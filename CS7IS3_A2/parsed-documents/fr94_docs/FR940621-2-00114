FR940621-2-00114 FR940621-2-00073 Purpose To support four Regional Children's Advocacy Centers that will encourage and facilitate the creation of local children's advocacy centers, and strengthen those now in existence through the delivery of training and technical assistance. Background Section 6 of Public Law 102&hyph;586, codified at 42 U.S.C. 13001 et. seq. , addressing the 1992 Amendments to the Victims of Child Abuse Act (the Act), provides for the establishment of four Regional Children's Advocacy Centers for purposes of providing information, technical assistance and training to assist communities in establishing multi-disciplinary programs which respond to child abuse. National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System Working Paper 2 reports that based on 1990 revised data, States received and referred for investigation approximately 1.7 million reports on an estimated 2.6 million children who are the alleged subjects of child abuse and neglect. In 1991, States received nearly 1.8 million reports on approximately 2.7 million children. The number reported in 1991 represents an increase of approximately 2.4 percent from 1990 data. 1 Draft Working Paper 3 of the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System reported approximately 918,263 substantiated and indicated victims of child maltreatment from 49 states in 1992. Of these, approximately 14% (129,982) were sexually abused. 2 The Carnegie Corporation of New York reported, in its publication Starting Points, that one in three victims of physical abuse is a baby less than a year old and that in 1990, more one year-olds were maltreated than in any previous year for which data are available. Additionally, Starting Points reported that ``almost 90 percent of children who died of abuse and neglect in 1990 were under the age of five; and 53 percent were less than a year old.'' 3 Based upon its annual telephone survey of states, the National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse reported that at least three children a day die from physical abuse inflicted by a parent or caretaker. 4 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System Working Paper 2, p.25. 2 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, Unpublished, Draft Working Paper 3 (1994) The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System. 3 Carnegie Corporation of New York, Starting Points_Meeting the Needs of Our Youngest Children, April 1994, p.4. 4 National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse, Current Trends in Child Abuse Reporting and Fatalities: The results of the 1991 annual fifty state survey, Chicago, Illinois 1992. To address this problem, in 1985, then Madison County Alabama District Attorney Robert E. (Bud) Cramer mobilized professionals in Madison County to establish a Children's Advocacy Center for victims of child abuse. The Center is a facility-based, child-focused program which coordinates the response to victims of child abuse through multi-disciplinary teams of representatives from statutorily mandated and other involved agencies. Team members include representatives from child protective services, law enforcement, the district attorney's office, and the mental health and medical fields. The elements of the Madison County model are incorporated in the 1992 Amendments to the Victims of Child Abuse Act.
