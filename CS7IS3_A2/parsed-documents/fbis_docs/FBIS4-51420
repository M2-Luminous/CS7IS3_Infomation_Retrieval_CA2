FBIS4-51420 "drchi103_v_94009" FBIS-CHI-94-103 Daily Report 26 May 1994 TAIWAN Minister Denies Rumors on Loan to South Africa Minister Denies Rumors on Loan to South Africa OW2605171294 Taipei CNA in English 1318 GMT 26 May 94 OW2605171294 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Benjamin Yeh] [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu on Thursday [26 May] denied rumors that the Republic of China [ROC] has agreed to extend a U.S.$200 million loan to South Africa as part of Taipei's efforts to help shore up endangered bilateral ties. Chien, replying to an interpellation by Democratic Progressive Party legislator Parris Chang, said the government had foreseen as long as three and a half years ago that drastic political changes would occur in South Africa, even though bilateral ties with the white-ruled government at that time were solid. "We indeed had promised a U.S.$60 million loan to help South Africa finance a farming development project during F.W. De Klerk's tenure as the president, but the loan has not yet been given," Chien said. The loan proposal was raised again when President Li Teng-hui visited South Africa to attend Nelson Mandela's presidential inauguration on May 10, Chien said, adding that both countries may re-start negotiations on the loan. Chien emphasized that Li had not offered any new loans to South Africa during his visit, but did agree to help South Africa implement a vocational-training project. "South Africa will send people here to see for themselves how job-training projects are implemented," Chien said. He added that the ROC has agreed to share with South Africa its successful experience in helping military personnel assimilate into society after retirement. Many legislators here are against any new economic aid to South Africa on grounds that the Nelson Mandela-led African National Congress, which now rules the new government, has maintained close ties with Beijing for many years, and may eventually shift diplomatic recognition away from Taipei. On the contrary, though, Li's visit, previously perceived as a last-ditch effort by Taiwan to salvage its relationship with South Africa, seems to have paid off handsomely. A confident Li, shortly after a meeting with Mandela, told a group of Chinese and representatives of Taiwan-owned companies in South Africa on May 11 that the bilateral ties between the two countries are strong and steady. South Africa is the largest country of the 29 with which the ROC maintains official diplomatic ties.
