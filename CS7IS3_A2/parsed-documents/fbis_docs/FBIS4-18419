It added that the state, which holds a 89.41 percent majority stake in Banque Hervet via Compagnie Financiere Hervet, will take part in putting the bank back on its feet by providing 750 million francs in the form of stockholders' advances. That amount will be added to the 150 million francs already paid in at the end of last year. The government's goal is to get the bank back to profitability this year, the ministry said, "so as to prepare for privatization under the best possible conditions."
