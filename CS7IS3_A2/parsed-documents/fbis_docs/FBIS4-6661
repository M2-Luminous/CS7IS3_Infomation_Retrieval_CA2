FBIS4-6661 "dreas077__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-077-A Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Clinton, Gore Express Concern on Ties to DPRK Clinton, Gore Express Concern on Ties to DPRK OW2104094794 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 19 Apr 94 Evening Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2104094794 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [By correspondent Yoshihisa Furumori] [Text] Washington, 18 Apr -- It was learned on 18 April that both U.S. President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore separately expressed their concerns to top Japanese leaders that there were people in the center of Japan's ruling coalition who maintained strong ties with North Korea. They asked whether or not these people could be a stumbling block to sanctions against the DPRK, which might be imposed as a result of the nation's suspected nuclear program. The delivery of this strong concern and the questioning by top U.S. leaders indicates the Clinton administration has a strong sense of distrust in a group of people within the ruling coalition. On 18 April a source well versed in Japan-U.S. relations said this concern was first revealed by President Clinton during the summit meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on 21 February. According to the source, Clinton said that if economic sanctions were imposed against the DPRK due to suspicions that Pyongyang was trying to arm itself with nuclear weapons, Japan's participation in the sanctions would be decisive. He then noted there was a person "in the center of the Hosokawa government" who maintains a close relationship with North Korea, and asked Hosokawa whether Japan could participate in sanctions in defiance of that person. Clinton did not specify the person, but merely said he was "in the center of the government." However, Japanese officials involved in the summit said they felt President Clinton was alluding to Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Takemura served as secretary general of the delegation which visited the DPRK in September 1990 led by Shin Kanemaru. He was also actively engaged as a senior member of the Dietmen's League for the Promotion of Friendship Between Japan and North Korea [name as published]. On 14 April, Vice President Gore met with Japan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in Marrakesh, Morocco, to attend a ministerial meeting of the GATT Uruguay Round trade negotiations. According to the same source, Gore expressed concern to Hata over the fact that the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which maintains relations with North Korea, is in both the Hosokawa government and the ruling coalition. He then asked Hata whether or not Tokyo could move toward sanctions despite the existence of the party. The source said Gore clearly mentioned the SDPJ at the meeting. It is unusual that both the President and Vice President of the United States have separately expressed to the prime minister and the deputy prime minister of Japan their concern about a political force within the governing coalition. This could be a reflection of the U.S. perception that Japan's role in the DPRK nuclear issue is very important, and of its serious concern that a "connection with North Korea" in Japan might hinder Tokyo from imposing sanctions against the DPRK.
