FR941028-2-00175 FR941028-2-00109 •The direction of airflow in health-care facilities should be designed, constructed, and maintained so that air flows from clean areas to less-clean areas. •Health-care facilities serving populations that have a high prevalence of TB may need to supplement the general ventilation or use additional engineering approaches (i.e., HEPA filtration or UVGI) in general-use areas where TB patients are likely to go (e.g., waiting-room areas, emergency departments, and radiology suites). A single-pass, nonrecirculating system that exhausts air to the outside, a recirculation system that passes air through HEPA filters before recirculating it to the general ventilation system, or upper air UVGI may be used in such areas. 2. Additional Engineering Control Approaches a. HEPA filtration. HEPA filters may be used in a number of ways to reduce or eliminate infectious droplet nuclei from room air or exhaust (Suppl. 3). These methods include placement of HEPA filters (a) in exhaust ducts discharging air from booths or enclosures into the surrounding room; (b) in ducts or in ceiling- or wall-mounted units, for recirculation of air within an individual room (fixed recirculation systems); (c) in portable air cleaners; (d) in exhaust ducts to remove droplet nuclei from air being discharged to the outside, either directly or through ventilation equipment; and (e) in ducts discharging air from the TB isolation room into the general ventilation system. In any application, HEPA filters should be installed carefully and maintained meticulously to ensure adequate functioning. The manufacturers of in-room air cleaning equipment should provide documentation of the HEPA filter efficiency and the efficiency of the device in lowering room air contaminant levels. b. UVGI. For general-use areas in which the risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis is relatively high, UVGI lamps may be used as an adjunct to ventilation for reducing the concentration of infectious droplet nuclei (Suppl. 3), although the effectiveness of such units has not been evaluated adequately. Ultraviolet (UV) units can be installed in a room or corridor to irradiate the air in the upper portion of the room (i.e., upper-room air irradiation), or they can be installed in ducts to irradiate air passing through the ducts. UV units installed in ducts should not be substituted for HEPA filters in ducts that discharge air from TB isolation rooms into the general ventilation system. However, UV units can be used in ducts that recirculate air back into the same room. To function properly and decrease hazards to HCWs and others in the health-care facility, UV lamps should be installed properly and maintained adequately, which includes the monitoring of irradiance levels. UV tubes should be changed according to the manufacturer's instructions or when meter readings indicate tube failure. An employee trained in the use and handling of UV lamps should be responsible for these measures and for keeping maintenance records. Applicable safety guidelines should be followed. Caution should be exercised to protect HCWs, patients, visitors, and others from excessive exposure to UV radiation. G. Respiratory Protection •Personal respiratory protection should be used by (a) persons entering rooms in which patients with known or suspected infectious TB are being isolated, (b) persons present during cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures performed on such patients, and (c) persons in other settings where administrative and engineering controls are not likely to protect them from inhaling infectious airborne droplet nuclei (Suppl. 4). These other settings include transporting patients who may have infectious TB in emergency transport vehicles and providing urgent surgical or dental care to patients who may have infectious TB before a determination has been made that the patient is noninfectious (Suppl. 1). •Respiratory protective devices used in health-care settings for protection against M. tuberculosis should meet the following standard performance criteria: 1. The ability to filter particles 1 μm in size in the unloaded* state with a filter efficiency of "95% (i.e., filter leakage of >5%), given flow rates of up to 50 L per minute. *Some filters become more efficient as they become loaded with dust. Health-care settings do not have enough dust in the air to load a filter on a respirator. Therefore, the filter efficiency for respirators used in health-care settings must be determined in the unloaded state. 2. The ability to be qualitatively or quantitatively fit tested in a reliable way to obtain a face-seal leakage of >10% ( 54,55 ). 3. The ability to fit the different facial sizes and characteristics of HCWs, which can usually be met by making the respirators available in at least three sizes. 4. The ability to be checked for facepiece fit, in accordance with standards established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and good industrial hygiene practice, by HCWs each time they put on their respirators ( 54,55 ). •The facility's risk assessment may identify a limited number of selected settings (e.g., bronchoscopy performed on patients suspected of having TB or autopsy performed on deceased persons suspected of having had active TB at the time of death) where the estimated risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis may be such that a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard performance criteria is appropriate. In such circumstances, a level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard criteria and compatible with patient-care delivery (e.g., more protective negative-pressure respirators; powered air-purifying particulate respirators [PAPRs]; or positive-pressure air-line, half-mask respirators) should be provided by employers to HCWs who are exposed to M. tuberculosis. Information on these and other respirators is in the NIOSH Guide to Industrial Respiratory Protection ( 55 ) and in Supplement 4 of this document. •In some settings, HCWs may be at risk for two types of exposure: (a) inhalation of M. tuberculosis and (b) mucous membrane exposure to fluids that may contain bloodborne pathogens. In these settings, protection against both types of exposure should be used. •When operative procedures (or other procedures requiring a sterile field) are performed on patients who may have infectious TB, respiratory protection worn by the HCW should serve two functions: (a) It should protect the surgical field from the respiratory secretions of the HCW, and (b) it should protect the HCW from infectious droplet nuclei that may be expelled by the patient or generated by the procedure. Respirators with exhalation valves and most positive-pressure respirators do not protect the sterile field. •Health-care facilities in which respiratory protection is used to prevent inhalation of M. tuberculosis are required by OSHA to develop, implement, and maintain a respiratory protection program (Suppl. 4). All HCWs who use respiratory protection should be included in this program. Visitors to TB patients should be given respirators to wear while in isolation rooms, and they should be given general instructions on how to use their respirators. •Facilities that do not have isolation rooms and do not perform cough-inducing procedures on patients who may have TB may not need to have a respiratory protection program for TB. However, such facilities should have written protocols for the early identification of patients who have signs or symptoms of TB and procedures for referring these patients to a facility where they can be evaluated and managed appropriately. These protocols should be evaluated regularly and revised as needed. •Surgical masks are designed to prevent the respiratory secretions of the person wearing the mask from entering the air. To reduce the expulsion of droplet nuclei into the air, patients suspected of having TB should wear surgical masks when not in TB isolation rooms. These patients do not need to wear particulate respirators, which are designed to filter the air before it is inhaled by the person wearing the respirator. Patients suspected of having or known to have TB should never wear a respirator that has an exhalation valve, because this type of respirator does not prevent expulsion of droplet nuclei into the air. H. Cough-Inducing and Aerosol-Generating Procedures 1. General Guidelines Procedures that involve instrumentation of the lower respiratory tract or induce coughing can increase the likelihood of droplet nuclei being expelled into the air. These cough-inducing procedures include endotracheal intubation and suctioning, diagnostic sputum induction, aerosol treatments (e.g., pentamidine therapy), and bronchoscopy. Other procedures that can generate aerosols (e.g., irrigation of tuberculous abscesses, homogenizing or lyophilizing tissue, or other processing of tissue that may contain tubercle bacilli) are also covered by these recommendations.
