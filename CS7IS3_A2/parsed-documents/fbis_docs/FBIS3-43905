Their pace has been slow but sure. That slowness is understandable because of the complexity of the process for the resolution of a conflict that is, itself, very complex. The first point in the political talks has to do with the formation of the new national police force and the two sides have been discussing it since 6 January so they can then discuss national reconciliation issues. Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] information secretary and the deputy chief of the UNITA team to the Lusaka peace talks, has rejected all reports of a deadlock at the talks. He has told Radio France International that the talks continue to make progress and that there are clear hopes for an accord. [Begin recording] [Valentim] Instead of being held in the style of the Bicesse talks, these talks on the formation of the new police force have been held in an extremely serious manner, and from the point (?of view of) [words indistinct] that is possible and democratic is always on the negotiating table. That is why people have become accustomed to (?more dynamic talks) and now, when you see a debate [words indistinct] that is seen as deadlock. There is no deadlock at all. Rather, there are serious discussions under way. (?The other side) has replied to our document and we can say that valid theories for a legal state (?have been advanced). We hope that the mediators -- who should be giving us the document today -- will have been able to reduce the gap between the two sides so that points of disagreement can be overcome. Nonetheless, discussions are under way and they are showing progress. There has been serious progress and, without entering into explanations for the benefit of the public, (?they should think) that things are moving forward. [Unidentified reporter] And when will these police issue discussions be over, so that other issues can be examined, notably sharing power (?with) Luanda? [Valentim] Once this point has been discussed, we will talk about national reconciliation and, as you can see, that issue is crucial for UNITA's substantive participation in government. However, it does not include all the [words indistinct] national reconciliation. There are various facets to it. That is why, when we get there, we will also be giving our views on how Angola should approach the national reconciliation issue. [Reporter] That might mean, then, that talks could go on for several weeks yet? [Valentim] Well, it is not a matter of the talks going on. These are serious talks. We are walking the burning coals of political differences. What happens is that many people thought the main differences would reside in military issues and that political issues would be easy to settle. In the final analysis, though, what we want to solve is the Angolan crisis and, to that end, we must define a political, legal, social, and economic framework so that the Angolan people can understand and accept each other.
