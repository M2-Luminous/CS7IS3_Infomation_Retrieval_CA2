At the place where the Beijing delegation stayed, Shao Yunjie, president of the municipal industrial and commercial bank and deputy of the municipality, set forth with the view of a banker that we should positively carry out the social security system, lighten the burden of enterprises, and create conditions for enterprises to equally join the market competition. Shao Yunjie said: Just as what Premier Li set forth in his report, enterprises bear heavy financial burdens in supporting social undertakings and there are many historical burdens. Taking Beijing as an example, 1,030,000 staff members and workers of the industrial enterprises should support 400,000 retired staff members and workers. How can they support such a large number of retired staff members and workers? So, we should set up, as soon as possible, a social security system so that enterprises will not bear this burden any longer. Enterprises hand over a portion of money to society. Simultaneously, enterprises have also to deliver to society portions of money from various kinds of earnings. Besides, staff members and workers themselves should also pay a portion of money and the state has to allocate a portion of money. So, the living expenses of retired staff members and workers will be provided under the social insurance system. The enterprises that are hopeless for halting deficits should declare bankruptcy. We can use the social insurance mechanism to arrange the staff members and workers of the bankrupt enterprises or to have the enterprises shift their lines of operation in a step-by-step manner. Shao Yunjie said: The higher levels must never define any speed targets for large- and medium-sized enterprises. Defining speed targets will bring damages to these enterprises. The products without benefits and the products that nobody wants must not be produced any more. Enterprises would rather suspend production than seek high output value. Using coal, electricity, water, and raw materials to produce unmarketable products is big waste. Enterprises should readjust the product mix according to market demands, grasp product quality, and produce their own products with competitiveness. Only by so doing will they be able to stand their ground on the market. Shao Yunjie said: Enterprises and banks have relations of loans. This does not mean that only enterprises seek banks' help. In reality, banks also have to seek enterprises' help. Only when enterprises have good economic results will banks be able to live a good life. In a sense, banks and large- and medium-sized enterprises share the same fate. According to the State Council's decision on the financial system reform, the industrial and commercial banks should turn themselves into commercial banks. Seeking profits is the highest target of commercial banks. So, the commercial banks have to make self-management and self-development, run risks by themselves, and restrict themselves. Some enterprises worry that they will not be able to use loans under such a situation. In fact they must not worry about this. Banks still give priorities to large- and medium-sized enterprises because these enterprises are the foundation stone of the socialist economy. Meanwhile, enterprises themselves should have a sense of urgency, enhance their internal potential, and increase economic results so that banks will rest assured to give loans.
