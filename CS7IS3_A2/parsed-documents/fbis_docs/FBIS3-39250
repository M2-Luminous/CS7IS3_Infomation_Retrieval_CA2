Seoul-Ottawa trade cooperation anticipates South Korea's participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), said Korean officials who are accompanying Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on a visit to Canada. Han held talks with his Canadian counterpart Andre Ouellet here Monday afternoon at which the Korean foreign minister expressed his country's desire to form a special relationship with NAFTA members. Ouellet promised Han that Canada will actively study the South Korean proposal, according to the Korean officials. Han briefed Ouellet on the positions of South Korea and the United States on the North Korean nuclear problem and asked for Canada's continuing support for resolution of the issue, they said. Prior to visiting Ottawa, Han held talks with U.S. Government leaders on the North Korean problem in Washington. Han and Ouellet shared the opinion that their countries, both surrounded by economically powerful neighbors, can work together and complement each other. They agreed to foster conditions for partnership in all fields, the officials said. Han later met with Minister for International Trade Roy Maclaren and discussed trade promotion and economic cooperation. "They have agreed to form a partnership in political, economic, trade and other fields," the officials said. The special relationship calls for an increase in trade, cooperation in regional and global issues, and efforts to achieve peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. With regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, Ouellet said it is obvious the world does not want to see any country withdraw from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). He said Canada supports South Korean and U.S. efforts to resolve the issue through dialogue.
