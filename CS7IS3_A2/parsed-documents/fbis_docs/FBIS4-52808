The IPP which lists the preferred areas of economic activity that will be promoted by the government this year, also adopted the following policies: - Incentives shall be given only to importation of brand-new and unused equipment and spare parts. - Capital equipment incentives shall be available for three years only from the date of project registration, but a six-year availment period shall be given for projects which take long to bear results. - Projects of a firm producing the same products and locating outside the 50 kilometer radius of the firm's site may be registered as new. - Expansion projects by firms which applied for registration as new export producers prior to 1 January 1989 and consequently registered will be exempted from the industrial location policy. - New enterprises registered under the 1994 IPP shall be given five years to avail themselves of the exemption from wharfage dues and any export tax, duty impost and fees. Expansion projects, however, shall no longer be entitled to this incentive. The 1994 IPP contains 59 preferred areas of activities, majority of which are carry overs from the 1993 IPP. Of these, 12 are new inclusions. President Ramos also stressed the need to speed up passage of pending economic measures in Congress. The president made the statement after Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo informed him International Monetary Fund (IMF) is expected to approve the government's Letter of Intent and the Memorandum of Economic Policy by end of June. Aside from the $650 million in Extended Fund Facility to be released by the IMF to the Philippines in three tranches over three years, the program will also serve as the country's exit plan with the IMF. The other vital economic measures still pending in Congress, the president said, include the bill liberalizing the entry of foreign banks, the investment incentives bill for the mining industry, the Magna Carta for Exporters, Education bill, Armed Forces modernization bill, Public Works Act, and other bills contained in the Social Pact for Empowered Development (SPEED).
