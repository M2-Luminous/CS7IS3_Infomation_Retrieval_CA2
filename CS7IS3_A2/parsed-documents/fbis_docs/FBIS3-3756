The reporter asked: Hainan is considered to be a special area with special power to carry out special projects. Hainan also enjoys greater autonomy than other provinces and regions. Does it mean that, in the foreseeable future, certain expensive sightseeing projects -- such as horse racing and dog racing --will be permitted in Hainan? Ruan Chongwu replied: While we encourage the development of all kinds of recreational activities in Hainan, we firmly forbid three kinds: gambling, prostitution, and drugs. We can say that this reply is exactly what the ordinary people wanted to say. People in some places have written to [Haikou's] mayor that they want economic growth, not spiritual garbage. Regrettably, not all leaders see it the same way. Have we not heard the argument that when material civilization has developed, spiritual civilization will naturally follow suit? Some people even say that gambling, prostitution, and the like are no big deal; and that these ideas can bring in foreign capital. Facts prove that this is an erroneous idea. The development of material civilization will indeed help the development of spiritual civilization because people who are well clothed and fed tend to pay attention to their honor. But there is also the observation that people who are well fed and clothed will tend to be obsessed with carnal pleasure. If we fail to intensify our efforts in building our spiritual civilization, our failure will certainly affect the development of material civilization. As far as attracting foreign capital is concerned, we should do so by counting on our huge markets and good services. We should always remember that we cannot afford to discard the traditional culture and ethical sense of the Chinese nation, and we cannot afford to let in the spiritual garbage of the Western society.
