Police identified one of the men as Kuniyasu Uchiyama, 41, the group's deputy chairman. Police said one of the men had fired a shot from a gun but no one was reported injured. It was the second incident in five months at the mass-circulation ASAHI SHIMBUN headquarters involving the Taihikai. On 20 October, Shusuke Nomura, 58, the leader of the group, entered the building and shot himself dead during a meeting with the company's executives in protest over the use of a cartoon parodying his group in a weekly magazine affiliated with the company. Police were negotiating with the rightists by telephone. They said the two Taihikai members later released eight hostages, but were still holding an executive in charge of the company's public relations department, Kei Aragaki, and the head of the secretarial department, Mikinori Yoshida. They said the rightists were using potted plants to barricade the door to the room. They identified the other rightist as Toshikazu Furusawa, 29. On 12 November 1991, police arrested Uchiyama after he set off a fire bomb in his own car outside the Tokyo residence of former Liberal Democratic Party power broker Shin Kanemaru. Uchiyama was carrying a sword at the time of the arrest.
