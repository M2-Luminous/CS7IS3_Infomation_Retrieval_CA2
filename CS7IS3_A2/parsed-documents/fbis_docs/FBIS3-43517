Earlier today on our station, the Togolese foreign minister accused the Ghanaian authorities of being passive accomplices; he said that the attack is coming from Ghana, from a commando operating from this country. He added that Ghana had also become a rear base for the forces of the opposition leader, Gilchrist Olympio. To say he is not involved is nonsensical, concluded the Togolese foreign minister. Ghana strongly denies any involvement in this case, saying that Lome has no evidence whatsoever. As for the opposition leader, Gilchrist Olympio, who was directly accused, he did not take long to react to what Ouattara Natachaba said: [Begin recording] [Olympio] We believe that the statement by Natachaba is particularly irresponsible. We have always said that Togo is very sick, and the national tissue is in the process of disintegration. What we need is not recriminations, but a genuine roundtable, gathering all the parties at the local level and our foreign mediators, particularly France, Germany, and the United States. Therefore, I would say that the violence we are witnessing at the moment was expected. [Repoter Assan Diop] So Mr. Olympio, you reject the accusation of being responsible for this action by a commando on 5 January? [Olympio] Absolutely! We reject it categorically and add that we deeply regret the shedding of blood. [end recording]
