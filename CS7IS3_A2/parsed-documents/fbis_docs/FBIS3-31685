And all of a sudden, in conformity with a political beginning aimed at impressing its membership that it is "resolute in the struggle for the rights of the disadvantaged Serbs in Macedonia," we heard accusations and threats from the new DPS leadership. At the news conference held two days ago by the DPS leaders there was an overwhelming wish to be provocative, to express hatred for the country where they live and work (except for party president Dragisa Miletic, who works in Pristina). The Serbian media and the DPS leaders in Macedonia are consistent in using the temporary name of Macedonia in the United Nations. For them, the only legitimate president of the Serbian people everywhere is Slobodan Milosevic. In the event of war on the territory of Macedonia the DPS would call for the defense of only Serbian property and the orthodox brothers "who deserve it." Moreover, in accordance with its ambition to be the only legitimate representative of the interests of the Serbian national minority in Macedonia, the DPS has already studied the possible reaction of the Serbs in the country to possible NATO air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- attacks against the U.S. troops in the state. "The problem of reintroducing the Serbs and Montenegrins in the Constitution is burning slowly, but it could easily become a conflagration that could consume all of us." This was the first threat conveyed by the DPS to the Macedonian public. The second went like this: "We shall wait a while longer, and then the people will have to decide what happens then." Once again in the name of the people, one of the DPS hawks Stojan Trajkovic said: "Any use of the territory for intervention in former Bosnia-Herzegovina will be lethal for the FYR Macedonia." Well-known threats, well-known propositions and the twisting of facts... but in the spirit of the chosen recipe of the policy of our northern neighbor -- Serbia. There was a short-lived shift of the party's policy to take account of the actual situation in the country where this political subject is registered, and then the activities resulted in personnel changes and shifts in the party's course toward northern political orientations. The previous DPS leadership succeeded in recognizing the peril of that orientation and changed its course and behavior in relation to the Macedonian authorities. The new leadership is again at the beginning of the road that repeatedly coincides, not by chance, with the new settlements of the Balkan situation. Whenever a settlement seemed near, one of the main roles was always played by the political leadership of Serbia which, despite the public manifestations of the DPS, apparently plays an important role in all that. The aim, once again, is very transparent and is to be expected from that type of politician -- apprentices. The Greek blockade has nothing to do with them, nor does the wish to destabilize Macedonia. For them Macedonia is the FYR Macedonia, but parallel with that, there is the strong wish to introduce Serbs and Montenegrins to the constitution of a state by the name of the Republic of Macedonia (although it is not yet clear whether as a national minority, a nationality, or certainly, as a people). For them, the fact that there are 300 U.S. soldiers in Macedonia means that Macedonia is "a U.S. protectorate and its puppet state." All this would be welcome in moments of appropriate assistance to orthodox brothers in the "south Vardar regional unit" and in the reestablishment of the "interrupted orthodox vertical axis." No matter where they may be on the territory of former Yugoslavia the "emotional Serbian people" are sensitive to injustice. The political leaders therefore have no choice. Until then, the provocations and irritations of everybody's emotions remain the main political strategy of these political branch offices.
