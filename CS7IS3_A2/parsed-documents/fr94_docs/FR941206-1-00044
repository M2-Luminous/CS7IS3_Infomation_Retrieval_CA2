FR941206-1-00044 FR941206-1-00007 Using various forums, the Committee discussed many challenging issues such as subcategorizing the source category, the emission data to be used to select the standards, potential regulatory formats, emission limits, work practice standards, compliance determination techniques, enforcement, and reporting and recordkeeping. Other issues such as the impacts of the rule on small businesses, the relationship between the proposed rule and the Title V operating permit program, and the effects of foreign competition were also considered. Given the potential for compliance with the rule by substituting non-HAP compounds for HAP contained in the coatings (e.g., ethanol for methanol), the issue of substitution of non-HAP VOC's for HAP was discussed at great length. Another major concern was the possibility of substituting a more toxic HAP for another HAP. This concern prompted a discussion on the relative toxicity of compounds used in wood furniture manufacturing. At the final negotiating session of the full Committee, many of the major issues were resolved conceptually. Thereafter, the Committee reviewed drafts of the regulatory language and the preamble and held conference calls and informal working group meetings to resolve the remaining issues. Some Committee members feel that because the proposed standards were developed solely for this source category and many of the provisions were developed through a regulatory negotiation process, which often requires concessions from some parties in exchange for concessions from other parties in other areas, these proposed standards should not be used as a basis for the development of standards for other source categories. The emission limitations for adhesives were developed by the EPA outside of the regulatory negotiation process, because adhesive suppliers were not represented on the Committee. While a Glue Work Group was formed to address gluing operations, the Committee members decided to suspend the work so they could focus their efforts on finishing, cleaning, and washoff operations. II. Description of the Source Category The following paragraphs briefly describe the operations covered by the proposed standards for the wood furniture (surface coating) source category. The EPA has produced a draft of Chapters 1 through 4 of the CTG. These chapters provide a detailed process description for the many types of wood furniture operations in this source category. Interested parties can refer to the draft chapters, which may be found in the docket of materials supporting this proposed rule, for a more detailed description than that provided here. The wood furniture industry encompasses the manufacture of many diverse products. For the purposes of the proposed rule, the wood furniture (surface coating) category includes production of the following products and their components: 1. Wood kitchen cabinets; 2. Wood residential furniture; 3. Upholstered residential and office furniture; 4. Wood television, radio, phonograph, and sewing machine cabinets; 5. Wood office furniture and fixtures; 6. Partitions, shelving, and lockers; and 7. Other wood furniture not described by one of the above categories. Despite the broad range of products manufactured by this source category, some manufacturing operations are common. There are four basic wood furniture manufacturing operations that are included in the affected emission source subject to the proposed rule. These are finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff. Wood furniture finishing operations include those operations in which a finishing material is applied to a substrate. Finishing processes differ within the industry, but typically they consist of application of finishing materials, evaporation of volatiles, and curing of the piece in an oven. Facilities may finish the furniture in components and then assemble it, but more commonly, the piece of furniture is assembled and then finished. The furniture or furniture components may be moved manually from one finishing application station to the next, or may be on tow lines that automatically move through the finishing lines.
