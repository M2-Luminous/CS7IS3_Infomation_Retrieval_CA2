The Sony research group announced this result at the commencement of a meeting of the Applied Physics Society on 28 March at Meiji University in Tama-ku, Kawasaki. According to the announcement, Sony succeeded in the continuous oscillation of a 489.9 nanometer blue (range) laser at a room temperature of 23ï¿½C. The development of a blue (bandwidth) laser was the main goal because blue was the only one of the three primary colors--red, green, and blue--that remained [to be achieved in a room temperature CW semiconductor laser]. Up until now, this laser was the target in a fierce development contest carried on primarily between the United States and Japan but, with this achievement, Sony has charged ahead to take the lead. When the laser is put to practical use [commercialized] it can be expected that there will be a widespread sphere of applications, including high-capacity optical recording equipment, high-performance color printers, full-color three- dimensional displays, etc. For semiconductor lasers, room temperature continuous oscillation is only the first step toward practical application. It has always been the plaintive wish to achieve blue (range) room temperature oscillation ever since the 1970s when, using a double-hetero structure, the first room temperature CW semiconductor laser was achieved. This time, Sony used a II-VI group zinc-magnesium-sulfur-selenium quaternary compound as a cladding layer to confine the light and, by exerting their ingenuity, the Sony researchers succeeded in the lowering of the resistance. The threshold current value obtained during room temperature continuous oscillation was 93 milliamperes at 6.3 volts. Ever since the 3-M company in the United States used a II-VI group compound not including magnesium to achieve room temperature pulsed oscillation with a 525 nanometer blue-green color, the II-VI group suddenly was in the limelight and research organizations of the world became engaged in fierce competition for development. By including magnesium in the quaternary compound in independent research, Sony reported room temperature pulsed oscillation of a blue laser in May 1993 and room temperature continuous oscillation of a blue-green laser in July 1993, thereby reversing the leading role in this field. When it is put to practical use [commercialized], the blue semiconductor laser, because of its short wavelength characteristic, will lead to the realization of a drastic advancement in optical recording density as well as medical uses, metrology, full-color three-dimensional displays, etc.
