Deputies Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou separately took the floor. They stressed: All comrades of the Army must further study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and must make efforts to successfully carry out the Army's military, political, and logistic work and to achieve new development in reforming and building the Army in line with the general requirement -- "political qualification, perfect mastery of military skills, high discipline, excellent work style, and effective logistic support" -- raised by Central Military Commission [CMC] Chairman Jiang Zemin, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong's military concept and Deng Xiaoping's concept of army-building in the new period. Deputy Zhang Wannian, chief of general staff of the PLA, said: Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report" sets a very high premium on army-building. Our armed forces must continuously enhance their consciousness of danger, national defense, and modern warfare; they must keep a clear head at all times; they must conscientiously prepare for danger in times of peace; and they must always be alert. Army units must intensify study and training; they must work hard to enhance their modern warfare capabilities; they must vigorously train and bring on a new type of military personnel able to meet the needs of and take command in modern warfare; they must further strengthen control of Army units; they must make efforts to explore ways to lead troops under the new situation; and they must pay attention to studying the new situation and solving new problems so as to maintain a high degree of centralism, unity, and stability in Army units. Deputy Yu Yongbo, director of the General Political Department of the PLA, said: We must actively respond to the call issued by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, take a clear stand in following the correct guidance of the media, and vigorously strengthen the building of spiritual civilization in the Army. He elaborated on how to follow the correct guidance of the media. He stressed that efforts must be made this year to successfully require Army units and especially cadres at and above regimental level to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, to energetically encourage standing up for what is right, and to carry on widespread propaganda for examples of advanced collectives and individuals that meet the needs of and reflect the spirit of our times. He said: We must treat the campaign to study Comrade Xu Honggang's activities as the turning point; we must energetically publicize and advocate the five types of revolutionary spirit initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the 64-character pioneering spirit initiated by General Secretary Jiang Zemin; we must carry forward the fine traditions of our party and Army; and we must vigorously foster and publicize more examples of advanced collectives and individuals that typify our times to enable good standards of conduct -- taking the interests of the whole into consideration, practicing plain living and waging hard struggle, strictly observing discipline, blazing new trails and forging ahead, and dedicating oneself selflessly -- to take further shape throughout the Army. Deputy Fu Quanyou, director of the General Logistics Department of the PLA, said: The development of a socialist market economy will inevitably cause a series of new problems to for Army logistic work and for economic work in the military field. Challenges and opportunities exist at the same time, and so do difficulties and hopes. It requires us to try to adapt ourselves to the development of a socialist market economy, to conscientiously "converge [jie gui 2234 6510]" with the market economy, and to conduct our various logistical operations in compliance with the dual requirements of the "battlefield" and the "market." We must intensify reform of logistical work, produce results from reform, and provide effective logistical support. To successfully carry out reform, we must further emancipate our minds and change our concepts. We must intensify study and continuously enhance our ability to keep the progress of reform well in hand. We must further carry forward fine traditions and arduously persist in pioneering undertakings. As the current material conditions for reform of the Army's logistics are not very good, we must practice plain living, wage hard struggle, and press forward despite difficulties. The main tasks for reform of the Army's logistics for a certain period of time to come are: Reforming the logistic support system to enable it to pay equal attention to both military and civilian production and to integrate the logistic support operations for wartime with that for peacetime; reforming the acquisition and stockpile of military material to guarantee that the needs of army-building are met; reforming logistic management and improving military efficiency; reforming military production and management to better subsidizing army units in terms of supplies; and reforming the supply standards and methods to better meet the needs of Army units for their combat readiness, training, and subsistence.
