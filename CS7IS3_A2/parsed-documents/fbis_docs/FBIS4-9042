Subversive acts can be 'canvassed' in many ways, he said, by those who pursue such aims. Romania does not exclude extraneous danger, although this is less poignant at the moment. He said Romania's option is for integration in the European structures, and that the Partnership for Peace is one step towards that goal. Romania's ultimate target in its strive for integration is the forging of a European security system comprising all the actors on the European political stage, the Russian Federation, the Ukraine, the United States, and Canada, inclusively. Related to the problems the Romanian Army is confronted with, the secretary of state said its endowment and equipment shall be done as the budget allocation permits. Although modest, this provides for certain growths which will enable the army to upgrade medical assistance and housing conditions for the military.
