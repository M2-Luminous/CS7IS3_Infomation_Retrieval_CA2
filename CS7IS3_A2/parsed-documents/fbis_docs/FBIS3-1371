Fierce clashes are continuing in the area of Dange-ia-Menha. After realizing that their militarist adventure against the area is a dream that will never come true, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party forces are now desperately looking for ways to get back to Dondo. They are under siege, however, and it is getting tighter all the time. [passage omitted] In clashes at 1500 GMT yesterday, as the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA, were trying to make their way back to Dondo, they left on the ground 10 dead soldiers, hundreds of wounded soldiers, two burnt out T-55 and T-66 tanks [words indistinct] and 20 cargo vehicles, also burnt out. Our forces also captured one 130-mm cannon. The other FAPLA forces are last in the jungle at this stage.
