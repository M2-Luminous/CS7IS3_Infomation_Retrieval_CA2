In his words, the meetings were held at the request of representatives of Tajik political opposition which expressed readiness to start negotiations with the Dushanbe leadership. In Pyankov's words, the fear of the opposition to go to Dushanbe is the major difficulty in the negotiations. For his part, Pyankov expressed readiness to ensure their security in case negotiations are held in Dushanbe. Otakhon Latifi, one of the representatives of the opposition, declared that negotiations with the Dushanbe authorities will take place in case they are held under the UN auspices and with the participation of Iranian and Pakistani representatives and Russia's mediation. Pyankov reaffirmed that the UN plans to hold negotiations but he has still no information about their time and place. "In my opinion, this decision is still far away." As Pyankov said, the Tajik opposition understands that the coalition peacekeeping forces represent a real force which substantially affects stabilization of the situation in the republic. As he said, representatives of the opposition expressed a request not to withdraw the coalition peacekeeping forces from Tajikistan as they are the major guarantor of civil peace in the country. At the same time Pyankov believes that the negotiations in Moscow have been "actually fruitless."
