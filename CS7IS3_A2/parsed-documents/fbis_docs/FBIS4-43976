Following that meeting, Kliridhis and Papandreou will meet EU Commission President Jacques Delors. Replying to questions prior to his departure from Larnaca Airport regarding last night's meeting with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative on Cyprus, President Kliridhis said that Clark conveyed a series of messages from the United Nations and received a series of answers. The president said that the Greek Cypriot side's positions remain the same. Our side, he stressed, insists on the 21 March document and we do not accept anything other than that document. The UN's desire, Kliridhis added, was to see whether it would be possible for us to accept what was agreed upon in Vienna in the absence of the Greek Cypriot side, and they got a very clear message that something like that will not happen. President Kliridhis also said that he discussed with Clark all options included in the UN secretary general's report. However, he added that Clark was not authorized to say which option would be preferred by the Security Council members or which option the UN secretary general would suggest. Called on to comment on British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's statement, that the two sides in Cyprus have come close to agreement, President Kliridhis said that he had not realized that we were very near an agreement. The president added that there is an attempt to cultivate such a climate. There is an attempt, he said, to create the impression that the differences regarding the 21 March document are so small, that somehow a solution would be found. Our view, he said, is that the differences between the two sides are substantial. Asked whether he is more optimistic or pessimistic following his meeting with Clark, President Kliridhis said that his position remains firm, that he insists on the 21 March document and if [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas finds a way to accept it, then his optimism will be realized. If Denktas, he concluded, does not find a way to accept the document, then his pessimism will be realized. In a laconic statement after his meeting with President Kliridhis, Clark noted that during his meetings he examined the situation following the submission of the UN secretary general's report and there has been no discussion of anything new.
