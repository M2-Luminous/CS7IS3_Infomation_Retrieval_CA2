We now have a reserve of 7.7 billion barrels, he said. Al-Banbi pointed out in a statement today that the increase in reserves, which do fluctuate, was the result of a special policy the petroleum sector pursued to encourage investment in oil and gas prospecting and production. He remarked that this policy resulted in the discovery of 70 new oil and natural gas reservoirs, 24 of which have already been placed on the production map. He added that the increase was also the result of increasing efforts to develop productive wells by drilling intermediary wells, supporting the subsidiary production of water and gas, and the application of advanced technology.
