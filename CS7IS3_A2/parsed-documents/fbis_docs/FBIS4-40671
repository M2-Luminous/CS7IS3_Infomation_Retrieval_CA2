The delegation representing the Dushanbe Government is headed by Shukurjon Zuhurov, minister of labor and employment, and the opposition is led by Otakhon Latifi, Khudaiberdi Khaliknazarov, and others. The opening ceremony of the second round of talks was held in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' political research center and it was attended by Ramiro Piriz Ballon [the UN secretary-general's envoy to Tajikistan] and observers from Russia, Iran, Pakistan, (?Afghanistan), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. From Russia, roving Ambassador Aleksandr Oblov and Sergey Tretyakov, Russian ambassador in Iran, are taking part in the talks. Speeches by Piriz Ballon, Iran's Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, and the heads of the Tajik delegations indicate that the main objective of the second round of the talks is to sign a cease-fire agreement. Having positively assessed the results of the first round of talks in Moscow, the UN secretary-general's envoy said that the agenda for [the second round of] talks was agreed during talks [in Moscow] and a joint commission was formed on the issue of refugees. He highly assessed the efforts of Russia and observers from other countries and at the same time expressed concern at the upsurge of hostilities including an increase in terrorist attacks against Russian military personnel in Tajikistan. Piriz Ballon said that despite all these, serious disagreements exist between the representative of the Tajik Government and the opposition. He called on both sides to strive for an atmosphere of mutual understanding during the talks, to take measures to cease military and other hostile operations, and to establish ways of observing future agreements. Piris Ballon assured participants in the talks that the United Nations and its secretary general are ready to provide aid to assist the normalization of the situation by sending experts and providing material aid for the repatriation of refugees. Pointing out the great importance of an end to conflict in Tajikistan, he said that the establishment of peace in the country is the only way to stability and prosperity in the Central Asian region. Iran's foreign affairs minister said at the opening ceremony of the talks and at the subsequent news conference, that the Tajikistan problem cannot be resolved by war. He rejected claims that Tehran is exporting its Islamic revolution to Tajikistan. Shukurjon Zuhurov and Otakhon Latifi cautiously welcomed the talks. However, some of their views show that serious disagreements exist [between them] and that it will be difficult to overcome them. [passage omitted] The talks are expected to continue for 10 days. Working and general meetings will also be held, attended by foreign observers. It is also been reported that the third round of talks will be held in Islamabad in the middle of July.
