The meeting will discuss the situation in Somalia and ways to coordinate the positions of the factions with the aim of effecting national reconciliation before the United States and European forces withdraw from Somalia by the end of March. Abshir announced that Somalia is passing through a critical stage and that the U.S. and European forces have begun their withdrawal. Noting that Egypt is helping the United Nations to find a solution to the problem, he stressed Somalia's need for this role in its quest for peace and national reconciliation. He voiced the hope that the Somali leaders will show the necessary sense of responsibility to restore peace and security in the country and establish a central authority. He said that when this has been done, free elections can be held supervised by the Arab countries, United Nations, OAU, and ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] to ensure they are fair.
