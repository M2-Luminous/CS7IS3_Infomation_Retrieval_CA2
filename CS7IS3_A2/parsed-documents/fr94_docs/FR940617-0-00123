Note that the adopted CO standard for engines at or above 130 kW may be changed from 11.5 g/kW-hr to 5.0 g/kW-hr when the European rules are final. This would ensure consistency between EPA and the more stringent European standard. This is also compatible with California since engines certified to the lower European CO standard would clearly be below the California CO standard. C. Implementation Dates All engines produced by an engine manufacturer on or after January 1 of the implementation year specified below by power category must be certified by the engine manufacturer according to the requirements in effect for that year. No nonroad vehicle or equipment manufacturer may install in its vehicles or equipment nonroad engines manufactured after January 1 of the implementation year specified below unless such engines are certified engines. EPA expects nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers to begin installing certified engines as soon as they become available from engine manufacturers, although EPA understands that some transition period may be necessary for vehicle and equipment manufacturers to deplete their inventory. Early certification is allowed one year prior to the applicable implementation date for engines participating in the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program for NO X . ␣ 1Engine size, kW (Hp) 1Implementation date ≥130 to <560 (≥175 to <750) January 1, 1996. ≥75 to <130 (≥100 to <175) January 1, 1997. ≥37 to <75 (≥50 to <100) January 1, 1998. >560 (>750) January 1, 2000.
