The area will be handed over to the Palestinians only after three conditions are met: the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] fully completes its deployment to protect the Jewish settlements, a liaison mechanism is set up, and the Palestinians are ready to enter the area. Gen. Vilna'i said that according to plans, Palestinian policemen will enter the Gaza Strip within the next few days and that the IDF will hand over to them some 30 facilities formerly used by the IDF, the Prison Authority, and the Israel Police. He added that there will be no overlap in responsibility for the area, and that responsibility will be transferred in its entirety at a specific time. The transfer of powers will not be accompanied by joint Israeli-Palestinian ceremonies to prevent tempers from flaring, he noted. Maj. Gen. 'Uzi Dayan, head of the General Staff's Planning Branch and a participant in the Cairo talks, said that all the points important to Israel had been safeguarded in the security segment of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Our correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that the two generals were speaking at a news conference in Tel Aviv.
