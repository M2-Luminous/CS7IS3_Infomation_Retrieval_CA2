The council has urged national and foreign investors who have capital investments in Mexico to remain calm and not to make hasty decisions. Luis German Carcova said the best way to demonstrate a love for the country is to confront the situation and to keep working. [Begin Carcova recording] We ask them to remain calm and to look at and analyze the situation carefully. We have to determine within the next few hours how to best face this situation. I am certain we will be able to resolve this situation and that the Mexican people will continue to move ahead. No one can stop us, and no one will. We ask them to remain calm and not to make hasty decisions. This is a time to demonstrate maturity and love for our country. One of the best ways businessmen and investors can demonstrate this love is by not splitting up, but, as the saying goes, by sticking to their guns -- namely, work, investments, and the generation of wealth and jobs. [end recording] Carcova said he is angry about the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio. [words indistinct] a leader of organized businessmen, has said that in Mexico there are groups interested in destabilizing the nation. The murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio is clear evidence of this, he said. In an interview at Los Pinos, Manuel Robleda, president of the Mexican Stock Market, did not want, or was unable, to predict what repercussions this event might have on the stock market.
