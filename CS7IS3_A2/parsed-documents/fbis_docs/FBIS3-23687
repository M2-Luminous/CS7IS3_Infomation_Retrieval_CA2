G. Grankov, Radio Engineering and Electronics Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 551.463:629.78] [Abstract] In an earlier study by the author (ZHURN TEKHN. FIZIKI, Vol 60, No 10, pp 114-120, 1990) it is proposed that the position of the sensitivity maximum of the radiation field to OST (ocean surface temperature) be used instead of radio emission intensity as a quantitative OST characteristic. The effectiveness of the proposed microwave spectrometer method for determining OST in the presence of waves and cloud cover is analyzed on the basis of the dependence of OST of a calm water surface on the position of the spectral sensitivity maximum of the field of natural microwave radiation to OST variations. With variation of OST in the range of natural variability of the world ocean (from 0 to 30�) the parameter _l_[.sup]m[/] (wavelength) changes from 8.5 to 3.5 cm respectively. The limiting heights of waves and cloud cover densities within which the method retains stability and ensures the required accuracy are determined. Tabulated data show that the microwave spectrometer method, applied in the form of a very simple algorithm, when the wind speed is up to 5-7 m/s has an accuracy in determining OST of about 1�C. An improved method is proposed which makes it possible to double or triple the range of meteorological conditions within which the error in determining OST does not exceed 1�C. The presence of well-developed cloud cover and foam formation on the water surface causes a considerable increase in the error in determining OST. Ocean areas with such conditions must be excluded from further examination or subjected to more complex processing. Figures 3; references: 6 Russian.
