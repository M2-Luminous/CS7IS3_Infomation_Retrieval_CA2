FR940323-0-00022 FR940323-0-00011 Background and Purpose The Coraopolis Highway Bridge at mile 9.6 on the Ohio River back channel between Coraopolis, Pennsylvania and Neville Island, Pennsylvania is no longer an active highway bridge and is in the process of being removed. The bridge originally consisted of several small spans that were located over land and two 300 foot main spans that crossed over the waterway and met atop a stone pier at the center of the channel. As part of the overall bridge removal operation, each main span and the center support pier have been scheduled for demolition with explosive charges. The first main span demolition, involving the southern span (Coraopolis side of the back channel) occurred on March 1, 1994. The second main span demolition, involving the northern span (Neville Island side of the back channel) is scheduled for approximately 10 a.m. on March 22, 1994. Steel members and debris from the demolition of this northern span will fall into the sailing line of the channel, creating an unsafe condition for vessels attempting to transit. The contractor will immediately commence clearing operations in the channel, but it will require 3 days to restore the navigability of this section of the Ohio River back channel. Accordingly, no vessel traffic will be permitted in the safety zone extending from Ohio River back channel mile 9.3 to mile 9.9 during this second demolition and subsequent channel clearing operations from 8 a.m. on March 22, 1994 to 4 p.m. on March 25, 1994. For the remaining period that this safety zone is in effect, vessel traffic will be permitted to proceed without restriction, except during periods when the bridge's center pier is undergoing actual demolition operations. These pier demolition operations are tentatively scheduled for 3 p.m. on March 30, 1994 and 3 p.m. on April 6, 1994, and each will last approximately four hours. During these times, no vessel traffic will be permitted within the safety zone. In the event of unanticipated delays involving the demolitions discussed above, the Captain of the Port Pittsburgh will notify the marine community of schedule changes affecting the duration of vessel traffic restrictions within the safety zone via Marine Safety Information Radio Broadcasts on VHF Marine Band Radio, Channel 22 (157.1 MHz) and via on site broadcast advisories on Channel 13 (156.650 MHz). Regulatory Evaluation This temporary final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979), it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal due to the relatively short duration of vessel traffic restrictions, the relatively small size of the area regulated, and the infrequency of commercial vessel transits along this section of Ohio River back channel. Federalism Assessment Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation as an action required to protect public safety.

Temporary Regulation In consideration of the foregoing, the Coast Guard is amending subpart C of part 165 of title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, as follows. This is a temporary amendment and will not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. PART 165_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 165 continues to read as follows: Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1231; 50 U.S.C. 191; 49 CFR 1.46 and 33 CFR 1.05&hyph;1(g), 6.04&hyph;1, 6.04&hyph;6, and 160.5. 2. A temporary ยง165.T02&hyph;014 is added to read as follows: ยง165.T02&hyph;014 Safety Zone: Ohio River. (a) Location. The Ohio River back channel (channel dividing Coraopolis, Pennsylvania from Neville Island, Pennsylvania) between mile 9.3 and mile 9.9 is established as a safety zone. (b) Effective Dates. This regulation is effective at 8 a.m. on March 22, 1994 and will terminate at 4 p.m. on April 10, 1994, unless terminated at an earlier date by the Captain of the Port, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (c) Regulations. In accordance with the general regulations in Section 165.23 of this part, entry into this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port. The Captain of the Port Pittsburgh will notify the marine community of times when vessel traffic will be permitted within the safety zone via Marine Safety Information Radio Broadcasts on VHF Marine Band Radio, Channel 22 (157.1 MHz) and via on site broadcast advisories on Channel 13 (156.650 MHz). Dated: March 10, 1994. M.W. Brown, Commander, U.S. Coast Guard, Captain of the Port, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
