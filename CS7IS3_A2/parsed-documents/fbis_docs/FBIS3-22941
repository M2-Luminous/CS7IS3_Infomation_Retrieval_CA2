The police, therefore, can only offer contradictory reports that confuse public opinion." [quotation marks as received] The government disclosed the "secret nature" of the talks in a written response to a request for information by conservative Congressman Antero Flores Araoz. Antiterrorist police believe that Shining Path Leader Abimael Guzman's calls for peace from jail have gained "the support of a significant portion of the organization. The rebel group is about to present the call at a clandestine congress to take place somewhere in Lima in April." The same source indicates, however, that Guzman managed to bypass the strict controls at El Callao Naval Base, where he is serving a life sentence, and delivered a document to rebel leader Martha Huatay ordering Shining Path to continue the 13-year-old war. The official government reports state that the terrorist leader met with other imprisoned leaders of the organization, including Huatay, "to get them to submit to his command and join the plea for peace." Huatay, according to the police, hid the message in her underclothing. She managed to pass the message on after she and Osman Morote, Shining Path's second in command, were returned to the Puno Penitentiary in the Andean mountain plains. Police found the message when one of Huatay's relatives was trying to smuggle it out of the facility, probably using the same way of concealing it. Press reports say that for weeks the government has been moving those rebel leaders who support the peace process from one detention facility to another so they can freely promote the idea. According to documents circulating within Shining Path, the movement is divided into two factions: the "pacifists," who swear loyalty to Guzman, and "the hard-liners." The latter formed the "new reconstituted direction" that replaced the leader following his arrest in September 1992. The "hard-liners" deny that Guzman wants peace. Police sources reported that their rivals are Oscar Ramirez and Teresa Durand -- nicknamed the "porfidios or perfidos" which was derived from the aliases of Feliciano and Doris. They were tried for rebellion and sentenced to life in prison by a military court in 1993. According to the "hard-liners," Elena Iparraguirre (Guzman's companion), Edmundo Cox, and Maria Pantoja, who are also serving life sentences, are the current leaders of the "pacifists." During a recent visit to one of the jails in Lima, President Alberto Fujimori and Edmundo Cox shook hands before reporters. The Peruvian opposition has repeatedly demanded that the government inform the people about the negotiation process in order for public opinion to stay abridge of the developments and thus clear all doubts surrounding the talks and deny the growing rumors that state "Guzman is trying to secure a pardon and his release into exile."
