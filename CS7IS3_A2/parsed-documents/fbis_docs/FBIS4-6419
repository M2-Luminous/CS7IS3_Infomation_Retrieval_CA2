Fujii, speaking at a regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting, declined to comment on the overnight tightening of U.S. credit policy, however. Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations are slated to meet Sunday in Washington for twice-yearly gatherings through Tuesday of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. "I presume interest rates will become one of the major issues," Fujii said, noting that sustainable growth without inflation is what G-7 nations want to attain. Fujii acknowledged there were various views concerning the tighter U.S. credit stance, such as increasing hopes for an economic recovery and spreading fears of inflation. But he said, "I shouldn't be commenting on another nation's credit policy." The U.S. Federal Reserve Board announced overnight a slight tightening of its credit policy, lifting the target rate for the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point. The third tightening since the Fed changed its credit stance for the first time in five years in February contrasts with Germany's move last week to cut its key rates to allow other European nations to follow suit. The U.S. credit stance has sent long-term market rates sharply higher, exporting the uptrend to other G-7 nations. With a credit policy gap surfacing between the U.S., which is on the road to recovery, and Japan and some European nations which are still struggling with sluggish economies, coordination is expected to become a tough issue for the G-7 meeting. Concerning Japan's huge trade surplus that is certain to be another major topic, Fujii declined to suggest remedies, saying it depends on the coming new cabinet. Japan is set to choose a new prime minister, with the most likely candidate being Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, to succeed Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa who offered to resign earlier this month. Fujii said he does not know whether Japan will be represented at the Washington meetings by its finance minister in view of the uncertain political situation and the expected start of Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 budget as soon as a new cabinet is formed. Referring to the fiscal 1993 trade surplus released Monday, Fujii said exports are decreasing and imports are increasing in terms of volume. The trend shows the effectiveness of the Trade Ministry's measures, he said. Japan's trade surplus for the year ended March 31 hit a record high for the second year in a row, reaching 121.99 billion dollars, up 10.0 percent from the year before. Fujii said Japan will continue taking action to boost domestic demand and deregulatory steps to facilitate market access as included in the February stimulus package and the March market-opening plan.
