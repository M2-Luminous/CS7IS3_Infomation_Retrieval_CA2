Rose was talking "soldier to soldier" in a private conversation, held during a visit to the town Wednesday, that "should never have been released," UNPROFOR spokesman Eric Chaperon said. The UN commander had been discussing theories for the Bosnian collapse, and the view expressed was only one of several possibilities raised, the spokesman said. He stressed that the remarks did not represent the UNPROFOR position on the issue. Rose intended to explain his position at greater length later Thursday, Chaperon said. A video tape presenting the conversation was broadcast on BBC television late Wednesday. Chaperon said he did not know how the tape came to be passed to the BBC and broadcast. In the tape, Rose said that Bosnian Government forces "think we should be fighting the war for them... they basically turned and ran and left us to try and pick up the bits." UNPROFOR Sarajevo sector commander General Andre Soubirou meanwhile told reporters Wednesday that he had found the collapse of Bosnian defence lines "difficult to explain," and said that they "could have done better." Serbs, who attacked Gorazde at the end of March, had withdrawn their heavy weapons outside a 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone around the town by late Wednesday, the UN peacekeeping force said. NATO has given the Serbs an ultimatum to lift their siege of the town or face aerial bombardment of their positions.
