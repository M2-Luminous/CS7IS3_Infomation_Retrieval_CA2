Quintal] [Text] Johannesburg April 21 SAPA -- Minister of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer said on Thursday [21 April] there was no possibility of amending the constitution and that the right-wing had not approached the government in this regard. He was commenting in an interview with SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio on the possibility of the Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] participating in the election if certain conditions were met. Mr Meyer said the idea of 800,000 votes indicating support for a volkstaat [homeland] was not viable because it would not be an indication of the locality of a volkstaat. Referring to the right-wing's demand for independence, he said the government was not prepared to fragment South Africa. Self-determination could be aspired to within the framework of the existing constitution. Mr Meyer said the right-wing already had what it wanted, which was why Gen Constand Viljoen was taking part in the election. He suggested Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg link up with Gen Viljoen.
