Utkin, leading researcher at the United States and Canada Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences: "United States--West Europe: The Changing Role of Germany"] [Text] There is no doubt that the West European region, due to its social propinquity to the United States, is important for the realization of a policy ensuring a world order favorable for the latter. However, Atlanticists and their imitators are gradually losing the exclusive positions they once held in the U.S. political arena as well as in American political science. It would be an exaggeration to present this process as a massive turn away from Europe, as an unequivocal rejection of solid political, economic, and military ties with the West European region. There is hardly any need to convince anyone how important for the United States are NATO, OECD, GATT, and the annual forum of the seven most developed countries. But it is equally important to point out the significant changes being observed in the U.S. ruling elite in terms of the vision of the American place in the future world. In the past, the pro-Atlantic strategists saw it in the creation of a "North Atlantic Community" (the blueprint for which was drafted by J. Kennedy in 1962) as the first stage of all other combinations. Now the very issue of institutionalizing the ties with West Europe has been practically abandoned and it is indicative that among the variants of development for the year 2000 (and beyond) one does not see anything that would assume some sort of North Atlantic statehood. The people who chart the U.S. foreign policy course see many different roads ahead, but not this one--it has lost its attraction. In the final analysis NATO will probably exist for some time, but the loss of a common goal, the asymmetry of the bloc, the disengagement of interests will further reduce the attractiveness to the United States of the West European region as a global ally. Washington is facing a practical question: With whom specifically to do business in Europe? There is a lively debate underway in the United States as to who should be America's main partner in Europe. There are three contenders: Great Britain, France, and Germany. But the old "special ally"--Great Britain--has lost economic positions, having become somewhat marginal in the process of West European integration. France chose to reorient itself towards Bonn, and the United States was left with practically no choice. It is logical in every sense that a significant number of political scientists name Germany as a key partner. It would be orientation towards the largest country in West Europe, a potential future predominant force in the region. The choice is almost certain--but just as certain are doubts that the new Germany will be as loyal and convenient a partner as the old FRG had been. Overall, the Americans are aware that when the communist East Germany disappeared in October 1990, the old West Germany, the familiar and ready-to-help ally, also disappeared. Even the strictly pro-German researcher R. Livingston acknowledges that increasing the FRG population by 16 million provides grounds not only for quantitative but also qualitative changes: It is clear that "the united Federative Republic will inevitably be more powerful, but it is not yet clear how it will use this might."[.sup]1[/] By all parameters (with the exception of nuclear weapons) Germany is already perceived in the United States as the future leader of Europe. But while the United States is willing to count on the new Germany as its main privileged ally in Europe, it would be somewhat premature to speak of reciprocal willingness on the part of the Germans. "The German corporate approach allows it, as it does Japan, to concentrate its economic might towards achieving political goals abroad."[.sup]2[/] The hasty recognition by Germany of Slovenia and Croatia is a clear example of how the new, more powerful Germany will (at least periodically) act in its own interests, without looking not only to the opposite shore of the Atlantic but even to neighboring Paris and London, let alone its small neighbors. The recognition of Croatia in 1991 is seen as a distant thunder: Germany has regained the self-confidence it lost with the defeat of Hitler. American experts predict that Germany will dominate East Europe (and even see in it already a source of Russian-German conflicts). And the fact that Chancellor Kohl already has demanded the right to use troops outside the NATO sphere of action cannot fail to suggest certain food for thought. In the past the United States looked for and emphasized the common in the political climate and mentality between Germany and the West as a whole. Now it carefully emphasizes the peculiarities of the largest country in West and Central Europe. In particular, American specialists note that Germany lacks universities that could produce an internationalist elite, as Oxford and Cambridge do in England, the Ecoles Superieures in France, and Tokyo University. In the opinion of the same Livingston, with unification Germany once again assumes the historic role of a Central European power, whose interests in the East are no less serious than in the West. West Germany oriented towards the Atlantic, the way we knew it during 1949-1990, was a deviation from the norm of German history. Russian power is currently on the wane once again in East Europe. And, as has happened more than once in the past, German power is replacing it here." What do Americans see in the Germanized East? Small states of Croatia and Hungary type already are awaiting directives from Germany. Slovakia, acquiring independence, immediate fell into the German orbit. The Czech Republic and Poland are in inevitable economic captivity. Ukraine may also end up there. Russia is looking for an economic foothold, and may find it only in Germany. Germany has surpassed all Western countries taken together with respect to credits, subsidies, and credit guarantees for the entire East Europe. The former Soviet Union alone had received 75 billion marks by the middle of 1992. Another 30 billion marks went to other East European countries. German investment in the East is incommensurably greater than that of others, and the FRG's trade with the East surpasses all Western trade taken together. While in the European Union ((EU)) Germany tries to act together with France, and in NATO--in coordination with the United States, in the East Germany has a free hand. Neither do the Americans fail to notice that the EU is becoming practically a German domain. In 1991, despite the strain caused by absorption of five Eastern lands, Germany accounted for 53 percent of the entire EU market (is it comparable with the U.S. share of 6 percent?). Now Germany has a population that is twice as large as that of its historical rivals--France and Great Britain. The population of the united Germany grew to 80 million, and Germany's economic share in the EU has increased from 26 to 31 percent. Kohl immediately used the factor of Germany's increased might and began to demand that the German language be given a status equal to that of French and English in the EU. There is no doubt that acceptance into the EU of such countries as Austria or the Czech Republic (now Germany's client) will increase the proportional weight of Germany even more. The United States and NATO, maintains Livingston, formerly vitally important for vulnerable West Germany, will now be relegated to the second or third level of priority, since with the end of the cold war Bonn has less need of an alliance with Washington. The situation is far from simple. On one hand, the Unites States has sufficiently strong positions in Germany--not only military-political, but also economic. Let us recall that direct American investment in the German economy comprises $25 billion, while direct German investment into the American economy comprises $34 billion. Germany, which exports one-third of its gross domestic product [GDP], and the United States, whose exports have exceeded 10 percent of GDP, are becoming increasingly more interested in a world system of free trade. On the other hand, it is quite obvious that Germany is in no particular rush to compete for the right of the United States' most-favored partner in the West when it has such prospects in the East. And this policy towards the East has deep historical roots. Before World War II Germany owned one-quarter of all trade with East Europe. It is not surprising that now Germany is again becoming a leading trade partner for Russia, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Germany's positions probably will be strongest in the Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovakia, and the Baltics. American economists, historians, and political scientists see in the future a Germany which will find a huge new (old) sphere of influence all the way to St. Petersburg, expand this sphere of influence, and the memory of old friends across the ocean will remind it only of the old days of humiliation. Americans note that Germany has already begun to "play down" the importance of NATO by creating pan-European organizations, such as the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which includes states of the former Warsaw Pact. Now it is Germany that is lobbying to accept into the EU Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. The objective result of Bonn's new external activities certainly is not neutral with respect to the United States. Germany is actually acting in its own name rather than "on behalf of the West," as a vanguard of the union led by America. The results of this are already affecting the European disposition of forces. In W. Hyland's opinion, in Europe "American influence is falling, German, rising."[.sup]3[/] Some American specialists have no doubt that the most important factor is Washington's nonparticipation, induced by circumstances, in forming the new Europe. One way or the other there is a growing conviction in the United States that the German question not only has not been resolved but that it is only now emerging in all its complexity. The question is which direction German foreign policy will move from here. Who will control Central Europe, and hence, the entire continent? At this point the dark forebodings and fears are entertained predominantly by historians, political scientists, and economists, but not the general public, which still believes in "German loyalty." Even among those who remember the history of the 20th century, attitudes have not yet taken final shape. Only the results of Germany's behavior in Europe will dot all the "i's." Hyland reassures his compatriots regarding Germany: "Fortunately, Bonn of the 1990's is not the Weimar of the 1920's. The unified Germany is fixed in the structure of unions and organizations; its democracy has deeper roots; its foreign ambitions and wishes have been fulfilled. No more of the 'knife in the back' legend; no more of the irredentist movement." Germany is different now, but what is it? It is already clear to everybody in Washington that as a result of Germany's rise a global shift of forces has occurred. What conclusions should we draw from this? Specialists' opinions diverge. Some want to extract some gain for the United States by establishing special relations with Germany; others advocate measures to nip the geopolitical rise of Germany in the bud. Energetic supporters of the former, "pro-German" approach are the aforementioned R. Livingston, E. Pond, General W. Odom, and P. Tarnoff. They argue the need for rapprochement with Bonn. Livingston, director of the German Research Institute at Johns Hopkins University, believes that fears of a unified Germany are exaggerated. It has changed in a fundamental way during the postwar period, he says. Its foundation--West Germany--over four decades has been "de-Prussified, Westernized, and highly commercialized." It has moved a great distance away from the Kaiser, Weimar, Nazi country that challenged the world and has sublimated its nationalism in the pathos of European build-up. E. Pond works on the premise that in the new 1990's system, which is currently in the process of being built, the two critically important forces are the United States and the European Union led by Germany. The researcher believes that NATO has already become a "postnational" institution, and advocates shifting the burden of the main efforts in this union to the European half as a whole, and within that--to Germany first. The Americans should welcome this positive self-assertion of its "partners in leadership," she writes, urging them not to worry (as the nervous French do) "about the subject of Germany creating a special sphere of influence in its region."[.sup]4[/] If not Germany, who will be able to mobilize the immense resources of Europe to the defense of the common interests of the West, or even the North as a whole in its developing confrontation with the developing South? General W. Odom, director of the Hudson Institute's Security Issues Research Program, has no doubt that "Germany is the key. The Atlantic house, which includes Britain, France, and some other smaller countries, cannot ensure peace; it must include Germany... When ties between Germany and the United States are solid, Europe is stable. The absence of such ties leads to war."[.sup]5[/] Famous political scientist and futurologist P. Tarnoff also provides arguments in favor of Washington's orientation toward the European capital that will determine the course of history, that is, Bonn. Washington can still delude itself for some time regarding the dominant function of its "special relations" with London, but this already constitutes a disengagement from reality. For the third time in the history of the 20th century the United States must choose among the European elite, and this time the choice must be Germany.[.sup]6[/] The Americans (like many before them) hope that the Germans will not forget the good deeds: the Marshall Plan, the aid during the Berlin blockade, and the help in the cause of German reunification. Let us note that in its time Russia also (in 1870) counted on Bismarck's gratitude. As did Gorbachev, for that matter. Livingston believes that by taking upon itself the role of Western bulwark in Central and East Europe, Germany will enable the United States to be active in the Near East, Latin America, and the Pacific Ocean basin. America, on the other hand, should not encroach on its partner in the latter's sphere of influence. In the final analysis, believes R. Livingston, a Europe reaching to the Urals is so big that it will tie up German energy for many decades to come. The only question is whether Germany will stop there. (The creators of Locarno also dreamed of Germany "having its hands full" in the east.) Many Americans count on German gratitude for the fact that in 1989-1990 it was distant America, less burdened by European historical experiences, that supported German reunification to a much greater extent than its nearby European neighbors. They also point out how many Germans have found their new homeland in the United States: The biggest ethnic community now is German (according to the results of the 1990 census there are 58 million persons of German descent living in the United States, as compared to 38 million of Anglo-Saxon origin and 32 million Irish). Still, wary American observers note that neither World War I nor World War II resolved the issue of accommodating Germany in the European order of powers. Now this question arises again, in the 1990's. Moreover, the disintegration of the Soviet Union intensified the issue of the future place of Germany in Europe, where it no longer has a powerful Russian counterweight. Alarmists recall that it was a combination of the unification and industrialization of Germany under Bismarck that caused World War I and all subsequent misfortunes of our century. It was then that Germany forced the countries of the world to face a choice: agree to Germany's unprecedented power or fight it. Then, as in 1941, the world chose the former. Now the United States faces a similar choice. Another side of the issue is whether Bonn will agree to have "special relations" with Washington. American critics of the "pro-German" course note that such a union would put the Germans in a deliberately subordinate position. It is unlikely that they will be willing to consciously fix their dependent status. More likely, they will seek Western support first and foremost in the practically dependent France. A supporter of the latter approach--critical with respect to Germany--L. Xiang (Yale University) notes that "latent anti-American and anti-NATO feelings among Germans are a tremendously important part of the outlook of both the left and the right in Germany, although they are kept beneath the surface. United Germany has proved to be a fertile soil for xenophobia. There are no grounds for excessive faith in the restraining nature of NATO... As the 'Russian threat' disappears, there is nothing for the United States to do in Central and East Europe, where the vacuum is being filled by another superpower."[.sup]7[/] And the United States has been at war with this new superpower twice in this century. The critics of the pro-German preoccupation feel that a special accent on the German direction is a mistake. "Germany did not choose to form close ties with the United States during the postwar (after the cold war--A.U.) period. It should be noted that Germany, while providing $6.6 billion in the course of the Gulf War, completely refrained from participating in combat operations, shifting all the burden onto the United States. At the same time there are no historical or cultural factors that would make cooperation between America and Germany inevitable. On the contrary, many well-informed Germans are against the presence of foreign, especially American, troops on German soil and, as pressure along the East-West line weakens, question the very necessity of it."[.sup]8[/] Those representing the critics dismiss the hopes that preserving NATO would be enough to keep Germany's development under secure control. Currently nobody in Europe can exert serious controlling influence on Germany. Only the United States has the real power to do so, but its resolve is waning. Xiang puts the question straight: "Is NATO up to the dual task of maintaining Germany's orientation toward the West and containing the growing German nationalism and ambitions?" Yes, the geostrategic situation of Germany has changed beyond recognition in the early 1990's. For the first time over almost half a century Germany can again concentrate on Central Europe, which was its main sphere of interest in 1914 and 1939; on that very historic "Mitteleurope" which was the base for Germany's designs for world domination. As for the United States, for the first time in half a century it is facing a question: Will a new powerful Germany not choose leading positions in Central Europe over a subordinate place in the West? American political scientists, who take a stand against encouraging such a turn by pointing out the danger of alienating the German superpower, emphasize the weak point in the current American policy: On one hand the United States apparently guarantees Germany's security through NATO, but on the other opens for it the freedom of practically uncontrolled action in the eastern direction, where such newborn countries as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Croatia are agreeable in advance to a German protectorate. In a certain sense the situation today is such that the United States in a way is pushing Germany to move in eastern and southern directions instead of its previous course towards the Atlantic peace. An increasingly greater number of German analysts link their future and the future of their country with the creation of a German zone of influence aimed at turning the former Yugoslavia and the countries of the former Warsaw Pact into grateful German clients. Belatedly, American analysts have indeed discovered that both the left and the right in Germany (from their own positions, guided by different aims and plans) have come to the conclusion that the future of the country may lie to the east. Their former pan-European stance has acquired a complex Central European coloration. As a result, both of the largest parties in the FRG currently have a special vision of European development--they link it with the return to a zone of "historical influence." German propagandists still energetically vouch for their adherence to Atlantic peace, but harsh facts of modern times tell us that German nationalism is on the rise and the false German pan-European stance may turn out to be a cover for the nationalistic upturn in the unified country. How naive the old serious academic conclusions which contended that the FRG has lost its German identity now look.[.sup]9[/] Now, thanks to U.S. and NATO support, German nationalism is gaining momentum utilizing respectable moral baggage. Nationalists in England and France look like dinosaurs, but in Germany they use the West's victory in the cold war as a justifying premise for moving forward. Membership in NATO allows Germany to expand its sphere of influence in the east and south without alarming the objects of its political offensive as they are being absorbed. For this, Germany should be grateful to the United States. But should the United States be grateful to its shortsighted politicians? The United States also practically ignored the reaction of the first victims of Germany's elevation--Great Britain and France. The Americans found consolation in the fact that neither London nor Paris ever figured out what to do over those months and years when Germany was regaining the Bismarck zone of influence. Now, however, the unified Germany has rendered practically meaningless the Gaullist idea of preserving strategic independence. And no matter how much the French may want now to strengthen NATO ties (contrary to the theory and practice of Gaullism), "the bird has flown the cage." This was pointed out as early as 1990 by the experienced Flora Lewis--THE NEW YORK TIMES correspondent in Paris.[.sup]10[/] London, on the other hand, being in strained circumstances, while holding back European integration in fact reserved the right to turn to Washington so that, by remaining its closest European ally (in the event of frightening turns in Europe) for the third time in this century is finding salvation in ties with the United States. The Americans saw clearly that London was much more irritated by German unification than Paris, which left everything to fate. England sort of froze, looking at America, quietly hoping that NATO would still work as an Anglo-Saxon brake on Germany. But London already began to see in the German "pressing in favor of a United States of Europe (cynics talk about a "Federal Republic of Europe") the pursuit of old nationalist goals by new methods."[.sup]11[/] And what about America? Berkeley University Professor A. Wolfe predicts that "suspicion toward communism, which has left such an imprint on the American past, may turn into suspicion combined with envy toward Germany and Japan as they become increasingly important players in the world arena."[.sup]12[/] American specialists believe that "the conflict between American and German interests will acquire an acute form at a time when the need will arise to resolve the problem of the future of American arms in Germany."[.sup]13[/] It is being noted in America that already many Germans are speaking of the inevitable death of NATO, since it does not create conditions for realizing their dreams of Mitteleurope. But NATO must 'die a natural death only after it has served its purpose for German national interests.'"[.sup]14[/] Germany has in the future the same three options to choose from as it has had over the preceding century and a half: 1) act alone; 2) union with Russia; 3) union with the United States. Twice in this century the Germans have attempted to take the first option, and twice were defeated. At the time, union with Russia helped Bismarck and Hitler (in 1939), but neither was able to preserve German primacy in Europe. Germany chose union with America only under Adenauer in 1949, and it produced as a result the reindustrialization of Germany, its unification, the introduction of democracy, a long period of peace, and most importantly, Germany gaining its true place in Europe. Still, the question remains: What will be the Germans' current geopolitical choice? To what use will they put the freedom of action they have gained for the first time? They have all the old options open to them; they may consider desirable both union with Moscow and their own way of strengthening influence in East Europe. "A dark past and decades of foreign military presence have reinforced deep-seated feelings," believes General Odom, "which in Germany may turn out to be stronger than a cool-minded appraisal of objective interests." Alarmed Americans say that this is precisely the time, when many Germans are still afraid to be left without the umbrella of NATO, to exert a decisive influence on the evolution of Germany's foreign policy course. Fear of an unknown future may still help the Americans. American support for Paris and London could help rein in German ambitions. The French could become a particularly good conduit of Western influence. Actually, Paris does not have any choice: Otherwise, it will find itself completely in Germany's shadow. Is this not the time to revive the old Gaullist ideas of a "directorate"--a multilateral governing body that would include the United States, England, France, as well as Italy and Germany--asks Xiang. The weakness of this idea is in that it is odiously undemocratic in its intent to "lure" Germany into this new structure that would give it new opportunities. Hastily hatched plans to find anti-German support in London and Paris have a downside as well. Yes, American researchers admit that much depends on West Europeans. However, if England, France, Italy, and others begin to get nervous at the sight of the new German might, Germany will turn to East Europe and possibly to Moscow as well. For the United States this would be the worst-case scenario. Great Britain and France, however, do not have that much of a choice. As in 1914, they are facing the fact that the two of them cannot contain the German colossus. The revival of German nationalism would inevitably reverberate in London and Paris. This time America will not have that much time to make a choice. A traditional question: "What will be the future of Germany?" is hanging like a sword of Damocles over the pacified Europe, which had so many hopes for a "golden age" after the end of the cold war. The possibilities of the Swiss, Japanese, and Swedish model of political development of the FRG are being considered. By now, however, such discussions look obsolete. Realism does not permit us to see Germany as merely "a big Switzerland." Meanwhile, given West German money and East German ties, truly mind-boggling prospects are opening in the east. Germany strategic interest in the EU may wane in light of these eastern prospects. It is hardly a matter of contention that the emergence of German might was the most important factor of European history of the 20th century. The point of contention is how the Germans will use their new might this time. Most American specialists believe that the United States could solve the German problem only by strengthening NATO--a sort of "straitjacket" for Germany. But merely choosing Bonn as the most important partner actually does not resolve the problem but rather begets new ones. New difficulties are arising for the Americans. First, this time they are not the ones to hold the initiative--it is in the hands of the Germans. Second, both France and especially Great Britain find it difficult to adjust to living in the German shadow. This factor will inevitably affect inter-Atlantic relations. Third, Moscow "in its misfortunes" may turn to a benevolent Germany, and this will again bring back the feelings of 1922 and 1939. Finally, fourth, NATO may simply disintegrate, and the Americans will have no effective levers left to influence the common European process. According to G. Treverton, a staff member of the New York Council on International Relations, "nobody on either side of the Atlantic knows how to reform American ties with Europe after the disappearance of the Soviet threat, and whether they need to be revised in the first place. Americans still see NATO as the most serious defense alliance that provides the United States with the ability to influence the development of events in Europe. But NATO is not suitable for solving the future problem of European security: New Yugoslavias are expected here, rather than Soviet troops marching into the North German plains."[.sup]15[/] At the current stage the United States is leaving Europe in the military sphere, but increasing pressure in the economic one. (For instance, during the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations, for instance, it is demanding that subsidies to European agricultural producers be cut by 75 percent over 10 years--in a way, America demanded from Germany payment for consent to unification). There is no doubt, however, that as the new Europe with a new leader comes of age, relations between "the benefactor and the grateful recipient" will change radically. Footnotes [.sup]1[/] R.
