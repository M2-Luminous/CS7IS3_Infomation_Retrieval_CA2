The current consumption tax is collected by the central government as a national tax and is allocated to local governments at the rate of 20 percent of taxes collected as a consumption transfer tax and at the rate of 19.2 percent of taxes collected as a local government grant. In contrast, in connection with the contemplated increase in the consumption tax rate, the local consumption tax concept calls for direct collection of a portion of the consumption tax by prefectural governments for use as a fiscal source belonging to the local government. Such a change is being proposed by local governments and the Ministry of Home Affairs in view of the expected future increase in the welfare burden of local governments. The government's Tax Council has established a working committee to study the proposal as a major issue in connection with pending tax system reforms.] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is said that the new cabinet's foremost issue is tax system reform. What sort of reform do you see as being necessary? [Miyajima] As suggested in the 21st century welfare vision program, a senior citizen society will mean an inevitable rise in the public burden whether it be taxes or social security premiums. However, the current tax system is designed to impose the burden on members of the active work force. A major issue consists of changing this policy. About 15 percent of those individuals whose incomes exceed 20 million yen are senior citizens above age 60. On the other hand, individuals who rely solely on government annuities for their livelihood lead difficult lifestyles. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What should we do to cope with such discrepancies? [Miyajima] We should implement a comprehensive tax system that taxes both interest income and annuity income. After adopting a comprehensive tax system, the highest income tax bracket, which is currently 50 percent, should be lowered to about 30 percent. Interest can be taxed at the source at the highest income tax rate and subsequently refunded to those in lower income tax or tax-exempt brackets. The comprehensive tax system should be designed so as to impose a tax burden on those who are fortunate, whether they are in the senior citizen bracket or in the working class, and to exempt the less fortunate from the tax burden. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the consumption tax where debate centers on a hike? [Miyajima] If one looks at European nations, income taxes and consumption taxes will be the two main sources of revenues in 21st century Japan, and I believe the future will call for increases in the consumption tax. The question is, what policy areas should be covered by the increased revenues? Under the government's welfare tax concept, even if the tax rate is set at 7 percent, revenue therefrom will have to be used to offset other tax reductions, and only 800 billion yen will be available for use on welfare programs. Such figures will not be acceptable to the public. Before hiking taxes, we must clearly establish programs so that the public will reap the benefits of taxation in the form of improved welfare programs and improvements in social capital. Further, unless we completely correct the problem of "benefits of employee income tax withholdings" on the part of employers, we will not be able to maintain any semblance of social fairness. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The emasculation of industry is about to become an issue, but what should we do about corporate taxes? [Miyajima] It is said that Japan is heavily dependent on direct taxation, but a major basis for that viewpoint is the high ratio of corporate taxes. Of special note is that dependence on the corporate operating tax, which is the local government-imposed version of corporate taxes, is unusually high on an internationally comparative basis. The world as a whole is moving towards lower corporate taxes. If Japan alone retains high tax rates, manufacturers will have no choice but to transfer factories overseas, considering the additional disadvantage of a strong yen. Maintaining economic vitality calls for lowering of corporate taxes. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] If the corporate operating tax is reduced, local governments will face increasing shortfalls in their tax revenues. [Miyajima] We can raise the consumption tax and allocate the additional revenue to the local governments. They can be used to cover local government expenses such as welfare and improvement of the living environment. Certainly, local government requires stable revenue sources. We have no alternative but to decentralize government authority and to use taxes to improve living standards as a means to justify the need for raising the consumption tax. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What you are addressing is the introduction of the local consumption tax as debated by the government's Tax Council, is it not? [Miyajima] The tax system recommended by Sharp that served as the basis for postwar tax system reform treated the corporate operations tax as a kind of value-added tax such as the consumption tax. A local consumption tax will translate into the restoration of some of those original tax ideas. The local consumption tax could result in cases where the locale of consumption and the locale of tax payment will vary, but the Ministry of Finance needs to deal with the issue of how to allocate taxes as part of government decentralization programs. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] A single-year income tax reduction was implemented as an economic stimulus measure, while social security premiums were increased, bringing criticism from the United States that "we lost the benefits of a tax reduction." [Miyajima] Although for the public both areas represent publicly sustained expense items, taxes are handled by the Ministry of Finance, and social security insurance premiums are handled by the Ministry of Health and Welfare with an absence of policy coordination. Taxes and social security premiums should be debated jointly. In the United States and Britain, social security taxes are collected by the tax authorities, and the same should be done in Japan. Duplicate collecting systems are also a waste of government resources.
