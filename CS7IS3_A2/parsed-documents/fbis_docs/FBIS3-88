The CAMEROON NEWS AGENCY (CAMNEWS) reported in a dispatch to PANA Monday that the arrival of the French soldiers and diplomats was prompted by what it termed as "the illegal occupation" of parts of the Bakassi Peninsula in southwestern Cameroon. CAMNEWS did not give the number of French soldiers who arrived. The agency said that the French mission is in Cameroon "to evaluate the situation created by the invasion of Bakassi by troops of the Nigerian Army and the agression of Cameroonian soldiers on their territory". CAMNEWS said that there were clashes between Cameroonian and Nigerian troops on 18 and 19 February around the fishing zone around Kumbo and Janea. The agency claimed that Nigeria's green and white flag has been flying in Jabana and Diamond areas since 3 January 1994. The Cameroonian agency quoted Radio Kano of Nigeria which reportedly said that in three assaults, Nigeria lost 30 soldiers while one Cameronian soldier was killed and two others injured. A journalist from the national Cameroonian daily, CAMEROON TRIBUNE, who accompanied the country's minister of state in the president's office, Edouard Akame Mfoumou, on a visit to the area wrote that: "Troops from the two armies have occupied the fishing zones which have been transformed into combat areas and are only 100 metres away from each other in the Diamond and Ibabato area". CAMNEWS wrote that the French troops arrived around the same time as a French delegation of French diplomats from the French president's office and Foreign Ministry. Among those in the French diplomatic team is the special chief of staff of President Francois Mitterrand. The diplomats are also expected to visit Abuja, Nigeria's federal capital, on "reconciliation" the agency added. France and Cameroon have a defence pact dating back from when the central African state became independent from France on 20 May 1960.
