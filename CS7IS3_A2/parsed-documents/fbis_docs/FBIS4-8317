"I have long thought is was necessary that the international community use stronger means to let it be known that (the Serbs) cannot do whatever pleases them," Havel said. Two U.S. Air Force F-16 jets under NATO command attacked Bosnian Serb units which had entered the southern suburbs of Gorazde. It was the first NATO air strike against ground targets in Bosnia.
