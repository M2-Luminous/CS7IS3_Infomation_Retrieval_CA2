Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], reportedly used his influence to secure contributions from automotive, electronics, banking and other industries for the "John Manjiro no kai," a nonprofit group to promote Japan-U.S. grassroots relations, the sources said. The friendship organization was established in November 1990, when Ozawa was then secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party and sought donations from businesses to host a November 1991 conference in Kyoto to promote Japan-U.S. exchanges. Sadao Hirano, a Shinseito member of the House of Councillors, a close associate of Ozawa, was the acting chairman of the organization and reportedly asked the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) in September 1991 for its assistance in reaching a donations goal of 600 million yen. Hirano said Keidanren Secretary General Masaya Miyoshi spoke with the industries that could not contribute money through Keidanren, calling him "very cooperative." On Thursday, the sources said the "John Manjiro no kai" received 100 million yen from the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors (Nikkenren), which is an influential group in the Keidanren. John Manjiro was a fisherman from old Tosa Province who was shipwrecked in 1841 and taken to the United States by an American whaling ship. Manjiro later returned to Japan where he served as a translator, wrote an English phrase book and taught at the predecessor of Tokyo University as Japan opened to the world.
