Britain would like to transfer several units of its Rhine Army to eastern Germany for exercises. Last week, the Foreign Ministry categorically rejected Britain's request. The background lies in disputes about the Two-Plus-Four Agreement on German unity. Under that agreement, all of Germany will be counted as NATO area once the Russians have pulled out. However, the agreement stipulates that "foreign armed forces" would "neither be deployed in nor transferred to" the former GDR. In 1990, the allies agreed with the two German states to leave it to the united Germans to interpret the term "transfer." The British request has maneuvered Bonn into a dilemma. The Russian Government might regard the authorization of Rhine Army exercises in eastern Germany as an affront and slow down the faster-than-planned troop withdrawal. Yet, Bonn does not want to put off the British either, which is why the Federal Government is playing for time at the moment.
