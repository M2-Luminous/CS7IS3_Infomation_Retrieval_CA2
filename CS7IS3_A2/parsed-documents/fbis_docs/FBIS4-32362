The Hungarian-Slovak basic agreement could possibly be signed during the summer, and it seems certain that Slovak President Michal Kovac will visit Hungary prior to Hungarian President Arpad Goncz's visit to Banska Bystrica at the end of August. This was reported by the international secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), Gabor Hars, in Bratislava on Wednesday [22 June], after his talks with leaders of several major political forces. In an interview with MTI, Hars said the aim of his visit was to inform his partners in Bratislava about his party's foreign policy concepts prior to the MSZP taking over government. Hars said Slovakia has a priority place in the MSZP's foreign policy. The MSZP is ready to sign the Hungarian-Slovak basic agreement, together with the border guarantees. The politician was of the opinion that this could perhaps take place during Horn's visit to Slovakia, prior to the Slovak elections scheduled for the autumn. During his visit, Hars held talks with the vice-president of the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), Erzsebet Borza, an ethnic Hungarian, and the party's ethnic Hungarian parliamentary deputy, Jozsef Zselenak. Hars also met former Slovak Prime Minister Jan Carnogursky, the chairman of the Slovak Christian Democratic Movement (KDH); the vice-president of the Vladimir Meciar-led Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Ivan Lexa; the section director of the Slovak Foreign Ministry, Frantisek Dlhopolsky, and the chairman of the Coexistence movement, Miklos Duray.
