The welcome ceremony was held in the main courtyard of the presidential palace. Fujimori's accompanying delegation is headed by Alfonso Bustamante, president of the Council of Ministers and industry, foreign trade, tourism, and integration minister, three additional ministers, and members of the Democratic Constituent Congress. During a news conference held after the welcoming ceremony, Fujimori answered questions for Colombian reporters on the antidrug-trafficking struggle, violence, and human rights in Peru. [Begin recording] [Fujimori] We are waging a battle against terrorism from which we cannot withdraw. Despite certain isolated incidents--as a matter of fact, very condemnable incidents in which members of the Armed Forces are involved--we cannot risk our antiterrorist strategy or Armed Forces; that is basic. Furthermore, those who have expressed their differences or disagreement with this law are those who have participated in former governments in which flagrant cases were also handled by military courts. The best example of this would be the killings in the jails when approximately 300 prisoners were shot in the temple and killed. This matter was handled by a military court. There were also cases involving the killing of peasants during the early eighties; a military court also handled these cases. One of the few cases handled by a civilian court was the case of General Noel [not further identified]. It took 10 years for the civilian court to hand down a sentence in this case--10 years. I am sure the deep-rooted goal is to punish those responsible for this horrible crime, and I know they will be punished. The people want this, and this will happen in a few weeks. [Unidentified reporter] Your justice minister has said in Geneva 95 percent of the terrorist leaders are in jail. Is it true the other 5 percent want to sit down and talk to you to end terrorism in your country? What would you tell former Peruvian President Alan Garcia if you were to meet him here in Colombia? What would you tell him on behalf of the people and government of Peru? [Fujimori] There has been no contact with that 5 percent of the terrorist leaders who are at large. Our intelligence organizations will make these contacts, which will be aimed at capturing them, not talking with them. Regarding your second question, I will refrain from answering. I am more concerned about helping Peru out of its situation of underdevelopment and economic crisis. [Reporter] How does it feel to be the initiator, at the world level, of the word Fujimori-style coup [Fujimorazo] as an unconventional procedure to defend democracy? [Fujimori] I do not know [chuckles] what I feel, but I am sure I did something that was necessary for Peru and for regional security. Perhaps the process is not called a Fujimori-style coup, of Fujimorifazo, as the Brazilians say, but it is a process in which the people express their discontent for the inefficiency of the political systems that have led most of the people to poverty, underdevelopment, and misery. [end recording] During the afternoon, President Fujimori was greeted by the diplomatic corps at the Foreign Ministry, located in the San Carlos Palace, which once had been Simon Bolivar's home. Fujimori also placed a wreath at Simon Bolivar's monument and received the keys to the city from the mayor of Santa Fe de Bogota.
