The Chinese vice foreign minister summoned the U.S. ambassador in Beijing and made it clear to him that the United States has interfered in China's internal affairs by approving that law. Meanwhile, speaking at the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee's session, the architect of the Pressler Amendment, Senator Larry Pressler, accused China of developing nuclear missiles capable of striking the United States, which can create security concerns among neighboring countries. The question is: Has Senator Larry Pressler taken onto his shoulder the onus of creating causes of friction in Pakistan's and China's relations with the developed nations? One can ask this because his every statement seems to be directed toward protecting the interests of India or Israel. Under these circumstances, if one were to say that Larry Pressler and Stephen Solarz are political cognates, then it would not be inappropriate. In his aforementioned statement, without naming India, Larry Pressler tried to bring home the point that Chinese missiles with the capacity to strike the United States could pose a threat to India's security. It seems India is fast increasing its lobbying in the U.S. political and legislative institutions to purchase Patriot missiles and technology from that country. As for Taiwan and Tibet, Pakistan recognizes these two regions as parts of China. However, India and the United States are gradually carrying forward their policies under a well thought-out plan to create an uprising against Beijing in Tibet and make Taiwan refuse to come under the sway of Beijing's administration. The United States, after having deferred the Tibet issue to India, is now playing the role of a silent spectator and is keeping the Taiwan issue directly in its own hands. If all these things are analyzed, then it will become crystal clear in the very first stage that the conspiracies to blockade China from all sides are being executed very cunningly. The recent U.S. approval of a legislation about Tibet and Taiwan also points to the Indo-U.S. conspiracy against China. The seminars currently being organized in Pakistan to pave the way for the implementation of the U.S. plan to divide the state of Jammu and Kashmir also seem to be a link in the chain of this conspiracy. The people of Pakistan openly support the protestations made by the Chinese vice foreign minister against the U.S. law and demand that Washington stop its increasing acts of interference in the Asian region, because it is essential for the preservation of global peace.
