Various localities must comprehensively understand and earnestly implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 10th (enlarged) plenum of the fifth Anhui provincial party committee; we must persistently endure hardships, press on to the finish without letup, seize favorable opportunities and make progress, and strive in every possible way to sustain the favorable momentum for development. These views have been repeatedly stressed by Lu Rongjing, secretary of the Anhui provincial party committee, during his recent inspection tour of grass-roots units. Lu Rongjing was inspecting and conducting research in various localities including Fanchang, Tongling, Qingyang, Shitai, Guichi, and Dongzhi from 15 to 22 January. He was particularly interested in learning how the guidelines of the 10th (enlarged) plenum of the fifth Anhui provincial party committee have been implemented. He braved severe cold and snowstorms, visited deeply in rural areas and enterprises, and studied the actual situation through personal contacts. He also held extensive discussions with grass-roots cadres and the masses. Wherever he went, he fully affirmed and commended cadres and the masses for their optimistic spirits and for the large number of laudable examples among them. Lu Rongjing said: Anhui's current situation is very good. Various localities are earnestly formulating and promptly implementing 1994's tasks according to the requirements of the provincial party committee and government. However, we should also notice that progress has not been balanced enough. After achieving certain accomplishments in 1993, some localities expressed the idea that they should take a rest, and they somewhat slackened their efforts in arranging and carrying out their work. We must attach importance to such a situation. Our efforts should be enhanced but not slackened, and our enthusiasm should be increased but not reduced. Various localities, especially leading comrades at various levels, must continue to be level-headed, and must not slacken their efforts or vigilance. We should value the excellent conditions, should seize rare opportunities, should continually promote the efforts and enthusiasm we displayed in our work in 1993, and should continue to make new efforts so as to attain a higher level of fresh accomplishments. Lu Rongjing pointed out: A whole year's work depends on a good start in the spring. We should pay closer and closer attention to various tasks, without any letup, at the beginning of the year. Otherwise, if we are sluggish at the beginning, our initial passivity will make us lag throughout the year. At present, the situation is progressing very favorably: Everyone is competing with one another. Stopping or moving slowly is considered regression. Time passes very swiftly, and it will be very difficult to catch up later. All of us must fully understand the aforementioned concept. The Spring Festival is approaching very soon. Our tasks in various fields are very heavy. We should make overall plans after taking all factors into consideration, should emphasize key tasks, and should properly make corresponding arrangements. While strictly and properly carrying out various other tasks, we should not slacken, even for a moment, our efforts, particularly on economic work, so as to lay a good foundation for competently completing all the tasks in 1994. Lu Rongjing stressed: Our key to accomplishing the tasks laid down by the 10th plenum of the fifth Anhui provincial party committee lies in strictly carrying out various tasks. At present, our reform tasks have entered a stage whereby we have to comprehensively resolve tough problems and a lot of work has become more complicated. They include ways to fulfill the requirements for establishing a modern enterprise system, how to further invigorate enterprises, how to gear up for the market, and ways to accelerate economic restructuring in the agricultural sector. We need to make great efforts to study and resolve many deep-seated contradictions and problems in the aforementioned issues. Leading cadres at various levels should truly involve themselves, should earnestly collect and understand firsthand information, should conscientiously summarize the creative work of the broad masses of cadres and people during their actual practice of it, and should provide specific guidance under various categories so as to help cadres and people at the lower level promptly resolve their actual existing problems. We should implement a rigorous responsibility system so that every task will be earnestly carried out. Wherever he went, Lu Rongjing visited peasants' families, expressed concern for their well-being, and meticulously inquired about their production and lives. He repeatedly told local responsible cadres who accompanied him: We must be concerned for the masses' lives. We must warmly express concerns, particularly for households which have been guaranteed that they will be provided with clothing, food, housing, and medical services during their lifetimes, and funeral services when they die; for destitute families, and for dependents and family members of active-duty service members and of revolutionary martyrs. We must constantly get to know their living conditions and must render timely assistance to them if they have difficulties. Before the Spring Festival arrives, various localities should mobilize and organize personnel in various sectors to launch warmth-extending campaigns so as to enable the broad masses of people to happily enjoy a pleasant lunar new year. During his inspection tour, Lu Rongjing also visited some military garrisons, where he called on and extended festive greetings to officers and service members. Accompanying him in the inspection tour were Fang Zhaoxiang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee; Ji Jiahong [1323 1367 1347], secretary general of the provincial party committee; and Lu Jiafeng [4151 1367 0023], deputy secretary general of the provincial party committee and director of the provincial party committee policy research center.
