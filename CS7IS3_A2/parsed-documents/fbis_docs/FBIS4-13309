[Begin recording] [Sha'th] Negotiations are continuing with all their committees. A large group of experts in various fields was added to the Palestinian delegation this week. Today, there were some positive developments. They are slow, but proceeding persistently regarding the security issues. Some progress was made also on the jurisdiction issue. [passage omitted] [Zaydani] We understand that the Israeli delegation submitted to discussion the issue of relations between Fatah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. [Sha'th] For the tenth time, I would like to explain that relations between Fatah and Hamas, or between Fatah or any other Palestinian organization, is a 100 percent internal issue, and a PLO affair only. We want Palestinian national unity. We spare no effort to create a framework of Palestinian understanding and Palestinian participation when the Palestinian entity sees light. However, at the same time, we are very clear, we are committed to this agreement and to its full implementation. Our desire to have the biggest possible number of Palestinians contribute to our decision making does not at all mean we will relinquish our commitments to this agreement. [end recording] [Zaydani] Dr. Nabil Sha'th was asked about his opinion of measures taken in Amman to the effect that the Hamas Movement is an illegal movement in Jordan. [Begin Sha'th recording] I prefer not to comment on this issue. I believe all Palestinian factions will eventually find their true house within the PLO and on Palestinian territory. His Majesty King Husayn reiterated that the PLO is the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinians. The PLO is the side that is responsible and must be responsible for protecting the entire Palestinian house. [end recording]
