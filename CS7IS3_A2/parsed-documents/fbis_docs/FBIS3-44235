Their discussions centered on the payment of Zaire's arrears to the organization. Muako Alibaba has the details: [Alibaba] INTELSAT might cut its telephone and television services to Zaire at the national and international levels, for failure to honor its financial obligations. This situation was at the center of the discussions that the prime minister held with Mr. Toure at his office today in the presence of (Philippe Gelezi Tutua Kabanzili), minister of posts, telephones, and telecommunications. After the discussions, the INTELSAT regional director for Africa had this to say: [Begin recording] [Toure] In my capacity as INTELSAT regional director for Africa, I paid a courtesy call on the prime minister who agreed to receive me. In general, we discussed African issues such as the important project known as the regional African satellite system and other problems concerning Zaire in particular. Among these problems are the present delayed payment of Zaire's contributions, and in view of the recent decisions made by INTELSAT board of governors, Zaire's national and international telephone and television traffic might be cut. This is why I deemed it advisable to come here to discuss the situation with the authorities to avoid such a cut, as it would adversely affect the African group within the board of governors. I first discussed the problem with the minister of telecommunications and with the National Telecommunications Corporation. We succeeded in drawing up a number of measures which I believe, once implemented, could help solve the problem soon. We also discussed other problems that may crop up in future and ways of preventing Zaire from facing a similar situation. We hope that our cooperation will be fruitful. [Unidentified correspondent] What was the prime minister's reaction in the face of all these problems? [Toure] First, I was very satisfied with the reactions of the minister of telecommunications and the prime minister who received me immediately after my arrival in view of the urgent situation. I was very satisfied with the measures taken before my arrival, because this problem is a longstanding one. The Ministry of Telecommunications has already started taking a number of steps, and I was very satisfied to note them here myself. We received some promises and support from the prime minister to help solve the problem. We believe that before the deadline -- we only have one month left, that is 27 February -- the problem will be solved, taking into account the prime minister's reactions. [Correspondent] Thank you.
