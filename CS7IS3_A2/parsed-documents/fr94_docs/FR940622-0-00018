Office location and telephone number: Westfield Building North, 6th floor, 2800 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-308-8393 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NOR-AM Chemical Co., Little Falls Centre One, 2711 Centerville Rd., Wilmington, DE 19808, submitted pesticide petitions (PPs) proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 to establish a tolerance exemption for residues of N -( n -octyl)-2-pyrrolidone (PP 1E3959) and N -( n -dodecyl)-2-pyrrolidone (PP 1E3960) as inert ingredients (solvents) applied to growing crops. EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of March 23, 1994 (57 FR 13720), announcing receipt of these petitions. No comments were received in response to the notice. Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 162.3(c), and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting and spreading agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply to nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. As part of the EPA policy statement on inert ingredients published in the Federal Register of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. The data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have been evaluated. This inert ingredient is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerance is sought. Toxicological, ecological, and environmental fate data were considered in evaluating this inert ingredient for use in pesticides. The data considered in support of these exemptions from tolerance include: 1. A 90-day oral toxicity study in the rat using N -( n -octyl)-2-pyrrolidone with a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 600 ppm (53 mg/kg) and a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) of 8,460 ppm. Effects observed include significantly increased absolute and relative liver weights and mild hepatocellular hypertrophy. 2. A 90-day oral toxicity study in the dog using N -( n -octyl)-2-pyrrolidone with a NOAEL of 30 mg/kg and a LOAEL of 90 mg/kg. Effects observed include increased absolute and relative liver weights, hepatocellular hypertrophy, and altered blood levels of liver enzymes. 3. A developmental toxicity study in the rat using N -( n -octyl)-2-pyrrolidone with a maternal NOAEL of 50 mg/kg and a developmental NOAEL of 200 mg/kg. At the developmental LOAEL of 800 mg/kg there was altered growth and an increased incidence of wavy ribs. 4. A negative mutagenicity battery for N -( n -octyl)-2-pyrrolidone including an Ames Test, Micronucleus Test, and TK Locus Test and negative Ames and Micronucleus Tests for N -( n -dodecyl)-2-pyrrolidone. 5. An oncogenicity study on N -methyl pyrrolidone, a related compound, was judged negative by reviewers in the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, EPA. Residue data is generally not required for inert ingredient exemptions from tolerance. In this case, worst-case residue calculations were done based on the proposed uses. These calculations indicated that a broad exemption could not be granted without additional residue information because of the potential for high dietary exposure. The petitioner therefore requested that the exemption be modified to include only the use of these solvents in cotton defoliant formulations containing thidiazuron and diuron as active ingrdients. This yielded worstcase residue estimates of 735 ppm in cotton seed, concentrating to 4,630 ppm in cottonseed oil. Consumption of cottonseed oil in children, the subgroup with the highest exposure, is .036355 gms/kg/day. This leads to an exposure of .18 mg/kg/day, with a margin of exposure of 166 from the NOAEL in the 90 day dog study. Residue information from thidiazuron as a cotton defoliant indicates that actual residues for these inerts are expected to be orders of magnitude below this worst-case estimate. Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural practice, these ingredients are useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA proposes that the exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations or recipients thereof, or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

N -( n -octyl)-2-pyrrolidone and N -( n -dodecyl)-2-pyrrolidone are exempt from the requirement of a tolerance when used as solvents in cotton defoliant formulations containing thidiazuron and diuron as active ingredients.
