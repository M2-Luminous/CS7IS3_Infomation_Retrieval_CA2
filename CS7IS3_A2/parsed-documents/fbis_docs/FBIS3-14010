This happened in 1962 when China had attacked us at our northern border. The same thing happened in 1965 when we went to war with Pakistan. This happened again in 1971 when we took action against the armed invasion of Pakistan in order to free Bangladesh. In 1971, the whole nation had united against the U.S. "gunboat diplomacy" used in support of the Pakistani army. It should be known that the U.S. battleship Enterprise was exercising in the Bay of Bengal. Its purpose was to scare the Indian people, however, it failed in doing so. The only thing it succeeded in was making every section of Indian population angry. Our five decades experience has made it clear how the people of this country meet any outside challenge or policy to intimidate and exploit us. The people will not bow to this, but will protect the pride and autonomy of their country. The latest expression of this unique response is the nationwide Indian reaction to the conspiracies hatched in Washington supported by the leaders of Pakistan. The truth is that Pakistani noises made over Kashmir would not have affected us unless everyone from President Clinton down to low-level U.S. officials had not openly encouraged it to spew poison against the Indian stand. The anger that was created by the United States is not limited to its accusation of human rights violations by Indian troops. It includes its challenge to the truth about Kashmir's joining India and putting a question mark on it. The fact is that President Clinton and his assistants have declared the Kashmir issue as serious as the problems created by the civil war in Afghanistan. The Clinton government is openly encouraging Pakistani military officers and armed terrorists to encourage insurgency against the Indian government. However, its effect is totally opposite to what was expected. How did this happen? This has created a solidarity and unity within the framework of Indian politics as was not seen since 1971. This national unity resulting from the foreign plot against India was demonstrated in the leadership of the government delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva and the Kashmir-related resolution introduced in the Parliament. There could not be a better display of a united national stand against the detestable conspiracy to separate Kashmir from the Indian Union. This conclusion shows us the actual elements of the American policy in this region. The government policy-makers appeared to be working under the belief that after the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, Washington would think it necessary to consider India as a more dependable and stable unit compared to Pakistan in South Asia. At the same time, it was hypothesized that the disintegration of the Soviet Union would reduce Pakistan's importance in the American strategy for this region, because the United States would not need Pakistan as a military base in the changed international situation. However, the emergence of facts proved both these notions to be wrong. The first reason for this is that despite economic liberalization, India is refusing to become a U.S. tributary or a supporter nation. The United States cannot consider India as a safe bet as long as this continues. The second reason is that the importance of Pakistan has not diminished in the Pentagon. The main basis for this is the possibility of expanding trade with the Central Asian countries, nearness to Pakistan, Kashmir, Tibet, and Sikiang which can be used for annoying China. Against this background, anyone can realize how useless the Indian government's request to the U.S. Government to declare Pakistan a terrorist nation is. In contrast, the India deputation's criticism of the terrorism introduced from across the border at the Geneva meeting was very appropriate. It is equally important for the Indian officials to foil any third party's efforts to mediate in Kashmir because the United States would be behind it. Keeping external interference out of Kashmir is one thing and dealing with this issue seriously as an internal problem is another; these two cannot be mixed up. We have been right in telling the rest of the world that unrest and tension in Kashmir is our internal issue. However, we also have to keep the fact in mind that we cannot resolve this issue just by saying that the whole problem was created by Pakistan. If we are honest with ourselves then we should not hesitate in admitting that our wrong approach in resolving this issue and the mistake of mixing up the political aspects with administrative aspects have created a feeling of alienation in the hearts and minds of the people in the valley. The truth is that the superficial and cheap strategy being used in the valley is an embarrassing situation for the Indian democracy. We still have the time to admit that the real key to solving Kashmir's problem is in the hands of this nation's government and the political parties. In order to find a permanent solution to this problem, they should take the effective and serious initiative of starting talks with the terrorist groups and their supporters in the Huriat Conference. *
