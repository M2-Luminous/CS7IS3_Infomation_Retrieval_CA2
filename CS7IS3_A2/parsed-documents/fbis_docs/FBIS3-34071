This time their criminal hands moved with the evil intention of attempting the assassination of the nation's loved one and the peerless companion of the leader, the popular president, in the sanctuary of the sacred tomb of the beloved Imam. Since the revolution and its move are divinely supported and guaranteed by the Imam of the Age, may God expedite his advent, by God's grace and power, once again the efforts of the conspirators were ineffective, and shouts of greetings to Hashemi and death to the hypocrites were the nation's crushing reply to that incident. The Muslim nation of Iran will hold prayer services in all the mosques after tomorrow night's evening prayers as thanksgiving for the wellbeing of their beloved president, as well as to ask for a long life for the exalted leader of the Islamic revolution.
