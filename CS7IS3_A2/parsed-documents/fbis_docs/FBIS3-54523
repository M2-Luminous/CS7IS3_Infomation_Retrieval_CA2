Among these parties is Hizballah. Both at home and abroad, Hizballah is widely seen as one party that is more likely than others to do some rethinking. Hizballah's regional and domestic views link its fate closely to the talks. Hizballah is known for its special links with Iran, a country that aspires to a regional role and sees Lebanon as a major vehicle for that role. According to Hizballah sources, the party has not awaited the convocation of this summit or the resumption of negotiations to redraw its guidelines and rethink its role. Hizballah, thanks to the information it has and the close contact it maintains with Damascus and Tehran, has for a long time prepared its answer to all possibilities involving the talks' success or failure. Hizballah has been getting ready for all the possible outcomes and repercussions of the negotiations ever since they started. Domestically, Hizballah's position continues to be one of general opposition to negotiations and reconciliation with Israel. It will continue to maintain this position. What changed is the method of confrontation it will follow depending on whether the negotiations succeed or fail. If the negotiations succeed, Lebanon will, naturally, sign a peace agreement with Israel. In this case, Hizballah will oppose any agreement before Israel withdraws completely from Lebanon. If Israel withdraws before reaching such an agreement, Hizballah will consider this withdrawal a victory for the resistance. Subsequently, Hizballah will examine ways of adjusting to the coming phase and its regional implications. If the signing of the peace agreement with Israel takes place before Israel's withdrawal, Hizballah will fight this agreement and seek to annul it. In this context, well-informed sources say that Hizballah has told senior security officials that it is opposed to any peace agreement reached before an Israeli withdrawal. Hizballah's Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah has met with security officials and told them in no uncertain terms that "if someone tries to shed our blood, ours will not be the only blood shed." According to the same sources, if the negotiations fail to produce positive results, Hizballah will continue its course of armed resistance. It has taken all precautions and preparations to continue the confrontation. According to reliable information obtained by AL-SHIRA', the decision to continue the military confrontation, pending the outcome of the negotiations, is divided into two parts: The first is to introduce internal changes and the second is to rehabilitate all Hizballah elements militarily. Regarding the first part, the two visits paid by Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah to Tehran in the past few months resulted in several agreements designed to bring about better control of the party's various political, security, and social departments. One important result of these two visits was a decision to strengthen the security and political departments, confine them in the hands of Nasrallah, and eliminate all departments subservient to Iranian officials. For this purpose, a special bureau has been established under the control of Nasrallah. The bureau will coordinate in advance all military and security operations and seek Nasrallah's approval of them. Consequently, 'Abd-al-Hadi Hammadi has given up his security responsibilities within the party. Hizballah has also focused its activity on the south at the expense of its presence in other areas. It has given priority to the south on all levels, especially in the field of services and in implementation of the secret resolutions of a conference it held seven months ago. The conference was then unofficially coined the "South Conference." Regarding the second part, namely military rehabilitation, in the past three months Hizballah has retrained all its full-time and part-time elements. It has retrained 10,000 full-time fighters in several classes held in al-Hirmil and nearby areas. The training took place under the supervision of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Long courses, some lasting over two months, were held for cadres, military officials, and others in Tehran. The part-timers who are able to fight have undergone 10-day training courses. About 6,000 part-timers have taken part in these courses. If Hizballah has reviewed its calculations and prepared itself for the coming period, other parties in the Lebanese arena will also find themselves compelled to review their calculations after the Geneva summit. This particularly applies to the parties that have opposed the al-Ta'if accord, as well as the parties that have wagered and still are wagering that international and regional developments will turn the clock back in Lebanon.
