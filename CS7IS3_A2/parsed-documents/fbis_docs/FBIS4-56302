As a result of the agreements between the government and the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity], the Civilian Society Assembly [Asamblea de la Sociedad Civil] was created. UN Moderator Jean Arnault has asked the Guatemalan Bishops Conference to head the coordination of this body, which must discuss and propose positions of consensus to the sides that are holding the talks abroad. [Shetemul] Why has the Bishops Conference decided to name you president of the Civilian Society Assembly? [Quezada] The conference had always said it wanted to assist in the peace process, and the bishops have noticed the sides showed a political commitment when they signed the Overall Agreement on Human Rights and Immediate International Verification [Acuerdo Global de Derechos Humanos y la Verificacion Internacional Immediata] and agreed to establish a timetable for the process. Another reason was the assembly will be convened at the request of the United Nations and the sides, unlike the Permanent Forum for Peace, a unilateral proposal by the government. Pope John Paul II had asked us to help in the reconciliation. [Shetemul] What will be the assembly's purpose? [Quezada] To convene and gather all nongovernment civilian, political, religious, business, mass, and Mayan sectors. We will discuss the substantial topic of the Mexico agreements to reach a consensus and expedite the end of the confrontation. [Shetemul] Wouldn't the diversity of interests involved pose an obstacle to a consensus? [Quezada] It is certainly something which is very difficult and complex. The easiest thing would be not to participate, but I believe taking the risk is worth it. For that reason, the conference has set its conditions to make the assembly effective. One of them is that we will not discuss circumstantial topics, only substantial ones. We will hold the assembly if most sectors participate, and it will last five months. We will avoid the distortion of topics and seek a consensus, but if we do not find it, we can present qualified majority opinions; besides, minorities' opinions will always be present. [Shetemul] What role will you play in the assembly? [Quezada] The assembly president's responsibilities are to moderate the meetings and create the mechanisms to make everybody's participation effective, all within a democratic atmosphere. The president must try to have a group coordinator in every sector to assist him. In the end, when a consensus or opinions are agreed on, he must take them to Mexico for submission to the government and the URNG. Upon returning to the country, he has to report to the assembly the results of the agreements made in Mexico. [Shetemul] What are the topics to be discussed? [Quezada] The resettlement of those uprooted by the armed confrontation, the rights and identification of ethnic groups, the prevalence of civilian authority, and the Army's role in a democratic society, socioeconomic aspects, farming issues, constitutional amendments, and the Law on Electoral and Political Parties. [Shetemul] Those are the same topics up for discussion in Mexico. What decisive role will the assembly play on the peace accord? [Quezada] If the social sectors do not participate, the government and the URNG will make the decisions, regardless of what we, as civilian society, think, meaning we are going to delegate the decisions to eight or 10 people. If we participate and reach a consensus, our opinions will carry a very strong moral weight at the negotiations table. [Shetemul] The Coordinating Committee for Agriculture, Commercial, Financial, and Industrial Associations (Cacif) was opposed to joining the national dialogue in the past. What would happen if it does not participate? [Quezada] When Cacif states whether it will participate, the assembly, not the person presiding over it, will have to decide how to move forward. I personally trust the business sector will understand the need to participate. [Shetemul] Considering there are many similar organizations, what criteria will be employed regarding the sectors' representation? [Quezada] We are talking of legality, representation, and legitimacy. Many institutions do not have legal status, while others have difficulty proving their legitimacy. In sum, the main condition is that they not be outside the law. [Shetemul] What about the groups that lack legal status, such as the Peasants Unity Committee (CUC)? [Quezada] I have not analyzed it specifically, but during the national dialogue such organizations as the CUC participated under the umbrella of the Labor and Popular Action Union (UASP). [Shetemul] Why has the Bishops Conference deemed the government's peace plan unviable, and now that it is working, why has it decided to join the negotiation process? [Quezada] We bishops have always thought the break in negotiations was due to the parties' lack of political resolve, not to the arrangement of the negotiations. This is why the Bishops Conference has decided to withdraw from the process, refusing to participate in the Permanent Forum for Peace, because it was unviable and too broad. In addition, the government unilaterally conceived the 4 October 1993 peace plan. We could not accept it. We had to stay away from the conflicting parties. There is an agreement between the two parties, and it has been specified what the assembly must do. We bishops will cooperate in the process, because it is an evangelical mandate. [Shetemul] The government did not want you to continue in the peace process last year. Do you think it has changed its mind? [Quezada] I know that at least Ramiro de Leon Carpio is glad I have accepted the presidency of the assembly. [Shetemul] Alfonso Cabrera and Rigoberta Menchu will submit alternate peace plans separately. Will their proposal be viable, or are they trying to assume starring roles? [Quezada] I have not talked with Alfonso lately, but I talked with Rigoberta. I understand she will participate in the ecumenical meeting that will take place next week. She will propose a plan, but I do not know what it is. [Shetemul] Menchu is skeptical of a possible signing of a definite peace agreement by the end of the year. [Quezada] I respect her opinion. There is a calendar, however. Should the Civilian Society Assembly be successful, should there be political resolve by the parties to reach an agreement, and should the international community support us, I truly believe peace will be possible by the end of the year. This process is irreversible, but we must think if we want a peace on paper or a sound peace to prevent the emergence of other guerrillas. [Shetemul] Could it be the advancements made are due to international pressure and not to parties' political resolve? [Quezada] I cannot give an opinion from the outside, but it is obvious the international community has indeed helped expedite the process. [Shetemul] The public sectors are saying militarization of the police is a setback for society. Does this situation affect the negotiation process? [Quezada] I am not in the position to say so. I want to steer the vessel toward national consensus. I do not want to waste time on secondary issues that could tangle up an already complicated negotiation. [Shetemul] Could your attitude be interpreted as ignoring reality? [Quezada] I have been commissioned to reach consensus on five issues. In this case, the country's governability is an issue I refuse to discuss, regardless of how important and significant it is. [Shetemul] Is the political system ready for a postwar period? [Quezada] This is an issue the government and the guerrillas will have to address when they discuss the grounds for the URNG to join the country's political arena, but that is another bowl of fish. [Shetemul] When will the assembly begin work? [Quezada] I want the group of sectors to be ready by next week at any rate. This group will address the issue of creating settlements for the uprooted civilian population. We do not want to be late for the May meeting in Mexico. [Shetemul] What will be the financial source of your new task? [Quezada] We already have the necessary infrastructure. I do not want governmental funds. Money will come from friendly countries. [Shetemul] Media reports indicate the guerrilla commanders could attend the next ecumenical meeting. Is that true? [Quezada] No, but I do not dismiss the possibility the guerrilla leadership may send a communique. The U.S. Lutheran, Catholic, and Evangelical Churches are organizing that meeting. We want the people to give their opinions. [Shetemul] Do you still criticize the secrecy of the peace process? [Quezada] Yes. Secrecy is one of the main problems plaguing the peace process, because it prevents the media from being well informed to prevent speculations. In short, the parties have decided to maintain this secrecy, and I only hope the process will continue.
