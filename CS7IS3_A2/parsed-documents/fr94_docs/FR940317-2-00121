SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life. Overall authority for these programs is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended, Public Law 87&hyph;256 (Fulbright-Hays Act). The purpose of the Act is ``to enable the Government of the United States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries; to strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and other nations and thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic and peaceful relations between the United States and the other countries of the world.'' Programs and projects must conform with all Agency requirements and guidelines and are subject to final review by the USIA contracting officer. Overview Through a grant to a non-profit organization in the New York city metropolitan area, USIA seeks programs that would enable self-sponsored international students to experience the United States: Its history, culture, values, policies and lifestyles. Self-sponsored international students should be provided an opportunity to utilize the city's resources productively; and to take an active role in city life. To understand more fully American life and culture, students must be provided the opportunity to become personally involved with and understand ``typical'' American activities such as volunteerism, observance of national and religious holidays, and cultural and sports events. In addition, self-sponsored international students should be encouraged to share their culture and knowledge with American students at all levels. Also important are programs which introduce foreign students to the U.S. government structure, the electoral process, the U.S. economy, business culture and trade issues, environmental protection, the arts and American cultural heritage. A variety of approaches such as workshops, home hospitability, and community outreach programs may be utilized. Enrichment programs should be designed not only to enhance international students' understanding of America's cultural and ethnic diversity, but they should also enable the students to teach Americans their own cultural, ethnic, political, and social diversity, thereby promoting mutual understanding and long-term friendships. This multicultural component can be met by emphasizing interaction_interpersonal, intercultural communication_between students and American citizens.
