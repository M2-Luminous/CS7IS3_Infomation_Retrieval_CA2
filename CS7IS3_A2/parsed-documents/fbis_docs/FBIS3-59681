We must become a prime (prime contractor)." Despite the fact that it is the top brand in the commercial computer industry, Fujitsu has to be content with a humble position behind such outshining contenders as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Electric when it comes to the defense-related business. Fujitsu has been longing for many years for the position of a "prime contractor" because being a prime contractor empowers them to dictate the technology. The dwindling growth rate of the government defense budget has been a hard blow to Fujitsu as well. The total amount of its contract with the Defense Agency for FY93 is expected to be about ¥33 billion. It is a substantial drop from the peak figure of about ¥38 billion (FY91). However, as Norio Nakamura, General Manager of Special Equipment System Div., says, "it's not bad for us that the focus of the defense budget is shifting from the front-line equipment to the rear support elements." With abundant experience in the computer technology, the company can compete more favorably in the field of the rear support elements than the front-line equipment such as fighters and missiles. A typical case is an information communication system called CI (Command Control Communication Intelligence). In FY91, the company successfully attained the prime contractor position when it got the contract to build a nationwide information communication system called "GSDF Command System." The project is to build the nationwide system with the annual budget of several billion yen, starting from the Northern Army located in Hokkaido, where Fujitsu is the leader of a group of subcontractors including Mitsubishi Electric, NEC, Hitachi, Toshiba, and Oki. "The ratio between front-line equipment vs. rear support elements in the contract amounts used to be about 2 to 1 five years ago, but it is now 1 to 2," says Mr. Nakamura. The company is at the valley of the orders for the moment. Although it received an order for the electronic equipment to be borne by P3C antisubmarine patrol airplane, which amounts to ¥500 million per set, it will not continue very long as the implementation of the airplane will be over soon. The project for the equipment of the ground support center for P3C (ASWOC) to be installed at various bases starting with Atsugi and Hachinohe, which amounted to slightly less than ¥3 billion, was finally completed last year when it finished the installation at Iwakuni. The short distance surface-to-air missile (Short SAM) project, in which Fujitsu participated as a vendor for Toshiba, will soon be entering a remodeling period. On the other hand, some optimistic opinions have recently surfaced as exemplified by Mr. Nakamura's comment, "it will be bottoming out soon." The company has accumulated a substantial amount of technology. It recently delivered an electronic warfare performance evaluation system for the F15 interceptor-fighter. This system installed at the Gifu Base of ASDF at the cost of over ¥10 billion is capable of conducting simulated electronic warfare using an F15 hung from the ceiling of a huge hangar. It tests the counteracting capability against the enemy's electronic jamming. The company is planning to propose a modification to enable it to handle the FSX next generation support fighter. The infrared technology is another strong point of this company. Fujitsu is leading the world neck and neck with Mitsubishi Electric in the development of Infrared Charged Couple Device (IRCCD) which is used for detecting the quantity of infrared rays emitted by any object, in other words, the temperature difference. The infrared night vision device using the JRCCD technology it developed is expected to be used on the OHX next generation small size helicopter for GSDF. It is assumed that approximately 180 OHX helicopters will be purchased eventually, so that this infrared night vision device costing about ¥50 million will be a stable source of business for the company. According to a source at the Defense Agency, "the only area where Japanese defense industry can compete against the leading defense industries of the world may be the information software and the cutting edge semiconductor technology." Now that the time where tanks and airplanes are the leading roles is over, the "dark horse" Fujitsu is ready to advance to the front row.
