Also, police in a nearby area arrested two troublemakers, seizing from them an Army pistol and another .38-caliber weapon. Meanwhile, in the Montalban area in northwestern Caracas and on Baralt Avenue in downtown Caracas, students staged two other marches on Monday morning but they did not degenerate into riots. At Candelaria Square in downtown Caracas, about midday today residents blocked traffic to protest the shortage of water, another ill affecting residents of Caracas due to the protracted drought that began late last year. Over the past two weeks, violent student demonstrations have been staged in Caracas and 10 other Venezuelan cities. These demonstrations have resulted in the death of one student amid renewed rumors of a coup d'etat and the bolivar's drastic decline on the parallel market, where it is now selling for 153 units per dollar. Foreseeing an intensification of the disturbances, Defense Minister General Rafael Montero Revette said the Army is prepared to implement the "Avila" and "Sovereignty" plans which would require the militarization of Caracas and the entire country.
