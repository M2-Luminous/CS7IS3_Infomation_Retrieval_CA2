These Are Being Carried Out by Uzbek Militia on the Territory of Sovereign Kazakhstan"] [Text] The international conference on human rights organized by the Russian-American Bureau for Human Rights will start work in Alma-Ata [Almaty] 17 May. But at least two invitees will not be taking part; they are Talib Yakubov and Vasilya Inoyatova, activists of the Uzbek people's movement Birlik. Yakubov was arrested in the apartment of relatives 10 May. Vasilya Inoyatova, whose name is still on many people's lips over last year's trial (she was accused of impugning the honor and dignity of President Karimov by her poetry) was arrested while still on Kazakhstani territory, in the settlment of Chernyayevka, 12 May. The car in which Inoyatova was traveling was stopped by pursuing Zhigulis. Inoyatova and those accompanying her were taken to the city militia administration in Tashkent where they underwent a five-hour interrogation, conducted by Deputy Chief Khudaybergenov. All, except Inoyatova, were released with a warning to sever all links with members of Birlik. Reports about the arrests of Yakubov and Inoyatina came from the U.S. human rights organization Helsinki Watch and the Society for the Defense of Human Rights in Central Asia. After reporting these arrests, human rights campaigners noted that there has recently been a growing number of unlawful actions by the Uzbek militia and special services on the territory of other sovereign states, the authorities of which are taking no serious measures whatsoever. Last year, at the end of a similar conference, Abdumannov Pulatov, the well-known defender of human rights from Uzbekistan, was picked up right in front of the Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] militia. He was saved from prison only thanks to the intervention of human rights workers of many countries, journalists, and statesmen from the United States. The Uzbek writer Yadgar Obid has been beaten up twice in Moscow in the last six months; however, the culprits have not been caught or punished. So what, then, can the participants in the conference in Alma-Ata expect? Will they be able to discuss the theoretical problems connected with human rights or will they in practice have to defend their own rights straightaway, as it were? Yesterday we received a new report: Another two people invited to the conference, Mikhail Ardzinov, deputy chairman of a human rights society, and Mamura Usmanova, chairman of the Society of Free Women, Tumaris, have been arrested in Tashkent.
