Mr Modise said the constituent forces would be returned to their home units in preparation for the integration of all the forces into the South African National Defence Force [SANDF]. He said he was following a recommendation by the National Peacekeeping Force Command Council, which was endorsed by the Transitional Executive Council's sub-council on defence. SANDF Chief Gen Georg Meiring would oversee the demobilisation, Mr Modise said. A passing out parade was being held for NPKF members at the force's Koeberg Base in the Cape, a source at the NPKF said. Force members would also be given certificates of commendation. It was not known whether a similar parade was being held at the NPKF's De Brug base at Bloemfontein. The NPKF was formed in February to help keep peace during the April elections. After its first outing on the East Rand, however, the NPKF was withdrawn to base and not used again. It is understood that about 1,200 NPKF members who came from Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], the armed wing of the African National Congress, would go to the Wallmannstal assembly point north of Pretoria for incorporation into the new National Defence Force. About 2,800 members from the Transkei, Ciskei and Venda Defence Forces will return to their forces of origin until such time as those forces are incorporated into the SANDF. It was not known what would become of the NPKF's commander, Gen Gabriel Ramushwana, formerly head of state and armed forces commander in Venda.
