SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 8, 1993, the Corporation proposed regulations setting forth procedures to be used in requesting access to and responding to requests for Corporation records. See 58 FR 59210. Essentially, the Corporation proposed regulations that provided that all requests for access to Corporation records must be in writing, adequately describe the material sought, and be sent to the Corporation in McLean, Virginia. The proposed regulations delegated to the Freedom of Information Officer authority to make initial determinations concerning requests for access to records, and provided procedures for final Corporation decisions on administrative appeals. The proposed regulations also recited the statutory bases for exemption from disclosure and provided that any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be produced as provided by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (FOIA). The proposed regulations provided a fee structure consistent with the Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget on March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012). The proposed regulations also set forth factors to be considered in determining whether to waive or reduce fees. Consistent with Executive Order 12600 published on June 23, 1987, pertaining to access to certain information submitted to an agency, the proposed regulations provided that, upon receipt of a request for possibly confidential commercial or financial information which may be protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption (b)(4), the Corporation shall notify the submitter and provide an opportunity to comment on possible disclosure. The Corporation did not receive any comments in response to the proposed regulations. The Corporation now adopts 12 CFR part 1402 as a final regulation without any revision.
