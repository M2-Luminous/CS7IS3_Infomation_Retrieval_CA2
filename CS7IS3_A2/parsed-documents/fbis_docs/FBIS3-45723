He also blamed Patten for violating the Memorandum of Understanding on the airport project and delaying the airport's construction. Lu Ping arrived in Shenzhen today and joined members of the economic group of the Preliminary Working Committee in inspecting traffic conditions at the border point in Shenzhen. When answering reporters' questions, Lu Ping said that if Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten discusses with the British Government when to bring the second part of the constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council, this would cause talks to break down completely and the talks would never be reopened. On the airport issue, he said that Patten had blamed the Chinese side for delaying the settlement of the airport issue; in fact, the British side should bear all the blame for such a delay. As long as the British side returns to the path of the Memorandum of Understanding at an early date, the airport issue will be solved instantly. Now, the problem is that Patten has completely violated the Memorandum of Understanding on the airport project, so the blame for the delay can only be put on the British side.
