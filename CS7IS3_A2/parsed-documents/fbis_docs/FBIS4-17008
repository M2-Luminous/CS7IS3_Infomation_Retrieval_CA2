Meeting journalists in Samara, Volga region, on Wednesday, Gaydar said "we have already passed the most crucial phase of the crisis. However, we have yet to do the most important -- assemble mechanisms which could allow the economy not only to survive, but also to develop and grow." Gaydar is in Samara to see if his idea of presidential party has chances of success in Russian regions. He believes it should not be entirely presidential, but must support the president so that he could count on it. The new party will be seeking to reduce budget expenditures, curb inflation, protect the rights of owners and carry out a reasonable tax policy. Gaydar confirmed that his party will move from rhetoric to action and is ready to bear responsibility for all decisions, including unpopular ones. "The present tax rates make economic growth impossible. Cuts in budget expenditures are vital for changing the tax policy. They should be reduced by means of gradual reforms, primarily in the military sphere," Gaydar noted. "We cannot keep the army which in its present form is absolutely incapable and absurdly expensive," he added. In his view, entrepreneurs, the intelligentsia and farmers who were considered "kulaks" in the Soviet past will make up the bulk of the new party. It will support itself by levying membership fees and receiving donations from commercial structures that understand the significance of the new party and are ready to invest in politics.
