He was speaking at a news conference at the Union Buildings after meeting Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas. [Begin De Klerk recording] We think that the anxieties and concerns of the Zulu king and Zulu leaders can be accommodated and our proposals will be aimed at formulating such accommodation. It will require from their side the will to find a compromise and it will require from their side also preparedness to move on very fixed stands on certain issues which have been taken, but I think there's a way out and we are not giving up until the very last moment.
