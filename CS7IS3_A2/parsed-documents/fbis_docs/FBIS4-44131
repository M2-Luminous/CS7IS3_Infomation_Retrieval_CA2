Correspondent Dinos Rodhopoulos reports: [Begin recording] In a statement, New Democracy [ND] stressed that the failure to elect a new European Commission president sealed the conclusion of the Corfu summit and confirmed that the six-month Greek Presidency was a missed opportunity, since it developed into a presidency of simple management and concluded with wishes and vague promises. Government Spokesman Ioannis Venizelos described the ND statement as a monument of ignorance, cheapness, and timidity. He stressed that it was issued even before the conclusions of the EU summit were announced. The spokesman noted that if ND Chairman Miltiadhis Evert had demonstrated an elementary national and European responsibility, he would have at least waited to hear the statements of the state and government leaders and would have heard about the praise for the Greek Presidency, and the developments regarding the election of the new European Commission president due to British Prime Minister John Major's stance. Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras said in Rethimnon that there has been absolutely no progress for our country in the Corfu Summit and that the government waved goodbye to the great opportunity it had to promote its national issues and the problems of the Greek farmers. In a statement, the Greek Communist Party stressed that the Greek Presidency is tremendously and historically responsible for the pan-European sounding of the antilabor raid that was decided in Corfu, noting that all the antipopular, antilabor demands of the multinational capital were approved.
