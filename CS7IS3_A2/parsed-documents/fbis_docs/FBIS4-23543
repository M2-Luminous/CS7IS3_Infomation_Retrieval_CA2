In a statement in Johannesburg the organisation said all interested parties, including the PAC, should be invited to discuss these terms as well as the definition of a political crime before they were finalised. "Of particular concern is the sectarian disqualification of the alleged killers of American student Amy Biehl from amnesty or indemnity," the statement said. According to the PAC, their act was political in the sense that they were involved in a campaign in support of a South African Democratic Teachers Union strike initiated by the African National Congress in the Western Cape. "The trust commission must take into consideration the definition of the enemy by those who purportedly committed violent acts," the statement said.
