Yet Bonn continues to prefer keeping a very low profile in terms of foreign and security policy. German foreign policy suffers from a lack of concept and orientation. One reason for this is that the Foreign Ministry continues to be affected by the fact that under Hans-Dietrich Genscher it used to focus on positions -- both regarding personnel and contents -- many of which have become shaky since 1989 or turned out to be wrong. Only four years ago, it looked as if Bonn had really risen to a real partner at the side of the United States during the two-plus-four process, while, meanwhile, the picture has changed. Not only since the Brussels NATO summit one has the feeling that German foreign policy, particularly in East Europe, is sailing in the tow of the Americans. As far as the Balkans is concerned, UN Security Council members Britain and France can determine what is going on at Germany's doorstep. Bonn has conformed itself to the role of junior partner. Would the same be conceivable in Northern Ireland or in Algeria under reverse circumstances? In view of Germany's recent past, the current conditions in Europe, and international politics, no one will endorse a foreign policy that undertakes actions of its own in East Europe and the rest of the world. The request cannot be: the Germans to the front. [preceding five words in English] Nevertheless, it is necessary for Germany to formulate interests of its own. One dilemma of Germany's current Russia policy is, for example, that the United States has put high stakes on the Moscow card and neglected the remaining East European area. Thus, Germany has been maneuvered into dangerous tracks. After all, the laws of history and geography are valid and they make German politics vulnerable should it turn out wrong one day to exclusively have banked on Gorbachev and, subsequently, Yeltsin. If Germany has learned a lesson from the last century and if there is a moral requirement for Germany, then it is the following: Under all circumstances cooperate as closely as possible with those countries of East Europe to which it has a major historic obligation; first of all, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Germany must not become once again a barrier between West and East, and, thus, a special case in politics. This requirement has been neglected in the past few months. Amid major efforts to include the French into the GATT agreement, Bonn's ostpolitik has been ignored. Along with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, Clinton has taken the initiative here. Although one hears of close coordination with Bonn, one feels very little of it in practical politics. In the 1980's, the politicians travelled too much, whereas now they do not meet often enough. In his European tour, Clinton conspicuously left out Germany. The short previous visit by Vice President Gore to Oggersheim cannot change this fact. Characteristically, the chancellor now has to pay a lightning visit to the United States at the end of the month to compensate for the "canceled meeting." The Balkans conflict has become almost the only reason that West Europeans still meet, while they have achieved nothing there but only pile up flight kilometers and conference hours. As a superpower, the Americans discuss things with Russia while, otherwise, concentrating on domestic policy issues and their neighbors in the Pacific. Clinton met Yeltsin for the first time in Vancouver and received the Pacific Basin neighbors in Seattle. Now there is the danger of civil-war like developments in the neighboring country -- NAFTA partner Mexico -- which might reduce America's interest in East Europe, while Germany can be happy to see the last Russian withdraw by August without the interference of Zhirinovskiy. Under these extraordinarily dramatic circumstances would it not be necessary to finally practice that partnership in leadership, which George Bush offered the Germans in his famous speech in Mainz on 31 May 1989? Bonn is still hesitating, but even the Bundestag election year is no reason to abstain from world politics.
