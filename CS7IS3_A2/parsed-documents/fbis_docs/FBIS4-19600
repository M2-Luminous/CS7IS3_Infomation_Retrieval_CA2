The French defense minister was on a visit to Corsica this Monday [18 April]. He spoke about the situation in Bosnia, in particular in the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, which is besieged by the Bosnian Serbs. The issue of this Muslim enclave -- which was declared a security zone by the United Nations -- has provoked tension among the great powers. Francois said to Christophe Leri that he rejected the idea of a Serb victory: [Leotard] I do not think we can talk of a Serb victory, in any case certainly not of a military victory, when this victory means bombing a hospital and chasing away a civilian population that is disorientated and distraught because of hunger and war. Rather than a military victory, I think that we can talk of a moral defeat, which will have significant consequences in Europe -- which is based on principles that are totally different from those prevailing in Bosnia at the moment: The integrity of borders, the respect of the right of nations to self-determination, the free circulation of people and goods, the rejection of the prevalence of force on right, the freedom of people, the dignity of women and children. All these principles are now totally ignored in Bosnia, also by the Serb forces, and it is only right for the international community to question its means, the efficiency of its action, both judicial and military, and it is obviously facing a genuine test of truth. I hope it will be able to overcome it. [Leri] Mr. Minister of State, what is happening in Gorazde today is a failure for democratic Europe, for the United Nations, and for NATO, isn't it? [Leotard] I did not use all those words, as you know. We have before us something that is a moral defeat, including for Serbia and for those who are involved. What has been called ethnic cleansing, the rejection of others, the will to destroy any others in a geographic and political space, is a moral defeat. Europeans would be well advised to recall the principle that they have used as a basis since 1945, that is to say the opposite of what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the moment, partly because of the Serb side. It is up to the international community to know whether it is still based on the principles that were the basis of the United Nations, and up to the Europeans to know whether it is still based on those that have been at the very root of the construction of the continent, in the West anyway, since the Treaty of Rome. We, the French, have the largest contingent of UN soldiers in that part of the world, and it is our duty to recall that these principles are still alive, that they are still relevant, and our diplomacy, now as well as in the past and in the future, is striving and will strive to have right prevail, the right of the human person and the right of the international community. This is difficult, but we will not give up. [Leri] However, there has been a diplomatic hitch recently because the cease-fire was broken just after it was signed by the Serbs. Isn't that a slap in the face for the United Nations, as I was saying earlier, and also for NATO? [Leotard] This is nothing new. There have been at least 20 or 30 cease-fires since the beginning of the crisis. They were later rejected or held up to ridicule. The truth is that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] officers and forces on the one hand and diplomats on the other must resume with extraordinary patience, negotiations that must lead to peace through negotiations. As we have said on several occasions, there cannot be a military victory by one side over the other in that part of the world. As for the United Nations, the hypothesis of a war against anyone is out. The United Nations is based on acts of law voted through by the Security Council, which is based on permanent members and other nations. May I remind you that these permanent members, including Russia, voted for Resolutions 824 and 836 unanimously. These resolutions provide for the setting up of safe areas. One of these safe areas has just been invaded. The civilian population was chased away or is being chased away. This is a challenge to international law and to the international community. It is up to the latter to question its means, its perspectives, and its judicial tools, and to know whether it intends to maintain this situation where it is held up to ridicule.
