FBIS TRENDS-13JUN94-DPRK-IAEA Pyongyang Declares Withdrawal from IAEA, Warns on Sanctions Pyongyang Declares Withdrawal from IAEA, Warns on Sanctions In a phased response to international moves toward the imposition of UN sanctions on North Korea, Pyongyang has declared that it "will immediately" withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but, apparently, not from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) (KCNA, 13 June). Depicting the withdrawal as a response to the IAEA Board of Governors' 10 June resolution suspending technical assistance to the DPRK and demanding the opening of two suspected nuclear waste sites that Pyongyang insists are "military sites," a 13 June Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement declared that Pyongyang will "hereafter" not be bound by the agency's "rules and resolutions." It also declared that IAEA inspectors now in North Korea "will have nothing to do any further"--a formulation that seems to fall short of announcing their immediate expulsion. The statement indicated that, despite its pullout from the IAEA, Pyongyang does not, so far, consider itself to have withdrawn from the NPT. However, it said that no further nuclear inspections will be allowed until "it has been decided whether we return to the NPT or completely withdraw from it," an implicit threat to ratchet up the crisis further at some future date. In addition, the statement implied that Pyongyang is ready to use other means to further deepen the current crisis, reaffirming Pyongyang's position of equating UN sanctions to a declaration of war, an action, the statement said, Pyongyang would counter with "expanded self-defense measures." The statement also ominously claimed without elaboration that Pyongyang "can" expand "international cooperation" in "the realm of nuclear activities"- -possibly a threat to cooperate with other states of proliferation concern.
