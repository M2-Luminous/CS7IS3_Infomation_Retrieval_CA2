Politicians already are beginning to correct the twists and turns which have occurred during sovereignization of the production sphere, to seek out the ``extremists,'' those who first said ``no'' to a partner and began to build a wall around their own territory. Meanwhile in science (yes, and probably not only in science) the cessation of normal relations among work partners is continuing to be aggravated. It is not what scientists want, but seemingly is occurring by itself by reason of some objective factors. Evidently in the last analysis the same strong factors are operative here as in the economy. And the consequences of this quiet process of calamitous self-isolation may be not less destructive for the growth of scientific potential in the republic and the development of the country as a whole. Accordingly, it is important as quickly as possible to stop the general disintegration of the intellectual sphere of activity before its results become irreversible for us. When Kazakhstan was part of the Union our science was included in the common information pool of the country. The central scientific library of the republic Academy in a centralized system received from Moscow the books and journals published in the USSR and abroad. Now the operation of this system does not extend to us. They explain to us: there are no funds available. In one way or another the flow of scientific information to the republic has been cut off. We have been left without a number of international journals in the English language in the fields of mathematics, physics and other disciplines. Our director then declared: ``Seek out partners, establish contacts with the necessary authors, ask that they send reprints and preprints. You certainly understand that without information we cannot survive! However, money also is needed for maintaining contacts with the respective parties... The other day our institute was visited by a group of Chinese scientists. It was headed by Chou Huan Chao, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This was not the first visit of Chinese colleagues to our institute. Already six years ago applications were finalized for carrying out joint research in different fields of high-energy physics and plans were laid for carrying out joint balloon experiments in the stratosphere. The negotiations ended without results: neither country had the necessary funding and equipment. Nevertheless Kazakh and Chinese physicists found a basis for carrying out joint research -- in third countries. Our scientists and specialists in four major scientific institutions in China (at Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Linfen) and the scientists of other countries with the support of Moscow colleagues are entering into a major international collaboration (cooperation sphere), are studying the interaction among different nuclei and photoemulsion nuclei in a broad energy range. A number of interesting results were obtained and 14 joint studies were published. But Kazakh and Chinese physicists cannot meet and talk in a neighborly way. To be more precise, we cannot. The tenth meeting of participants in this collaboration was held in September 1991 in Wuhan. The scientists of our institute also received an invitation. But they did not go: there was no money for missions abroad. This time invitations to China and proposals for cooperation no longer followed. But, indeed, at the meeting there was discussion of the difficult times that had arrived for fundamental research in some countries... So an outright disgraceful situation has arisen for an independent country: in order to meet with a work colleague who lives right here, not far away, ``over the mountain,'' it is necessary to go to Moscow or await an invitation from Sweden, where the collaboration center is located at Lund. It goes without saying, if the trip is at the expense of the inviting party... And this is not the sole example when the friendly hand of support extended from abroad is not being met with a return handshake on our part. For a long time our institute cooperated with the Physics Institute at Lodz University (Poland). Joint research was carried out, there was an exchange of work results and scientists and plans for the future were laid. In 1991 the Poles proposed that in the spring of the coming year a small working conference be held on ``Simulation, Theory and Experimentation in Cosmic Rays'' at Almaty. And it also was planned that this conference later become traditional, that it acquire a solid international status and that different countries participate. But again everything was cut off due to the lack of money; the Academy at that time (in 1992) did not have 30 thousand rubles for meeting the minimum expenditures on the reception of guests. It was evidently difficult for the Poles to believe this. They broke contacts with us and the traditional protocol on cooperation was not extended. In actuality, what sense does it make to maintain relations with such an incapacitated partner! In search for a solution they say, seek sponsors, involve yourself in commercial activity, organize joint enterprises and companies, and continue scientific work. They cite the example of Japan, where reliance is on practical research carried out by large private companies, or China, where scientists are put on a self-supporting basis. We regard such a recommendation to be fallacious at its very core. And it is strange to hear it from time to time from the ``generals'' of science. At best it is suited for solution of the problems of a limited number of individuals, but not science in general. The fact is that for the time being in the republic there are simply no such large industrial companies which would be in a position to assume a considerable fraction of responsibility for the growth of scientific research and the development of new technologies. Our private entrepreneurial sector only now is beginning to stand on its own legs and is absorbed in its own problems of survival and initial accumulation of resources. It is not up to sponsorship at such a scale as would be necessary for the normal functioning of science. For the time being the government remains the sole ``sponsor'' for science, culture, education, medicine, etc. The market for individual entrepreneurship in our country is extremely limited and specific. It cannot be accepted by all who do not wish to switch suddenly from the good life to trading in computers or selling beverages in the streets. Incidentally, for those not in the know, the heads of the researcher and creative worker are not at all tuned like those of a merchant or broker. Accordingly, to combine business, science and art is difficult for a normal person with a psyche not operating on two frequencies. And finally, and most importantly: perhaps it is not evident that all this feverish individual activity of scientific workers in the search for sponsors, grants and money for acquiring computers and equipment, trips abroad and return reception of visitors has a single result: rapid breakdown of scientific potential. The same as the departure of people for commercial organizations or the ``brain drain'' abroad. And this potential, indeed, has been built up in Kazakhstan over the decades and constitutes a treasure of the republic. And it is of great importance for the movement of people along a civilized development path. Will we select backwardness? The tragic situation in which Kazakh science has found itself, it is believed, is caused not so much by the general economic crisis, which in itself is secondary, as by the mentality of the influential part of society, a systematic undervaluation of that role which science plays in our time, in general, for the intellectual potential of the country, for the growth of the well-being of people and the prospects for its further development. With respect to the number of people involved in intellectual spheres of activity, with respect to the importance for the future development (or degradation) of society, the problem of the fate of science in Kazakhstan is now already acquiring a political ring. Like litmus paper, giving evidence of the course of a reaction in one direction or another, the prolonged neglecting of science indicates a voluntary (or involuntary) choice of a definite variant of the development of events: a choice in the direction of backwardness. In actuality, when Japan after bitter damage in the Second World War went to work on restoration of its economy it also experienced an acute need for money and received material assistance from the outside. And nevertheless it proceeded to a sharp increase in expenditures on fundamental research and development work. During 1948-1949 36.7% of the budget was allocated for these purposes. Because its leadership elected a path of development by increasing the intellectual capabilities of the population and on this basis the mass use of advanced foreign methods and equipment. There's an example of resoluteness and faith in their own capabilities! Against the background of Japan and other countries attaining rapid progress due to an intensification of the intellectual sphere of activity, the slow ``financial'' stifling of science in Kazakhstan is perceived as a sort of act of national suicide. Again and again I want to ask our powers that be: ``Do you need science? If not, it is interesting to know how, relying on what social forces, you intend to ensure the proclaimed strategic development of the republic, the flourishing of the people and growth of its prestige in the world?'' In order to accelerate democratic and market transformations in society there must be profound changes in the consciousness of the people, a radical breaking away from the stereotypes and mentality which have developed. With the present-day psychological mood of society it is difficult for scientists to count on any full recognition of the usefulness of their activity and receive everything which is necessary for carrying it out at a fitting professional level. It seems that in Kazakhstan there is a need for a union of science and politics.
