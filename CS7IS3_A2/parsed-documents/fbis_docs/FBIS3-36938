Prior to it First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets gave a briefing to Russian journalists. [Soskovets] The main thing is to solve the problem of inflation. Credit will be allocated more strictly and we will have to get down to organizing production at the same time. What does that mean? The system of settlements must be adjusted, not in the sense that the budget be used to clear enterprises' reciprocal debts but in the sense of helping those who are linked by a common manufacturing process or production-sharing relationship to find a mutually acceptable method. Pricing policy must be improved. Prices for services, transport, and energy are going to grow, and the government's actions in that area must be understood by all. [Golyayev] Oleg Nikolayevich, I have heard people say that the whole problem of the state's insolvency is down to enterprises and the debts owed by one plant to another or one sector -- subcontractors -- to another. The government, which is failing to draw up a program to regulate relations among enterprises, is guilty. [Soskovets] The problem of nonpayments is a topical one, and here one thing is bound up with another: Enterprises don't have money and consequently the state's pocket is empty. Manufacturers are a prime source of finance for the exchequer. But what are they doing to ensure they get back what they are owed? Nonpayments have always existed, and I know from my own experience that whether an enterprise recovers the money it has earned depends to a large extent on its leader. If you just sit around and wait, you won't get a red cent. The money doesn't disappear, after all, it's there, someone who does not deem it necessary to return it unless he receives a demand has got it in his possesion. Let's take the chain constituted by VAZ [the Volga Automobile Plant], the Lipetsk metallugical combine, Vorkutaugol, and the Lebedinskiy ore-dressing combine. One provides raw materials, another the power supply, a third the sheet metal, and the fourth the actual vehicles. They have reciprocal debts while the Zhiguli is the most popular, if one may put it that way, automobile on sale, but money does not move along the chain. That is to say, there are structures -- commercial or banking -- which find this advantageous. How will the government help here? Under market relations the government does not lay down the law, people have to be accustomed to be self-reliant. I asked the leaders of VAZ: What's the problem? You will understand, they answered: the structures of the stores are such... But who founded LogoVAZ? Make your demands there! You have the same situation with petroleum: There is the well-refinery-gas station chain. The product is in great demand, but there's no money. And what's the government's got to do with this? Yes, it is a taxing, dreary chore prising money out of people, but it has to be done -- links must be forged, otherwise you go bankrupt. [Golyayev] Has the "beefing" about nonpayments within sectors been exaggerated, are there people doing this deliberately? [Soskovets] I'm not in doubt. There are many ways of "wearing down" a debtor -- the tax police, the tax inspectorate, and much else besides. You have to act rather than waiting to hear what the government will say on this score. While people are waiting for a piece of paper from above, there's no knowing where tens of trillions of rubles are fetching up. Many examples of proper market relations could be cited where goods are delivered on time and paid for in full. We have people in this country who understand the market and know how to work and live not just in terms of the present. Unfortunately, the majority ask the state to provide, and if they receive nothing they curse the government for not having organized the system of reciprocal settlements and for consequently being the wrong kind of reformers.
