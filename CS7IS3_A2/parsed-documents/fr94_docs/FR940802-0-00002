ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued proposed rules with respect to the 1994 production adjustment program for wheat on April 6, 1993, and for feed grains on August 5, 1993, which is conducted by the CCC in accordance with the Agricultural Act of 1949 (1949 Act), as amended. This final rule amends the regulations to set forth the following determinations: the Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) percentages for the 1994 crops of wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, and oats will be zero percent; a paid land diversion (PLD) program will not be implemented for the 1994-crop of wheat and feed grains; producers of malting barley must, as a condition of eligibility for feed grain loans, purchases, and payments, comply with requirements of the zero percent ARP for the 1994 crop of barley; and the 1994-crop price support rates per bushel will be $2.58 for wheat, $1.89 for corn, $1.80 for grain sorghum, $1.54 for barley, $0.97 for oats, $1.61 for rye, $4.92 for soybeans, and $0.087 per pound for canola, flaxseed, mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower, and sunflower seed. These actions are required by section 107B, in the case of wheat, section 105B, in the case of feed grains, and section 205, in the case of oilseeds, of the 1949 Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 2, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Final Regulatory Impact Analysis The Final Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this rule and the impact of the implementation of each option is available on request from the above-named individual. Executive Order 12866 This final rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the USDA, it has been determined to be ``economically significant'' because it would have an annual effect on the economy of more than $100 million and would materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof. Budget outlays for 1994-crop deficiency payments are expected to range from $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion for wheat and from $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion for feed grains. This final rule would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; and would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. Federal Assistance Programs The titles and numbers of the Federal Assistance Programs, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to which this rule applies, are as follows: ‚ê£ 1Titles 1Numbers Commodity Loans and Purchases 10.051 Feed Grain Production Stabilization 10.055 Wheat Production Stabilization 10.058 Regulatory Flexibility Act It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is applicable to this final rule because the CCC is required by sections 107B(o) and 105B(o) of the 1949 Act to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to certain provisions of this rule.

Copies of this analysis are available from the above-named individual. Executive Order 12778 This final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this final rule do not preempt State laws, are not retroactive, and do not require the exhaustion of any administrative appeal remedies.

Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

Background This final rule amends 7 CFR parts 1413 and 1421 to set forth determinations of the 1994 production adjustment programs for wheat and feed grains and the 1994 price support rates for wheat, feed grains, and oilseeds. General descriptions of the statutory basis for the 1994 Wheat and Feed Grain Program determinations in this final rule were set forth at 58 FR 17087 (April 6, 1993) and at 58 FR 41641 (August 5, 1993), respectively.
