The newspaper claims it was the victim of a obscure intended set-up, the mastermind and objective of which still have not been identified. The Colombian newspaper admitted that a professional and serious examination of the sources, reconfirmation of the data, and a confrontation with those affected would have unmasked the sources and prevented the publication of false information. El TIEMPO also points out the falsehood of Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff's statements, which gave the information an apparent credibility. The Cuban Government and the highest Colombian authorities promptly and repeatedly denied Havana's involvement with the alleged so-called guerrilla summit. The newspaper goes on to say that the legal editor and the head of the editorial staff have tendered their resignations.
