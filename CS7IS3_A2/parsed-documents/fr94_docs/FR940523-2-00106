FR940523-2-00106 FR940523-2-00059 [Docket No. 15000004, License No. 0373&hyph;70 (CA), EA 93&hyph;201] Richardson X-Ray, Inc., Rancho Dominerey, California, Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalties I Richardson X-Ray, Inc. (Licensee or Richardson) is the holder of Byproduct Material License No. 0373&hyph;70 issued by the State of California. The license authorizes the Licensee to possess and use sealed sources in industrial radiographic exposure devices within the State of California. Pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20 and Richardson's California license, Richardson is authorized to possess and use licensed byproduct materials to perform industrial radiography in Non-Agreement States and areas under exclusive Federal jurisdiction. II An inspection by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was conducted on July 29 and 30, 1993, of the Licensee's activities that were performed in an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction at Vandenburg Air Force Base, California. The results of the inspection determined that the Licensee had not conducted its activities in full compliance with NRC requirements. A written Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties (Notice) was served upon the Licensee by letter dated November 5, 1993. The Notice states the nature of the violations, the provisions of the NRC's requirements that the Licensee had violated, and the amount of the civil penalties proposed for the violations. The Licensee responded to the Notice in a letter dated November 30, 1993. In its response, the Licensee admitted the violations assessed civil penalties, but requested that the proposed civil penalties be remitted based on its corrective actions and its alleged inability to pay the proposed $25,000 civil penalty. III After consideration of the Licensee's response and the statements of fact, explanation, and argument for remission contained therein, the NRC staff has determined, as set forth in the Appendix to this Order, that the Licensee's timely and extensive corrective actions support a $5,000 reduction of the $25,000 civil penalties proposed in the November 5, 1993 Notice, based on mitigation consistent with the Enforcement Policy. IV In view of the foregoing, and pursuant to section 234 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 2282, and 10 CFR 2.205, it is hereby ordered that: The Licensee pay civil penalties in the full amount of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) by check, draft, or money order, payable to the Treasurer of the United States and mailed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, USNRC, Washington, DC 20555. This payment shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order or in accordance with the attached Promissory Note for Payment of the Civil Penalties (Note). If payment is to be in accordance with the attached Note, the Licensee within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order shall submit the signed Note in duplicate to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Mail stop 7H5, Washington, DC 20555. V The Licensee may request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order. A request for a hearing should be clearly marked as a ``Request for an Enforcement Hearing'' and shall be addressed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address and to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, 611 Ryan Plaza Drive, suite 400, Arlington, Texas 76011. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of the hearing. If the Licensee fails to request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order, the provisions of this Order shall be effective without further proceedings. If payment has not been made by that time, the matter may be referred to the Attorney General for collection. In the event the Licensee requests a hearing as provided above, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether, on the basis of the violations admitted by the Licensee, this Order should be sustained. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 13th day of May 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. James Lieberman, Director, Office of Enforcement.
