According to Cristiani, the attacks are in response to the PNC's ongoing battle against organized crime. The president said: With these attacks "criminals are trying to intimidate agents so they abandon the fight," but he warned that both the PNC and the government will continue the war against organized crime with greater vigor. Cristiani made this announcement at noon yesterday, just after he presided over a ceremony to commemorate the Santa Ana centennial, which was officially named a "Heroic City." The government has said authorities "have taken steps to fight the gangs of kidnappers" who have spread terror throughout the Santa Ana region. As was previously reported, gangs of men dressed in olive green and armed with heavy weapons have set up various camps at the base of the Santa Ana volcano and continue to kidnap and extort money from farmers. A self-proclaimed "Commander Oscar" even sent threatening letters announcing the beginning of a new war in this area. According to Cristiani, the PNC has taken note of the complaints and begun investigations, and he added that the Army has begun patrolling the area. Meanwhile, Cristiani also denied external pressure was exerted to reform the Constitution, as some jurists have claimed. According to the president, the reforms being made by the assembly are designed to modernize the state and modify the government's administration, specifically within the Supreme Court of Justice and the Arbitration Court. On the other hand, Dr. Kirio Waldo Salgado, who was consulted yesterday in Santa Ana, believes "the Legislative Assembly is once again making the mistake it made in 1991." Our Constitution is being hastily reformed because of foreign pressure, while national interests are being neglected. Salgado charged that many decisions which hurt the people "are being adopted in a foreign embassy, which is bad." On another subject, President Cristiani said he will meet with his Central American counterparts in San Jose, Costa Rica, on 8 May at President Jose Figueres' inauguration. There they will decide when they will hold the next summit, which Dr. Armando Calderon Sol will probably attend as president of El Salvador.
