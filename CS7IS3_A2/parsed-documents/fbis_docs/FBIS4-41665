Kravchuk gathered the most votes, ITAR-TASS learned from reliable sources. According to Ukrainian political observers, Kravchuk seems to have a good chance of retaining his job. His reelection would ensure stability in Ukraine's foreign and internal policies, maintain the now-noticeable trend towards economic stability, and prevent an outbreak of political conflicts, they say. Kravchuk, 60, began his political career as a Communist Party member. He has admitted that the high point of his career should have been department head in the Ukrainian Communist Party's Central Committee, but fate apparently had different things in store for him. Kravchuk resigned his party membership after the August 1991 coup attempt in Moscow, and was elected president of Ukraine in December of that year with a significant margin of victory over his opponents. Kravchuk started agitating for a postponement of the presidential election early in June, arguing that the absence of a new Ukrainian constitution, the undefined powers and responsibilities of the president, and imperfect structure of the executive branch made it difficult to fairly elect a president. The new session of parliament, however, confirmed its predecessor's judgement, and the electoral campaign entered its final heat. In less than one month Kravchuk visited all the regions in the country, signed an agreement between Ukraine and the European Union on cooperation and partnership, and issued a series of decrees aimed at improving the social and economic situation in the country. His rating grew so much during that period that his competitors were left far behind. The practically-unanimous support of voters in western Ukraine, who christened the president "national-democrat number one," formed the core of Kravchuk's electoral success. Predictions concerning ex-premier Kuchma's fate seem to have been justified as well. Kuchma, 55, stood at the head of the government for 11 months, and now leads the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. His platform revolves around the need for a union with Russia, which is supported by a large percentage of Ukraine's population. Among Kuchma's assets is the support of the factory managers and, the presidential candidate is hoping, their shop workers as well. Political experts have not overlooked Kuchma's minuses either. Under his leadership, the government soon fell under sharp criticism. At that time, Kuchma admitted to reporters that he did not read newspapers, because he did not like everythihg that he saw printed there. When the premier became convinced that he could not manage the state apparatus, he resigned his job. "I do not intend to carry that heavy cross until my death," he declared then. Although he left his post as prime minister, the former industrial boss was far from renouncing political activity altogether. "I am not going to fall out of the orbit of politics or burn up like a meteor" the presidential hopeful announced.
