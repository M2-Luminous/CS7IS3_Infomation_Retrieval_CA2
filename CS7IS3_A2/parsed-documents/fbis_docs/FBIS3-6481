The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: "To enhance the role of the county and remove the gap between town and country and the gap between the working class and the peasantry is a strategic task facing the working-class party and state after the establishment of the socialist system." The author of the article says: The idea, theory and policies set out in the work have displayed a great vitality in promoting socialist rural construction, developing the local economy and improving the people's standard of living. The validity and vitality of the idea and theory on the position and role of the county in socialist construction find expression, first of all, in that the rural base of socialism has been consolidated through the dynamic promotion of the ideological revolution and active efforts to make the party members and other working people revolutionary and assimilate them to the working class. The function and role of the county party committee have been enhanced and ideological education of the working class on the revolutionary and working-class lines has been strengthened, with the result that the party members and other working people are firmly equipped with the revolutionary idea of our party, the socialist idea of chuche, and they take the chuche idea as the guiding principle. Although the imperialists and reactionaries have launched a more vicious political and ideological offensive than ever before to undermine the people's faith in socialism, our agricultural working people firmly trust the party and the leader and are building socialism with might and main, full of confidence and optimism, meeting the challenge of the enemy. The great vitality of the idea and theory on the position and role of the county in socialist construction finds clear expression also in that a great progress has been made in promoting socialist rural construction and removing the gap between town and country. In Korea today the county serves as a centre linking town and country in all spheres of politics, the economy and culture and as the basic unit of guidance and management of agriculture. With the increase of the state's material and technical assistance to the countryside with the county as the base, advanced industrial management and production culture have been introduced widely in rural communities and the gap between industry and agriculture is getting narrower. The great vitality of the idea and theory on the position and role of the county in socialist construction finds another clear expression in that the local economy has been developed comprehensively so as to satisfy the growing material demands of the people and evenly develop all parts of the country. Comprehensive development of the local economy makes it possible to diminish the differences between local areas in economic development by enabling every county to make an effective and rational use of its favorable natural and geographical conditions and production reserves to the maximum. All counties, either in plain areas or in-mountainous areas, have done away with age-old backwardness and taken on new looks, those in-mountainous areas making use of mountains and those in the coastal areas making use of the seas in the development of the local economy. They are now positively contributing to the development of the local economy and the improvement of the people's standard of living.
