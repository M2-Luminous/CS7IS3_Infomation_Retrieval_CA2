The Attorney General's Office (PGR) has not received any reports or evidence about the presence of ETA members in Mexico to promote armed actions from this country. Information obtained at the PGR indicated that if ETA members are found to be operating in the country, the appropriate authorities will investigate the situation. The PGR stated in a communique that neither the Mexican judicial authorities nor Interpol have been asked by any Spanish authority to investigate the presence of members of the separatist organization. Mexico conducts investigations with strict respect for the law, and the authorities do not allow themselves to be swayed by rumors that sometimes only confuse the public. The Spanish newspaper ABC published a report stating that ETA members direct activities of that organization form Mexico and that they have infiltrated various sectors of the Mexican economy.
