[passage omitted] Their party, the Parti Socialiste, held an emergency meeting on Friday evening [21 January]. The party leadership decided not to quit the government, though it did not name successors to the three resigning ministers. According to PS Chairman Philippe Busquin, his party is outraged that the whole affair has been politicized. The party also regrets that their Flemish coalition partners, the Christian Democrat CVP and the Socialist SP, refused to confirm their confidence in the deputy prime minister. Mr. Busquin said the reason the PS is not quitting the government is primarily due to concerns about the social security system. The PS feels the system may be destroyed, and it wants to protect it from within the government. Meanwhile, it has emerged that the anonymous witness in the Agusta corruption scandal is Mr. Philippe Moreau, who is also a member of the Francophone Socialist Party. The witness was identified yesterday by Mr. Coeme himself. Earlier, Philippe Moreau had been heard by a magistrate of the Supreme Court. His statements were damaging to both Guy Coeme and Guy Spitaels, but less so than it was assumed at first. Mr. Moreau did confirm that his two party colleagues told him personally that Agusta was prepared to pay a bribe in order to win the helicopter contract, but he denied that Mr. Spitaels and Mr. Coeme sent a courier to Luxembourg to collect the money.
