Police moved into position outside the home of Chen Zihua, sister of released political prisoner Chen Ziming, early on Friday [27 May ] morning, hours after US President Bill Clinton announced that he was severing the link between human rights and MFN renewal. A police car and six uniformed officers remained in position until 2 am, closely monitoring the family's activities. It was the first time Chen's family had been put under surveillance since the National Peoples' Congress met in Beijing in March. Chen was released two weeks ago on medical parole after serving nearly five years of a 13-year sentence, in a move seen as concession to the Clinton administration in order to win MFN renewal. However, Chen was not allowed to return home and was forced instead to leave Beijing with his wife and parents. He is not expected to return until after the fifth anniversary of the June 4 crackdown.
