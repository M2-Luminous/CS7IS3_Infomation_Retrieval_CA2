It is highly unlikely that Clinton will take this advise although the developments in the war-ravaged ex-Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have reached a critical point. Everything happening there in the past few weeks is linked to the United States. In Bosnia an "American peace" is being negotiated, U.S. bombs are being dropped and the American war diplomacy has claimed its first victims. In Bosnia Washington has become lost in the maze of its own Balkan policy which it is trying to implement in keeping with the principles of its own new international order. Over the past couple of years the Americans changed their stands on the Yugoslav crisis so many times that now it is hard to say exactly what they want in Bosnia and how they envisage the "new Balkans." Clinton's operation for imposing a peace in Bosnia which is being separately carried out with the Moslems and Croats, faces a total defeat. The Gorazde bombs have not only failed to return the Serbs to the negotiating table, but have rendered this almost impossible. Everyone is now asking only one question: What will be Washington's next move. The answer will depend on whether and to what extent Clinton is aware that the U.S. involvement in the Bosnian war could well cause its escalation from the Balkans. The U.S. President could also apply the already present views in Washington that the several bombs dropped on Gorazde were insufficient and that new air strikes are required. The Europeans hope that the U.S. leaders will finally become aware that they have been licked in Bosnia and that the situation there is so serious and complex that it cannot be resolved by a few bombs, even on condition that they hit the designated targets and are not duds. A positive sign that such a more realistic policy could prevail is the sudden appearence in Bosnia of the co-chairmen of the international conference on ex-Yugoslavia, Lord David Owen and Thorwald Stoltenberg. This could mean that Washington has come to the conclusion that it will have to ask its European allies to help it pull the chesnuts out of the Bosnian fire. The Europeans have much experience in this because they have also been too hasty and were defeated in Bosnia. In 1993 they finally concluded that there is only one solution: to divide the three warring sides in Bosnia in the same way as the disintegration of their former country -- Yugoslavia.
