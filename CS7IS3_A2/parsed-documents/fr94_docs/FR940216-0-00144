In order that the fuel parameter values obtained with Method 3-type data adequately represent the 1990 values of those parameters, EPA proposed that the refiner must provide detailed documentation of its 1990 and post-1990 refinery operations, including comparing 1990 and post-1990 operations, intermediates and products, and other aspects of refinery operations which would cause its post-1990 gasoline to differ from its 1990 gasoline. For instance, if post-1991 data is used, appropriate adjustments must be made for the refinery operational changes that occurred due to the 1992 volatility rules and the oxygenated fuels program, two situations which could cause post-1990 operations to differ from 1990 operations. The required documentation will assist the baseline auditor in its verification and EPA in its review of the refiner's baseline submission. This provision is being promulgated as proposed. EPA proposed to allow post-1990 gasoline data to be used to estimate 1990 baseline parameters under certain circumstances. In addition to requiring the same detailed documentation of 1990 and post-1990 operations as above, in the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA specified that the volumetric fraction of each blendstock in post-1990 gasoline must be within ten (10.0) percent of the volumetric fraction of the same blendstock in 1990 gasoline. For example, if a refiner's 1990 gasoline contained 30 volume percent reformate, post-1990 gasoline data may be used in the baseline determination as long as it contained 27.0&hyph;33.0 volume percent reformate and provided all other blendstocks also conformed to these requirements. EPA received many comments stating that the use of post-1990 gasoline data was more accurate, and less costly, than using post-1990 blendstock data. EPA agrees, and is allowing the use of gasoline data under certain circumstances, as discussed below. Commenters also suggested that verification of differences and similarities between 1990 and post-1990 operations and the resulting gasoline should be left to the baseline auditor rather than compared to specific criteria. While the auditor will verify the comparison of 1990 and post-1990 operations, etc., all issues verified by the auditor will also be reviewed by EPA. In addition to the technical reasons discussed below, specifying such criteria (i.e., the ``10 percent'' criterion) will ensure the uniformity of both auditor and EPA evaluations and verifications. As discussed in the RIA, unless post-1990 blendstock fractions are sufficiently similar to 1990 blendstock fractions, adjustments for differences will have to be made at the blendstock level, making any gasoline data moot. Larger differences than 10 percent in large streams such as reformate could affect overall aromatic levels by up to 3 volume percent, which is clearly significant. For smaller streams, however, a 10 percent change could be insignificant. Therefore, EPA is expanding its criteria by allowing post-1990 gasoline blendstocks to meet the larger of (1) the 10 percent criterion, or (2) be within two absolute volume percent of the blendstock volumetric fraction in 1990 gasoline. As discussed in the RIA, this means of utilizing post-1990 gasoline should adequately cover typical fluctuations in both large and small volume blendstocks without unduly sacrificing accuracy. Post-1990 gasoline data for which a single 1990 blendstock does not meet either of the blendstock fraction requirements cannot be used in the baseline determination. However, EPA also received comment that many refiners would not be able to use post-1990 gasoline data, even with the expanded criteria, simply due to butane utilization changes from 1990. Because butane, and thus RVP, were reduced after 1990 due to volatility controls, and because RVP reductions reduce emissions, EPA is exempting butane from the blendstock requirements for using post-1990 gasoline. d. E200 and E300. Although not previously included among the fuel parameters for which baseline values are required to be determined, EPA is now requiring that baseline values be determined for the fuel parameters E200 and E300, the percent evaporated at 200 ○F and 300 ○F, respectively. Although these two fuel parameters replace T50 and T90, respectively, in the complex model, T90 baseline values are still required to be determined for use prior to mandatory complex model use. EPA expects E200 and E300 values to be determined directly from gasoline or blendstock data, even if distillation information has to be regraphed. If such a determination is not possible, E200 and E300 values may be estimated from otherwise acceptable T50 and T90 data using the equations specified in the regulations. Thus, this addition will not void any data collected under the proposed criteria.
