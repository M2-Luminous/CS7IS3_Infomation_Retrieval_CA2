Mr. F.W. de Klerk, leader of the National Party [NP], who (?lifts) its election manifesto this morning. Good evening, Mr. de Klerk. [De Klerk] Good evening, Mr. du Preez. [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, your manifesto calls you the man for justice and peace, and in fact the National Party promises that through its manifesto it will bring peace to South Africa. I'm sure there will be many people who will want to ask you tonight: Why don't you do it now? [De Klerk] Firstly, let me say that the insert which was shown referring to the season of violence ....[changes thought] The season of the violence that we've had up to 1990 indeed was over, and the violence which occurred since then more and more became a violence of a different nature. Before 1990, before the unbanning of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the nation -- ANC Military Wing] and the security forces were killing each other. There was an armed struggle between the ANC [African National Congress], the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] forces, and the security forces of South Africa. We have succeeded in defusing that armed struggle. [Du Preez] But you promise peace now. [De Klerk] Let me just first come to this. The violence which has occurred since has a totally different character. We now have Zulus and Xhosas killing each other. We now have supporters of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC at each other's throats in terms of various findings of the Goldstone Commission. It's a different violence. I kept my promise to end that season of violence. The violence that we now have is of a very complicated nature. There is no quick fix for it. [Du Preez] Yet that's what you promised. [De Klerk] Yes, and that is what we'll get through a proper democratic process. That is what we'll get if all the leaders assume their fair share of responsibility. My supporters are not killing anybody. My supporters are not involved in the burning down of houses. My supporters are not -- on a daily basis at each other's throat in Thokoza and Katlehong. My supporters there are intimidated. I have supporters there. My supporters there are being killed. We need the leaders of the ANC and the IFP to take a much more direct interest in disciplining their supporters as well. But can I just say, with regard to the trouble spots, the government is doing everything in its power. We've just -- with a multiparty agreement -- in conjunction with the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] launched an imaginative initiative on the East Rand which is where so many people were being killed. We're not sitting on our hands. [Du Preez] I see in your manifesto, and I quote you, what you've just said: The National Party does not kill people. The National Party does not threaten people. And again, I'm sure the relatives of Steve Biko, and Dulcie September, and David Webster, and Anton Lubowski would want me to ask you when did you change your mind? When did you stop doing that? [De Klerk] Well, firstly, in some of the instances you are referring to, accusations were made where no proof exists. If at any time in the past and now, and in the future, security forces are involved in breaking the law, it's wrong. And I have without fear -- fearlessly -- ordered full investigation. Where there is evidence we will prosecute. But the National Party of today... [Du Preez, interrupting] But the CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau], we had evidence, we had a commission, we had evidence. [De Klerk] And we had one of the best judges and one of the best prosecutors and they couldn't uncover evidence which really led to prosecution, because people, in as much as they were guilty, apparently covered their tracks so well that there was no evidence, and we live in a civil country. You cannot charge a man without evidence. We cannot go back to the law of the jungle because of rumors, because of even well-founded suspicion. But without evidence in a civilized country where you say we adhere to the rule of law, you wait until you get evidence. [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, let me interrupt you there and say to you that it is my perception that this very fact that you still, and your government still denies the existence of death squads, the fact that you killed your opponents. I'm talking about your party over the last decade or two, that makes it so difficult for South Africans to forget, to bring up the past every now and again as you object to sometimes? [De Klerk] No, no. [Du Preez] How can people forgive you if the government doesn't even, is not even prepared to say, yes we did it and it was wrong? [De Klerk] No, no I'm sorry, there are policemen in jail because evidence was uncovered, and they've been found guilty. There are members of the SADF [South African Defense Force] in jail. It is simply just not true to say that we are covering anything up. At the moment, with regard to the death of Goniwe, there is a judicial commission of inquiry, we've put every piece of evidence, we've given them every form of assistance. It is unfair to say that there is any effort on our side to cover up. But can I come back, you say when did we change. There was war at a certain stage. Certain things were done which fell outside the scope of a war. Certain things were done which fell within the scope of a war. But that war has ended because of our initiatives, because we became a new National Party, because we scrapped apartheid, because we removed the cause for the struggle, because we freed the people, because we repealed all legislation with regard to discrimination. And that new National Party is not involved in violence whatsoever. That new National Party has freed also the security forces from being used as political instruments. The first thing I did when I became president, in the first three months I called together the top management of both the police and the SADF and said never again will you be asked to act as a political instrument, you are there to safeguard the lives and property of all South Africans. [Du Preez] And do you think black South Africans find this credible? Is it not your perception that most black South Africans, especially those in the opposition in the past years, still firmly believe that those of them who had been killed, and poisoned, and whatever, had been done by state death squads and not by some unknown force. Who killed all these people? [De Klerk] Yes, obviously, obviously many people, including I, would like to get the real facts. And I have nothing against crime committed in the past being uncovered. But if we were constantly to dwell on the past in trying to prepare for the future, if I were to constantly say I cannot trust the ANC because they planted the Pretoria bomb in which so many people were killed, because Mr. McBride killed innocent bystanders by putting a bomb in a supermarket then where would we be.... [Du Preez, interrupting] But they admitted. You don't you say you need evidence? [De Klerk] No, but this election that we're talking about tonight is about the future. It is about what people now say and now do. I have publicly said that in as much as in the past, people have been hurt, their dignity have been impaired, people became the prey of deeds and action which brought about hurt and damage, we are sorry. [Du Preez] Would you reopen the Biko inquest? [De Klerk] If there is sufficient evidence, yes. [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, let's move on. Analysts find it significant that you've now lately been reviving the red danger, the communist danger. At your conference again you spoke about that. When you demonize your opponents so much in this campaign, do you keep in mind that in May you will sit with those very people in a coalition government, in a government of national unity? When you've demonized them so much, would it not impair a new government? [De Klerk] Before I reply directly, let me just say Mr. Mandela will have to sit with me, a man he accuses of not caring for black lives, a man he accuses of not caring. So in an election, politics isn't for sissies. In an election -- a free and fair election -- you focus on your opponents weaknesses, and it is a tremendous weakness of the ANC that it remains in alliance with a totally discredited ideology. [Du Preez] But are you really scared of communism? Isn't it dead? [De Klerk] No, I'm not scared of communism, otherwise I wouldn't have unbanned the SACP [South African Communist Party]. I think that on their own the SA Communist Party is worth nothing. They are a pushover. But I think, that the fact that so many prominent SA communists are sitting in high power positions in the ANC makes them dangerous, and therefore my attack is upon the alliance, and I say that the African National Congress needs to distance itself from communism as the whole world has done, and even the ex-communists have done. And while these people remain there, it makes the ANC an extremely dangerous party because those communists, according to their own publication, have a hidden agenda. [Du Preez] Let's move back to violence for a minute. It is safe to say that our election will not be violence-free. In your opinion, how much violence can we tolerate on those few days as to not jeopardize the legitimacy of that election? And jointly with that, can we have that if Inkatha and Volksfront [National Front] do not take part? [De Klerk] Let me deal with the first question first. It will depend on how widespread it is, on how serious it is. If it is localized to a few localities then the Independent Electoral Commission has sufficient powers to isolate those areas in a certain sense of the word, and to declare the rest of the election free and fair and not to let those votes count. If it is widespread, then it will be the duty of the Independent Electoral Commission to say that the elections haven't been free and fair, and they have the power to declare it null and void. I hope that we can avoid it. I believe that yes, while it won't be totally violence-free, I think that if everybody does their job from now until the 27th of April -- all the mechanisms which we have created, all the political leaders who participate, then we can assure, and especially the TEC by the way. We can assure that it will be free and fair. If all... [Du Preez, interrupting] What about an Angolan option if Inkatha and Volksfront do not take part? [De Klerk] Inkatha and the Volksfront together still represent, although a significant minority, but a very clear minority. Definitely more than 80 percent of all the people in South Africa want this election to take place, they want it to succeed, they are committed, and they want to participate in it. We cannot allow a minority to stop the train of history, to stop the course of events. We cannot allow a minority to hold the whole country, which wants this election to take place, to ransom. And therefore if there is such a boycott, we'll have to manage it. If it is peaceful, that is for them a democratic option although I think a very short-sighted one to exercise. If, however, it is not a passive boycott, but if it becomes undermining, if it becomes violence related, then we'll have to act very firmly and ensure that that minority and those who participate in violence will not succeed in upsetting what this country needs and wants. [Du Preez] Let's go to your election manifesto. Like the other parties, you offer jobs and houses and education and health care and whatever. But isn't also true that your government has been in power for 46 years. Why do you promise them no we don't have those things. Can you with credibility promise those things if you haven't delivered in 46 years? [De Klerk] But can I take you on a trip to show you what we have delivered? [Du Preez) A very short one. [De Klerk] No, it will be a very long trip. For years we've been building one new school per school day. Some of them have been burned down, some of the have been burned down by whom? For years we've been successfully making good progress with regard to housing. Who stopped to a certain extent housing in the past two years? The boycotts ordered by the civics, the ANC Youth League. Who is responsible for the breakdown in the continuance of those programs? The disruptions caused in the townships under the leadership of ANC surrogates. We have money which we could have spent in the past years on housing, but because of the unrest created by ANC-related organizations, we couldn't spend it. We made two and a half thousand million rands available for housing and through sabotage and putting up stumbling blocks, not all of that money could've been spent. The ANC has robbed the townships of thousands and thousands of houses. The boycotts frightened off the private sector. We had a successful scheme going where the private sector started financing housing on a grand scale, when they stopped paying their installments all private sector involved in investment stopped. The ANC.... [Du Preez, interrupting] But you're talking about the resistance that started because of.... [De Klerk, interrupting] Now I'm saying we have a proud track record of -- even under apartheid -- of doing much with regard to improvement of health care, improvement of education, improvement of this, that, and the other. Under sanctions, in a period when as a result of sanctions, as well as a result of extraneous factors such as the heaviest drought, the drop in the gold price, a world recession, funds were scarce. Now that we've had good rains, the sanctions are gone, the world economy is slowly starting to pick up, the future is rosy. If we can get investment we'll have more jobs, government income will increase, and in an economically healthy way we will be able to expand more on more imaginative development projects. So, our promise we can make good. But the fundamental difference is whose economic policy will generate the growth. We make the same promises than the ANC, but the difference is that with their economic policy there won't be foreign investment. With their economic policy there will be further capital outflow as there now is as result of the regular wild statements which they make. With our economic policy we will attract the investment, and therefore we will be able to make good on our promises. [Du Preez] Can I quickly take you to one other field before we take an ad [advertisement] break. Corruption in the government over the last 15 years has been of the greatest on the continent. Some of the ministers have even been jailed, what guarantee do we have now that if we vote for your party we won't see a repeat of National Party corruption? [De Klerk] Well, firstly most of the corruption that you refer to in the later years occurred in basically two of the self- governing states. The chief ministers of those two self-governing states are now on the candidates list of the ANC. We ordered judicial commissions of inquiry into it. [Du Preez] But I think by referring to homelands you're escaping the fact that a lot of that was in the central government? [De Klerk] Oh no. [Du Preez] We had pictures on Sunday newspaper front pages of toilets in the veld. As I said we have ministers in jail? [De Klerk] But then you must define corruption. That wasn't corrupt to build it. It might have been a misdirected development action. But that's not corruption. Corruption is when money is misused, is under the table allocated to something which wasn't properly authorized, etc, etc. That was a residue of an effort to create development in a place where people didn't want to go. It might have been a mistake, but not corruption. [Du Preez] I think we'll be back. There'll be more after this. [commercial break] [Du Preez] Our guest on Agenda is Mr. de Klerk, leader of the National Party. Mr. de Klerk, a question that I think many people in the world have wanted to ask you, who are interested in South Africa. On February the second, 1990. That speech that we watched earlier. Did you have a fundamental change of heart, or was it a change of strategy because of pressure? [De Klerk] Well, I and the whole National Party had a fundamental change of heart, but it wasn't a Damascus Road experience, that suddenly one morning we stood up and said we've got to change. [Du Preez] Did it happen towards the last year of the P.W. Botha regime? [De Klerk] It was a process which started in the early eighties, and in 1986 we formally held a federal congress and changed our policy and said, we're scrapping separate development. And we held a special election to get a renewed mandate from the white electorate to say we now stand for one united South Africa with an equal vote for all with one citizenship, and with all forms of racial discrimination to be disbanded, and we won it. And I won it again in 1989. What happened on the second of February 1990 is that that change of heart, which took place over the previous four, five, six years, and which we actually formalized, then came together in an action plan to say, we've changed our mind, our heart, now we must start moving and do what we believe in is right for South Africa. That was the beginning of an implementation phase towards working really towards reconciliation, towards bringing peace to South Africa, towards burying the past. [Du Preez] I see a right wing newspaper said General Tienie Groenewald wrote that speech for you. Is that true? [De Klerk] No. It's absolutely untrue. I would like to call my wife as a witness. That speech was written in my own hand, at my own desk, in my own home and if I remember correctly one evening at a dining room table. That speech was my product, but it was also the product of a bosberaad [bush summit], a previous think tank meeting with my whole cabinet, with our advisers... [Du Preez, interrupting] Do you still have that speech? Is it framed, or is it somewhere? [De Klerk] I am not sentimental about such things. I haven't framed it, but it must be around somewhere. [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk you are a boerseun [farm lad] with deep roots in the Western Transvaal. When you're walking in the fields and you take the soil and you feel it between your fingers, what does your heart tell you? Whose soil is that? [De Klerk] When I do that my dominant emotion is I love this country, this beautiful country, and yes, I say that country belongs to all its people. I'm an Afrikaner. My forebears, and yours, unless they remained in the Cape... [Du Preez, interrupting] Hulle was ook Doppers [preceding four words in Afrikaans -- they were also members of the Reformed Church] [De Klerk, continuing] ...fought the first anti-colonial freedom war on African soil in modern history. I am an African. I am not a European. You are an African, and this country, we say, we must share with all of us who live here, who will die here, and whose children will live here. [Du Preez] Talking about Doppers, they are different from the rest of us. Doppers -- from the Reformed Church, for those who do not know -- are supposed to be more puritan and more honest than the rest of us, Afrikaners, I mean. What has this Gereformeerde -- this reformed tradition, what has it meant in your political style, in your political thinking? [De Klerk] Well, firstly, inasmuch as Doppers might have that image, I think it's a wrong image, and if Doppers think themselves better than others, then it is a very, very grave sin that they are committing. I don't think they are better than anybody else. But yes, theologically speaking... [Du Preez, interrupting] They have a no nonsense approach? [De Klerk] ...they are relatively puritan. [Du Preez] Yes. [De Klerk] Politically speaking, they have always been verlig [enlightened]. It has had a tremendous influence on me. I studied at the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education which says that you must look at science, at everything, in the light of the word of God, and it had a tremendous influence on my whole outlook on life. It has taught me, whenever I have to tackle even a practical problem, to ask what is the principle involved. [Du Preez] You are also a man with a sense of history, and I remember reading some day long ago, that you are a great admirer of General Koos de la Rey [words indistinct] coincidentally. Does that not mean that you have a real deep understanding of the fears and the anger of the white right wing at the moment? [De Klerk] Oh yes. I have a deep understanding. I have a very deep understanding of it, and I know that there are many, many people in that camp at the moment who are genuine people, who are God-fearing South Africans and Afrikaners, and who are agonizing, and I am going out of my way to try and convince them that there is a way, that they must turn away from the cul de sac into which they are moving, that it is wrong to become emotional and adhere to a policy which cannot work or succeed in practice. But the ultra radicals there who are planning violence, I ask them to also go back in history and to know that from 1910 onward at least twice there were efforts by Afrikaners to, through violence, try and achieve their ideals. It never worked. [Du Preez] But you.... [De Klerk, interrupting] We got our republic through constitutional means, not the OB [Ossewa Brandwag -- Ox wagon Guard], not the Gryshemde [Gray Shirts], not the Stormjaers [Storm Riders], not General de Wet in the 1914 rebellion. But those who said -- I will use whatever constitutional opportunity I get to advance my cause -- they had success in South African, in Afrikaans political history. [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk can I ask you a very straightforward, almost intimate question? Is there in your heart, or your mind somewhere, a small bit that wants a volkstaat [homeland] for the Afrikaner? [De Klerk] No. Nowhere. In the sense that I am convinced it is not achievable, in my heart I want the Afrikaner nation, together with the Zulu nation, together with the Xhoza nation, together with any other nation which has a sense of pride in its history, in its traditions, which is proud of its language, to have room and space in South Africa to maintain that which is dear to it, to be sure, to have security that they won't be suppressed by anybody else. But I believe that the Afrikaner nation and all other nations can only survive in South Africa, and can only have a proud existence in South Africa if they find a way in which to coexist peacefully. [Du Preez] Do you think General Constand Viljoen is a man of integrity? [De Klerk] I think that he is a man of integrity, and I think that he has reached a moment of truth, because his integrity has to a great extent been rejected at that congress where he was shouted down. He said there, he opened a way, he indicated a direction which could be followed. If he believes in that, I think he must stand up and give a lead that that direction must be followed. [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, let's move on and away from the right wing. South Africans and the world have seen you and Mr. Nelson Mandela as partners, as a team that brought us where we are now. What is it that you have in common with Nelson Mandela? [De Klerk] I think we have in common a commitment that through negotiation, and continued negotiation -- because after the election we'll have once again a constant negotiation situation -- we'll have to find ways and means of fully ending conflict and of breaking through to a form of cooperation in the best interests of all the people. There is much which divides us but I think we have that in common that we want a peaceful solution. What I'm dissatisfied with, because I don't question his integrity, is his lack of action against the wild elements in his party and in his movement. [Du Preez] Mr. de Klerk, you are sitting in the voorkamer [sitting room] of the home of Mrs. Gladys Tshabalala and her family in Zone 13 Katlehong. She says to you I want to vote. You have exactly two minutes to tell her why she should vote for your party. What would you tell her? [De Klerk] I think I will start with the negative and say: You have really a choice between two parties, because she wouldn't be interested in voting CP [Conservative Party], and in all probability she won't be interested in voting IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. If she discusses the IFP with me I'll tell her it's such a negative party, against anything, not cooperating -- that I wouldn't put my fate in their hands -- and I would tell her that you have a basic choice between the ANC and the National Party, and then I would tell her why I think the ANC is a dangerous party. I would remind her that the ANC ruined her son's education. I would remind her that ANC supporters burned down her sister's house, etcetera, etcetera, and then I would say but why should you vote for me? And I would tell her that the National Party is really a party of peace, that the National Party has constantly in the past four years been the only binding force which kept us on a sane road. It is the only party which never left negotiations. It is the only party which never boycotted. It is the only party with an economic policy which can create jobs for her children because it will attract investment, and I will show her -- my heart -- that I care, that I want to improve her lot and I will ask her to accept that this party is a new party with a vision for the future, that it has buried its past and I will ask her to take my hand. [Du Preez] Unfortunately we will not know what Mrs. Tshabalala is going to say. [De Klerk] We will on the 27 April. [Du Preez] Thank you very much Mr. de Klerk and good night. [De Klerk] Thank you very much.
