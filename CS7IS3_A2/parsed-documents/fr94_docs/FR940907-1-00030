FR940907-1-00030 FR940907-1-00012 (4) Incurred costs shall not include: (i) Any costs that are required under any requirement of this contract (other than the ``COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS (LABOR AND MATERIAL)'' requirement) to be reimbursed or paid by the Government to the Contractor or by the Contractor to the Government other than through an equitable adjustment in the contract price; (ii) Costs incurred by subcontractors or suppliers; (iii) Costs ordinarily capitalized and subject to depreciation or amortization except for the properly depreciated or amortized portion of such costs; (iv) Payments made or amounts payable to subcontractors or suppliers, except for_(A) Completed work, including partial deliveries, to which the Contractor has acquired title; and (B) Work under cost-reimbursement or time-and-material subcontracts to which the Contractor has acquired title. (5) If an overpayment is made relative to this paragraph (f), interest shall be charged at the prevailing per annum rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to Public Law 92&hyph;41, from the date such overpayment is made (date of Government check) until the date the overpayment is fully recovered. (g) Progress payments to subcontractors . Progress payments made by the Contractor to its subcontractors shall be the unliquidated progress payments paid to subcontractors that are mentioned in (b)(1) and (b)(2), if the following conditions are met: (1) The amounts included are limited to the unliquidated remainder of progress payments made. (2) The subcontract or interdivisional order is expected to involve a minimum of approximately six months between the beginning of work and the first delivery, or, if the subcontractor is a small business concern, four months. (3) The terms of the subcontract or interdivisional order concerning progress payments_ (i) Are substantially similar to the terms of this provision or to the clause at FAR 52.232&hyph;16, Progress Payments, for any subcontractor that is a large business concern, or that clause with its Alternate I for any subcontractor that is a small business concern; (ii) Are at least as favorable to the Government as the terms of this requirement; (iii) Are not more favorable to the subcontractor or division than the terms of this requirement are to the Contractor; (iv) Are substantially in conformance with the requirements of paragraph 32.504(e) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and (v) Subordinate all subcontractor rights concerning property to which the Government has title under the subcontract to the Government's right to require delivery of the property to the Government if (A) the Contractor defaults or (B) the subcontractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent. (4) The progress payment rate in the subcontract is the customary rate used by the Contracting Agency, depending on whether the subcontractor is or is not a small business concern. (5) The parties agree concerning any proceeds received by the Government for property to which title has vested in the Government or against which a lien has been placed in favor of the Government under the subcontract terms, that the proceeds shall be applied to reducing any unliquidated progress payments by the Government to the Contractor under this contract. (6) If no unliquidated progress payments to the Contractor remain, but there are unliquidated progress payments that the Contractor has made to any subcontractor, the Contractor shall be subrogated to all the rights the Government obtained through the terms required by this requirement to be in any subcontract, as if all such rights had been assigned and transferred to the Contractor. (7) To facilitate small business participation in subcontracting under this contract, the Contractor agrees to provide progress payments to small business concerns, in conformity with the standards for customary progress payments stated in subpart 32.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Contractor further agrees that the need for such progress payments shall not be considered as a handicap or adverse factor in the award of subcontracts. (h) Retentions . (1) Upon preliminary acceptance of each vessel and upon the submission of properly certified invoices, the Government will pay to the Contractor the amount withheld under paragraph (b) of this requirement in respect of that vessel in excess of (i) a performance reserve in the amount of one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the allocated total contract price for such vessel, or (ii) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), whichever is greater. If at any time it shall appear to the Government that the amount of performance reserve may be insufficient to meet the cost to the Government of finishing any unfinished work under the contract for which the Contractor is responsible, or of correcting defects for which the Contractor is responsible which are discovered prior to preliminary acceptance or during the guaranty period of any vessel, the Government may, in making payments under this requirement, deduct or withhold such additional amounts as it may determine to be necessary to render such reserve adequate; provided , that any additional amounts deducted or withheld on account of defects which are discovered during the guaranty period of the vessel shall not exceed the limit of the Contractor's liability as set forth in the requirement entitled ``LIMITATION OF CONTRACTOR'S LIABILITY FOR CORRECTION OF DEFECTS'', reduced by the amounts of the cost incurred by the Contractor for work on such vessel because of Contractor responsible deficiencies which are discovered during the guaranty period of the vessel.
