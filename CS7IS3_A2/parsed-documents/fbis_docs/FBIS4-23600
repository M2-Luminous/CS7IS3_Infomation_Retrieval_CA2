"Certain powers are definitely coming our way. They are not half as many as we wanted to get," KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose said. He said the first powers would be gazetted on Friday. He referred to these as phase one powers. PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo Sexwale said it was not correct that premiers were up in arms about the delay in receiving powers. He said the first powers allotted to the provinces would be powers that allowed the provinces to set up their administrations. Although the provinces have been assigned certain powers by the constitution, all powers have been temporarily assigned to central government departments. They will be re-assigned to the provinces when the provinces are able to prove that they have the administrative capacity to exercise the powers. The premiers' meeting was attended by Constitutional Development and Provincial Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer and Public Service and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya. Also in attendance were Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo, the Deputy Minister of Constitutional Development Mohammed Valli Moosa and the deputy minister of finance, Alec Erwin. The premiers were given a presentation of the government's white paper on reconstruction and development which acting North West Premier Satish Roopa said had set out structures for the implementation and monitoring of the RDP [Research and Development Program]. According to a statement issued by Mr Meyer and Dr Skweyiya, Mr Naidoo gave an overview of the RDP "with a view to encouraging development planning on provincial and local levels". Many of the objectives of the RDP will be implemented by the provincial governments at local level. Not all the provinces would receive all their powers at the same time, Mr Sexwale said. It depended on their administrative capacity. Eastern Transvaal Premier Mathews Phosa said the provincial powers were "no longer an issue". "They will be given out in phases," he said. The premiers had been satisfied by their meeting. Mr Skweyiya said the assignment of powers "will be based on the responses from the provinces before 17 June, 1994 to submissions made by the public service commission. "The assignment of powers can now start taking place on the assumption that the administrative capacities to assume these powers are in place." The statement said government ministers would visit the provinces over the next fortnight to discuss issues. "A permanent forum between relevant central government ministers and provincial premiers is to be implemented. This forum will meet on a monthly basis," the statement said.
