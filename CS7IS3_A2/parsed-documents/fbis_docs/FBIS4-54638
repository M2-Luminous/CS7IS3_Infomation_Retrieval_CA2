Gabriel Lasku, director of the Northern-Central Regional Agency in Lac, stated that this year the European Union (EU) will provide credits of 3 million ECU to stimulate the transition from small to medium enterprises. Credits of $10-15,000 were granted to small enterprises last year, while this year the credit limit will be raised to $30,000 for medium enterprises. The credits for this year will be distributed to all SME Foundation agencies in Albania in 1994, with more rapid distribution in the second half of the year. The less developed areas, such as those in the far north, will be given preference in the distribution of credits. The number of people to be assisted this year will be greater than the 15 who benefited from the program last year. (Tirana ATA in English 1014 GMT 30 Mar 94) EUROPEAN COMMISSION GRANT: An EU spokesman said that the European Commission has proposed that the European Union grant a financial assistance to Albania and Moldova for economic reform programs. The European Commission proposed 35 million ECU aid for Albania to resettle its balance of payments.

(Tirana ATA in English 1007 GMT 2 Apr 94) ITALIAN JOINT VENTURE: The Albanian-Italian joint venture Sando-Co. was recently set up in Kucove. This joint venture is a result of the cooperation of the Detergent Factory in Kucove and an Italian company located in Milan. Thus, the production of detergents has increased to 800 tonnes per month, compared to 200 tonnes in the previous period, which was due to the lack of raw material and the rise in detergent imports. Fitim Malaj, the Kucove factory's director, told an ATA reporter that "in May this year we expect to have a monthly rise of 300 tonnes. The quality of the material we produce and the price, which is 30-40 percent lower than the imported one, make us hope for the rise." The Italian side will provide other equipment, spare parts, and a large boiler, as well as organizing the sale on the domestic market. (Tirana ATA in English 1020 GMT 3 Apr 94) MERCHANT FLEET SHIPS AUCTIONED: The first eight merchant fleet ships have recently been put on auction. The Durresi, Liria, and Apolonia are among the ships that have been put up for auction. The auction will continue with 11 other ships. The first phase of the ships' privatization will end after the 11 ships are sold. Some six high tonnage ships are expected to be sold in the second phase. The Durresi ships will be privatized based on a recently compiled study that will give priority to the fleet workers. In cases when any of the workers will take possession of a ship, the fleet will guarantee them a one-year term contract, with the right to renewal. (Tirana ATA in English 1022 GMT 3 Apr 94) MODULAR CONSTRUCTION BEGINS: The construction of modular building units has begun in Shkoder on an experimental basis by a joint Albanian-Italian venture. The System- plast factory intends to use a process that will combine two sheets of galvanized steel with a core of thermal insulation. The material for the different size units has been furnished by the Italian partner. The units will be used as kiosks, tourist accommodation, petrol stations, and other purposes. The units produced by the joint venture in Shkoder will compete with imported units due to their comfort and attractive appearance. They are available with excellent lighting and sanitary systems. (Tirana ATA in English 1205 GMT 4 Apr 94) TEXTILE MILL RESUMES PRODUCTION: After a suspension of several months, work has recently resumed in the Textile Mill in Tirana. The mill engineer told ATA that the mill is operating with only one shift, with approximately 1,000 workers. The average salaries the workers are expected to get this year will increase over 30 percent as compared to the average level of payments. The specialists say that the mill has undergone a large scale of amortization. Thus, efforts are being made to establish contacts with various firms for investments in this important project of the textile industry. The mill's privatization process will include its other factories of thread, woolen textiles, velvet, light clothing, and other linen. For many years the mill was named after Stalin, but after the democratic movements in Albania four years ago, its name changed simply into the Textile Mill. (Tirana ATA in English 1015 GMT 10 Apr 94) EGYPTIAN FIRM BEGINS CONSTRUCTION: The Egyptian ambassador in Tirana reported that the powerful Egyptian firm Cato Aromatic will soon start to construct five food factories in Vore, near Tirana. The factories will produce cheese, macaroni, olive oil, and some cosmetics. Cato Aromatic came to Albania a year ago.

(Tirana ATA in English 1202 GMT 13 Apr 94) CELLULAR PHONES: Cellular telephone, one of this century's achievements, will be installed in Albania as well. In an interview with RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE, Minister of Transports and Telecommunications Fatos Bitincka stressed that the cellular telephone will be installed along with the traditional telephone network, thus contributing to a further modernization of telecommunications in Albania. Regarding the tender on the new facility, Mr. Bitincka said that they intend to complete the selection of offers within May or June, thus leaving enough time to work for the installation and install the cellular telephone by the end of 1994 or in early 1995. The number of telephone subscribers ranges from 3,000 to 5,000, but the new system will have greater possibilities to increase the number of subscribers. Both foreign and Albanian firms have so far been registered for the tender. Bitincka stated that the new telephone network is expected to cover 70 percent of the country's territory, giving priority to coastal and touristic areas. (Tirana ATA in English 1019 GMT 14 Apr 94) AUSTRIANS TO RESTRUCTURE BANK: Erbert Stefic, president of one of the biggest Austrian banks, Raiffeisen Zentral Bank, declared before Austrian reporters that this bank will soon carry out a complete restructuring of the Albanian Bank of Agriculture, sources from this bank with its headquarters in Tirana told ATA.

The purpose of the meeting was to acquaint the Italian entrepreneurs with the possibilities of investments in Albania. Dylber Vrioni, governor of the Albanian Bank, took the floor at the meeting and mentioned several good existing priorities, such as the little geographical distance between Albania and Italy, the young age and cheap cost of the labor force, their training and education, and the open and liberal legislation for foreign investors. Mr. Vrioni also mentioned the building industry, transportation, tourism, and agriculture as the most profitable fields for investments. Many Italian entrepreneurs, including representatives from Coca Cola and Siemens, discussed at the meeting. The Siemens representative told those participants that Albania has greater possibilities for Italian investors than any other east European country. Such activities will continue to be held in Bari, Milan, Ancona, and Trieste. (Tirana ATA in English 1025 GMT 14 Apr 94) EU DONATION FOR ENTERPRISES: Founded in 1992, the SME [Small & Medium Enterprises] Foundation supports and encourages free initiative among the Albanian businessmen, who have just started their activity. The foundation, financed by the PHARE PROGRAM [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary], whose member Albania is since 1992, has given credits worth 1.1 million ECU for 152 cases. The EU has approved credits worth 3 million ECU and some 1.5 million ECU as technical assistance to the SME Foundation for the period 1994-1995. The program attaches priority to the manufacturing of goods, small factories, and the transition from small private enterprises to medium ones. So, the goal is to set up a new economic platform, the main part of which is occupied by agro-industry, craftsmanship, and small tourism, thus creating favorable conditions for investors. Some 200 Albanian different enterprises have been created so far. (Tirana ATA in English 1011 GMT 16 Apr 94) ALBANIAN-ITALIAN OIL VENTURE: An agreement has been signed for the creation of an Albanian-Italian joint venture named "Bertoli." Rakip Iljazi, the enterprise's director, told ATA's reporter that the enterprise will start its production in the second six months this year and will mainly produce olive and vegetable oil. Later, it will also produce soaps, apart from the installation of a milk production line. For the Albanian side, the agreement was signed by Minister of Agriculture and Food Hasan Halili and for the Italian side, by Rudolfo Bertoli. (Tirana ATA in English 1012 GMT 18 Apr 94) NUMBER OF VEHICLES INCREASING: Compared with 1992, the number of vehicles circulating in Albania has doubled, while the situation of roads has remained the same or even worse. Based on these facts, the parliament decided to use 70 percent of the income levied from fines on traffic violations to improve the situation in this sector. The growing funds will be used to provide the traffic police with sophisticated means to prevent accidents. (Tirana ATA in English 1204 GMT 19 Apr 94) GLASS FACTORY RESUMES PRODUCTION: The Glass Factory in Kavaje resumed production on 18 April. This was made possible due to the funds provided by the Enterprise Reconstruction Agency, which reconstructed four factory workshops, such as that of glass production, packing, and glass articles for every day use. The factory stopped its production due to old technology on July 1990 and later due to the economical difficulties of the transition period. Work has been going on for several months to make the operation start again. Glass products made in Albania, such as glass windows and articles of every day use, will soon be present in our market. All demands for glass products have so far been met by import and sometimes with high prices.

Along with these imports, local food products, such as fresh meat, sausage, curd, cheese and other products have also been traded. At present, every Tirana citizen consumes on average four times more meat and its by-products, two to three times more cheese, two times more eggs, and 1.7 times more milk than during 1980-1991. The increase of food articles in the market has been accompanied with the increase of the number of shops from 80 to over 220. (Tirana ATA in English 1209 GMT 20 Apr 94) NEW AIRLINE SERVICE: The national company, Albanian Airlines, which has been operating for the past two years, has recently added Bologna to its schedule and will start a new service to Skopje in FYROM before the end of April. Founded as a joint venture with the Austrian company Tyrolean Airlines, Albanian Airlines initiated its service with flights to Zurich, Rome, and Munich. The company has recently concluded an agreement with Delta Airlines, which will enable it to provide services to various U.S. states. The airline's management is mainly Albanian and Canadian, and the fares are favorable for Albanians. Feliks Baci, the company director, said to ATA that "in the future we plan to introduce larger and faster turbo-powered aircraft, and in May we will introduce flights to Istanbul as well." (Tirana ATA in English 1212 GMT 23 Apr 94) FOREIGN TRADE EXPANDING: The economic opening of Albania is evident in the increase and expansion of trade activity with almost all countries in the world. Its export indexes for 1993 amounted to 11.344 billion leks, and the highest level was registered in October last year, to the tune of 1.350 billion leks. The value of imports in the previous year was 58.177 billion leks. If we compare the export of certain products, such as minerals, chemicals, plastic materials and their by-products, it emerges that their value is about 2.5 times lower than the value of the import of the same articles. The export of electricity is worth nearly 492 million leks, that of tobacco about 650 million leks, and the import of cigarettes is about 299 million leks. The export to countries of Eastern Europe was 1,945.383 billion leks, while goods worth 44,577.827 billion leks were exported to European Community member countries.

(Tirana ATA in English 0800 GMT 24 Apr 94) COOPERATION WITH GERMANS: The interest of German companies to invest in Albania has been increasing. Since 1992, many Albanian-German joint ventures have been created in Albania. The "El Frigo," "Transalbania," "Gerberc-Butrint II," "Albania Bau Handel ShPK," "Arta" have an initial capital worth $5.812 million, of which $5.553 million invested by German companies and $259,000 by Albanian companies. The German companies are taking special interest in the energy and mining sectors. Agreements are expected to be signed soon between the Albanian Electroenergy Corporation and the energy company "Preussen Elektra," an affiliate of a major German concern. The Institute of Geo-Sciences of Hannover has allocated a fund of DM35 million for the mine in northern Bulqize, and 85 percent of it has already been furnished. Of great importance for the development of this industry in Albania is the German offer represented by BSE with three partners -- Sachtleben Bergban GmbH, Mannesmann Anlagenban GmbH, and Metallgesellschaft AG -- which have requested cooperation with the Albkrom company as a joint venture, something that will be realized through a tender. (Tirana ATA in English 0804 GMT 24 Apr 94) FOREIGN INTEREST IN BEER PRODUCTION: While the Beer Factory in Tirana has resumed its production after three years of suspension, some well-known foreign firms have presented their cooperation projects to the Albanian Ministry of Agriculture and Food. The foreign firms -- the German "Bramburger," the Italian "Peroni," and the Greek "Pheninger" -- are the first to have presented their cooperation projects and studies. Minister of Agriculture and Food Hasan Halili told ATA that "we have offered these firms cooperation with beer factories in Tirana, Korce, and Vlore (the latter is under construction)." Mr. Halili said that "after examining all the projects, the specialists will decide on the most profitable offer. (Tirana ATA in English 0806 GMT 24 Apr 94) FREIGHTER SERVICE: The Tyrsus freighter of the joint company Duval Line of the Albanian Merchant Fleet and the Italian company Baund began service recently. The freighter will operate from Durres to Vasto, a port in the eastern shore of central Italy, and from Durres to Bari. The freighter is hired and used by an Albanian crew and has a capacity of 600 passengers, 30 trucks, and 48 cars. The 10 freighters sailing from Durres port have belonged to foreign firms so far. For the first time, half of the freighter's income, apart from port taxes and other services, will go to the Albanian side. This company, in competition with other freighters, will operate with low tariffs. (Tirana ATA in English 0814 GMT 25 Apr 94) PRICE OF STEAM: The price of steam will now be set by the productive enterprises themselves. Under a government decision, steam-production enterprises, which are still free of competition in this field, will not be allowed to abuse their power to set the steam price. This right will be given to enterprises with a maximum profit up to 10 percent, fixed by the electro-energy corporation. Specialists state that the liberalization of coal and solar energy prices, the increase in the prices of acid and spare parts, as well as the increase in workers' salaries influence the increase in steam costs. They confirm that the previous prices of steam, set in November 1992, have been at the expense of the Electro-Energy Corporation, which today is unable to meet the development needs with its own resources. The price of technological steam is almost the only price that has not changed since the end of 1992. (Tirana ATA in English 0817 GMT 25 Apr 94) ALBCHROME TO BE JOINT VENTURE: The firms "Buero Fuer Social und Entwicklungsmanagement" from Germany, "Mecolis Corporation," a group of Anglo-American firms, "Fucineti" from Italy, and an Italo- Japanese group are the four firms selected from a tender that the Albchrome Corporation, the only one in this field in Albania, will hold soon for the creation of a joint venture. Authorized sources of this corporation told ATA that, after a careful selection by Albchrome and its U.S. financial, technical, and juridical counselors, the tender envisages re-evaluating the four proposals from the technical, financial, and juridical angles until the end of April. The negotiating group and leading board of the Albchrome Corporation will chose the firm to continue negotiations for the creation of the joint venture. A draft-agreement for the creation of this joint enterprise, which is already drafted by the U.S. counselors and Albchrome specialists, will regulate further negotiations. Hence, a joint venture is expected to be created for the extraction and processing of Albanian chrome, which is renowned in the world market for its quality. (Tirana ATA in English 1001 GMT 25 Apr 94) FLOUR FACTORY RESUMES PRODUCTION: After a four-year suspension due to damage, the Flour Factory in Tirana became active again after one year of reconstruction and reequipment with modern technology. The factory is fitted with Turkish-made Orkimsen machinery. Its equipment cost $1.4 million, and the total value of the factory reconstruction cost 56 million leks, amounts made available from the Albanian state budget. It is assumed that the factory will later work in three shifts, gradually reemploying first 80 and then 120 workers. The factory accomplishes four processes automatically with a daily capacity of 150 tonnes of flour, a production three times higher than before. The high standard production of several kinds of flour is destined for the Bread and Macaroni Factory, as well as private bakeries in the capital and its neighborhood. (Tirana ATA in English 1003 GMT 25 Apr 94) HEALTH SERVICE FUNDS: Saimir Kadiu, director of the Economic Department in the Ministry of Health and Environmental Protection, told ATA that a fund of 4.934 billion leks has been allocated for the health service in 1994. Kadiu said that this budget marks a 35 percent increase compared to last year. Salaries represent 44 percent of this budget, still low if compared to the salaries of the health workers in the developed countries, which represent 70 percent of the budget. In this budget, priority is given to the problem of ensuring medicines, a fund of 534 million leks, representing 35 percent of the budget. With the privatization of pharmacies, demands for medicine were somewhat satisfied, but offers declined because of the very high prices of medicines in relation to the income of the population. The Ministry of Health intends to resolve this social problem, therefore the pharmaceutical network is assumed to be heterogeneous. A fund of 510 million leks has been allocated to the Tirana University Hospital Center. About 58 million leks have been put at the disposal of the Maternity Home of Tirana, 48 million leks to psychiatric hospitals, and 1.3537 billion leks to district hospitals. Another fund of 1.862 billion leks has been allocated for health institutions, out-patient clinics, dental clinics, health centers, children's centers in villages, and the hygienic-epidemiologic sector. A fund of 160 million leks has been allocated to nurseries; a fund of 300 million leks to investments for the necessary health equipment and apparatuses. Kadiu states that taking into account the present needs of the Albanian health service, the budget is not yet sufficient. (Tirana ATA in English 1204 GMT 25 Apr 94)
