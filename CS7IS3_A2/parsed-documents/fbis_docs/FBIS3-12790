Among these conditions is the protection of Palestinian citizens. This letter was conveyed to the Israeli minister last night by the chairman of the EU Council of Ministers, who left Tunisia yesterday, and by the Russian deputy foreign minister, who carried a private message from President Boris Yeltsin for President Yasir 'Arafat. The chairman of the EU Council of Ministers had also met President Yasir 'Arafat. After the meeting, the Israeli foreign minister said he was ready to discuss any new conditions with the PLO provided they did not contradict with the Declaration of Principles. Peres added that some conditions included in the organization's letter, like the release of prisoners, had been met and that other conditions were unclear. Regarding a likely Security Council resolution concerning foreign presence in Gaza and Jericho, Peres said that was possible in accordance with what had been stipulated in one of the Declaration of Principles' clauses, but that presence would not be an alternative to the Palestinian police force, increasing the number of which will be discussed by the two sides.
