"The crime of illegally leaving the country is extremely serious when the attempt is made at this border military zone," Raul Castro said. It is a "provocation, a treacherous act against Cuban national security," and a real "crazy exploit" because of the danger of the mined zones and the presence of numerous forces, from both sides, in the "no man's land" that surrounds the base," Raul Castro said in a statement published today in JUVENTUD REBELDE, a newspaper issued by the Union of Young Communists (UJC). "An incident occurring by chance or deliberately provoked by the enemy in the no-man's land could lead to a conflict of unpredictable proportions," he added in protest of the U.S. attitude, which according to him, encourages the illegal immigration of Cubans. While the United States welcomes illegal Cuban immigrants with open arms, "Haitians fleeing from extreme poverty and bloody repression are stopped on the high seas and are forcefully returned to their martyred country," Raul Castro said. "In order to contain the economic immigration of millions of Mexicans and Central Americans, the Yankees are building a tall, long fence, comparable not only to the Berlin Wall, but also to the ancient Chinese Wall," he went on. JUVENTUD REBELDE did not specify the exact date which the defense minister, who recently toured the eastern part of the country, made that statement. The weekly did say, however, that Raul Castro issued the warning during a visit to the military hospital in Santiago de Cuba (900 km east of Havana), while visiting a young soldier who was seriously injured by a mine in early December in an effort to stop four fugitives from reaching the Guantanamo Base. With the worsening of the economic crisis in Cuba, attempts to illegally leave the country -- particularly by sea -- to go to Florida (United States) have increased from the northern coasts of the archipelago and also from the Caimaneras Region, bordering the Guantanamo Base. [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 1743 GMT on 6 February reports that according to Army Gen. Raul Castro, the illegal departure from the country through the Guantanamo area, where two Armies have been deployed, is very serious and constitutes a provocation, "an act of treason against the national security of our country. [quotation marks as received] Raul Castro, first vice president of the Council of State, accused Washington of encouraging for the past three decades the illegal immigration of Cubans, who according to him, receive exclusive and special treatment in U.S. immigration laws. He recognized, however, that in the past year, during William Clinton's administration, there has been an atmosphere of tranquility on both sides of the U.S. military base, which occupies 117 square kilometers. This Sunday, JUVENTUD REBELDE stated millions could be killed if the "cowboys of the unipolar world" were to fabricate an incident that served as a "pretext" to invading Cuba. "We have the right to be tough in applying sanctions. Those who play around with sacred values cannot go unpunished," the Cuban newspaper stated.]
