The amendment is effective as of the date of issuance. The amendment modified the Technical Specifications by replacing the existing Technical Specifications in their entirety with a new set of Technical Specifications based on NUREG&hyph;1434, ``Improved BWR&hyph;6 Technical Specifications,'' dated September 1992. This amendment was based on the licensee's submittal of October 26, 1993, and supplemented by letters dated April 26, October 31, November 18, and November 28, 1994. The application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published in the Federal Register on April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17800). No request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice. The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to the action and has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement. Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the issuance of the amendment will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 55864, dated November 9, 1994).
