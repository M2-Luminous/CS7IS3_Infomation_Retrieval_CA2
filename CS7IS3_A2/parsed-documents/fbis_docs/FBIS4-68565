In Vienna they signed an agreement on trade-economic cooperation between the two countries. They also okayed another agreement concerning promotion and protection of foreign investments. The delegation from Armenia had a meeting with the minister of transportation and nationalized industry of Austria, during the course of which a draft agreement between the two countries in the area of air communications was discussed. The agreement will make it possible to complete flights in the air space of the two countries, use airports, service aircraft, etc. Thus the airline companies will have a legal basis for concretizing their relations with the corresponding agreements. Delegates from Armenia visited a number of enterprises of the Austrian capital and learned about their activity. Then in the Ministry of Transportation and Nationalization of Industry of Austria, which has jurisdiction over the state enterprises, there was a businesslike discussion of certain mutually advantageous programs. From the Chamber of Commerce, which essentially unites a number of industrial ministries and enterprises and also performs banking functions, an agreement was reached to the effect that the Austrian side would render to Armenia a certain amount of assistance in the matter of training personnel and encouraging investments. The trade-economic and other agreements will undoubtedly help in the development and deepening of Armenian-Austrian cooperation.
