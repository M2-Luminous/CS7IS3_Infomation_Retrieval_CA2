The local press today carries decrees of President Nursultan Nazarbayev aimed at major restructuring of the Republic's ministries and scrapping some of them altogether. The abolished Ministries of Foreign Economic Relations, Industry and Trade will be replaced by one single Ministry of Industry and Trade for purposes "of making a more effective use of the Republic's production potential and meeting market demand, as well as for purposes of entering international economic relations as soon as possible." The Ministry of Transport and Communications will take over from two other abolished ministries, those of transport and communications, which is expected to cut spending on the upkeep of state government bodies and streamline their operations. On the other hand, the Ministry of Energy and Fuel resources is now divided into two ministries, the Ministry of the Oil and Gas Industry and the Ministry of Energy and the Coal Industry to ensure a more effective implementation of the state policy in the use of the republic's fuel and energy potential as a major precondition for accelerating the social and economic development of all of its regions. The chairman of the National Bank is given a more independent status in pursuing the monetary and crediting policy. He will no longer be a member of the cabinet.
