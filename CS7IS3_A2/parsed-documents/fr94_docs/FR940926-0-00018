FR940926-0-00018 FR940926-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Office of the Secretary 32 CFR Part 220 RIN 0790&hyph;AF63 Collection From Third Party Payers of Reasonable Costs of Healthcare Services AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, DoD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule replaces the current method of per diem billings to one based on diagnostic related groups, expands the single outpatient billing category to as many as sixty, and expands the billing for outpatient services to include land ambulance service, air ambulance service and hyperbaric services. This final rule improves billing methods for both inpatient and outpatient care. This expansion creates a greater level of specificity which more accurately reflects the cost of the care provided. In addition, this final rule identifies additional outpatient services for which recovery of costs will be sought. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective on October 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LCDR Patrick Kelly, (703) 756&hyph;8910. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Congress enacted 10 U.S.C. 1095 as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99&hyph;272, ยง2001(a)(1), to permit the Department of Defense to collect from third party payers reasonable inpatient hospital care costs incurred on behalf of most DoD health care beneficiaries. To implement this statute, the Department of Defense issued a proposed rule October 8, 1986, and a final rule September 25, 1987. The final rule has been amended several times since 1987, most recently on September 9, 1992, (57 CFR 41096). That rule changed the unified per diem rate for inpatient care to a set of 12 clinical group per diem rates. It also implemented authority to bill for outpatient services by establishing a single per visit rate for most outpatient services. II. Provisions of the Final Rule A. Inpatient Services In October 1992, the Department of Defense began a transition from the traditional single rate for reimbursement for various healthcare services to multiple rates reflective of the clinical care provided. The multiple rates result in charges that more closely approximate the actual costs of delivering specific categories of medical services, such as surgical care, obstetrical care, pediatric care, etc. The rates are based on the actual costs of rendering healthcare services as reflected in the Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS).
