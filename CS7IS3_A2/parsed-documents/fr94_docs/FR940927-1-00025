Proposed Amendment By letter dated September 9, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. UT&hyph;971). Utah submitted the proposed amendment in response to the required program amendment at 30 CFR 944.16(a). The provision of the Utah Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposes to revise is Utah Administrative Rule (Utah Admin. R.) 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, Confidentiality. Specifically, Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200 by inserting language to specify that the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (Division) will not make information available for public inspection, if the information ``concerns trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating to the competitive rights of the person intending to conduct coal exploration or that the information is confidential under the standards of the Federal Act.'' Utah also proposes to delete language that limited confidential information to information ``classified as being protected, private, or controlled under the Government Records Access and Management Act (GRAMA) or confidential under other applicable State or federal laws, rules, or regulations.''
