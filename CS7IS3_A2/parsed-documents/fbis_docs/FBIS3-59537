It must strengthen ties with Deutsche Telekom. The strategy: new commercial and tariff policies, and diversification into computer services. Is France Telecom doomed to suffer the fate of the dinosaurs? Will the telecommunications operator be able to evolve enough to survive in an environment of turbulent competition? Everywhere in the telecommunications industry, rumors are flying of colossal alliances between public operators, cable operators, and computer builders. Last June, Brussels gave a further push to change in the European communications landscape. Beginning in 1998, all telecommunications services will be open to competition from companies anywhere in the Community. Still basking in the comfort of its virtually untouched monopoly of the domestic market, France Telecom has a big job ahead of it. It must throw off the yoke of its status as a government-controlled corporation, which is a handicap in concluding international alliances and adapting to changing markets. It must also improve responsiveness to demands of a clientele that recognizes its technical prowess but grumbles about its tariffs and marketing approach. Finally, it has yet to prove its strategy of investing in computer services is pertinent and profitable. The challenges are tremendous --but so is the explosive expansion of the market. Open to Competition "It is always more difficult to try to change when all the indicators are positive." Charles Rozmaryn, general manager of France Telecom, points out that the French operator is in fact doing very well just now. In 1992, the French telecommunications market was 180 billion French francs [Fr], plus more than Fr40 billion in investments. France Telecom was responsible for more than 98.5 percent of turnover in services, according to Marc Dandelot, consultant to the government and author of a report on the sector prepared for the minister of industry. But this position of strength in the domestic market is changing. Several years ago, the French mobile telephone market was opened up with the entry of SFR, a subsidiary of Generale des Eaux [General Water Company]. In the local area network [LAN] market, competitors such as BT [British Telecoms], Unisource, Cable & Wireless, and IBM are trying to carve out positions. France Telecom also has a long way to go at the international level. Overseas sales accounted for 15 percent of turnover in 1992 (total turnover was Fr121.5 billion, with 168,000 employees and net profits of Fr3 billion). The approximately Fr5 billion invested outside of France was devoted mostly to purchase of market shares in foreign countries, often in conjunction with privatization processes. Narrowly focused partnerships have also been concluded with the Americans. For example, the French operator is collaborating with US West in promoting Minitel [home terminal of the French telecommunications system], and with Bell South in France's cellular market. But major accords remain to be concluded. In coping with tumultuous change, its first challenge is to revamp its own charter. An initial step was taken in July 1990 with legislation that gave it administrative autonomy vis-a-vis the state. But the degree of autonomy it currently enjoys is sometimes very problematic, as demonstrated by the amount of money it was obliged to inject into the capital of CEA-Industrie and Bull, in which it now holds a 17.7 percent share. The pace of change was accelerated last June when the European Community fixed 1 January 1998 as the date for inaugurating free competition on the voice telephony market, which is responsible for 80 percent of France Telecom's turnover. This is why the government plans next spring to submit legislation to Parliament revising the operator's charter, turning it into a limited-liability company with the state as majority shareholder. Changing the status of employees will be an especially sensitive affair. The sizable mobilization in connection with the 12 October strike was a powerful reminder of that. At the same time as France Telecom is reforming its charter and implementing the necessary rate restructuring, it must also find supports and the partners needed for growth in overseas markets. Deutsche Telekom is currently the keystone of this international push. "Since the creation of Eucom in 1987 as a vehicle for providing value-added services, the presidents of our two enterprises, Marcel Roulet and Helmut Ricke, have met together periodically. Their frequent meetings have generated a feeling of real confidence," says Udo Huck, president of the French subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. In addition to Eucom, the two operators in late 1991 launched Eunetcom (which specializes in LAN outsourcing). A joint subsidiary, Eunetcom has just recently begun to take shape with the naming in September of Claude Olier as general manager. According to Huck, the two parent companies have several good reasons for pursuing their collaboration. First of all, BT, Europe's other major operator, has found an important partner in MCI (United States). Second, AT&T -- by reason of its ambitions and its dual hats, as both operator and integrator --looms as a "dangerous partner." Finally, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are about the same size, though the German firm is slightly larger. "This means our strategic partnership doesn't run the risk that one partner or the other will become dominant," notes the head of Deutsche Telekom in France, adding that their respective spheres of expertise and the distribution of their physical assets on the ground are fairly complementary. This proximity of perspectives gives the two partners grounds for cherishing high hopes for their Eunetcom subsidiary. In the field of outsourcing enterprise networks, a market estimated at between US$3-4 billion, "we are getting in on the ground floor of a field where competition for contracts is very fierce," explains general manager Claude Olier. The company hopes ultimately to carve out a 10 to 15 percent market share, concentrating initially on France and Germany, its natural markets. A contract with IBM was inked in October, and a second big international client is expected to sign with Eunetcom in the near future. In addition to Eunetcom, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are discussing a strengthening of their alliance in the context of the charter restructurings to which both are committed. Marc Dandelot is an enthusiastic advocate of these closer ties. "Interlocked shareholding between the operators is necessary, both to cement their strategic alliance over the longer term and to augment its credibility at the international level -- not only in the eyes of clients, but also with other partners whose cooperation doubtless will be indispensable if we're to achieve the status of a full-service, Europe-wide operator," concludes Michel Hirsch, director of France Telecom's international division. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are thus counting on each other to make their transformations successful. But given the obstacles at the legislative level, problems connected with employee status, and a speeded-up calendar for market deregulation, they cannot afford to slacken in their efforts. Interview with Charles Rozmaryn, general manager of France Telecom, by B. d'Armagnac. "Strengthen Strategic Alliance with Deutsche Telekom" [d'Armagnac] With the market increasingly open, who are your main rivals? [Rozmaryn] When a big call for bids goes out, the contest is between BT-MCI, AT&T, Sita, Deutsche Telekom, and us. International presence is a decisive factor. France Telecom's European implantation, including Transpac, makes us a credible contender. The contracts won by France Telecom group with Europcar and IBM prove that. [d'Armagnac] In France, how will the new entrants change the market? [Rozmaryn] At both the domestic and international level, there are going to be new players in the market. Inevitably, these will be large companies, because large investments are required, and clients need to be dealing with credible interlocutors. [d'Armagnac] How important are your ties with Deutsche Telekom? [Rozmaryn] They are the keystone of our international growth strategy. When we created Eunetcom, that was the only sector where the regulations governing competition permitted us to collaborate. The subsidiary was created in late 1991, in response to a situation which has changed a great deal since then with the decision in Brussels last June to move ahead with European liberalization. The competitive landscape is different now. Thus we and our German colleagues are in the process of re-evaluating the situation as a whole, to strengthen our strategic alliance and broaden considerably the range of activities we will pursue jointly. [d'Armagnac] What is France Telecom's strategy in computer services? [Rozmaryn] France Telecom must be active in this sector, because clients increasingly are demanding full-service providers. So we must be able to work with clients at the level of enterprise applications, and this explains our need for link-ups with service companies. The SSIIs [computer systems and services firms] have access to loci of decision-making and specification-setting that are useful to us. Especially overseas, which is France Telecom's principal target. This for example is what's behind the idea of the partnership with Sema Group. Finally, we have our own computer services company, Telesystemes. FTLIS, our services division, needs to grow, especially in overseas markets. Sema Group's takeover of SKD, the Swedish SSII, is a typical example of the kind of partnership we are seeking. [d'Armagnac] What kind of synergies can there be with Bull, particularly in services? [Rozmaryn] We have acquired an ownership interest in Bull for both historical and financial reasons; our participation is not that of a shareholder truly integrated into the enterprise's overall strategy.
