"Our delegation in Cairo told me Israel was going to allow 10 deportees to come back next week," said Rashid Abu-Shibak. Israel, which has expelled about 1,700 Palestinians since 1967, allowed 49 Palestinians to return to the territories last week. Abu-Shibak was sent back to Gaza by the PLO last week to oversee the handover of official buildings as the Israelis pull-back. Israeli military officials said they were unaware of any decision to allow another group of deportees to return.
