However, hidden unemployment increased at industrial enterprises, particularly those under the Ministry of engineering, MIC [Military Industrial Complex] and conversion. As tentative estimates by the Labor Ministry suggest, about 2,200,000 workers were on unpaid leaves in the first quarter, or 14.2 per cent of the total number of workforce. March's official unemployment rate was stated at 0.35 per cent. However, as independent experts' data, which were made public at the International Conference on Economics in Kiev in late May, suggest, Ukraine's hidden unemployment minimal rate is in excess of 7 million workers. Meanwhile, some 120,000 jobs remain vacant. The State's employment bodies and local authorities are reported as intending to step up implementation of the national and territorial employment programs, which involve, in particular, creation of new jobs at enterprises of all proprietorial forms. However, no one can tell how many of these or how soon they will be created, except 279,100 jobs reserved for citizens certified as unable to compete on par with others on Ukraine's labor market.
