Also 10,000 workers from the state oil company returned today to work after a 24-hour strike. Consuelo Febrero, a leader of the hospital employees, said that during the 72-hour strike specially appointed personnel will take care of the emergency situations in the hospitals. The strikers want higher wages, the release of the union leaders under arrest, and the state hospitals not to be privatized. The workers said that Health Minister Jaime Freundt does not want to listen to their demands, and this is the reason for the strike. In addition about 10,000 workers form the State Petroleum Agency returned to work today after holding a 24-hour strike. According to union leader Miguel Freytas, the workers oppose the selling of the state oil enterprise to a private company, because the enterprise made a profit of $86 million in 1993 and profits may reach $200 million in 1994. The union said it will call for longer strikes, and then for an indefinite general strike, to keep the State Petroleum Agency under state ownership and maintain the labor force of 10,000 workers.
