The sporadic artillery and mortar exchanges between government troops and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) were less intense than on Thursday, which saw the heaviest fighting in Kigali in 10 days, said Abdul Kabia, spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR). Shells fell throughout the night near Amahoro stadium, where several thousand people fleeing the country's ethnic bloodbath have sought refuge, though there were no reported injuries, Kabia said, contacted by telephone. At least 30 patients, wounded survivors of Rwanda's killing fields, died in their beds when shells slammed into the crowded Kigali general hospital Thursday during violent fighting in several city districts. The UN headquarters was also hit though no one was hurt. The United Nations has been trying to broker a ceasefire between majority Hutu government forces and the Tutsi minority-dominated rebel Front before the planned arrival of the new UN troops. UN spokesmen have said they were hoping for a response Friday from the government to UN proposals to establish a neutral zone at the airport, to allow flights to land without hindrance. Despite the battles, the United Nations went ahead with plans to send in thousands of UN peacekeeping reinforcements. According to Kabia, Ghana confirmed that it would send some 500 men to boost its battalion of 800 troops already stationed in Kigali. Negotiations with other countries to bring in equipment needed by the UN peacekeepers are "well advanced," he added without giving details. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali also plans to send special envoy Iqbal Riza from the UN peacekeeping operations department to Kigali to meet with the belligerents to discuss terms of the "new UNAMIR mandate" and try to get their "cooperation," Kabia said without specifying any date.
