Leonid Kravchuk's New Year's Present"] [Text] In his New Year address to Ukrainian citizens, Leonid Kravchuk unexpectedly broached the fairly unexpected idea of holding a referendum on the law on authority. The president explained that the law was designed to put an end to misunderstanding with regard to the separation of powers in Ukraine. Leonid Kravchuk's initiative appears to be a logical continuation of the emerging confrontation between the president and the Ukrainian Supreme Council on the eve of the upcoming parliamentary, and later presidential, elections. While the parliamentarians have already put up with the ineluctability of having to run for reelection, and preparations for the parliamentary elections are in full swing, the Ukrainian president does not appear too enthusiastic about going through a similar process himself. The "party of authority" in Ukraine is unwilling to hold early presidential elections, either, because there is no plausible, serious alternative to Leonid Kravchuk just the same. Given the republic's difficult economic and political situation, however, it is far from certain that Kravchuk is set to achieve an easy victory at the early presidential elections. Therefore, the ruling elite would like to insure itself against possible surprises, but this requires unconventional moves that will be somewhat reminiscent of the way events evolved in Russia: the vote on a new constitution was also proclaimed "an expression of confidence in Boris Yeltsin," hence the question of early presidential elections in Russia fell through by itself. The Ukrainian authorities, however, cannot submit a new constitution to a referendum. This is why they came up with the law on authority, which will boost presidential powers and may turn Ukraine into a presidential republic without making amendments to the country's fundamental law beforehand. Should the referendum be a success, one may interpret it as an expression of citizens' confidence in President Kravchuk and, hence, cancel the early presidential elections after the new deputy corps is already in place. It is not yet clear how the president is going to hold the referendum. Or who will draw up the law on authority: the current parliament or a structure specially appointed for this purpose by the Ukrainian president, and whether the chiefs of the Ukrainian Supreme Council under its chairman, Ivan Plyushch, will be involved in the preparation of the new referendum. If the Supreme Council accepts President Kravchuk's initiative and calls the referendum on the law on authority simultaneously with parliamentary elections, it will, of course, have to draw up the law on its own, and then presidential powers will not be as sweeping as Leonid Kravchuk would wish. Even in this case, however, the adoption of the law on authority would automatically mean an expression of confidence in the president. According to some well-informed sources close to the Ukrainian Supreme Council's chiefs, Ivan Plyushch is unlikely to be willing to strike a deal with Leonid Kravchuk on the referendum, because the Ukrainian parliament speaker, as many other politicians in the republic, would probably like to seize the chance of early presidential elections simply to try his luck or to remind the public of himself as Leonid Kravchuk's possible successor, if not to win.
