However, the Foreign Office says it will study them very carefully with the seriousness they deserve. Other ministries would also study them and only then would a `considered reaction' be given. Giving his preliminary reaction Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M Khan said; "None of the six non-papers really goes into the depth of the issue. We feel that India's position is mainly to raise less important issues to show to the world that we are engaged in negotiations so that pressure by Western countries, governments and public opinion is diverted." The Foreign Secretary said that unlike New Delhi, Pakistan, in its two non-papers, referred to the two crucial issues, i.e, steps for stopping repression in occupied Kashmir and modalities of holding plebiscite. Giving his reactions on the six-non papers one by one Shaharyar M Khan expressed his amazement that proposal on Line of Control (LoC) virtually calls for the acceptance of the status quo on the LoC. "This is not acceptable to Pakistan. This does not refer to the question of repression (on the LoC) which is why there is tension there." The Foreign Secretary felt that if this issue was addressed as if there was no tension at the LoC, then one would have only a `mechanical agreement' thus missing the point altogether. He felt that the three non-papers on Siachen, Wullar Barrage and Sir Creek show that the points on which discussions were left off during the last talks, have not been accurately reflected. These technical issues, he said, had shown progress in the past but the non-papers on the subject do not show this. India's non-paper on confidence-building measures has also greatly disappointed Pakistan which feels that these continue to be `peripheral issues' while the core issue is completely by-passed. Commenting on the `no first strike' policy, the Foreign Secretary said that since Pakistan was not a nuclear power and since it did not possess any nuclear weapon "this was a contradiction". This proposal, he added, asks for something that Pakistan does not possess. In the same area, about increasing the frequency of the two DMOs' [expansion unknown] talk to each other, Mr Khan replied: "I was expecting reference to regional non-proliferation, or the banning of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles." There is agreement on the proposal of joint commissions but the Foreign Secretary added: "It is important to discuss repression in Occupied Kashmir, and the human rights issue. These come first. Things like exchanging table tennis teams and military bands can come later. They are not our top priority."
