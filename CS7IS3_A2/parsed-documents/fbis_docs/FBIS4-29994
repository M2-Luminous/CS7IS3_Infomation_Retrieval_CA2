The protocol designated some areas to conduct agricultural development programs and experimental studies to find proper technical methods in planting crops and raising livestock for commercial purposes. The experimental work will be jointly carried out by the two sides on four locations covering an area of 11 hectares within a period of five years, namely a five-hectare plot at Latsen in Xieng Khouang Province and three plots in Vientiane Province -- a one-hectare plot at the Naphok Seeds Experimental Center, a one-hectare plot at the Hatdokkeo Agricultural Center, and a four-hectare plot at the Salakham Agricultural Promotion Unit. New techniques and rice-planting machines will be used on an experimental basis to raise rice production efficiency up to the level achieved by the DPRK, which is capable of producing between eight to 12 metric tons of paddy per one hectare.
