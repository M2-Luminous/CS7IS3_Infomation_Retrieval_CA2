Regarding the higher courts, there are 249 judges distributed in 20 superior courts. According to experts, the most urgent problems of judicial reform are not at those levels. In fact, according to the new charter and the Judicial Branch Organic Law, the Supreme Court will have less work because it will no longer be the last resort but only a court of cassation. In other words, it will review the request of the party that the process follows the established rules without making judgment on the sentences. The superior courts (court of appeal) will now become the last resort. A judicial branch executive council source said the appeals court does not require so many courts, but rather a high specialization of verdicts. Therefore, the main problem at this level would be the judges' qualification and specialization. Anyway, there is a deficit in solving cases. In 1993, Lima's civil courts did not resolve 25 percent of the cases. Regarding criminal courts, only 10 percent of the cases were unresolved. Also, according to the requests received by the Executive Council for the creation of courts and appeal courts that were not fulfilled, there is a shortage of 25 to 30 percent of judges in the entire country. Shortage of Judges It is at the lower court level where the shortage of judges and the judicial system's bad organization are clearly seen. According to figures provided by the judicial branch personnel directorate, there are 563 lower court judges at the national level among the civil, penal, juvenile, labor, and mixed courts. According to studies by the Inter-American Development Agency (AID) in coordination with Catholic University based on an agreement with the judicial branch, if the existence of 184 provinces in the country is taken into account, and 381 civil, penal, and mixed courts, it can be said that there is an average of two lower courts per province (the main demand for justices is in the criminal and civil courts). Is There a Shortage of Criminal Judges? Of the 381 judges, 187 are criminal judges. If we take as a point of reference the number of inmates who have not received sentences yet, we would conclude that the number of judges is highly insufficient. In the penitentiaries, 75 percent of the inmates are not sentenced. Sometimes they wait several years before they are found innocent. Only 25 percent of the cases are resolved. But there are exceptions: In the Arequipa judicial district, unsentenced inmates reach 50 percent. An investigation should be made to find out why it is more efficient. In a Catholic University poll of Lima criminal judges, the majority said they had from 100 to 2,000 cases, with an average of 550. In answer to a question on how many cases were appropriate for efficient work, an average of 250 was given. If a comparison is made of this alleged ideal number of cases per judge with the average number of cases for each judge, the conclusion is that the number of criminal judges in the lower courts should be at least doubled. The difference found by the poll is also the result of the shift of judges on duty that can lead to corruption, because one filing a lawsuit can choose "his judge." The experts' proposal is to assign a fixed number of judges per shift. This could be changed according to the process' complexity. Effects of Penal Legislation There are factors other than the number of judges. One of them is indiscriminate laws. For example, Congressman Cesar Fernandez Arce maintains that the antidrug trafficking law does not establish any difference between a drug "pusher" and the chief of a drug trafficking gang, consequently crowding prisons in the jungle region. This is why the judicial branch Executive Council has decided to present draft bills reforming the antidrug law and to apply the new Penal Procedural Law in order to reduce the amount of defendants by 75 percent in the whole country. Effects of Informatics The executive branch has implemented a pilot program in the Second Lima Penal Court with the help of U.S. organization AID and the judicial branch. The contrasts were evident the day we visited that courthouse: Unlike other courthouses, there was no crowding of people and there were no mountains of files on the tables. A secretary informed us that the proceedings' computerization has expedited the work because files, decisions, and proceedings are in a computer file. However, the secretary added, given the lack of trained administrative personnel, the secretaries (of which there are two in each court) are the ones responsible for feeding the files into computers, a procedure that overloads them with work. The computerized service's results are nonetheless evident because the average number of sentences issued by Lima courts during 1993 -- according to the Lima Appellate Court -- was 18 per month. In the case of the Second Lima Penal Court it was 36. This result shows that the procedures' computerization can double a judge's productivity. Effects of the New Procedural Law The new Penal Procedural Law takes effect 20 May if its implementation is not suspended again for the fourth time. The main new provision established by this new law is that an inquiry's commencement and procedures, besides the indictment procedures, must be made by the District Attorney's Office. The courts must determine the acquittal or not of the defendants and issue sentences. In other words, the penal courts would be relieved of long inquiries and will pass sentences. According to the current law procedure, in cases of oral trials a penal court commences an inquiry and presents its findings to an upper penal court (second instance). In case of petty crimes, summary trials -- in which the same judge carries out the investigations and issues a sentence -- are held. "It is, therefore, very different to hear an average of 550 trials under the current Penal Procedural Law than to hear them under the new law under which the inquiry is already completed," states legal expert Carlos Rivera from the Institute for the Defense of Law. The Judicial Branch Inquiry Center presided over by Roberto Alvarez believes the number of judges in Lima is enough to apply the new Penal Procedural Law. "The problems, however, will be transferred to the district attorney," Rivera states. It has been learned that the postponement in implementing the new Penal Procedural Law is due to the prosecutors' inability to carry out the new procedural duties. "If the new law were applied all of a sudden all the cases would be delayed because reorganization takes time," Rivera said. Attorney General's Office Will Need More Prosecutors The question now is whether the public prosecutor offices are either prepared or if they have enough personnel to carry out the inquiries. Under the current system the Attorney General's Office must present the charges in defense of the interests of society. In order to comply with this objective, there exist almost 700 public prosecutors assigned according to the amount of lower and upper courts (mainly penal courts) in the judicial branch. Each penal court has one provincial prosecutor. In the case of upper penal courts, there are appellate court prosecutors, who in turn have assistant prosecutors. On top are Supreme Court prosecutors, who are organized according to Supreme Court sections. There are five sections (two penal, two civilian, and one constitutional court); therefore, there are five supreme prosecutors. Fiscal Attorney Influences? Generally speaking, the Attorney General's Office never had problems fulfilling its duty of raising formal charges because it never conducted investigations. In the Peruvian tradition, the majority of crimes handled by the Attorney General's Office have previously been investigated by police precincts or stations. Moreover, attorneys usually do not probe the investigation or contradict what is reported by police. But what will happen when the Attorney General's Office is assigned to conduct the pre-trial inquest as it should be? If we take into account that according to the aforementioned report, 75 percent of penal cases are neglected and (if the procedural law codes are not computerized and amended), it is obvious that the Attorney General's Office will be unable to meet the demand with its current personnel. To clarify this statement we also must take into account the time needed to conduct a pre-trial inquest with the current penal judges and compare the working conditions of the provincial attorney general's offices with that of the courts. If we take into account that according to Apoyo the indictment procedure currently conducted by the Attorney General's Office takes an average of 80 days and the pre-trial inquest conducted by penal court judges takes an average of 286 days, we will have an idea of the number of new provincial attorney generals that must be appointed so they can fulfill their new duties. Working Conditions in Attorney General's Office It is the provincial attorney general's offices -- which are associated with the first instance courts -- that will be in charge of conducting future pre-trial inquests. Each provincial attorney general's office has three "technical experts" (who are generally either law students or law school graduates) and an administrative worker who is in charge of the dispatches. If we compare the personnel assigned to a provincial attorney general's office with that of a penal court -- which has one judge, four counselors, and two administrative secretaries -- the differences are obvious. It is not only a quantitative but also qualitative difference because the majority of courts secretaries are lawyers and assist the judges with their professional expertise. There is no need to explain that because of the current number of attorney generals, the infrastructure, and the personnel on hand, the penal courts will take far more than the 286 days they currently take for summary proceedings, and this will weaken the penal justice situation even further. This is such an obvious fact that the enforcement of the new Penal Procedure Law has been postponed three times solely for this reason. Experts assert that to assume its new responsibilities, the Attorney General's Office needs to increase the number of attorneys, improve its infrastructure, and increase its personnel. An Attorney General's office member said: "Each provincial attorney general must have at least three attorneys." Conclusions Should the situation remain the same, that is, if the current Penal Procedure Law continues to be enforced and the courts are not computerized, it is obvious that in Lima alone the number of judges should double. If the ideal number of cases per judge is 250, this conclusion is obvious. With the new Penal Procedure Law and computerized courts, the processes are expedited and judges will double their production. A judicial branch Executive Council member said: "If this is the case, we will be forced to reduce the number of judges." The problem, however, does not disappear. It is simply transferred to the attorneys. As for the Attorney General's Office, by reviewing the current figures, it can be concluded that the enforcement of the new Penal Procedure Law will only be feasible if the number of provincial attorneys is increased threefold. Moreover, each attorney must have an assistant who must be a law school graduate. The number of assistants needed may be reduced by half if the attorneys' offices are computerized.
