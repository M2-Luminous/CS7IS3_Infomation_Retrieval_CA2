The authority citation for part 101&hyph;37 continues to read as follows: Authority: 31 U.S.C. 1344; Sec. 205(c), 63 Stat. 390; 40 U.S.C. 486(c). 2. Subpart 101&hyph;37.12 is added to read as follows: SUBPART 101&hyph;37.12_FEDERAL AGENCY AVIATION SAFETY PROGRAM §101&hyph;37.1200 General. (a) This subpart sets forth guidance to agencies for establishing aviation safety programs in accordance with the direction given to GSA in OMB Circular A&hyph;126, but the subpart is not binding on other agencies. (b) The aviation safety program objective is the safe accomplishment of the agency mission, and is a direct result of effective management which should include attention to detail sufficient to preclude the occurrence of an accident. Each agency should establish appropriate key management positions and define their responsibilities and qualifications. Agencies should ensure these positions are staffed with properly qualified personnel. §101&hyph;37.1201 Applicability. As prescribed in this subpart 101&hyph;37.12, the requirement to develop and operate an aviation safety program which addresses all program facets including, but not limited to, flight, ground, and weapons environments, is applicable to all Federal aviation programs. §101&hyph;37.1202 Agency aviation safety responsibilities. Agencies operating aviation programs are responsibilities for establishing and conducting a comprehensive aviation safety program. Agencies should appoint qualified aviation safety managers at both the national and operational program level. §101&hyph;37.1203 Avaiation safety manager qualifications. (a) Aviation safety manager positions may be full time or additional duty, based on program mission requirements. In general, an aviation safety manger should, regardless of management level: (1) Be knowledgeable in agency aviation program activities within his/her purview; (2) Have experience as a pilot, crew member, or in aviation operations management; and (3) Be a graduate of a recognized aviation safety officer or accident prevention course, or qualified within 1 year through attendance at formal courses(s) of instruction. (b) These standards should be used as a guide to ensure that qualified personnel are selected as safety managers. However, they do not supersede those job classifications prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management or other appropriate authority. §101&hyph;37.1204 Program responsibilities. Agencies will ensure that policies, objectives, and standards are established and clearly defined to support an effective aviation accident prevention effort. The aviation safety manager should develop and implement an agency aviation safety program which integrates agency safety policy into aviation related activities. §101&hyph;37.1205 Program elements. As a recommendation, aviation safety program elements should include, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Aviation safety council; (b) Inspections and evaluations; (c) Hazard reporting; (d) Aircraft accident and incident investigation; (e) Education and training; (f) Aviation protective equipment; (g) Aviation qualification and certification; and (h) Awards program. §101&hyph;37.1206 Aviation safety council. (a) Each agency should establish aviation safety councils at the appropriate aircraft operations level. The purpose of the council is to promote safety by exchanging ideas, reviewing, and discussing hazard reports and accident and incident reports, and assessing the threat to safe operation inherent in mission operations plans. The council should function to recommend changes to agency policies, rules, regulations, procedures, and operations based upon such discussions, reviews, and assessments. The council should meet regularly and should consist, at a minimum, of those individuals within the organization responsible for the following areas: (1) Operations/mission planning; (2) Safety; (3) Aircrew training; (4) Maintenance; and (5) Aircrew scheduling.
