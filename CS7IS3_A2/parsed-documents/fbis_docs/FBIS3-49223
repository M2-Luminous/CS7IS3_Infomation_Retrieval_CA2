The package of economic measures adopted on December 30 envisages a much more restrictive monetary policy, TANJUG learns. Though the printing presses are operating at top capacity, churning out 1.6 million banknotes a day, the mint cannot meet the demand for cash money. An ever-increasing amount of banknotes is needed to buy an ever-decreasing quantity of goods. The government aims to substantially cut public spending and procure more revenue from sources such as taxation. Tax benefits will be abolished and payments to employees in kind banned. The average net wage this year is projected at 55 U.S. dollars. Owing to the rigorous sanctions imposed in late May 1992, the vast majority of Yugoslavs are living below the poverty line and are short of many essentials, including medicines. A recent survey showed that around 75 percent of industrial facilities have ground to a halt because of the lack of fuel, raw materials and semi-manufactures. One of the anti-inflationary measures whose implementation will start in the first half of the year is easing the tax burden on the economy by shifting the responsibility for social welfare from companies to the state. In addition, some 300,000 people who are currently on forced leave will lose their jobs and receive unemployment benefits from the state. The federal government estimates that implementation of these measures will result in a drop in industrial production in the first half of the year, after which it would pick up and record a 6.7 percent growth in the third quarter. The GNP is projected to increase 6 percent. The government said easing of the sanctions and unblocking of Yugoslavia's assets in foreign banks were preconditions for cutting back the inflation rate. Late last year, Prime Minister Radoje Kontic addressed a request to this effect to the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
