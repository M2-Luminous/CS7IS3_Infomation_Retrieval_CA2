They Would Have Once Again Elected Yeltsin This Week"] [Text] Two years before presidential elections in Russia, Liberal Democrat leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy continues in third position on the list of probable contenders for this position, conceding first and second positions to Boris Yeltsin and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy respectively. At least, this is what transpires from the results of a poll commissioned by SEGODNYA and conducted by the All-Russia Center for the Study of Public Opinion poll 14-18 May among 1,620 respondents representing the Russian Federation's urban population. Mr. Zhirinovskiy's escapades, to all appearances, continue to hold appeal for his former voters, while the squabbles inside the party and the virtual split in the Duma faction of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia are having no effect on the attitude to its leader. Supporters of the Liberal Democrats' fuhrer still regard him as the only man who can act on their demand for "strong authority" and "a real leader." It is these notions that rate first on the scale of "civic values" of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's voters. However, judging from the poll, neither the "pro-market" nor "pro-democracy" supporters of Russia's current president are free from the predilection for a "firm hand." Aleksandr Rutskoy, who was noted some time ago as the main rival to Mr. Zhirinovskiy in the contest for the lumpen-like electorate, has so far been unable to regain the second position he held in the rating list before the coup. Now one can be totally sure that the general's golden moment has been left behind. As for Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, his probable electorate (among the four leaders) in future elections looks more eroded than the others. This is most likely because voters have a vague idea of the real difference between Mr. Yavlinskiy's policy and that of his rivals on the possible election list.
