The photograph below shows how MiG-21's and MiG-23's are being destroyed. In accordance with the agreement, the destruction of the technology must be completed within three years, although 115 aircraft have already been eliminated. One circumstance is alarming: Since the technology is being dismantled at military units, what control over its utilization can one talk about? It is a pity. We have repeatedly witnessed how numerous commercial structures, which took advantage of the alleged secrecy of the operations, made good profits even on this valuable metal scrap. They turned over very small amounts of it, if at all, to the state treasury. What is going to happen now?
