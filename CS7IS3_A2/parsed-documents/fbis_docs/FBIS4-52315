It is also a major economic development area of the southeastern region of the country. With a population of over 400,000 made up by 140,000 Catholics, 30,000 Buddhists, and a number of Cao Daists, the main concern of the local authorities is to raise the revolutionary vigilance among the people, while effectively carrying out the party and state policy toward religions. The authorities should strive to avoid the situation of the enemy exploiting the extremists within religions to agitate the public to commit illegal activities. To subdue the `peaceful evolution' activities in the locality, the authorities have to: - Strengthen educational campaigns to help cadres, members of the armed forces, and people of Bien Hoa to realize all maneuvers that enemy may use in the city. - The enemy will carry out their scheme in many fields. We need to consolidate the people's patriotic traditions in building up more steadfast armed forces that can positively prevent and break down all sabotage activities. - Party and state organizations should intensify internal security task and suppress corruption and ironhandedness. - Taking advantage of our open door policy, the enemy will find ways to intrude and cause disorder. Hence, we need to be careful and flexible while expanding our external relations and cooperation activities.
