FR940503-2-00034 FR940503-2-00028 After arriving in the United States, the casks would be transported to DOE's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina, where the fuel elements would be stored underwater in an existing storage facility (the Receiving Basin for Offsite Fuels). Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action Routine Operation: During routine (non-accident condition) ocean transport, there would be no impact to the marine environment. Radiation exposure from the very small radiation fields being emitted from the casks_about 1 millirem per hour at 1 meter from the cask surface_would be limited primarily to crew members who inspect the cargo on a daily basis to ensure secure stowage and structural safety of the vessel. Incident-free dose estimates to these crew members would be essentially the same regardless of the port of entry, largely because the exposure is proportional to the numbers of inspections over time. Distances and time of transit are similar from the European ports to the proposed United States ports of entry. Assuming that the ship makes three intermediate port stops and then unloads at the fourth stop, the incident-free dose to a ship cargo inspector is estimated to be 4.3 millirem for shipments into Sunny Point and Wilmington, North Carolina; 4.5 millirem for shipments into Charleston, South Carolina; and 4.6 millirem for shipments into Jacksonville, Florida and Savannah, Georgia. The likelihood of a single fatal cancer among the entire crew of all the ships used in the proposed action is approximately one in 450,000. If no intermediate port stops are assumed, the collective dose would be reduced by approximately 30 percent. Because container cargo handling is relatively uniform throughout the world, exposure to port workers (handlers/inspectors) also would be essentially the same regardless of the port of entry. Using a conservative assumption, i.e., the same handler/inspector inspects all shipments, the maximally exposed port worker would receive a dose of approximately 5.2 millirem. The collective exposure (assuming the same crew of handlers/inspectors for all shipments) to the handlers/inspectors is estimated as 0.078 person-rem (0.0052 rem Ã— 15 workers). The likelihood of a single individual port worker dying from cancer as a result of the proposed action is about 1 in 380,000. Dose to members of the general public during port operations would be extremely low because residences are separated from dock facilities by buffer spaces such as parking lots, warehouses and other port facilities. During truck transport of the spent fuel from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site, the maximally exposed individual truck crew member (assuming the same person is involved in all truck shipments) would receive 2.4 millirem for shipments from Charleston, South Carolina; 2.7 millirem for shipments from Savannah, Georgia; 4.1 millirem for shipments from Wilmington, North Carolina; 4.5 millirem for shipments from Sunny Point, North Carolina; and 3.9 millirem for shipments from Jacksonville, Florida. The likelihood of a single crew member dying from cancer as a result of transporting spent fuel from Sunny Point to the Savannah River Site is about 1 in 440,000. The maximum exposure to an individual not actively involved in shipping the spent fuel during routine transport was estimated for two cases: (1) a member of the public who lives beside the highway route (this individual was assumed to be exposed to each of the 15 truck shipments at a distance of 30 meters); and (2) an individual located near a stopped truck, e.g., in a traffic jam. The maximum in-transit dose under the first instance was calculated to be 0.002 millirem for routine operations. A dose of 0.002 millirem would increase the risk of a latent cancer fatality by 1 in one billion. For the second case, an individual could receive doses higher than 0.002 millirem depending on the duration of the stop and the distance of the individual from the truck. For example, in the unlikely event that a person was standing outside a stopped truck for a period of 1/2 hour at a distance of two meters, the person could receive a dose of one millirem. Since port workers, inspectors, and truck drivers are not considered radiation workers, as defined by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the maximum annual allowable exposure for these personnel would be 100 millirem, the same radiation dose limit established by the NRC to protect the individual members of the general public. As discussed above, during normal transport of the spent nuclear fuel, the maximum annual exposure to the public, port workers, inspectors, and truck drivers would be well below the 100 millirem dose limit, and no doses large enough to result in acute health effects are predicted among either the workers or general public for the proposed action. The cumulative annual incident-free dose from the proposed activity to all persons potentially exposed would range between 0.12 person-rem (Charleston and Savannah) and 0.16 person-rem (Sunny Point). Currently, the average annual individual worker dose at the Receiving Basin for Off-Site Fuels (RBOF) for all operations (unloading, handling and storage of the spent nuclear fuel elements) is approximately 150 millirem. Based on very conservative assumptions, i.e., all 409 spent fuel elements are received in a one-year period and the same individuals unload all 15 casks, the maximum annual increase in the average individual dose to a worker at RBOF is estimated to be 60 millirem. This dose would be well below both the DOE limit of 5,000 millirem per year for radiation workers and the DOE Administrative control level of 2,000 millirem per year per person, for all DOE activities. Once the spent fuel elements were stored under water in the RBOF, the increase in radiation exposure to facility personnel from the storage of the foreign spent fuel elements would not be detectable. Only minor environmental impacts would be expected from the proposed action because the receipt and storage of up to 409 spent fuel elements represents only a small increase to existing site activity and involves no new construction. Approximately 15 cubic feet of laundry type waste and 5.5 cubic feet of solid waste would be generated per cask. The proposed action would add less than 4 percent to the average annual solid waste normally generated at RBOF. Receipt and storage of foreign research reactor spent nuclear fuel would have no effect on the types, quantities or utilization of hazardous compounds stored at RBOF, and no incremental risk to workers would be expected. Accident Conditions: The Environmental Assessment evaluates the potential for accidents during ocean transport (port departure, ocean crossing, and port arrival), overland transport, and storage at RBOF.
