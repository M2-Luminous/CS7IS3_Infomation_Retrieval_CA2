The election office also established the number corresponding to each candidate on the voting ballot, a sheet that includes the list of candidates and also information with respect to the name of the movement or party, the respective number, a photograph, and the candidate's name. The majority of the candidates, including three women, are not well known. They registered, knowing beforehand that they do not stand a change of being elected. According to their respective identification number, the candidates include Guillermo Aleman, Luis Eduardo Rodriguez, Jose Antonio Cortes, Jose Galat, Andres Pastrana, Enrique Parejo, Gloria Gaitan, Doris de Castro, Efrain Torres, Ernesto Samper, Jose Guillermo Barbosa, Alberto Mendoza, Oscar Rojas, Maria Diaz, Miguel Meza, Miguel Zamora, Antonio Navarro, and Regina Betancourt. According to recent voter polls, Conservative Andres Pastrana and Liberal Ernesto Samper are both in the best position to win the elections. They are closely followed by former guerrilla Antonio Navarro Wolff, former secret police director Miguel Meza, and former Liberal Minister Enrique Parejo. If none of the candidates obtain an absolute majority of votes, which would seem to be the case, a second election round will take place on 29 May between the two candidates that received the most votes.
