One of the results of this visit is that our Army is going to take part in joint maneuvers with the French and German Armies. What tasks has the visit imposed on your department? [Wozniak] At their Paris meeting, the defense ministers of Poland, France, and Germany opened a historic stage in the history of mutual relations between these countries. The growth of military bilateral contacts noted by the ministers provided a basis to develop trilateral cooperation, including meetings of experts and the holding of joint exercises. In this connection, my department now has the task of preparing reports and analyses that take into account the legislative peculiarities of each country that is taking part in international exercises. The ministers approved in principle the idea of a joint exercise that would be held in France in the fall, with the participation of French, German, and Polish troops. Polish observers would also be present. [Lukaszewski] In accordance with Polish security policy, defense strategy, and foreign policy, this year's military foreign policy is aimed at making Poland a member of European security structures--i.e., the WEU [Western European Union], the EU [European Union], and NATO. As the man responsible for military foreign policy, what are the guiding principles of this policy? [Wozniak] The guiding principle is that European security is indivisible, and Poland's efforts in this sphere are aimed at creating an all-European security system that matches the political-military challenges and expectations, as well as the economic capabilities. We are trying to establish good political and military relationships not only with our neighbors, but also with other countries. We are concentrating on problems of multilateral regional and all-European cooperation. We are availing ourselves of existing international structures and organizations in order to attain our objective. [Lukaszewski] What do you think of the CSCE as the platform of a new European security system? [Wozniak] The CSCE is a major component of the process of creating new European security structures. Our representatives are taking part in CSCE talks on arms control and on confidence and security-building measures. We are concerned that progress be achieved in this sphere. Within the CSCE, Poland has already been participating with other countries in achieving stability in the region. Poland is also taking part in extinguishing conflicts and supervising the implementation of conventional arms-control agreements such as the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and the 1992 Vienna document. We hope that the CSCE will lead to a cooperative system of security in Europe. However, the primary goal of Polish politics is full membership in NATO. But, because this is going to take a long time, Poland in the meantime is taking part in the work of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which is also a major component of the new European security. [Lukaszewski] What are the other paths of military cooperation for 1994? [Wozniak] In our plans of cooperation with foreign defense ministries and European military structures this year, we have put greater emphasis on defense problems and the strengthening of democratic control over the armed forces. We have also suggested an exchange of experiences in planning and conducting military exercises with the help of computer simulations. We will also examine ways of guaranteeing good interpersonal relationships and human rights inside the Army. [Lukaszewski] What about relations with our neighbors? [Wozniak] Agreements have been reached that will cause a revival and an increase of good-neighborly relations. There will be an increased flow of information, broader personal contacts, and measures to increase the mutual trust between border zones. For this purpose, there is going to be cooperation in military training between neighboring military districts, as well as between military units and training establishments on both sides of the border. [Lukaszewski] Have any details been established in this sphere? [Wozniak] Yes. We are going to send more of our soldiers to be trained in foreign military academies. There are going to be more exchange visits by officers on active duty and by military lecturers. We are going to send soldiers on language training and further training to the United States, Germany, France, Great Britain, and Canada. We will try to send soldiers on training sessions to Norway and Spain. In the Baltic Sea, we are tightening contacts with the naval and coastal defense forces of Germany and Denmark. We will continue to seek agreements with the defense ministries of non-NATO countries on the basic paths of military cooperation. Further ministerial agreements will be concluded soon. [Lukaszewski] Can you give any details? [Wozniak] So far, we have concluded military cooperation agreements with the defense ministries of 126 countries, including all of our neighbors--i.e., Germany, Russia, Belarus, Lithuania, Ukraine, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic, as well as Belgium, France, Latvia, Greece, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Romania. The extent and content of the cooperation varies from one country to another. But, in every single case, there is a desire to be open and to implement European agreements in security, disarmament, and confidence-building measures. [Lukaszewski] What do you think of the Partnership for Peace? [Wozniak] Poland has eagerly accepted the U.S. Partnership for Peace initiative, viewing it as the first meaningful step in the process of including the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the West European system of security. For us, Partnership for Peace confirms NATO's commitment to the security of all Europe. [Lukaszewski] What is the situation with our eastern policy? [Wozniak] Poland wants to open a new chapter in its eastern policy. This need stems from the changes that are occurring on the territory of the former USSR and from our relations with the Russian Federation. In recent years, major progress has been achieved in establishing equal relations with the new countries on this territory. We consider our activity here as a major contribution to the construction of all-European security. [Lukaszewski] And what is your opinion of the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction? [Wozniak] We attach particular importance to the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Poland was the coauthor of the UN General Assembly resolution calling on all member countries to sign the convention to ban chemical weapons as soon as possible, which took place in Paris in January 1993. The convention is a unique international agreement in the sphere of disarmament. It imposes a complete and general ban on the use of chemical weapons and introduces broad verification measures at the same time. We hope this ban will be observed and extended indefinitely. [Lukaszewski] Right now, peace missions are an important factor in stabilizing the military and political situation on a global and regional scale. But let us discuss Polish involvement in UN peace missions separately because that is also an important and interesting topic. [Wozniak] The involvement of Polish soldiers in international missions goes back almost 40 years. That provides another reason for you to conduct an interview at the Department of Military Foreign Affairs at the Defense Ministry. I suggest you talk to one of my deputies about the participation of the Polish Armed Forces in international activity in extinguishing conflicts and restoring peace.
