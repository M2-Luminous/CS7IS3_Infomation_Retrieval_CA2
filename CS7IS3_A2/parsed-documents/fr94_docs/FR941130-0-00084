FR941130-0-00084 FR941130-0-00015 Sections 674.14, 675.14 and 676.14␣Overaward Comments: There were a number of comments on these sections, all in favor of the statutory provision that allows a student employed in the FWS program to earn up to $300 for need-based employment in excess of his or her financial need before employment in the FWS program must be discontinued. Several commenters recommended that the Secretary provide a uniform overaward threshold of $300 for all recipients of campus-based aid to simplify the overaward calculation process and reduce administrative costs. One commenter suggested that the proposed wording of these provisions is slightly ambiguous and subject to different interpretations. The commenter believed that the application of a uniform overaward threshold to all campus-based aid recipients will avoid any potential confusion. Discussion: The Secretary has reevaluated his proposal in the June 22, 1994 NPRM. The statutory purpose of the FWS provision is to prevent aid administrators from being administratively burdened by having to make adjustments to financial aid packages when small amounts of overawards occur. The Secretary believes that the use of a uniform campus-based overaward threshold will further reduce the administrative burden for institutions without cost implications to the campus-based programs. It is important to note that these provisions do not allow an institution to make campus-based awards in excess of the amount of the student's need. Although a threshold is allowed subsequent to the packaging of campus-based aid, the threshold does not allow an institution deliberately to award campus-based aid that, in combination with other resources, exceeds the student's financial need. Changes: The Secretary has provided a uniform $300 overaward threshold for all recipients of campus-based aid. Federal Perkins Loan Program Section 674.2␣Definitions Comments: While most commenters believed that the new definition of ``disposable income'' was necessary in order to be consistent with the FFEL Program and to establish eligibility for an economic hardship deferment or forbearance of payments, others believed the definition was unclear and needed further clarification. Commenters were particularly concerned that alimony payments, child support payments, wage garnishment, and other similar items be considered deductions ``required by law to be withheld.'' Discussion: The term ``disposable income'' was defined in the NPRM as part of the proposed rules for the forbearance and the economic hardship deferment provisions. Forbearance and economic hardship are provisions common to all title IV loan programs, including the Federal Perkins Loan program, and the Secretary made the identical proposal for these two provisions in the FFEL Program NPRM, published on March 24, 1994. The Secretary received a number of comments on the proposed definition of ``disposable income'' in the FFEL Program NPRM and, as a result, decided that ``total monthly gross income'' was a term more easily understood than ``disposable income.'' Consequently, the Secretary replaced ``disposable income'' with ``total monthly gross income'' in the final FFEL Program regulation. For a complete discussion of the reasons for making this change, see comment number 18 on page 33584 of the Federal Register published on June 29, 1994. As part of the Department's effort to simplify the regulations and reduce burden at the institution, provisions that are common to both the Federal Perkins Loan program and the FFEL Program will have the same regulatory provisions, to the extent practicable. Therefore, in this final rule, the proposed rules for the Federal Perkins Loan program have been modified to reflect the forbearance and economic hardship provisions contained in the final FFEL Program regulation, published on June 29, 1994. Changes: The definition of ``disposable income'' is removed and replaced by the definition of ``total monthly gross income.'' Comments: Several commenters believed that the definition of ``making of a loan'' needed to be expanded and clarified. Some commenters stated that the Secretary should define when a disbursement has been made to the borrower as part of the definition of ``making of a loan.'' The commenters believed that without this clarification there would be inconsistencies among institutions and additional tracking mechanisms would be required. Discussion: The issue of when funds are considered to be disbursed applies to all of the title IV programs, not just to the Federal Perkins Loan program. The Secretary is aware that the current title IV disbursement policies are applied inconsistently by institutions and is preparing to issue final regulations on this and other ``cash management'' issues by December 1, 1994. The Secretary is making conforming changes to the Federal Perkins Loan program regulations in the ``cash management'' regulations to be issued by December 1, 1994. Changes: None. Comments: Several commenters believed that the Secretary should define when a promissory note should be signed by the borrower as part of the definition of ``making of a loan.'' These commenters believed that Federal Perkins Loan borrowers should be able to sign the promissory note once, at the beginning of the academic year in which the award is made, and not each time a disbursement is made to the borrower. Discussion: The Secretary is sensitive to the commenters' concerns and will evaluate situations in which an institution could require an annual signature on the promissory note. The Secretary is especially interested in evaluating the possibility of making this option available to those institutions that have demonstrated a high performance level and that have met the stricter cohort default rate requirements adopted for the Federal Perkins Loan program. The Secretary would like to note that an annual signature on the promissory note would necessitate the elimination of the ``open-ended'' Federal Perkins Loan promissory note. The ``open-ended'' promissory note, currently available only in the Federal Perkins Loan program, significantly reduces burden at the institution, by allowing an institution to make loans on the same promissory note for as long as the statutory provisions remain the same. Allowing only a ``closed-ended'' promissory note, as is done in the FFEL and FDSL programs, would result in a major increase in the number of promissory notes an institution would be required to maintain.
