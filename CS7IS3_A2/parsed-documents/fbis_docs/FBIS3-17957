The delegation, headed by Kyrgyz parliament chairman Medetkan Sherimkulov, is made up of representatives of Russia, Kyrgyzia and Belarus. The CIS parliamentarians are scheduled to visit Baku, Yerevan and Stepanakert, and meet Azerbaijani, Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh leaders. The previous tour by CIS lawmakers of the Transcaucasia with a peacekeeping mission was taken last September. The parliamentarians met for three times with Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev, discussed the possibilities of resolving the crisis with Armanian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and the Nagorno-Karabakh leadership. The delegation also visited Azerbaijan's border regions and makeshift camps of refugees in the Belyagan and Barda districts, met heads of district administrations. The tour resulted in an agreement between the CIS parliamentary delegation and the Karabakh leaders about a month-long ceasefire and partial return of refugees to their homes. According to the lawmakers, to finally settle the Karabakh conflict, the warring sides will need time, patience and negotiating skills. A new impetus was imparted to CIS parliamentarians' peacekeeping efforts by the Moscow meeting of Armenian and Azerbaijani defence ministers with the participation of a Nagorno-Karabakh representative. The meeting was held in February at the initiative of the Russian defence minister and resulted in an agreement on a complete ceasefire and gradual settlement of the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev met on Wednesday with Sherimkulov to discuss the forthcoming trip by the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly mission to Nagorno-Karabakh. After the meeting, the Kyrgyz parliament speaker told TASS that at the moment the interparliamentary peacekeeping group was arranging a meeting of Armenian, Azerbaijani and Karabakh lawmakers in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek. "We would like to hope that our activities will help restore peace. People are tired of war, of increasing numbers of refugees. None of the states will profit by this", Sherimkulov stressed. "if we manage to promote rapprochement between the warring sides, we would consider our mission helpful", he said. A senior official of the Russian Foreign Ministry told reporters that the ministry fully supported the intention of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly's peacekeeping group to promote the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement. According to him, the Russian Foreign Ministry "is working in close coordination (with the group) and is ready to render an expert assistance in the activities conducted by the group". Russian diplomats beleive this group "may play a special role, since parliamentarians can help create a favourable atmosphere for concluding an agreement, which is presently being drafted by executive structures". According to the Foreign Ministry high-ranking official, the main thing to do now is "to bring the sides together, to create a proper atmosphere for signing an agreement to halt the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh". The agreement has already being worked out in principle. Each of the conflicting sides has its own approaches, therefore it will certainly take much effort to have the agreement signed, the diplomat stressed.
