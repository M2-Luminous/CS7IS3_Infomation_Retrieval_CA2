Though technopolises were meant to be like America's Silicon Valley, they're degenerating into industrial parks. Problems such as inadequate control by MITI and the use of technopolises as ``good causes'' by regions and by politicians snaring public works projects are behind the retreat from the original concept. The concept of the technopolis, which started under the jurisdiction of MITI in 1983, was to aim for innovation based on the fostering of start-ups and industry-academia cooperation rooted in the region. However, today, ten years later, the reality of the technopolis is very different from the original concept. Local Governments Put Local Revitalization First, Regionalism and Nurturing of New Industries Second The biggest problem is that often the technopolises have almost become industrial parks not very similar to the research parks of Silicon Valley on which they were modeled. As local governments put local revitalization first, they persist in pursuing factories from Tokyo and Osaka companies, putting in second place the nurturing of regional distinctiveness and new industries. The corporations are under the influence of their headquarters, which is fine when times are good. However, when the economy plunges, people are quickly recalled and plans are quickly cut. This makes it difficulty for long-term research to survive. Take Hamamatsu City in Shizuoka Prefecture, one of the 26 designated technopolis regions. Its geographic conditions are favorable and it is blessed with local industries such as musical instruments and motorcycles. Even here the business plan is behind schedule. Toda Industrial Park is at the core of the city's technopolis plan. The parceling out of the 100-hectare industrial park began in March 1990. As the bubble economy still lingered then, companies were very interested in entering the park. Before two years were up, the park was 100% parceled out to 68 companies. However, of the 68 companies, nine have yet to begin building one to two years after obtaining the land. That is because companies had to reconsider totally their investments in plant and equipment when the economy declined immediately after the companies signed their contracts. The sales contract the companies signed with Hamamatsu includes an obligation to be in operation within three years of obtaining the land. Companies which do not fulfill that condition must pay a penalty or return the land to the city. If this rule is strictly applied, companies will suffer and Hamamatsu will lose companies it wooed. As a last resort, the standard of ``operation within three years'' was changed to ``construction begun within three years.'' However, since prospects are poor for economic recovery in the latter half (October 1993 to March 1994) of this fiscal year, meeting even the revised standard will be a tall order for the companies. The three companies with an October 1993 deadline have not submitted their applications for architectural approval and cannot start construction in time. The remaining six companies with deadlines in April 1994 or January 1995 are conferring with Hamamatsu on how to meet the construction start deadline even with scaled down plans for first stage construction. Retreat of Companies has Begun to Stand Out, a Region That Hasn't Attracted Even One Company Cases of companies giving up on technopolises have begun appearing as the business climate has worsened. Automotive parts manufacturer Shin Kobe Plastic had planned to build a factory at Hiroshima's Chuo Technopolis, but in July 1992 it completely retreated from the plan and returned the land to Hiroshima Prefecture. ``Based on the direction of the automotive market, we must give up on constructing a new plant,'' explained the company to the prefecture. The prefecture, which had attracted the company, was devastated by the cancellation of construction plans. But the Hiroshima company Mazda, which uses Shin Kobe's products, suffered a rapid downturn due to the declining demand for automobiles. There is nothing to be done to relieve the sorry plight of companies which rely on Mazda. The problem is not only with Shin Kobe. Last year two other companies gave up on technopolis plans. Automotive seat belt manufacturer Takata had acquired land in the prefecturally operated Taguchi Industrial Park and Daiure, a processor of urethane for automotive seats, had planned to build a plant in the prefecturally operated Chiyoda Industrial Park. Both companies returned the land to the prefecture. Both were hurt by the recession in the automotive industry. Hiroshima Prefecture has many automotive parts manufacturers and subcontractors to large-scale heavy industries such as ship-building and steel. One purpose of getting the technopolis designation from MITI was to lessen the prefecture's reliance on existing industries -- such as automobiles, ship-building, and steel -- by encouraging location of high-tech industries such as electronics and machinery in the technopolis. There were some positive results. The national brewing laboratory and Matsushita's research laboratory were lured to the technopolis. But mostly companies in the automotive industry wanted to enter the technopolis during the bubble era. As a result, there was insufficient industrial diversification. That's one reason the current recession has hurt very badly. Hiroshima and Hamamatsu are in the top three of the 26 technopolises in terms of value of manufactured goods shipped. They were blessed from the outset with a concentration of industries such as autos and instruments, moreover they have big cities nearby. It is noteworthy that companies are giving up even in these two regions. There are many regions with worse conditions that cannot even attract industry. ``In 1984, on the occasion of the moving of Akita Airport, three industrial parks were created,'' according to Akita Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section. ``The good economy continued and companies were locating as expected. Last year was the worst. Not one company was attracted to the technopolis. The severe conditions are continuing this year.'' ``We are working hard to attract companies with inspection tours and explanatory meetings, but we get a very bad feeling from the corporate side. Last year we attracted eight companies, but this year we're stuck at one,'' according to Yamaguchi Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section. The majority of technopolises are having varying degrees of difficulty in attracting companies due to the sluggish economy. Introductory Pamphlets are Virtually Indistinguishable: ``Electronics, Biotech, New Materials ...'' A diagram (see below) of the changes in number of corporate locations in the technopolis areas which make up more than ten percent of Japan's newly established factory locations, shows that in 1990, driven by the bubble economy, there was a record of 474 new sitings in those 20 earlier regions designated from 1984 to 1986. This is more than twice the number in 1981. However, since 1991 the downturn in the economy has been accompanied by reconsideration of plans for excessive investment in plant and equipment. The number of new locations has dropped 35% in the two years since 1991, falling to 307 cases in 1992. Corporate appetites for investment in plants and equipment are expected to decline further this year. ``If industrial parks are filled up, that's a kind of business success. But the technopolises were based originally on the ideal of Silicon Valley. Despite that, they've become something very different from nurturers of new industries. There is a need to reconsider how technopolises differ from industrial parks.'' This is at the heart of the problem, according to Ichio Hiramoto, assistant division chief of the social welfare division of Mitsubishi Research Institute. As an urban development specialist, Hiramoto has experience with drafting plans for large scale development projects such as the technopolises. The content of introductory pamphlets for the various technopolises are virtually indistinguishable, particularly in the fields that they want to develop. They have sweeping goals in electronics, software, biotechnology, new materials and so on. It's almost as if their goals were cut by cookie cutter. There are very few prefectures with the individuality to say ``if we don't go into that area, we'll lag behind in research in that field.'' Yamagata Prefecture Achieves Success With Research Focus, ``Make a Distinctive Plan that Doesn't Follow the System'' Of course, there are also individualistic approaches. Yamagata Prefecture decisively narrowed the target for its research and development, thus overcoming its geographical handicap. Life support technologies, such as the development of an artificial heart and prevention of aging, are the pride of Yamagata. Yamagata ``aims to be second to none in Japan'' in research related to living bioradicals such as active oxygen which is said to be closely related to damage to living organisms from causes such as cancer and aging, according to Yamagata Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section. In November 1988 a life support technology research and development organization was set up as a voluntary organization. It has become a cooperative development project involving 70 companies and 120 university researchers. A Bioradical Laboratory was built as the core facility with Â¥4.5 billion raised by the prefecture. The laboratory drew Fumio Inaba, professor emeritus of Tohoku Institute of Technology from neighboring Miyagi Prefecture and began a public-private jointly funded Bio Light Information Laboratory. It was possible to attract personnel due to good narrowing of the research goal and legwork. Yamagata succeeded in creating a somewhat different kind of attractiveness with its living body radical research. ``A prefecture like ours (with poor geographic conditions) couldn't survive if we did the same thing as everyone else. It is important to create a distinctive plan for a local area rather than to be lead by the national system,'' says the Industrial Promotion Section persuasively. There are examples of other local governments where several tens of pre-existing researchers have been collected in a foundation or in the tertiary sector to create unique cooperative research between corporations and local universities. There are many cases in which practical research results have been achieved. For example: Kumamoto Prefecture's apparatus using optical sensors for non-destructive continuous sweetness testing of mandarin oranges and the Shin Niigata-Nagaoka technopolis' sub-micron super accurate CNC lathe. However, unfortunately the technopolises cannot be compared to America's Silicon Valley, which gave birth to many companies like Intel that will bring forth a new generation and which has become a world-wide mecca for the computer industry. Designated Regions With Inflated Egos, Development From Perspective of a Single Unit of a Bloc is Indispensable Why have 26 locations spawned such similar plans? In 1984, the year after the establishment of the Technopolis Law, MITI began approving development plans based on prefectural applications. This is what MITI officials familiar with the circumstances back then say. At the project stage the technopolis was distorted into something completely different from the original concept. MITI meant to select two to three sites from across the country in a strict selection process and create very pure research parks which would serve as national models. However, at the application stage there were many prefectures which said that if other prefectures did it, then they wanted to do it. Then the local Diet members got involved. As a result, 26 locations were designated representing more than half of the prefectures. For the Diet members the technopolises were a way of extending the public works budget for highways and maintenance. Most local governments used the technopolises for ``good causes'' and ended up with plans very different from the original intention. Regional egos and the machinations of politicians have warped the concept of the technopolis. MITI itself does not control the budget for developing the technopolises. The localities have been chartered by MITI to be in charge of the benefits of public works. Another problem is inadequate control by MITI which designated 26 regions even though that contradicted its purposes. This is not just a problem with the technopolises. It's also a problem since then with MITI's Key Facilities Siting Law and its Regional Core Cities Law. Twenty-three locations have been designated under the Key Facilities Siting Law and 44 (almost all of the prefectures) for the Regional Core Cities Law. ``Most of Japan's model development undertakings are influenced by various dynamics during the implementation stage and tend to get uniformly watered down across the country,'' says Mitsubishi Research Institute assistant division chief Hiramoto. The technopolises reproduce the problems of Japan's administrative organization on a smaller scale. The fact of 26 designated regions cannot be changed. ``The topic for debate is how to deal with role allocation and mutual cooperation among the 26 regions. It's necessary to think about how to use limited manpower and funds efficiently. For this purpose it's necessary to overcome the existing prefectural framework to think of development from a perspective as one unit of a bloc,'' says Yoshikazu Iwasaki, chief researcher of the research division of Japan Industrial Location Center which deals with research and drafting of development plans. For example, the seven prefectures of Kyushu and Tohoku's six prefectures have each received a technopolis designation. It's natural that they'll compete in attracting companies to the region. In Kyushu at the end of the first phase of the technopolis plan in 1990, Kumamoto, which had quickly succeeded in establishing an image as the mecca for the semiconductor and related[?rinkuu?] industries, achieved 98.9% of its goal for industrial shipments whereas on the opposite shore Nagasaki contented itself with 69.9%. Nagasaki Prefecture has little flat land and limited resources, so it would be difficult to locate there industries such as semiconductors which require large quantities of water. Prefectural per capita income languishes at forty-fourth among the prefectures. A major cause of problems has been the reliance of the local economy on shipbuilding. ``In reality Nagasaki is equipped with highways and an airport, so in terms of access it compares favorably, but it has a poor image compared to Kumamoto and Fukuoka,'' according to Nagasaki Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section. Nagasaki Prefecture appears poised to begin capitalizing on its shipbuilding skills by fostering local companies in the area of machine processing and on its long coastline by developing marine environmental protection technology and ocean bottom exploration technology. However, this approach won't work unless it collaborates with the neighboring prefectures. If Kyushu's prefectures can cooperate to attract industries suited to their technical specialties and geographic characteristics, then development will occur in a balanced way across Kyushu and companies will see the advantages of locating in Kyushu. Corporations Also Need to Change Their Thinking and Move Toward Research Exchange Unhampered by Company-First-Ism In the beginning there was no industry clustered in the U.S.' Silicon Valley. Stanford University, a second-tier university, played a role when an industrial park was built near the university. That was the beginning of Silicon Valley. Now about 2,000 companies have their headquarters in Silicon Valley which has become a research park whose researchers spin off start-ups and nurture them into full-blown companies. ``The biggest difference from Japan is the existence of ``software programs'' for nurturing promising companies. Innovation won't come from splendid buildings built from a public works mentality,'' according to Mitsubishi Research Institute's Hiramoto. In Silicon Valley, university researchers may turn into entrepreneurs the next day and personnel move frequently between companies. Rather than start off with a building and an organization, they pull together the people and organization most suited to fostering development. This is how Silicon Valley supports creativity. In Japan, by comparison, even when companies cluster together they're separated by company-first-ism. There's little exchange of research and little technological impact on local companies. ``There are forums set up by local governments or foundations, but they are generally little more than social gatherings. Research exchange across corporate boundaries won't happen just because people dance the bon odori together,'' said the head of a laboratory located in a technopolis. To turn the technopolises into something substantial, it isn't enough to simply address administrative problems. Change must be made to corporate research customs and to the characteristics that make Japanese poor at exchanges. Figure Figure
