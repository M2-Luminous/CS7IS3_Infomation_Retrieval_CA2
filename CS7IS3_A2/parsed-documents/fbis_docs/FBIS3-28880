This comes under fire in MINJU CHOSON today. He maliciously slandered the DPRK's political system and spun out a string of trash, contending that the DPRK "might take a military action" and Japan's "countermeasure should be examined" to cope with [word indistinct] of contingency" on the Korean peninsula, the analyst says, and goes on: His remarks are an undisguised provocation aimed at impairing the prestige and dignity of the DPRK and stifling Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses. The Japanese reactionaries' nuclear armament has practically reached a danger line. It is not without reason that Japanese scholars themselves admit "Japan is fully prepared to possess nuclear weapons." It is clear to everybody that if Japan possessed many nuclear weapons, it would bring a grave disaster to the Korean people and other Asian people. What Ozawa said fully shows what an extent the Japanese ruling circles' aggressive design on the DPRK has reached. The Japanese reactionaries are desperately trying to stifle our socialist system in league with the United States and South Korea. But it is a foolish act. They would be well advised to clearly see the situation, give up the scheme to [word indistinct] Japanese military power armed with nuclear weapons and act with discretion.
