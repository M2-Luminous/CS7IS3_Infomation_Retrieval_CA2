The solution of this problem, on which politicians, military leaders and diplomats have been racking their brains for several past decades, may be brought closer by the annual session of the U.N. disarmament conference, which opened here today. Having completed in 1992 the elaboration of a convention to ban chemical weapons, it is now getting down to the discussion of the problem of an all-embracing ban on nuclear tests. The session is being attended by delegations from 37 states-members of the conference, including Russia. "The banning of tests is a very important measure, primarily from the viewpoint of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons", Grigoriy Berdennikov, Russia's permanent representative, told ITAR-TASS. "It is not a matter of concluding a treaty among the nuclear powers alone, but a matter of complete and universal prohibition of tests in all the countries of the world. This will guarantee us against the emergence of a new possessor of nuclear weapons." The Geneva session is particularly important in light of current preparations for a conference of signatories of the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty, scheduled for 1995. This conference may adopt a decision to prolong the treaty forever. "The idea of fully banning nuclear tests was advanced by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954. We have traditionally backed this initiative," Berdennikov added. "The treaty to ban tests in three media was concluded in 1963. We have also signed a treaty with the Americans to restrict the yield of nuclear tests. We are observing a moratorium on tests for several years now. Everybody admits that it has created a good background for talks in Geneva." "The main problem after the end of the 'Cold War' is to save the world from the 'spreading' of mass destruction weapons and means for their delivery," the Russian representative said. "It is very important to reach agreement on security guarantees to non-nuclear state and on stopping the output of fissionable materials. The current session of the conference will also focus its attention on these problems."
