These were the words uttered by Diet member Muneaki Samejima of the Japan New Party [JNP] as he read a copy of the policy agreement of the coalition government. Priority Given to Maintaining the System [subhead] At a policy discussion meeting of the coalition parties in mid- April when the Hata government was about to set sail, a behind-the- scenes battle was fought over the question of reforming the food control system. A "rough draft" prepared on 16 April had included the position of the JNP "supporting the reform of the agricultural cooperatives -- by adopting the market economy in production, distribution, and sales (passage omitted) -- in order to improve self-sufficiency in foodstuffs." The draft had included the intention to abolish the existing rigid Food Control Law and to legislate a new law designed to help strengthen the competitiveness of Japan's agriculture in preparation for the tariffication of rice in the future. But on the morning of 18 April, Norihiko Narita, secretary to Prime Minister Hosokawa, appeared at the office of the JNP and delivered a hand-written, three-page-long revised draft. He then said that "an overall revision, including the part on agriculture, is necessary." When he was asked who wrote it, the secretary avoiding giving a clear-cut answer. Thus, eventually, a portion of the agreement was revised to read "to utilize the function of the market economy in the areas of production, distribution, and sales (passage omitted) while maintaining the self-sufficiency system for basic foodstuffs." This meant a change back to the maintenance of the food control system and the taking of the substance out of the introduction of the market economy principle. When asked whether the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] intervened with the prime minister's office, a ranking official of the ministry denied this, saying "I have not heard anything about that happening." Still, however, he looked happy with the contents of the agreement and remarked, "Now that I have seen the expressions used to explain the details, it seems to me that someone who is familiar with agricultural administration was involved." The MAFF started discussing a reform of the food control system in the beginning of the year following a decision late last year to partially open the rice market. The public outpouring of distrust in the system as a result of the controversy over rice shortages also prompted the ministry to act. But the ministry's thinking was based on the premise that the reform should be effected within the existing system, and such drastic measures as reorganizing or abolishing the Food Agency were never contemplated. Meticulous Groundwork Done on Ruling Parties in Advance [subhead] Even in the full-scale ruling-opposition parties' negotiations since the end of May -- with an eye on the formulation in July of an intermediate report by the Agricultural Administration Council on the food control system reform -- the MAFF took the position of wanting to seek the understanding of the public on the condition that "it will be a reform within the existing system," and even MAFF Minister Mutsuki Kato took the position of respecting the bureaucrats' position, saying "The basic part of the food control system will be maintained." The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], which until last year had run the agricultural administration in close concert with the MAFF, was also all for this, with former MAFF Minister Tomio Yamamoto declaring, "Saying that the food control system is unnecessary is sheer absurdity." The MAFF is concerned that it does not have good personal connections with the coalition parties because there are so few Diet members in the parties who previously had worked in the ministry. As such, it recently has been sending out almost every day its officials to offices of Komeito [Clean Government Party] and Democratic Socialist Party Diet members in the Diet members hall, in efforts to gain friends for it. MAFF Vice Minister Toshihiko Tsuruhiko complained, "Since the Social Democratic Party of Japan bolted the coalition, this is taking much more time than it did before." But even a staff official of the Ministry of Finance said in praise, "We are awed by their ability to use politicians who are just good for their purposes." While the winds for the dissolution of the Diet for a general election may be blowing, the vote- collecting machines of agricultural areas, such as agricultural cooperatives and land-improvement districts, are as sound as ever. An officer of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperative Associations noted his union's efforts to approach the ruling coalition parties, saying, "In the next election, we must think about dividing votes between the LDP and the ruling coalition parties." "We Are the Ones Who Draw the Picture" The MAFF is standing firm against even the voices of the private sector which are demanding reform. The Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters in April asked for an easing of existing rules against grain dealers newly participating in the market, but the ministry rejected this, declaring, "That is a matter that should be taken up by the Agricultural Administration Council." The ministry is confident it can control the Agricultural Administration Council because it believes, "There can be all kinds of discussions, but in the end, we will be the people who draw the picture." Within the MAFF, there are some who even strongly resist considering a reform of the food control system within the framework of the existing system. As for operations on reforming the system, the minister's Secretariat is pushing for a "system of voluntary reductions of farming acreage" which will enable farmers to choose whether or not to reduce farming acreage, but many officials of the ministry's Agricultural Production Bureau are going around speaking negatively of it and saying, "That is impossible." Even the Food Agency, which wants to protect the existing interests of wholesale and retail stores, is not so willing to support the deregulation of distribution. The bureaucrats may have heard criticism (made by Kozo Uchida, a member of the Rice Prime Review Council and the executive director of the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan) saying, "The postwar bureaucrats of the MAFF were fired up with the ideal of rebuilding the nation's agriculture. We don't sense any passions from them now." The bureaucrats want to be deaf to the song of "reform" and to look the other way.
