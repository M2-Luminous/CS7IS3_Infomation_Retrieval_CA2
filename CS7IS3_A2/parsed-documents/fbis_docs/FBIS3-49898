Most transactions are not carried out in the national currency, the dinar. Even farmers in the markets sell their goods solely for DM [German marks], the exchange rate of which changes several times a day. The value of the German currency has gone up exactly a thousand times since new year. Experts estimate that the January inflation rate in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is going to exceed the record one million per cent reached in December. Turnover of goods in shops is rapidly dropping which is partly explained by a dramatic and massive impoverishment of the population, living under international economic sanctions for twenty months. Most shops in central Belgrade are closed, each having the same notice "inventory" on the door. Salesmen do not want to sell their goods for dinars, which is being devaluated daily for several tenths percent, even less for cheques, because it is difficult to cash them in. Salesmen complain that it is harder and harder to purchase goods since the production in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is almost non-existent for lack of fuel, raw materials and primary products whose is banned by sanctions [sentence as received]. Pensioners represent the mostly affected social category, but the standard of living of those who are employed is hardly any better. A large number of companies in Serbia paid out on Friday guaranteed weekly salary, amounting to an average 5,000,000 dinars, which is less than 1 DM according to the current exchange rate. The physical survival of the population of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia depends on crushing the inflationary chaos. The government has announced that the monetary reconstruction programme is planned to take effect at the beginning of next week. According to experts, the fact that the new measures will be carried out without any support or assistance from international financial institutions represents a serious handicap.
