The source told MENA today that the Israelis are mainly concentrating on the first part--arrangements for regional security with a view toward breaking the Arab wall around Israel. The source said the Israeli delegation wants to finish promptly with security arrangements, as this would mean an implicit recognition of Israel by the region's states, while it refrains from entering into a detailed discussion of arms control. It should be noted that the prevailing view among the delegates is that the two subjects must be discussed together without focusing on one to the exclusion of the other.
