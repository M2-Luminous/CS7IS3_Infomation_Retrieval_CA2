The trustee of a trust any portion of which is treated as owned by the grantor or another person must report pursuant to this section for taxable years beginning on or after the first day of the first calendar year after the date of publication of the final regulations in the Federal Register . However, if the trustee has filed a Form 1041 for any taxable year ending before that date (and has not filed a final Form 1041 pursuant to §1.671&hyph;4(b)(3) in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994), or files a Form 1041 for any taxable year thereafter, the trustee must file a final Form 1041 for the taxable year which ends after the date of publication of the final regulations in the Federal Register and which immediately precedes the first taxable year for which the trustee reports pursuant to paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section, on the front of which form the trustee must write: ``Pursuant to §1.671&hyph;4(f), this is the final Form 1041 for this grantor trust.''. (2) Transition rule. For taxable years beginning prior to the first day of the first calendar year following the date of publication of the final regulations in the Federal Register , the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge the manner of reporting of_ (i) A trustee of a trust all of which is treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons who did not report in accordance with §1.671&hyph;4(a) (26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 1994) as in effect for taxable years beginning prior to the first day of the first calendar year following the date of publication of the final regulations in the Federal Register , but did report in a manner substantially similar to one of the reporting methods described in paragraph (b) of this section; or (ii) A trustee of two or more trusts all of which are treated as owned by grantors or other persons who filed a single Form 1041 for all of the trusts, rather than a separate Form 1041 for each trust, provided that the items of income, deduction, and credit of each trust were shown on a statement attached to the single Form 1041. (g) Cross-references. For special rules relating to backup withholding requirements, see section 3406 and the regulations thereunder. For rules relating to employer identification numbers, and to the obligation of a payor of income or proceeds to the trust to furnish to the payee a statement to recipients with respect to the information return filed by the payor, see §301.6109&hyph;1(a)(2) of this chapter. Par. 3. Section 1.6012&hyph;3 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(9) to read as follows: §1.6012&hyph;3 Returns by fiduciaries. (a) *␣*␣* (9) A trust any portion of which is treated as owned by the grantor or another person pursuant to section 671 and following. In the case of a trust any part of which is treated as owned by the grantor or another person under the provisions of subpart E (section 671 and following) part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, see §1.671&hyph;4. * * * * * PART 301_PROCEDURE AND ADMINISTRATION Par. 4. The authority citation for part 301 continues to read in part as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 *␣*␣* Par. 5. Section 301.6109&hyph;1 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(2) to read as follows: §301.6109&hyph;1 Identifying numbers. (a) *␣*␣* (2) A trust all of which is treated as owned by the grantor or another person pursuant to section 671 and following _(i) Obtaining an employer identification number. If the trustee furnishes the name and taxpayer identification number of the grantor or other person and the address of the trust to all payors pursuant to §1.671- 4(b)(1)(i)(A) of this chapter, the trustee need not obtain an employer identification number for the trust until the first taxable year of the trust in which the trust is no longer described in §1.671&hyph;4(b) of this chapter. If the trustee furnishes the name, taxpayer identification number, and address of the trust to all payors pursuant to §1.671&hyph;4 (b)(1)(i)(B) or (b)(2)(i) of this chapter, and the trustee has not already obtained a taxpayer identification number for the trust, the trustee must obtain an employer identification number for the trust as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. (ii) Obligations of persons who make payments of income or proceeds to certain trusts. Any payors of income or proceeds that are required to file an information return with respect to payments of income or proceeds to a trust must show the name and taxpayer identification number that the trustee has furnished to the payor on the return. Regardless of whether the trustee furnishes to the payor the name and taxpayer identification number of the grantor or other person, or the name and taxpayer identification number of the trust, the payor must furnish a statement to recipients to the trustee of the trust, rather than to the grantor or other person. Under these circumstances, the payor is considered to have satisfied any obligation to show the name and taxpayer identification number of the payee on the information return and to furnish to the person whose taxpayer identification number is required to be shown on the form a statement to recipients. * * * * * Margaret Milner Richardson, Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
