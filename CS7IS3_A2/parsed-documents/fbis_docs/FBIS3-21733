It also shows a high rate of drug consumption. He offered to furnish evidence of this to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR). Remarking that small planes are often observed landing in various parts of the state, he said that this should be investigated by the PGR and the counternarcotics authorities. He questioned the effort of the PGR, noting its failure to publicize the results of investigations conducted in the case of small planes loaded with drugs that crashed in BCS territory months ago. He asserted that, to date, the Attorney General's Office has maintained secrecy regarding the crash of a plane carrying five tons of cocaine. It occurred during April 1993, in this municipality's Los Barriles community, 60 km south of here. He revealed that he, personally, had reports from an ex-official pertaining to the drug traffic, adding: "I would be willing to give details to the PGR authorities."
