At a ceremony promoting 19 senior officers to generals, Jiang, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, emphasized the importance of integrating Deng's theory and ideas with practice. He said: "We must pay close attention to the study of modern science, technology and expertise, and study strategies and tactics of the people's war in high-tech conditions, in order to master the capabilities needed to direct modern warfare." The leader stressed that senior officers must study hard, unswervingly implement the line and policies of the Chinese Communist Party and firmly follow the instructions of the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. Jiang described a powerful army and strong national defense as a "powerful backing" for reforms, opening up to the world and the modernization drive, and as a "reliable guarantee" for the consolidation of state power, social stability, economic growth and a peaceful life. He said that officers and men of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), China's armed forces, must be vigilant in peace-time and be well prepared at all times so as to make even greater contributions to China's security, unification, stability and unity. He asked senior officers to serve the people wholeheartedly, sincerely bring happiness to the people, work hard in the interests of the people, and to be honest. The PLA is best known for being well-organized and strictly observing discipline, said Jiang, general secretary of the party Central Committee. For this reason, senior officers must set an example in observing discipline and implementing rules and regulations, he said. They must also implement to the letter the decisions, orders and directives of the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, he added.
