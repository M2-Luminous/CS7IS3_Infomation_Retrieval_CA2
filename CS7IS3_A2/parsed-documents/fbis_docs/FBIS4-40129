Akayev intends to find a way out of the prevailing situation during his meeting today with representatives of the Slav diaspora in Kirghizia. At present the republic's over four million population consists of 56.5 per cent native Kirghizs, but the people of Russian, Ukrainian and Belarussian nationalities account for 21.1 per cent. Four years ago there were 905.4 thousand Russian-speaking people living in Kirghizia. Now this diaspora has shrunk to almost 170 thousand. The process of migration is gathering momentum everyday. According to the president, this process can be stopped only by giving official status to the Russian language, and introducing duel citizenship. But both alternatives run contrary to the Constitution of Kirghizia. The republic's present parliament has more than once demonstrated that it does not intend to amend or change the fundamental law. How to find a compromise, stop migration, without arousing a wave of nationalism, this is what is causing the present "headache" to President Akayev.
