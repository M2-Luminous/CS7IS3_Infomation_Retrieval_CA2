After an automatic emergency shutdown at noon on Wednesday [16 March], the restart program was continued around 2315 [2215 GMT], power plant manager Klaus Distler said on Thursday morning. The Hesse Environment Ministry also agreed with the decision. The reactor will probably be on line again by Friday morning, Distler said. The power plant manager stated that the accident, which caused the latest shutdown of the nuclear reactor on Wednesday, was a "trifle": The short-circuit relay of a oil pump for controlling the turbine activated for no reason and thus caused the emergency shutdown. When the part was checked, no defect was found. The oil pump is needed only during the start-up phase; it is not important for the safety of the facility. The Environment Ministry in Wiesbaden said that the Hesse nuclear supervisory body agreed to restart Block A after an on-site inspection in the nuclear plant and discussions with operators and experts during the night and into Thursday morning. After a faultless test run of the pump engine, which took several hours, and a positive assessment by the experts, the nuclear supervisory body was able to withdraw its order to stop the restart until matters were clarified, which had been given early Wednesday evening.
