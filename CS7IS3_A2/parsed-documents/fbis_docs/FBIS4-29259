On the same day, the United States completed its draft resolution on sanctions against North Korea to be presented to the UN Security Council. The situation with regard to the North Korean nuclear issue has become increasingly strained. From the viewpoint that the coordination of opinion between the ROK and the United States is more important than ever under this situation, the government let all communication channels between Washington and Seoul, and between the United Nations and the Foreign Ministry become wide open. As long as our government, which is one of the parties most directly concerned with the North Korean nuclear issue, remains as a third party in negotiations on the nuclear issue, the United States, a party concerned with the negotiations, is sitting face to face with North Korea in the place of our government while negotiating with it on behalf of the United Nations and the IAEA which represent the international community. Nevertheless, some people's criticism is that the United States shows an attitude of dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue as a line in the chain of its own diplomatic policy, and our government is not effectively responding to the U.S. policy of approach toward the issue. As the North Korean nuclear issue has lately brought about an excessive "sense of simulated crisis [kasangjok wigigam]" on the Korean peninsula, the aged doubt [haemugun pulsingam] that "the United States has a passive opinion [sogukchogin kyonhae] on tensions on the Korean peninsula because it wants to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue in its own way" seems to be raised again. In short, people note that the ROK and the United States have yet to build a belt of consensus in which they can share even specific interests [kuchejogin ihaekkaji kongyuhanun konggamdaega hyongsongdoeji anko itta]. It is learned that the ROK and the United States have a good system for pre- or post-coordination of their opinion and that there is a relatively wide belt of consensus between the two. Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Bill Clinton have held talks over the telephone at every critical stage for every important issue. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher have also held frequent talks in person or over telephone. In addition, Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun has paved way for pictorial cooperation between the two countries by visiting the United States, and Robert Gallucci, U.S. ambassador in charge of the North Korean nuclear issue, will visit our country and Japan in the near future to round off the cooperation system between the ROK, the United States, and Japan. On the other hand, however, some people note that "the two countries have held frequent talks for coordination of opinion but seem to have failed to reach a complete agreement to share even interests." When North Korea declared its withdrawal from the IAEA, the United States, a suzerain state of the agency, branded [kyujong] North Korea's attitude as "an unforgivable act against the international community," and some U.S. sections made without hesitation such strong utterances as "they would not hesitate in imposing even military sanctions." Meanwhile, our government held an emergency meeting on measures against North Korea's declaration. However, it said "it would adhere to its original policy of using both dialogue and sanctions." Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of the National Unification Board, who presided over the meeting, made it clear that "UN sanctions will be sanctions for dialogue." These facts cause us to assume that the ROK and the United States have a different awareness of the crisis on the Korean peninsula. There have been more contradictions in cooperation between the ROK, the United States, and Japan. When Ambassador Kim Sam-hun visited the United States and held working-level talks with the United States and Japan, he said "the three countries are cooperatively coping with the North Korean nuclear issue." However, when faced with the unexpected variable of North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA, they showed wavering attitudes in reaching agreements and coordinating opinions. A ranking official of our government prospected, "This fact [North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA] will not influence UN sanctions against North Korea and, accordingly, it will take two or three weeks, as scheduled, for the UN Security Council to formally discuss sanctions against the North." The United States, however, immediately prepared a draft resolution on sanctions against the North and opened it to public on the following day. They differed from each other in way of understanding the matter. In addition to the withdrawal from the IAEA, North Korea has begun to show another card, that is, the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Situation will all the more require the partnership among the ROK, the United States, and Japan, particularly between the ROK and the United States, in coping with the North Korean nuclear issue.
