Padora; place and date not given: "Driving at Old Prices"] [Text] The government decision of two days ago on the abolition of the 10-percent customs fee for import of oil derivatives not only will help avoid possible disturbances in the fuel supply, but it will also mean a stable price, that is, maintenance of the price that is now paid by consumers. If not for longer, users can stay "cool" at least until 30 June, which is the date until which this decision remains valid. It is also a period in which all is possible, even what the optimists hope for -- the lifting of the embargo imposed by the southern neighbor on Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] on 16 February. What the "abolition" of the customs fee in fact means, and how it is going to be reflected in the price, the supply, and consumption is the subject of our discussion with "Makpetrol" general manager Ljubomir Janev. Costs The additional burden on the price, as Mr. Janev said, was a result of the eastern transport corridor which has been used since the embargo. More precisely, according to the specific customs regulations, the crude oil arriving in the country for refining was not taxed until that period. That same fact brought about the only possible alternative -- to "drag" only oil products for which taxes are to be paid, which burdened the price and increased the costs. Moreover, the transport costs became five times greater than before (when the crude oil arrived by railroad from Thessaloniki directly to Miladinovci). "Because of all this, and with the aim of avoiding difficulties in the supply, we asked the government to abolish the customs taxes on oil products, since it was not our desire to buy it abroad and transport it via the eastern corridor -- that was simply imposed on us. After some discussions in government commissions it was finally agreed that our request was substantial and it was good that the government understood the problem, because by decreasing the taxes a more stable price and a better management is provided," Ljubomir Janev said. On the other hand, since the 10-percent customs fee applied after the embargo was simply not "planned" in the annual budget, it was decided to apply it retroactively from 1 March. Supply As far as the situation in the supply is concerned, as Ljubomir Janev pointed out, the situation is under full "control." Although there is a quantity of crude oil in the Thessaloniki port valued at $7 million ($4 million for "Makpetrol" and $3 million for the Skopje Oil Refinery), for the time being all financial deals for purchasing oil derivatives from the East and the West are successfully covered. At this moment, 5,500 metric tons of Italian gas have been transferred in the country, and an equal quantity is expected to arrive at the Refinery from the same supplier. Moreover, an agreement was signed this month with the Bulgarian company "Neftokhim" for 42,000 tons of derivatives from Bulgarian producers. It is also news that in the days to come there will be discussions on a peak state level for convoy transports that will cross the Macedonian-Bulgarian border two to three times per day in a well-organized way and without delays. This would buy time, but the very fact that the time and handling costs will be shortened means a good saving. "The experiences of the previous and the present embargo have greatly contributed to our good organization and, with the great help of the government and its interventions, the road for the derivatives has been shortened. Instead of using fuel tankers travelling for days from Burgas to Macedonia, we are now using the railroad transport across Bulgaria. More precisely, the derivatives arrive by railroad to Sandanski, Plovdiv, and Sofia, where they are loaded on fuel tankers; thus the time is shortened and the distribution dynamic is much better," Ljubomir Janev told us. Beside the eastern transport, there are negotiations with Albania for the possible use of the western coast. There is an intention to lease two tanks for light derivatives in Valona, and it has been agreed to purchase 7,000 tons of "virgin oil" for Macedonia, in order to discharge the capacities which can be used for storing derivatives for Macedonia from Italy, Rijeka, or other suppliers sailing on the Adriatic Sea.
