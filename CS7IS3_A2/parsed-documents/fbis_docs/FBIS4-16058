In his view, Russians should come to terms with the need to give these islands back to Japan, sooner or later. In his view, none of the democratic politicians are an attractive or constructively uniting figure for the 1996 presidential elections. For this reason Boris Yeltsin could run for reelection under the proviso, however, that he "shows in no uncertain terms where his social support lies, seeks support from specific organizational/political structures and sheds the role, adopted over recent years, of charismatic leader of the nation who is supposed to be fully aware of what is going on in the nation and can rely on its support at any time." Burbulis said that Boris Yeltsin had a realistic chance to become a strong president, a head of state. For his part, Burbulis would work for creating a base of support for the president. In Burbulis's words, "today Yeltsin remains a major source of stability in the country and we, while reproaching him justly, must give him sufficient backing for our own good." Burbulis said that while the formation of a political party by Yegor Gaydar was a historically legitimate idea he also believed that this idea led nowhere. He explained that the new party would rely too much on the confrontation and denunciation that had worked in the past.
