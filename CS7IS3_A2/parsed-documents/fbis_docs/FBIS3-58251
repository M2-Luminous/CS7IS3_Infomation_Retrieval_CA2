You are the man of the day for several reasons. First, because you have just come back from a lightning trip to Saudi Arabia with Edouard Balladur -- without anything very specific, in fact, but a lot of promises. Are you dIsappointed? [Leotard] No, no. Not disappointed. With contracts that are likely to end up being signed, and which are very large, but that was not the only, or major, aim of our visit. We also held very important political discussions in that country. [Giesbert] Good. You are also the man of the day because of the NATO summit opening in Brussels today. There is going to be a lot of talk about Bosnia. By the way, did you see the article by Bernard Koucher and Michel Rocard in yesterday's JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE? For them, the alternative is simple: Get shooting or get out. In other words, humanitarian action is over now; we have to move on to military action. [Leotard] Yes. A black and white solution in this sort of tragedy -- it is not very responsible to say that. [Giesbert] But before you were a minister, did you not use to say the same sort of thing? [Leotard] Let me tell you that as far as shooting is concerned, we do that when we have to respond. Getting out means abandoning the women and children that we are currently protecting, the civilian population in other words, giving up the French role in that part of the world. It probably means allowing the conflagration in the Balkans to spread. So, I do not think that the alternative is as brutal, or as simple, if I may say so, as that. We are retorting, and we will go on retorting still more if we go on being attacked. That is quite proper. But at the same time we are holding discussions with our partners to see how we can continue to manage the situation politically, and not just militarily. [Giesbert] People do not always understand your position very clearly. One day you raise the question of a withdrawal from Bosnia, another day you raise the need for reinforcements, and in the end you [word indistinct] on Bosnia. [Leotard] No, you journalists in general are strange. You ask if we are going to stay indefinitely, and we say no, because we do not stay indefinitely anywhere in the world. Then you say: Ah, that means you are going to withdraw? It is obvious that one day or other the United Nations forces -- the United Nations forces, not just French ones -- will withdraw from Bosnia. That is obvious. But we are not going to do it now. [Giesbert] Before becoming a minister you adopted very hard-line, very interventionist positions. [words indistinct] [Leotard] Mr. Giesbert, when there were no troops on the ground, not a single soldier, and not a single French soldier of course, I supported air strikes -- and I remain convinced that I was right. Once we have soldiers on the ground, who are humanitarian forces, accompanying convoys, let us make sure that air strikes -- which one day or other will of course have to be made -- do not have even more serious consequences [words indistinct]. [passage omitted] [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, the NATO summit will also deal with the problem of the former people's democracies, like Poland, or the Czech Republic, who want to join the club. Do you think they should be made to wait, and then given a hard time, as is happening? [Leotard] I think their movement toward the West, toward us, should be done in stages. We suggested to them that they should be associated with the WEU, which is our European security organization, and today and tomorrow in Brussels we will discuss the American formula -- which is not contradictory, in fact -- of partnership for peace. In other words, what we want is to bring them in progressively, and not all at once, to the security process that we Europeans are now constructing. I think this is the right way. [Giesbert] I imagine you have read the AFP interview with the president? [on France not rejoining NATO military command and need for nuclear tests] [Leotard] Of course. [Giesbert] Had he shown it to you before? [Leotard] No, and I can tell you that I see him every week because that is my job, and we tell each other what each has to say on the problems of defense, that is to say, according to our responsibilities. There is nothing in the interview that I am not aware of, that might worry me. [Giesbert] He rejects a French return to the NATO command. You agree with that? [Leotard] Yes. We have always said that. The current government shares this position completely. [Giesbert] He also comes out against a resumption of nuclear tests. You agree with that too? [Leotard] That is the only point -- and even here he knows quite well that we are not in agreement, except in the short-term, because in the short-term there is of course no threat to our deterrent force, which is perfectly credible. But we think, I think, and will go on thinking, that over several years, (?as soon as possible) we will have to resume testing with a very specific aim, namely so that France can acquire simulation techniques. We cannot get these techniques -- which will make it possible for us to do without tests to a large extent -- without holding some today, precisely in order to acquire this technology -- as the Americans have done, incidentally, in the past few years and months. So that is the only point, but he is very well aware of the government's position and his own. [passage omitted]
