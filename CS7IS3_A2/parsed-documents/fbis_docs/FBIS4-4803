Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in a letter last month that war might return to the Korean peninsula over Pyongyang's alleged nuclear arms development program. In the March 24 letter released by the United Nations on Monday [4 April], Kim suggested that if the U.N. Security Council followed U.S. calls for a resolution against Pyongyang, the unfortunate history of the 1950s might return to the Korean peninsula. Last month, after a team of experts reported difficulties inspecting North Korean nuclear sites, the United States began lobbying members of the Security Council for a resolution urging Pyongyang to comply with international safeguard accords. In the letter, Kim also declared that North Korea would resume its peaceful nuclear activities and warned that it may follow through with its decision last year to withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. On March 31, at the urging of China and nonaligned nations, the Security Council adopted a softened presidential statement calling on Pyongyang to comply with the inspections demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The letter requested Butrus-Ghali's help in attaining a fair resolution to the issue.
