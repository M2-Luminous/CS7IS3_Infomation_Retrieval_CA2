He noted that the Central Electoral Commission treats with understanding those lawmakers who have not decided whether to be members of parliament or to hold their present government posts. "We do not prod legislators, since we understand that there will be government reshuffling, and it may turn out that some parliamentarians who will give up their seats in parliament, will later lose their government jobs," he noted. At the same time Beloborodov stressed that those lawmakers who have not decided this question as yet, should remember that "the Central Electoral Commission should know for sure who will work at the new parliament by the first joint sitting of the two chambers which is to be held in the Kremlin next week," he noted.
