[Watanabe] I thought the coalition might leave some cabinet posts open and headhunt senior members of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to fill vacancies in six cabinet posts (which were occupied by the SDPJ under the Hosokawa administration). So I am glad to see they filled the cabinet posts at once. I think the cabinet lineup is satisfactory, considering the people the coalition had available. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What is your opinion on calls for dissolution of the lower house or the mass resignation of the cabinet immediately after enactment of the fiscal 1995 budget? [Watanabe] At the end of the ongoing session, the Diet will have to discuss scandals (involving former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa) and other pending issues, and a no-confidence motion may be brought forward depending on manners (of the Hata administration). If the SDPJ supports the motion, the Hata cabinet would have to decide whether to resign en masse or dissolve the lower house. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] If the Hata cabinet is forced to resign, do you think it is possible to form a coalition government made up of the LDP and SDPJ? [Watanabe] If the two parties form a coalition without a clear policy accord, the administration will meet the same fate as the Hosokawa administration. It would be difficult (to form a full-fledged administration of the two parties). The resignation of the Hata cabinet is more likely to result in a realignment of political parties. The SDPJ should take a more realistic attitude toward security ties with the United States. With respect to legislation for emergency situations (in connection with the Korean peninsula), Japan cannot be freed from logistics support duties. (In the case of an emergency), the Self-Defense Forces are supposed to supply fuel and provisions to U.S. vessels in operation. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Some quarters say confusion in political circles should be cleared up by an immediate general election. Do you agree? [Watanabe] I think that is the due process of constitutional politics. It would not hurt the political reform laws. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Could you describe the LDP's strategy for winning back ruling power? [Watanabe] I believe the LDP must try harder to change its negative image, as its policies are widely supported by the public. Of course, the LDP's drastic renovation may include a change of the party's name. The question here is whether or not we are ready to take action. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] LDP President Yohei Kono is critical of the political manners of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. What is your comment on that point? [Watanabe] So many people think so, and I was surprised when I noticed how many people dislike him. I did not realize it at all. They say he is too opinionated and secretive. In fact, the people are afraid of his dictatorship under the single-seat constituency system. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] But, Mr. Watanabe, you are still looking for a policy-oriented merger of conservative parties, are you not? [Watanabe] I have been saying it is more natural to join forces with those who have common goals and methodology. I wonder why everybody does not do that. Politics must not be run on grudges. Based on emotions, people are saying they hate the LDP and some other parties. He (Ozawa) also has some points which merit blame; he should correct his manners a little. I think he is a man of deed who has clear ideas. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Can you and President Kono win back the LDP's ruling position? [Watanabe] I am not sure about that until I actually face the situation. At the least, I will try.
