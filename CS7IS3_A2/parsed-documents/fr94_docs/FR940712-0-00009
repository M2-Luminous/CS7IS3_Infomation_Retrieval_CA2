FR940712-0-00009 FR940712-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Research and Special Programs Administration 49 CFR Part 195 [Docket No. PS&hyph;117; Amdt. 195&hyph;53] RIN 2137&hyph;AB86 Transportation of Hazardous Liquids at 20 Percent or Less of Specified Minimum Yield Strength AGENCY: Research and Special Programs Administration, (RSPA), DOT. ACTION: Final Rule. SUMMARY: RSPA's hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations do not apply to steel pipelines that operate at 20 percent or less of specified minimum yield strength (SMYS). This final rule extends the regulations to three groups of these pipelines: pipelines that transport highly volatile liquids, pipelines or pipeline segments in populated areas, and pipelines or pipeline segments in navigable waterways. Accidents have shown that regulating these pipelines or pipeline segments would be in the interest of public safety. Moreover, the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 provides that DOT may not exclude hazardous liquid pipelines from regulation based solely on operation at low internal stress. The final rule responds to this statutory prohibition and will reduce the risk that hazardous liquid pipelines present to public safety and the environment. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: L.M. Furrow, (202) 366&hyph;2392, regarding the subject matter of this final rule. Contact the Dockets Unit, (202) 366&hyph;4453, for copies of the final rule or other docket material.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background RSPA's hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations do not apply to pipelines operating at a stress level of 20 percent or less of SMYS (hereafter ``low-stress pipelines'') (see 49 CFR 195.1(b)(3)). DOT excluded these pipelines from part 195 when it first issued the regulations (34 FR 15473; October 4, 1969). However, serious accidents have occurred on low-stress pipelines, suggesting that this blanket exclusion is no longer in the interest of public safety. Moreover, Section 206 of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (PSA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;508; October 24, 1992), amended ยง203(b) of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (HLPSA) (49 App. U.S.C. 2002(b)) to provide that ``[i]n exercising any discretion under this Act, the Secretary shall not provide an exception to regulation under this Act for any pipeline facility solely on the basis of the fact that such pipeline facility operates at low internal stress.'' On October 31, 1990, RSPA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on low-stress pipelines (55 FR 45822). The notice described accidents and rulemaking recommendations. We analyzed data received in response to that notice to learn the benefits and costs of regulating low-stress pipelines. The analysis showed that many operators could face costs disproportionate to benefits if RSPA regulated all low-stress pipelines subject to the HLPSA. So we focused on those low-stress pipelines that pose a higher risk to people and the environment. We identified the commodity in transportation and the location of the pipeline as significant risk factors. RSPA then published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (58 FR 12213; March 3, 1993) that addressed these risk factors. The NPRM proposed to apply the safety standards in part 195 and the drug testing rules in 49 CFR part 199 to low-stress pipelines that transport highly volatile liquids (HVL), traverse populated areas, or traverse navigable waterways. These pipelines were targeted because failures of HVL pipelines usually result in more deaths and injuries than other pipeline failures, and failures in populated areas and navigable waterways generally result in more damages to people and the environment. Furthermore, the risk of outside force damage, a major cause of pipeline accidents, is greater in populated areas and navigable waterways, making failures there somewhat more likely. The proposed rules would address the statutory restriction (quoted above) on administrative discretion in regulating hazardous liquid pipelines. The proposed rules also would respond to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380), which requires DOT to regulate oil pipelines to prevent pollution of navigable waters. The NPRM proposed regulating four kinds of pipelines operating at 20 percent or less of SMYS: gathering lines, trunk lines, inter-facility lines, and delivery lines. Unaffected were pipelines that part 195 does not cover for a reason besides low operating stress. For example, the NPRM did not propose regulating low-stress rural gathering lines. Part 195 does not apply to petroleum gathering lines in rural areas, regardless of the pipeline's operating stress level (see ยง195.1(b)(4)). Also, with regard to low-stress pipelines that do not transport HVL, the proposed rules did not affect pipelines or pipeline segments that lie outside populated areas or navigable waterways. However, controls or equipment on excepted segments that are necessary for the safe operation of pipeline segments inside populated areas or navigable waterways (e.g., pressure controls) would have to meet part 195 requirements.
