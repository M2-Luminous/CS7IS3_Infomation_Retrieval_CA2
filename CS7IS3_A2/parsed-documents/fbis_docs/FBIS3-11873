The ideals of Bolivar, Jefferson, Marti, Juarez, Morazan, San Martin, and all those who fought to make America a great nation compel us to see this commitment as the continuation of our liberator's task. In addition, we see it as a recognition of the common identity and joint ideals of all Americans. They also compel us to receive it as an expression of friendship for and trust in a modern and renewed Colombia, something that fills us with pride and gratitude. The community of American nations has considered the modernization of our institutions, renewal of our social, economic, and commercial structure, and expansion of political and civil rights; in sum, the commitment and effort to put Colombia in step with the times. With the support of all, we will devote ourselves to the task of starting a new era in hemispheric relations. You can rest assured that since we accepted the nomination, we clearly understood what would entail the challenge of redesigning the future of the inter-American system. We have an unyielding and firm commitment to integration. We wish peace, democracy, protection of human rights, justice, and liberty. We hope for the expansion of commerce and economic welfare. These aspirations will undoubtedly strengthen the American union and will be put at the service of the unavoidable and collective destiny of all our peoples. My commitment. Under current circumstances it is to serve the continent. The time has come in which the OAS has ahead of it the responsibility of setting new paths within the context of a changing world, which is demanding the articulation of new international relations, more egalitarian, with more solidarity and a higher awareness of the capacities and needs of every region. This is one of those rare moments in history in which we are called to respond with courage and creativity to a great opportunity. The Cold War is over. It is not sufficient to talk of a new world order; in fact, this is unavoidable. Our challenge is to mold it so that the initial euphoria, which has vanished now, will generate hope and a clear path instead of yielding to uncertainty and confusion. I will promote an integrating OAS that joins, unites, complements, and turns into the catalytic agent that joins the processes and initiatives of economic liberation and commercial integration the hemisphere is experiencing. The Bolivarian dream of unity should also be reflected in the creation of a great free trade zone that links the immense territories from Alaska to Patagonia and shows the world the greatness of an America that supports itself in its untold resources and its multiethnic and multicultural nature. From that prostrate America with an outstretched hand that regretted its own destiny, we have witnessed a birth, a new and second opportunity, a new hemisphere that is demanding solidarity and cooperation, equitable commerce, and development and struggles against poverty for the sake of equality and dignity. A conjunction of interests has been born, filled with autonomy and values, proud of itself and assured of its future, which is already holding fluid and dynamic talks with the European Union, the Asia of the Pacific Basin, Africa, and other world regions. They, the Americas and the Caribbean, recognize the virtues of mutual cooperation, the need to take everywhere--on islands and the mainland--the progress and benefits of new and productive alliances for development. The new OAS will preserve, defend, and reinforce the prevalence of human rights, democracy and its freedoms, while respecting the identity, aspirations, and path chosen by each people who will have in the OAS an unconditional ally in the defense of their institutions. Today more than ever, our countries are legitimizing their institutions, reaffirming their democracies, and proclaiming new constitutions which reiterate the American ideal of freedom, justice, and equality. We plan to transform the OAS into a major forum in which every nation, especially those truly in need, will be able to discuss their cultures, achievements, and concerns, as well as their living conditions, in such a way that it will enrich cooperation agreements with our hemisphere. This will enable us to advance together as one, without differences or disputes. Our primary concern lies in coming closer together with each passing day and moving toward equitable and dignified standards of living for all of our brothers in the Americas. Our natural resources -- including the Latin American environment that stretches from the tundra, across seas and rivers, all the way to the pampa -- are entitled to our best efforts to ensure their protection and conservation. It is our responsibility to our children and history to exhaust all means possible to prevent deterioration or uncontrolled exploitation. In terms of my predecessor Joao Baena Soares, in the name of the three Americas and the Caribbean, I would like to acknowledge his relentless efforts over the past 10 years to uphold this organization's leadership and to transform it into a forum committed to consultation, overcoming difficult situations created by new and fragile democracies. All of these efforts required a man of his temperament and his knowledge. To my opponent, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, as well as to all of the other candidates -- of which I must mention Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas and Mr. Carlos Iturralde from Bolivia -- I would like to express my appreciation for their taking part in this outstanding and first-rate debate, which will undoubtedly enrich our future ideas. The final vote shows a willingness to unite and to move in a direction which, I dare say, demands we head toward action and renewal. To my Colombian compatriots, I urge all of you to continue providing your support, because this new phase of the OAS represents both a victory and a commitment for us, as both Colombians and as Americans. Our Foreign Relations Ministry headed by Minister Noemi Sanin Rubio, who has conducted her duties with professionalism, devotion, and patriotism, deserves a warm acknowledgement from all of Colombia. Our diplomatic corps in Washington, the Americas, the Caribbean, and throughout the world, as well as all of those officials working abroad for the good of Colombia, have performed in a praiseworthy manner. Thanks to all of these people, our country will accept this honorable appointment which the president will receive once the constitutional regulations governing this matter are met and his mandate concludes on 7 August 1994 -- the date up until which I will direct Colombian's destiny as part of my official duties. Alberto Lleras Camargo, the first OAS secretary general, interpreted the organization's commitment to integration, democracy, and progress with these words: We intend to transform the hemisphere into man's worthy sanctuary, employing his best attributes, and defending his liberty. This is our commitment also, just as it was yesterday, and just as it will continue to be tomorrow. Thank you.
