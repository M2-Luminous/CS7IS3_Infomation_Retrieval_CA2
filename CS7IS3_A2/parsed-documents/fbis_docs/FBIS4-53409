The joint meeting was due to be held in Pyongyang and Kwangju of South Korea at the same time today on the patriotic initiative of the General Student Council of Chonnam National University to realize the noble aspirations of the participants in the uprising. Speaking at the meeting here, Pak Chang-kwang, vice-chairman of the Student Committee Kim Chaek University of Technology, and others said although the Kwangju popular uprising which started because of the frantic repressive offensive by the U.S. imperialists and their stooges, the remnants of "Yusin", failed due to brutal armed suppression by the oppressors, it was a just patriotic resistance which recorded a most brilliant chapter in the South Korean students and people's history of anti-U.S., anti-fascist struggle and the biggest massive uprising unprecedented in the modern history of national liberation struggle. They pointed out that the noble desire of the participants in the Kwangju popular uprising for independence, democracy and reunification has not been realized although 14 years have passed since the uprising and the rancour of thousands of Kwangju citizens who were murdered in cold blood has not been wreaked. Noting that the U.S. imperialists were pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula to a touch-and-go phase of nuclear war on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, they said the South Korean students and people should wage a more unremitting anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuke struggle to get the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and their nuclear weapons withdrawn from South Korea and smash their nuclear war provocation moves. They stressed that the entire students of the university would join hands firmly with the fellow students of Chonnam National University in South Korea and wage a vigorous struggle to achieve national unity and make a breakthrough in the reunification of the country, upholding the "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" advanced by the great leader President Kim Il-song. A declaration on the establishment of sisterly relations and a resolution on the joint struggle against the U.S. imperialists and for the resignation of Kim Yong-sam were read at the meeting. The resolution says they, as students responsible for the future of the country and the nation, cannot remain a mere onlooker to the aggressive and treacherous acts of the United States and its stooges. It indicates common fighting goals of the students of Kim Chaek University of Technology and Chonnam National University to decisively counter them. The declaration says the students in the North and the South would develop independent exchange and contribute to achieving the great unity of the whole nation, assume their looks as students of the generation of reunification and contribute to the reunification of the country in '95.
