FR941219-2-00040 FR941219-2-00030 [FRL&hyph;5124&hyph;9] Arizona: Final Determination of Adequacy of State Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of Final Determination of Full Program Adequacy for Arizona's Application. SUMMARY: Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 6945 (c)(1)(B), requires States to develop and implement regulatory programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfill facilities (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator hazardous waste will comply with the revised federal MSWLF criteria, codified at 40 CFR Part 258 (the Federal MSWLF Criteria). Section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate regulatory programs for MSWLFs. Approved State MSWLF programs provide interaction between the State and MSWLF owners and operators regarding site-specific approval conditions. Only owners or operators located in States with approved programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by 40 CFR Part 258 to the extent the state program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that the Federal MSWLF Criteria apply to all MSWLFs, regardless of the approval status of any state program or individual facility. Arizona applied for a determination of adequacy under Section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Arizona's application and issued for public comment a tentative determination that Arizona's program is adequate to ensure compliance with the revised MSWLF criteria. Based on a thorough review of Arizona's MSWLF program and the fact that the only comments EPA received supported the tentative determination, EPA is today issuing a final determination that Arizona's MSWLF program is adequate. EFFECTIVE DATE: The determination of adequacy for Arizona shall be effective on December 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: U.S. EPA Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California, 94105. Attn: Ms. Donna J. Orebic, mail code H&hyph;W&hyph;3, telephone (415) 744&hyph;2092. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated the Federal MSWLF Criteria, codified at 40 CFR part 258. Subtitle D of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6941&hyph;6949(a), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop regulatory programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal MSWLF Criteria. Section 4005 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945, also requires that EPA determine the adequacy of State MSWLF programs to ensure that facilities comply with the Federal MSWLF Criteria. To facilitate this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State and Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State and Tribal landfill regulatory programs. EPA has approved, and will continue to approve, State MSWLF programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. Prior to the promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will continue to be made on the basis of statutory authorities and requirements. EPA interprets the statutory requirements for States to develop ``adequate'' regulatory programs to impose several minimum standards. First, each State must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State also must provide for public participation in facility approval and enforcement as required in Section 7004(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6974(b). Finally, the State must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. EPA Regions will determine whether a State has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA expects States to meet all of the criteria for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. In addition, States may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. On May 6, 1994, Arizona submitted an application for program adequacy determination. On September 15, 1994, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Arizona's program. Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 59 FR 47332 (September 15, 1994).
