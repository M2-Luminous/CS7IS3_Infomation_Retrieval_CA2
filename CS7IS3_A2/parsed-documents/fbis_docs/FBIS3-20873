The philosophy of the changes was approved by the leadership of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in January; subsequently, directors of labor offices were familiarized with this philosophy. The document divides the instruments of APZ into seven topical groups as follows: 1. Job Training A change in the structure of professions is the most effective APZ instrument available in solving the discrepancy between supply and demand in the area of manpower. Organizationally, job training will be handled on three levels--at the initiative of the labor offices, at the initiative of applicants for employment themselves, and at the initiative of employers. In the first case--that is to say, in the case of activities organized by the labor offices--the goal is to provide room for the training of applicants who lack any previous work experience, to facilitate the deliberate training of applicants who have been registered at the labor office for more than six months (and, in limited quantities, also provide for nonspecific training), and, finally, to provide nonspecific training for those who have been registered for long periods. The financing of this type of activity will be accomplished in the same manner as has been the case for requalification up to now. An applicant or a person interested in employment may initiate his own job training if, on the one hand, the labor office recognizes the purposefulness of this training in terms of subsequent job placement, and also a person (who is already unemployed or one who has already received notice according to Section 46, Letters a through c, of the Labor Code) whose existing profession is unassertable in the labor market. In the case of applicants for specific jobs, the labor office may defray up to two-thirds of the costs involved; in the event of the nonspecific training of those interested in employment, it may defray up to one-third of the costs, and, in the case of specific training of job applicants, it may again defray up to two-thirds of the overall costs. Training organized by an employer is intended to cover the need for manpower in the case of a change in production from existing resources, and, on the other hand, it is intended to facilitate the smooth transition to other jobs for those employees who are released for so-called organizational reasons. In case of an employee whom the organization would be demonstrably releasing (and whose profession is not very assertable on the labor market) but whom the organization would continue to employ after retraining, the state share of financing this training could amount to up to one-half of the costs. If a released worker is being retrained (and has an unassertable profession) for another employer (customized training), the compensation paid by the state could amount to as much as two-thirds of the costs. The same is true where an organization is training employees of another institution that it will subsequently hire. 2. Contractual Jobs The currently not overly clear category of "socially purposeful job" (SUPM) will be replaced by the precisely defined variations used in creating so-called contractual jobs (SM): All types of financial assistance applicable to the present SUPM categories will be applicable to the SM categories in the form of self-employment by applicants and selected groups of those interested in employment in the form of individual entrepreneurial activity (plus the subsequent possible creation of additional jobs). The specific types of compensation of costs connected with the development of new jobs will be judged by the labor offices; the maximum possible amount of the contribution will amount to 60,000 korunas [Kc] (a condition for this is the minimum two-year existence of a given job). Contractual jobs with employers should contribute to solving the problems of regional unemployment (particularly in regard to the more poorly assertable professions). The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs plus other organs of state administration shall periodically establish regions (identified by name or through the form of criteria) in which it is possible to provide financial support for this type of contractual job. The appropriate labor office will then announce a selection proceeding. For purposes of solving unemployment in certain territories by shifting manpower to another region, there should be the possibility of announcing this proceeding even outside of the territory administered by the initiating labor office (following agreement with the office that has jurisdiction in that region). But, fundamentally, these must be new jobs for registered applicants. In such a case, the financing is the same as for all types of existing SUPM creations, with a maximum amount of the contribution per job amounting to Kc50,000. It is expected that the possibility will exist to defray all types of ongoing and one-time costs connected with the creation and operation of the job involved (according to the judgment of the labor office), but for a maximum period of 12 months. The developed contractual job must exist for a period of two years. An instrument to facilitate entrance to the labor market is represented by contractual jobs in the form of specialized work done by graduates of schools and by young people. The method is again the announcement of a selection proceeding (following agreement with the labor office, even in another region). The overall sum of the state contribution per job must not exceed Kc50,000. The time limit for defraying these expenses is 12 months. In justified cases, where the employment conditions are terminated prematurely, however, the labor office may forgo the enforced recovery of the resources expended. The temporary placement of unqualified applicants for employment (and those who are difficult to retrain), with the objective of finding them long-term employment, is the principal motive behind the development of those contractual jobs categorized as short-term employment for those who are difficult to place. These jobs should come into being on the basis of agreement between the labor office and the employing institution on a priority basis in such cases where the employer pledges to maintain at least a portion of the jobs that have been developed. In such a case, the state may compensate the employer for wages paid for a period of six months for contractual jobs so created and may, moreover, pay him a contribution of Kc20,000, provided the employer pledges to maintain the job in question for an additional 12 months and employs the original applicant in that position. Furthermore, the employer may receive compensation for wages paid for a leader of a working group made up of at least five such short-term employees for a period of six months. The group leader need not be a job applicant of record but must not be originally a basic employee of the institution involved. 3. Public Investments A new instrument of the APZ--employment on public investment projects--differs conceptually from the previous understanding. Work categorized as periodic activities of community and public entities will no longer be subsidized; rather, support will be forthcoming for investments made from public resources, which will create prerequisites for the development of new and permanent jobs. It will be possible to finance this kind of activity to the full extent of wage expenses incurred by placed applicants (12 months), the costs of mobility (possibly even of providing quarters for a period of six months) of employees who have been hired, and the wage costs even for the group leader (with at least five subordinates) who is not an original employee of the institution involved. 4. Employing the Physically Handicapped Support for the creation of jobs for citizens with impaired work abilities or those who are permanently handicapped will mainly take the form of subsidies for newly created protected workplaces and their operation. The state contribution per job developed can, in extreme cases, amount to as much as Kc100,000 (in the event a permanently handicapped person is placed). A condition is a minimum two-year duration of this job. The state contribution toward the operation of a protected workshop (work site) will amount to as much as Kc20,000 per job, in the event this is essential for purposes of preserving that job. 5. Partial Employment Agreements Employment on the basis of other than a complete work agreement should solve the work assertion of individuals who are not in a position to accept a complete work agreement (for example, those caring for a child, etc.). Moreover, this form of employment should form a certain barrier against releasing employees in cases where the employer is switching over to a new production program. Financially, it is possible to cover all types of expenses connected with the establishment of such a job (for example, even a contribution for transporting material in the case of work at home, etc., is possible). The total contribution must not exceed Kc25,000 and can be available for a maximum of 12 months. The job must exist for at least two years. The new system of an active employment policy no longer counts on employing people on the basis of a partial employee obligation (so-called kurzarbeit--short-term work). This instrument will be utilized individually only in cases where its effectiveness is clearly documented. 6. Transport Contribution This is a new instrument of an APZ that will make it possible to mitigate the negative impact of a reduced number of transportation lines usable for commuting to work. "Clients" in this case are thus the job applicants whose placement is demonstrably hampered by nonexistent transport connections. The regions in which this instrument will be applied will be determined either by the Directorate of Employment Services of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs or jobs of this type will come into being at the initiative of the labor offices or directly at the initiative of job applicants. Subsidizing opportunities will consist of the state paying part of the cost of the employer incurred for transporting workers (on the basis of temporary calculations). The maximum monthly subsidy per job, however, can be at the most Kc1,000 and will be paid for a maximum of one year. 7. Projects Involving the Territorial Revival of Employment A new APZ instrument in the form of regional projects for the revival of employment has as its goal the systems solution of this problem in those regions that are most impacted. These projects formulate the most effective variation of the money flow to support the APZ and recommend even additional possible measures that contribute to solving unemployment (for example, the economic stimulation of suitable entrepreneurial efforts at various locations, etc.). The processing of these projects will be entrusted to specifically identified firms (for example, institutions that have experience regarding territorial planning, and organs of state administration and self-administration should be participating on a "subsupplier" basis (free of charge). The project will be assigned on the basis of a selection proceeding, announced by the labor office and evaluated by a coordinating commission (made up of representatives of the region--for example, the okres office, the self-administration office, the labor office, the education office, the bank, etc.). This same commission is simultaneously the control organ for the project. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs will identify those regions in which it is possible to finance projects of territorial employment revival out of state resources. This means the compensation of costs (up to their full extent) incurred for processing the project, as well as the costs of the activities of the coordinating commission (for a period determined by the labor office, and to a maximum of Kc30,000).
