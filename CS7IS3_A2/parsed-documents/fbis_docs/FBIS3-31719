Tamara is a state-of-the-art air defense system, which, according to experts, can uncover even the "invisible" U.S. Stealth bomber. The attempt to obtain secret information on the production of Tamara was supposedly made by a certain Czech arms company. Stodulka did not specify which company it was, nor did he reveal any details about the espionage attempt. He did indicate, however, that the arms company wanted to gain access to information about Tamara by offering jobs to three key HTT Group employees. Ludek Stodulka also said that this unnamed company, in cooperation with foreign competitors, rendered it impossible for the HTT Group company to export Tamara, which can fetch up to $17 million, to one Persian Gulf country. The competitors supposedly thwarted the long-planned deal, which was to have been the first export of Tamara since 1992, by spreading false information about the radar's abilities.
