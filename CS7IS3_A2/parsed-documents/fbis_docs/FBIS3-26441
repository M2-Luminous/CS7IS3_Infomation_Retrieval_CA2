Hu Jintao, Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, Song Jian, Wang Zhaoguo, and responsible comrades from relevant departments attended the tea party. On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council, Song Jian extended season's greetings and warm regards to the specialists and scholars attending the tea party, as well as to the vast numbers of intellectuals across the country. In his speech, Song Jian said: Over the past year, our country enjoyed economic development, political stability, national unity, and social progress. The party and people are sincerely grateful for the diligent and creative work carried out by the vast numbers of intellectuals across the country. Speaking of the work to be carried out in the new year, Song Jian said: Our tasks will be heavier and more formidable. There is a wide scope for the vast numbers of intellectuals to fully display their ability and talent in pursuing the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Song Jian said: The status and role of our country's intellectuals has become more important with the development of the situation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important proposition -- "respect intellectuals and talented people," "intellectuals are members of the working class," and "science and technology are primary productive forces" -- has fundamentally established the status of our country's intellectuals. A social climate of embracing science, and of respecting learning and talent, has taken shape. The vast numbers of intellectuals are contributing to building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Their hard work has gained increasingly widespread recognition and respect in society. We firmly believe that the vast numbers of intellectuals will make fresh contributions to our country's socialist modernization, thus demonstrating a strong sense of responsibility and urgency toward this era. Song Jian said emphatically: Giving full rein to the role of talented people is the key to making our undertakings flourish. From now on, all competent departments should continue to implement the party's policy toward intellectuals, study new circumstances and solve new problems in the course of deepening institutional reform, and further create a good environment that is conducive to expanding the role of intellectuals. Specialists and scholars who attended the tea party -- which was jointly hosted by the CPC Central Committee's Organization, Propaganda, and United Front Work Departments; the Ministry of Personnel, the State Science and Technology Commission, the Ministry of Culture, and the People's Liberation Army's General Political Department -- included some Beijing-based academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS]; young and middle-aged specialists whose titles have been approved by the Ministry of Personnel and who have made outstanding contributions; specialists, scholars, and artists who receive special government allowances; prominent specialists selected from various departments; specialists admitted into the "Program for Cultivating Transcentury Personnel"; winners of awards for young scientists; and outstanding young and middle-aged scientists who receive special funds. Professionals from all fronts and specialists of several generations got together today to reminisce about the past and to talk about the future. The spacious banquet hall was filled with joy and laughter.
