They guarantee "to offer each other a shoulder to lean on" both in the economic sphere and in the utilization of financial, material, natural, personnel, and other resources. The two okrugs intend to unite their scientific-technical and information potential in conditions of the emergence of a market economy. Given that the okrugs of Yamalo-Nenets and Khanty-Mansiysk are main suppliers of oil and gas in Russia, the agreement will allow them to bring the question to the government's attention on a more fundamental basis in the interests of the territories.
