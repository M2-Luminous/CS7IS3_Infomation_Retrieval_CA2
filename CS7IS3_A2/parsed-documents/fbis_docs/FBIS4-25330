Also taking part in the discussion were representatives of the All-China Federation of Industry And commerce, and people without party affiliations. The national education working conference is the second such meeting convened by the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council since China started its policy of reform and opening to the world in the late 1970s. The meeting is considered to be very important for solving problems in China's educational reform and development. The people taking part in the discussion gave much advice and expressed their opinions on how to popularize the nine-year compulsory education system, how to develop vocational education and education for adults, and how to increase the input to education.
