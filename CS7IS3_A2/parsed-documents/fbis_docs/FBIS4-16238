Grachev believes there is a good chance of establishing united armed forces in the Commonwealth of Independent States by the end of the year. He admitted, however, that the pace of the process will largely depend on the economic situation in these states. Speaking to journalists after a meeting of the CIS defence ministers in Moscow on Thursday, Grachev stressed that the establishment of united armed forces will enable CIS member-states to begin thinking about an Eurasian defence union, which, according to the minister, will be "much bigger than the Treaty of Collective Security." "Together we will hold defenses, arm ourselves and make military equipment," he said. The meeting which was attended by 11 CIS defence leaders with the exception of Moldavian [Moldovan] minister focused on documents regulating the work of the secretariat of the collective Security Council and a declaration of states parties to the Treaty of Collective Security which outlines the basic principles of cooperation on security issues. The declaration will be submitted to the CIS leaders for signing on Friday. Grachev who chaired the meeting said that the CIS presidents will discuss, among other matters, issues connected with additional measures to protect the Tajik-Afghan border and the status of collective peace-keeping forces in Tajikistan.
