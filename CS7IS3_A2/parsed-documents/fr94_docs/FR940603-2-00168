Priority 6: ``The ADA: Civil Rights Law'' educational videotape. Lack of recognition that the ADA is a civil rights law, long held myths and stereotypes, and ignorance about the attitudinal and physical discrimination that people with disabilities face in their daily lives_not being able to enter the building to attend a child's school play; not being allowed to play on a sports team or participate in the town meeting; not being able to order a hamburger, drop off dry cleaning, or to rent a car_are thought to be major impediments to voluntary compliance with the ADA. The goal of Priority 6 is to produce and disseminate educational audiovisual materials illustrating discrimination, stereotypes and attitudinal barriers encountered by people with disabilities. The goal of this project is to identify the ADA as a civil rights law, distinct from a ``benefit program'', with the same historical background and battles associated with other types of civil rights legislation. The project will draw comparisons between discrimination encountered by people with disabilities and other protected classes of individuals and the historical struggle people with disabilities and others faced to gain the right to equality. Finally, the project will focus on the impact that complying with the ADA can have on changing stereotypes, eliminating barriers, and increasing access to goods, services, and activities. Educating the public about the abilities of people with disabilities to function well in an accessible environment and dispelling oft held myths and stereotypes can lead to increased voluntary compliance with the ADA. Materials developed in this project shall portray persons with disabilities in a positive manner and will be used to increase the general public's awareness of disability, accessibility and the ADA and its historical place in the development of civil rights legislation. The project should also strive to increase the level of communication between covered entities, people with disabilities, and providers of consultation services. Priority 6 is an ADA educational audiovisual project that shall include the following major components: _Create and disseminate broadcast quality educational videotapes, identifying the ADA as a civil rights law with protection for people with disabilities parallel to that provided under other civil rights legislation; _Edit to provide videotapes of varying lengths, suitable for use in a variety of broadcast situations (e.g., short segments to be used to promote the videotape or on magazine type programs, longer segments for viewing by audiences attending a meeting, etc.); _Identify target audience and state explicitly the number of people expected to be served in the course of the project's activities; _Specify how the project will reach all parts of the targeted audience, including racial and ethnic minority communities; _Identify types of attitudinal and physical discrimination that prevent people with disabilities from gaining equal opportunity and possible methods to eliminate discrimination; _Illustrate the increased independence persons with disabilities experience when barriers are removed;
