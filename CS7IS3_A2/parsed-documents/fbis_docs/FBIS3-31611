Stevo Crvenkovski said following a meeting with his Dutch counterpart Pieter Kooijmans that his country was prepared to resume talks with Greece over the issue, Kooijmans's spokesman Bob Hiensch told AFP. The dispute between Skopje and Athens over the use of the name Macedonia, which Greece claims belongs exclusively its own northern province of that name, came to a head last week, when Greece imposed and then stiffened a trade blockade against its neighbour. Greece has also demanded that Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic which gained independence in 1991 and which has since been recognised by most other European Community countries and the United States, stops "hostile propaganda" against Athens. [passage omitted] Crvenkovski, who ends a two-day official visit to the Netherlands on Tuesday, said the Greek sanctions were bitterly resented in Macedonia and that Greece had now closed its borders to all traffic barring trains.
