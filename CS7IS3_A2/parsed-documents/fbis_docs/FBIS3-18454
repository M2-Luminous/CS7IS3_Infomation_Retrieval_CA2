Rajoy justified presenting this initiative on the ground that "a definition of the model of autonomy is necessary" in view of the host of topics for debate, which require concluding a new national agreement similar to the constitutional agreement. The People's Party leader -- who presented the proposal together with Secretary for the Autonomy Area Jorge Fernandez -- was very critical of the government's attitude in this issue, "in which it must not be a bystander as it is," since the silence "has not only been that of the minister of public administration but also that of the prime minister himself." In Rajoy's opinion, the People's Party proposal is important enough "for it not to be dismissed by saying that it is simplistic." The People's Party deputy secretary general emphasized that his party's proposal gives the government an opportunity to tackle the problem "with all the calm that it deems appropriate, but with proper seriousness, because the only thing that is no solution is to do nothing, as the government is doing." With respect to the standardization of powers among the autonomous communities, he stated that this does not mean that they must all compulsorily assume all the powers defined as transferable if they do not want them, but that they have the opportunity to attain them. The People's Party is opposed to "preferential political treatment" for certain communities, "because the treatment can only be that resulting from the existence of a distinctive feature which we acknowledge, but that must entail not different but distinctive treatment." In Rajoy's opinion, the phrase "cafe for everybody" is often disparaged, "without taking into account the fact that the cafe can take many forms, but what is not possible is to be left without a cafe." With respect to the possibility of these matters being tackled bilaterally between the central government and each autonomous community, the People's Party deputy secretary general stated that the pact should be between the parties represented in parliament, "which are the ones representing national sovereignty," and which include the nationalist parties governing autonomous communities, but the bilateral relationship, which will also have to be present in the negotiations for the agreement, "should be conducted within the framework of the model of the state laid down by the Cortes." The differences between the Spanish Socialist Workers Party and the People's Party became clear in many other issues yesterday, with accusations and aspersions which conflict with the atmosphere of understanding which has recently existed between the two parties.
