The people's aspirations also will change. The prediction proved to be quite true because we recently saw the emergence of several events on the national scene. To cite an example, a series of events took place over the last two months. These events, which eventually turned into national issues, were putting us under a kind of pressure and were also worrisome. As a matter of fact, they can disrupt national unity and cohesion. Nobody seemed to know the perpetrators of the events or what their objectives were. However, it is apparent that these events are destructive to the people, the public order, and the country if they are not completely prevented from turning into sensitive issues. The allegation that the government was planning to shorten the retirement age for civil servants and to replace the leadership of the Functional Group faction in the House of Representatives were among the several issues that cropped up. The government formally had put an end to such rumors. The other issues concerned the liquidation of the Summa Bank's assets, the unpaid bank loans by 50 conglomerate companies, and the wish by professionals to create the ICKI [Association of Indonesian Nationalist Intellectuals]. The people who were involved in these issues were clamoring for support from President Suharto. The ICKI was dissolved even before it materialized. Prior to the press briefing by Murdiono, minister/state secretary, on the extension of General Feisal Tanjung's service as the commander of the Republic of Indonesia Armed Forces [ABRI], all sorts of speculation about the armed forces' top leadership were made by ABRI personnel at headquarters in Cilangkap. The unpleasant issue spreading at that time was that the ABRI is divided into factions. This is a very dangerous issue. The above-mentioned issues were only those that the public could gain access to through mass media reports. These did not include the rumors and gossip that spread nationwide about the mass protests and demonstrations taking place here and there in the country. Such issues are worrisome. If they are not immediately resolved, they can disrupt the national stability that we thus far have struggled very hard to achieve. It is not easy to know for sure the causes that led to the recent flare up of issues in the country. A special in-depth study of events is required to determine the causes. If we base our theory on the experience of several developing countries, such issues normally flare up when several existing institutions remain frozen, their functions are reduced, or they become defunct. Some institutions were granted a status quo position. As a matter of fact, all kinds of gossip and rumors became the daily menu [preceding word in English] while politicians were still facing obstacles in their efforts to reach a consensus to resolve the issues constitutionally. It is possible for issues to develop when the bureaucracy is obviously inefficient and is bogged down with the inability to make collective decisions on state matters. In a situation where there is no full guarantee for human rights protection and when economic disparity is widening, there will be more opportunities for the people to spread rumors about anything and everything. Generally, such a situation only will benefit a group of people such as those with a specific political ideology, "the annoyed people's front", and other movements that reject establishment. On the other hand, the rapid social development and the advancement of modern science and technology, which is affected by the currents of globalization, will add greater dynamism to the unsteady situation. We will see the emergence of a period of transition or national instability in this situation. Usually such a period also will provide the opportunity for several issues to develop. Ironically, they attract the people's attention. As we already know, our entry into the PJP II simultaneously marked the beginning of the take-off process in our efforts to upgrade the quality of our people from a developing agrarian society to a modern and industrialized society. The process of ugrading our society can also be called the transitional period. Several kinds of issues always spread in a transitional period. The matter to be decided now is, on one hand, the effort to create concrete measures to be taken to prevent the conflicting issues from spreading; and, on the other, to prevent the people from being trapped by such issues. Edi Sudrajat, minister of defense and security, has stressed repeatedly the significance of upholding the very foundation of the unitary republic and the need for the people to fully understand nationalism in the Republic of Indonesia, which has been handed down by the founders of the republic. This is important regarding the idea that Indonesia will be a strong country if all the various components that make up the nation are strong. The modernization trend can cause a nation that is not very strong to stumble into the process of disintegration and it finally will divide the nation and create disunity among the people.
