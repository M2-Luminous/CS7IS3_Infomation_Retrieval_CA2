Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to disband the U.N. command in South Korea in order to establish a new peace arrangement on the Korean peninsula. The Korean newspaper "NODONG SINMUN" reported today that Kim, also the vice-premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), had communicated with Butrus-Ghali on May 28 on the issue. Kim said an unstable truce has lasted for more than 40 years on the Korean peninsula, but the armistice set up then has now lost its validity because the U.S. has been shipping military equipment into South Korea. "The situation on the Korean peninsula has become more strained and the possibility of an armed conflict is increasing as the United States has massed huge reinforcements in and around South Korea and stepped up its military action against the DPRK," Kim said in the letter to Butrus-Ghali. He said that a new peace agreement is needed in order to prevent another war breaking out on the Korean peninsula. In 1992 DPRK and South Korea signed an agreement on reconciliation, non-aggression, cooperation and exchange but a truce still exists between the DPRK and the United States. Kim declared that the U.N. command was unrelated to the U.N. peace-keeping mission in South Korea and serves only U.S. strategic aims to isolate and stifle the DPRK and establish control over Asia and the Pacific region. In 1975, the 30th session of the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution, calling for the dissolution of the U.N. command and replacement of the existing armistice with a new peace agreement. Kim insisted that the U.N. must pay due attention to the DPRK's proposal and take practical measures to disband the U.S. command in South Korea. On April 28, the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement, proposing the establishment of a new peace mechanism to replace the existing Military Armistice Commission (MAC), but the proposal received no positive response from the U.S.. U.S. representatives claimed that the question of peace and security on the Korean peninsula should be tackled in principle through north-south dialogue in accordance with related agreements reached by the north and south in February 1992. In another development, the DPRK recalled all the members of the Korean People's Army (KPA) from the MAC in May and set up a KPA Mission at Panmunjom responsible for contacts with the military authorities of the U.S. and South Korea.
