It wishes to put the following points on record: First, the crime comes in the context of a scheme seeking to undermine the process of security and national accord which has made great progress with Syrian assistance. It aims to involve the country in a new cycle of violence, keep the Lebanese arena open to those who wish to exploit it in order to pressure and weaken Lebanon, throw Syria's role in Lebanon into confusion, and undermine the two countries' relationship. The crime comes in the wake of the bombing of the Phalangist Party headquarters in al-Sayfi and several other similar operations. A number of suspects were arrested after these operations, which proves that the same groups are responsible for all these crimes. Consequently, we ask the state: What point has the investigation into the al-Sayfi bombing reached? Would it not have been possible to halt all these assaults on Lebanon and these new crimes against the Lebanese people if the Lebanese security departments had succeeded in apprehending the al-Sayfi culprits? What point has the interrogation of the pro-Israeli ring reached? Some of this ring's leaders were uncovered, arrested, and accused of planning assassinations of Lebanese officials and the bombing of various places. We demand increased focus on these investigations and urge that all information that thus comes to light be made public. We all urge that the severest penalties, up to execution, be inflicted on the suspects. We call for measures to extradite Ghassan Tuma, the most prominent fugitive suspect linked to the aforementioned operations. Second, the PSP warned earlier of the consequences of having several diverse official security agencies that have no coordination whatsoever with each other. Indeed, some of their actions undermine the efforts seeking to maintain security, prevent infiltrations, or uncover criminals, particularly the perpetrators of crimes against the state's security. We reemphasize our call to reexamine this affair. We urge that this be done from the perspective of supreme national interest. If it is unavoidable to have all these separate agencies, at least let them be placed under a unified command and let matters follow their proper course. Third, it is clear that a single political-security operations room is making plans, implementing them, and trying to exploit the results. In the context of sectarian sedition and to cause greater rifts among the Lebanese people, some forces are now raising their heads and pretending to be concerned about the Christians' welfare and future. These forces already stand convicted of formerly involving the Christians in strife, causing their displacement from their homes, and forcing them to make suicidal choices that have cost them and cost Lebanon dearly. They now exploit any political or security incident to pressure, intimidate, and incite them, heighten their frustration, and then call for self-isolation and demand special guarantees. They try to do this just when all the Lebanese people are unanimous in their opinion that such crimes are directed against them all and against Lebanon's national unity and future. Hence, efforts must be made to isolate and excise this pro-Israeli tendency from Lebanon's national body and prevent it from achieving its aims. Fourth, in such circumstances, just as in our daily life, the media play a vital role. Some of them are part of the above-mentioned operations room and are consequently incapable of exercising the necessary self-censorship and halting the dangerous sectarian incitements so evident in their news and other programs. We urge the state to act promptly and pass a law organizing the audiovisual media. This law will lay down restrictions and prevent the use of media for such a purpose or other purposes that threaten national unity and national and social morality.
