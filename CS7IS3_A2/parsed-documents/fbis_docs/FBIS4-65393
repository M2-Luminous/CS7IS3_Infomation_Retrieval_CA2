Cetin was addressing the first meeting of the national committee set up for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, which will be marked next year. He pointed out that the massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina today is the result of a lack of political will on the part of the United Nations. Actually, he explained, the will of the United Nations is determined by the decision of a few countries. The decision of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council becomes the resolution of the entire United Nations. Naturally, at times, it is the interests of the permanent members that is reflected in a UN resolution or in its implementation. Consequently, it would be better to criticize the UN decisionmaking mechanism rather than the organization and its aims. Cetin pointed out that the phrase "We the peoples of the world" has been accepted as the slogan of the 50th anniversary celebrations, stressing that this saddles the United Nations with great responsibilities that must be fulfilled.
