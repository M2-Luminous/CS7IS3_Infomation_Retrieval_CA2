On Thursday Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov urged the lower chamber on behalf of the Russian President to refrain from such a decision, but the request was ignored. The TV and radio service will employ 49 people and is to daily report on activities of legislative authorities. Representatives of various factions will have 30 minutes of daily air time. The Duma thus followed suit of the former Russian legislature, the Supreme Soviet, which was dissolved by the President last September. It had also created its own TV service which appeared on central TV with the "parliamentary hour" programme. The broadcasts were intended to provide objective coverage of the work of the legislature which said that state-controlled media was biased about it.
