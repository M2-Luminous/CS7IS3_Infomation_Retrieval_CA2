First, the masses' concept about birth has changed and their concept about family planning has improved. In particular, because the masses have attained a better understanding of the reform and opening up policy, and few and optimal births as well as late marriage have become a habit among young people in some localities. According to statistics from the provincial statistical bureau, married couples of child-bearing age who only wish to have one or two children for the rest of their life account for 77 percent. In 1992 the one-child rate was 67.9 percent of the children born in that year. Second, the province's excessive population growth has been effectively controlled. In 1992 it was reduced by nine per thousand compared with 1987, the family planning rate increased by 21.7 percent, and the multiple-birth rate dropped by approximately 13.3 percent. The two children and multiple-birth rates have been basically changed. Third, family planning work standards have improved. Most localities in the province pay attention to family planning. Fourth, the province's population growth rate is approaching the country's advanced level. In 1992 the province's family planning ranked in the forefront of two digit localities in the country's provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. According to an estimate, in 1993 the province could fulfill the state's population control program.
