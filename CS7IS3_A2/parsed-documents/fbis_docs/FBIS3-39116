Has this policy not failed? [Kinkel] Certainly not. There is no alternative to this policy. To support the reform forces is not only Germany's policy but all significant countries pursue the same course. What we must achieve in Russia is that the developments toward law-governed and market-economy structures become irreversible, and that the revolutionary process comes to a standstill -- or, at least, to a consolidation so that this huge, important country can embark on quieter tracks. [Guensche] The figureheads among the reformers have abandoned ship.... [Kinkel] That is not quite true either. You are obviously alluding to Gaydar and Federov. It is true that the resignation of the two men was not a good signal because both had a good reputation in the West, for example at the IMF, the World Bank, among economic experts, and because one thought that they would be capable of implementing the necessary economic reforms that are so decisive for the political success of the Russian reforms. Yet, the real figurehead for the Russian reforms is President Yeltsin. [Guensche] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has spoken of the end of the market romanticism.... [Kinkel] Some of Mr. Chernomyrdin's recent remarks, if he really made them in the way they were received outside, were indeed somewhat irritating. Still, I think that he supports Yeltsin's policy. [Guensche] Mr. Illrionov, Chernomyrdin's economic adviser, has given up this week. Are all these events not serious warning signals? [Kinkel] Yes, they are warning signals. However, could anybody really expect the enormously difficult Russian transformation process from dictatorship to democracy, from total controlled economy to the market economy to have taken place rapidly and without any problems? My answer is: no. Problems, adjustments, setbacks were bound to occur. Still, this must not influence our policy of support for the reform forces. I repeat that I do not see any alternative to this policy. [Guensche] Is it not also a warning sign when President Yeltsin announces that he would defend more strongly the interests of the 25 million Russians living in the "immediate neighborhood," that is to say in the former Soviet republics? [Kinkel] Yeltsin is under pressure from the conservatives and extremists. He must take certain things into consideration. What you are referring to is not nice and must neither be belittled nor dramatized. [Guensche] Your counterpart, Kozyrev, claims a protective function for Russia in the Baltics, and has spoken of Russia's "special role" on the territory of the old Soviet Union. Does this not point to a U-turn in the former position? [Kinkel] Russia's relations with the Baltic countries are particularly sensitive as a result of the minority problems, the issue of the withdrawal of Russian forces, and the somewhat unfortunate legal regulations for Russians living in the Baltic countries. Still, we must not accept Russia's claims of hegemony. [Guensche] Is this not exactly what we did in the case of the NATO decision? [Kinkel] No, we have always said -- and I am doing it again -- that Russia cannot claim a veto right regarding the getting closer to NATO or membership of Central and East European reformist countries. Nevertheless, it is also in the interest of those countries that, by creating a new European security architecture, we avoid opening up new gulfs between Russia, the CIS countries, and the Central and East European countries. [Guensche] Do you not sometimes get the feeling that Russia is trying to resuscitate the old Soviet Union in a new form? [Kinkel] I am building on the success of the reform forces, who do not want that. Once again: One cannot be happy about some tendencies that began to emerge recently. The success of the extremists in the election is not something, either, that would strengthen confidence in this large and important country. Still, we must not lose patience and not expect too much too rapidly. [Guensche] How reliable is Yeltsin for you as a partner? [Kinkel] Yeltsin personifies and articulates the reform forces. We are banking on him and we hope that Yeltsin will hold his own, which is why we support him. [Guensche] Even people close to Yeltsin admit that the president is ill. Do you have any information on how ill he is? [Kinkel] No. [Guensche] What is your very personal prediction for the developments in Russia? [Kinkel] I am hopeful that things will turn out well. We want to contribute everything we can to it.
