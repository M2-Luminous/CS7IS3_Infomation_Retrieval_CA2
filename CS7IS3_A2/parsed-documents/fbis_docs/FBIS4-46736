Khuzin: "On the Theatre of Party Activities"] [Text] Our newspaper sometimes reports on the political forces of the oblast. What kind of forces are these, and what specifically do they do, for example in the electoral campaigns? --V. SHARKOV, Sysertskiy Rayon. The time of inception The first and last elections of USSR people's deputies in 1989 led to a bipolarization of our civil society. For Sverdlovsk Oblast specifically this meant a conditioal division of its residents into the "party of the Month" and the "party of Kudrin." The personified "multiparty system" was one of the stages of its birth. The groups supporting the candidates for deputy became that germ of future parties whose inception occurred specifically during the time of introduction of alternative choice into the country's political system. Not even 9 months had passed after the elections to the union parliament, and the first child was born in the Central Urals--the "Democratic Choice Movement" (DCM). The next elections, to the Russian parliament, also took place under conditions of bipolarity of civil society, but it was already of a higher level. There was a transition from the personified "bipartisanism" to an organized one--the CPSU [Communist Party of the Soviet Union] and the DCM competed against each other. And so, finally, the elections in December of 1993 demonstrated the polycentric party system. For the first time in many years, we saw voting according to party lists. In Russia, as we know, they are slow to hitch up the horses, but then they ride rather fast. And so it was in the question of a multiparty system, the country will evidently soon find itself "at the head of the entire planet." According to the lists of the RF Minyust [Russian Federation Ministry of Justice], over 120 organizations had the opportunity of participating in the December elections. Over 50 of them decided to exercise this opportunity, but only 35 engaged in gathering of voter signatures needed for participation in the elections under the proportional system. Twenty-one organizations gathered the required number of signatures. However, our very rich traditions of "holding and not letting in" allowed only 13 electoral associations to enter the final stretch. Moreover, "quite by accident" it happened that one of the primary political associations--the National Patriotic Association--"left" the arena of struggle. This, specifically, may explain the phenomenon of the Liberal-Democratic Party, which received the greatest number of votes. The process of mutual development of political pluralism and the electoral system for the present day is still far from its conclusion. This is true of the multi-party system, where the increase in numbers no longer facilitates the development of quality. This is true also of the system of elections, where we have noted shameless administrative intervention in the process of certain subjects of the electoral campaign. If we take specifically Sverdlovsk Oblast, we see the immaturity of the system of elections to the oblast Duma and the organs of local self-government prior to elections under the proportional system, or according to party lists. `Bumps and bruises' from past elections The December elections to the RF [Russian Federation] Federal Assembly are still fresh in our minds. Undoubtedly, their dominant factor was the activity, agitational and organizational, of the parties, movements and blocks, which facilitated the continued re-structuring of civil society. However, it is not difficult to note their main peculiarity--weak social roots, a strong cadre-oriented character, and a non-systematic method of work. Even before the elections, it was quite obvious that the upcoming campaign would lead to changes in the power ratio between the center and the regions, in favor of the former. The elections by party lists gave an undisputed priority to the candidates from Moscow and St. Petersburg. Even the introduction of the standard on the right to break down the party list of candidates for deputy into regional groups did not help. Plus, by some inscrutable administrative means, the electoral districts in the center turned out to be smaller in their number of voters than those in the provincial regions. And this meant that there were relatively more of them. Why should we now be surprised when around 62 percent of the deputies in the State Duma are from Moscow? Another rather new situation for us is the change in the relationship between the role of the individual and the organization. The introduction of party lists made it possible for individual candidates to seemingly hide behind the curtain of the party or the leader of their block, as a result of which there has been a depersonification of the candidate corps. Many of those who "did not get the light" of mandate got into the Duma. The next peculiarity which we cannot discount is the fact that the "apical nature" of parties conditions the formulation of a certain eliteness of the elections. A sort of closed system (group of persons) is formed, which by the method of a periodic "shuffling of the cards" holds in its hands the authority of power. To this one might object: What is so bad about that? After all, the formation of a stable elite in society facilitates its stable development. Furthermore, politics is not a matter for housewives. However, there is another side to this coin: Our elite, as a rule, is far from being uniform, and periodic "bulldog fights under the rug" cannot facilitate the development of true democracy, i.e., people's power. 12 December for Sverdlovsk Oblast, as, we might add, also for many other oblasts, became a notable day: For the first time, the majority of voters did not come to the electoral districts. Thus, one of the most widespread, age-old and chronic illnesses of traditional democracies--absenteeism (the refusal to vote in the elections) came also to our parts. It is interesting that preliminary polls conducted by the Committee on Relations with Public Associations under the oblast govenment showed that 42-54 percent of the voters intended to participate in the voting. There were some hopes placed on the "undecided" voters, particularly since no more than one-fourth of those surveyed categorically refused to vote. Nevertheless, the result was somewhat surprising--51 percent of the voters on the average throughout the oblast refused to vote. We may cite many reasons why this happened, and far from the last one of these is the factor of great polyvariation of the political choice. Many with whom we had occasion to speak since 12 December said just that: There were so many parties and candidates that it was impossible to sort them out, and therefore there was no sense in voting. Our sociological surveys came to the same conclusion. In mid-November, only one in ten respondents considered himself informed on the platforms of the parties and candidates. Approximately four out of five persons surveyed in different parts of the Central Urals noted that they did not know about the draft constitution, the statute on elections and the programs of those hoping to be elected to the Federal Assembly. So what is the choice? According to the all-federal party lists, there were 37 people nominated from Sverdlovsk Oblast. Among them: From "Choice of Russia"--10; from the Democratic Party (Travkin)--5; from the "Future of Russia--New Names" block--5; from the Movement for Democratic Reform (Sobchak)--3; from PRES [Party for Russian Unity and Accord] (Shakhray)--3; from "KEDR"--3; two each from the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia], the Agrarian Party and the "Civic Union", and one each from the Russian Communist Party and "Yabloko." Thus, out of 13 blocks our oblast countrymen were represented in 11 of them. Altogether by territorial okrugs in the oblast there were 34 candidates presented. Of those, three were from the double-mandate district to the Federation Council, 22 were from blocks and parties, and 12 were from the groups of electors to the State Duma. And so, what choice did we make? Most apparent is the rather small percentage of those who voted against all the electoral blocks--only 3. We may assume that the main mass of those who did not come to the polls was also "against everyone." The political breakdown of forces among the oblast's voters may easily be expressed in a table, grouping together all the electoral blocks and groups: The pro-presidential ("Choice of Russia," Yabloko, PRES and RDDR [Russian Movement for Democratic Reform); the centrist ("Future of Russia--New Names," "Civic Union," the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia], "Dignity and Charity," "KEDR," and "Women of Russia") and the opposition (CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], APR [Agrarian Party of Russia], LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia]). The results of the voting by percentage of voters were as follows: District Pro-presidential Centrist Opposition Against all blocks Artemovskiy 32 13 37 5 Verkh-Isetskiy 57 14 17 5 Kamensk-Ural 44 19 23 5 Nizhnetagil 47 17 22 5 Ordzhonikidze 58 14 17 4 Pervouralsk 40 18 28 5 Serovskiy 45 19 24 6 All 46 17 24 -- As we see from the figures presented above, the fellow countrymen of the first RF [Russian Federation] President on the whole retain their ties. The elections to the Federal Assembly also showed an exceptional weakness and erosion of the political center and a considerable polarization of society. Evidently, the times of the centrists have not yet come, and the logic of the "revolutionary" situation and civic opposition remains in force. The weakness of the center is explained by its fragmentation, by the high degree of differentiation of these forces, by the absence of a unifying organizational principle and an outstanding individual capable of organizing the center. Unlike the blocks of general political forces, the elections showed the weakness of the functional blocks which are oriented toward a certain social group or social problem. The only exception to this was the "Women of Russia," which won 8 percent of the votes. Such a peculiarity of the elections as lack of correspondence of political affiliations of many voters in voting on different bulletins also did not escape the eye of the specialists. For example, in the Artemovskiy Electoral District, where the candidates for the State Duma represented the most varied political forces, by party lists the LDPR was victorious, by the single-mandate district--the candidate from the Agrarian Party, and the majority upheld the presidential draft constitution. And the same voters were voting on all of these. The main characters There are already over 700 public associations registered with the oblast justice administration. The most numerous group of these is represented by various funds--around 15 percent. Sports and cultural organizations comprise approximately the same amount. Twelve percent of those registered are youth organizations, the largest of which is the oblast organization of the Russian Union of Youth, the Association of Student Youth, the section of the Russian Union of Young Entrepreneurs, and the Association of Youth Organizations. A large relative share is comprised of organizations of former military servicemen and veteran's organizations (around 8 percent), invalids (around 5 percent), and women (around 2 percent). Of the ecological organizations (around 4 percent), most are territorial sections of the "Chernobyl" Union. The dominant role among professional organizations belongs to the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Sverdlovsk Oblast, aside from which there are the Independent Trade Union of Miners, the Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the Partnership of Trade Unions of the city of Yekaterinburg. The Sverdlovsk Oblast Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs was the most influential among entrepreneurial organizations. Cossack associations comprise the registered Cossack stanitsas [villages], which are affiliated with two primary organizations: The Yekaterinburg section of the Orenburg Cossack Troops [OCT] and the Isetskiy section of the OCT. There are around 50 organizations registered with the oblast justice administration which have a clearly expressed political character. These comprise over 6 percent of the overall number. One in every three has all-Russian status, one in six has oblast status, and every other one has city or rayon status. One in six speaks out as a political party, and one in four--as a rights protection organization. The absolute figures are not presented here for one reason--their make-up is constantly changing: Some "fade into history," others register again, and still others re-register under new names. By the beginning of March the oblast electoral commission had registered 29 public associations which wanted to take part in the elections. These may be divided into specifically political (party and non-party) and functional (corporative) groups. The political group is made up of about 12 organizations which are usually called "democrats," 4 centrist organizations ("Transformation of the Urals," "Ural Center," DPR, and RSM [Russian Union of Youth], and finally, 7 opposition organizations--of communist, socialist and national-patriotic directionality. The second group is comprised of associations which have a clear function of reflecting the interests of a specific category. The "Russian Fund for Charity and Health," the "Beer Lovers Society", etc. may also conditionally be classed in this group. Many socio-political associations have for a comparatively long time been preparing for the struggle for seats in the oblast Duma and the organs of local self-government. The temporary statutes on elections which were ratified by the head of administration clearly did not suit them by the very procedure by which they are held as well as by the number of seats in the representative bodies and the functions of these bodies. The definite dissatisfaction with the rules of the pre-electoral struggle nevertheless did not decrease the number of those wishing to participate in them. The change in principles, according to which the elections will be conducted on 10 April, defined a certain re-grouping of the political forces. One of the main determining factors will evidently become the multi-mandate districts. The political blocks which had consolidated before the 13 December elections began to break up in order to try to win the maximum number of mandates in the multi-mandate districts. Thus, for example, "Choice of Russia" "fell apart" into "Choice of Russia" proper, the Fund for Support of the First RF President, "Our City," "Rebirth of Self-Government and Regions," "Action," "Rebirth," the Party of Economic Freedom and the Republican Party. The opposition forces had not joined together in the last elections, and they are also speaking out individually at the upcoming ones. The rise in the ratings of the communist and socialist organizations which has recently become apparent organizationally inspires the leftist opposition embodied by the oblast organizations of the CPRF (V. Novoselov), RCWP [Russian Communist Workers' Party] (V. Sarvarov), the "Rabochiy" ["Worker"] association, as well as the association of workers. The national-patriots will be represented at the elections by "Russian Union" (V. Ilyish). Around 70 percent of the oblast residents polled in February of this year had already decided which political forces they would vote for. Thirty spoke out in support of the independent candidates. Naturally, the results of such a survey do not yet warrant far-reaching conclusions. However, they did illuminate certain tendencies and proportions. We may assume that the future oblast Duma will be divided into four parts: One-fourth will represent the democratic orientation, one-fifth--the centrist, another one-fifth--the opposition, and one-third will remain with the "independents." The final breakdown of forces in the Duma, of course, will depend on the degree of "independence" of the latter, and one conclusion is apparent already today: The deputies of this Duma are simply doomed to cooperation, and this will require of them a high degree of political and purely human tolerance.
