The Solidarity Party held its convention at the Atlapa Convention Center. The other members of the presidential ticket are Carlos Clement as the first vice presidential candidate and Marisin Villalaz de Arias as the second vice presidential candidate. In his acceptance speech, Lewis Galindo promised more jobs, better education, and renegotiation of the foreign debt. The Solidarity conventioneers also agreed to authorize the party's national directorate to negotiate before 8 February -- the deadline established by the Electoral Tribunal for engaging in alliances -- a possible political alliance with other parties. According to Villalaz de Arias, the Solidarity Party is talking with the National Unity Mission and the Papa Egoro Movement about the possibility of an alliance. The presidential ticket can be changed to adjust to the results of negotiations, a source said. Meanwhile, at the Doctrinal Panamenista Party [Partido Panamenist Doctrinario -- PD] convention, Jose Salvador Munoz was nominated as the presidential candidate. The nominee for first vice president is Rodrigo Bernal, and the nomination for second vice president went to Julia Suria. In his acceptance speech, Munoz described his party as the third force and the best option. According to him, the oligarchy that governed the country during the past three years and the Democratic Revolutionary Party and its allies, who represent 21 years of "military dictatorship and repression," must be discarded. According to reports from the Electoral Tribunal, 1.5 million Panamanians, out of a population of 2.5 million, have been called to participate in the general elections in May. According to authorities, these will be the first democratic elections ever to take place.
