EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of the delegation of authority is February 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the request for the delegation of authority and EPA's letter of delegation are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: Environmental Protection Agency Region IV, Air Programs Branch, 345 Courtland Street NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365. South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, 2600 Bull Street, Columbia, South Carolina 29201. Effective immediately, all requests, applications, reports and other correspondence required pursuant to the newly designated standards should not be submitted to the Region IV office, but should instead be submitted to the following address: South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, 2600 Bull Street, Columbia, South Carolina 29201.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 301, in conjunction with sections 110 and 111(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act as amended November 15, 1990, authorize the Administrator to delegate his authority to implement and enforce the standards established in 40 CFR part 60, New Source Performance Standards (NSPS). After a thorough review of the categories requested for delegation, the Regional Administrator determined that such delegation was appropriate for these source categories with conditions set forth in the original delegation letter of October 19, 1976, and subsequent delegation letters of January 22, 1981, February 1, 1984, June 29, 1987, February 9, 1988, January 5, 1989, December 10, 1990, March 3, 1992, and March 8, 1993.

The Administrator retains the exclusive right to approve equivalent and alternative test methods, continuous monitoring procedures, and reporting requirements. The EPA hereby notifies the public that it has delegated the authority over certain NSPS subparts to the State of South Carolina. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Authority: This action is issued under the authority of sections 101, 110, 111, and 301 of the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7401, 7410, 74121, 7412, and 7601). Dated: April 18, 1994.
