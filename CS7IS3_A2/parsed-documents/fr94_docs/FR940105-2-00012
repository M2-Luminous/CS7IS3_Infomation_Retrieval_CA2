FR940105-2-00012 FR940105-2-00006 Also, on December 20, respondents requested that, in the event of an affirmative determination in this investigation, the Department postpone the final determination an additional 60 days from the date of publication of the affirmative preliminary determination. See the ``Postponement of Final Determination'' section of this notice. On December 23, 1993, we received a response from the Beijing municipal government but we did not receive a response to our supplemental Attachment II questionnaire from MOFTEC or from the four responding exporters. Scope of Investigation The products covered by this investigation are all grades of sebacic acid, a dicarboxylic acid with the formula (CH 2 ) 8 (COOH) 2 , which include but are not limited to CP Grade (500ppm maximum ash, 25 maximum APHA color), Purified Grade (1000ppm maximum ash, 50 maximum APHA color), and Nylon Grade (500ppm maximum ash, 70 maximum APHA color). The principal difference between the grades is the quantity of undesirable ash and color. Sebacic acid contains a minimum of 85 percent dibasic acids of which the predominant species is the C 10 dibasic acid. Sebacic acid is sold generally as a free-flowing powder/flake. Sebacic acid has numerous industrial uses, including the production of nylon 6/10 (a polymer used for paintbrush and toothbrush bristles and paper machine felts), plasticizers, esters, automotive coolants, polyamides, polyester castings and films, inks and adhesives, lubricants, and polyurethane castings and coatings. Sebacic acid is currently classifiable under subheading 2917.13.00.00, of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. Period of Investigation The POI is January 1, 1993, through June 30, 1993. Market-Oriented Industry All of the respondents in this investigation have claimed that the sebacic acid industry is an MOI. In their November 1, 1993, responses, the respondents claim that all of the manufacturers' material and non-material inputs used to produce sebacic acid were purchased at market-driven prices during the POI and that none of the factories or the factories' suppliers produced any of the inputs for sebacic acid for in-plan production. Accordingly, these respondents state that it is appropriate for the Department to use the PRC prices for material and non-material inputs for valuing the inputs used to produce sebacic acid. In the Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sulfanilic Acid from the People's Republic of China (57 FR 9409, 9411; March 18, 1992) (Sulfanilic Acid), the Department set forth the following criteria to be used in determining whether an MOI exists in an economy which would otherwise be considered non-market: •For merchandise under investigation, there must be virtually no government involvement in setting prices or amounts to be produced. For example, state-required production of the merchandise, whether for export or domestic consumption in the non-market economy country would be an almost insuperable barrier to finding a market-oriented industry. •The industry producing the merchandise under investigation should be characterized by private or collective ownership. There may be state-owned enterprises in the industry but substantial state ownership would weigh heavily against finding a market-oriented industry. •Market-determined prices must be paid for all significant inputs, whether material or non-material, and for an all but insignificant proportion of all the inputs accounting for the total value of the merchandise under investigation. For example, an input price will not be considered market-determined if the producers of the merchandise under investigation pay a state-set price for the input or if the input is supplied to the producers at government direction. Moreover, if there is any state-required production in the industry producing the input, the share of state-required production must be insignificant. If these conditions are not met, then, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.52, the producers of the merchandise under investigation will be treated as non-market economy (NME) producers, and the foreign market value will be calculated by using prices and costs from a surrogate country, in accordance with sections 773(c)(3) and (4) of the Act. On November 9, we issued an MOI deficiency questionnaire to the respondents and sent a supplemental MOI questionnaire to MOFTEC. This questionnaire contained questions concerning the identity of the entire sebacic acid industry, the ownership of all entities which produce sebacic acid or supply inputs used to produce sebacic acid, and whether any inputs were subject to in-plan production. Since we did not receive the responses to our questionnaire on December 23, 1993, we did not have sufficient information on the record for our preliminary determination to determine whether the sebacic acid industry during the POI was an MOI. Therefore, we will address the respondents' MOI claim in our final determination. Separate Rates To determine whether an NME exporter is eligible for a separate antidumping duty rate, the Department first analyzes ownership. If an exporter is owned by the central government, the Department will not issue a separate rate for that exporter. Instead, the Department assigns to all exporters owned by the central government a single, weighted-average margin. In the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Compact Ductile Iron Waterworks Fittings and Accessories Thereof from the People's Republic of China (58 FR 37908; July 14, 1993), the Department determined that NME exporters owned by the central government are not eligible for antidumping duty rates separate from each other because ownership by the central government enables the government to manipulate prices, whether or not it takes advantage of its opportunity to do so during the POI. Accordingly, entities owned by the central government cannot be eligible for rates different or separate from each other. To calculate a rate for exporters owned by the central government, the Department requires that all potential respondents that are owned by the central government reply to the antidumping questionnaire. Only complete responses from all the entities owned by the central government could enable the Department to calculate a weighted-average antidumping margin for the central government-controlled entities.
