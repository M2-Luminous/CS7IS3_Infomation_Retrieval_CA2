Speaking at the constituent conference of a consultative council on foreign investments in Moscow Monday, he pointed out that creating a climate of trust in investment cooperation with foreign countries was one of the main conditions for Russia's involvement in the world economic order. Shokhin put special emphasis on the fact that the Russian government took into account foreign investors' opinion with respect to the instability of Russian legislation. The government has suspended the practices of legislating and shaping up their own investment policies by individual ministries and agencies, which would facilitate their relations with foreign partners. At the same time, investors' proposals on lessening investment risks were being considered, and specific measures guaranteeing foreign investments from changes in the legislation were being taken. "We support creating a system for international arbitration which would enable Russia and its partners to solve their differences in a civilized way," Shokhin said. According to Shokhin, the government planned to set up a centralized collateral fund of federal property and create analogous structures in the federation items in order to attract foreign capital. This autumn, the government will consider regulations for pledging land, underground, forest and other natural resources as securities and retaining pawned property. To facilitate the search for and assessment of potential business partners, especially outside Moscow, a list of investment projects with participation of foreign capital was prepared. The list includes more than 500 entries each of them is a specific project supplemented with brief business plans, Shokhin said.
