Briquemont succeeded French General Philippe Morillon as the UN's top soldier in Bosnia in July last year, and like Morillon has frequently expressed anger at the UN Protection Force's (UNPROFOR) lack of means to protect civilians in Bosnia and stop attacks on UN aid convoys. Briquemont's one-year stint as UNPROFOR head ends in July. But the defence officials said Belgium had asked UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to release him earlier. The Belgian military authorities would give no official reason for its request to recall Briquemont, apart from saying that he was needed to help restructure Belgium's defence force. Briquemont recently demanded reinforcements for the 12,000-strong UNPROFOR contingent in Bosnia, and said he no longer bothered to read unheeded UN resolutions on the civil war in the ex-Yugoslav republic. The Belgian radio station RTBF said Briquemont might be recalled as early as the end of January. A Belgian Defence Ministry spokesman said Belgium would nominate another top military officer to serve out Briquemont's term. On Monday [3 January], French General Jean Cot, commander in chief of the 30,000-strong UNPROFOR force in ex-Yugoslavia, complained of the "humiliations" suffered by the UN troops and said it was ready for an "offensive intervention" in Bosnia.
