Products that have the aforementioned primary magnesium content but do not conform to ASTM specifications or other industry or customer-specific specifications are included in the scope of these investigations. Pure unwrought magnesium is provided for in subheadings 8104.11.00 and 8104.20.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Excluded from the scope of investigation are magnesium anodes, granular magnesium (including turnings and powder), and secondary magnesium. See also, Commerce's scope of investigation in its notices of preliminary determinations, 59 F.R. 55420, 55424, and 55427. 2 For purposes of these investigations, unwrought alloy magnesium contains less than 99.8 percent magnesium by weight but 50 percent or more magnesium by weight, with magnesium being the largest metallic element in the alloy by weight, and is sold in various ingot and billet forms and sizes.
