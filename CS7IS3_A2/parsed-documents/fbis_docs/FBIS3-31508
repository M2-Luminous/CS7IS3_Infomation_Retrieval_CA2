Procedures linked to the possible calling of a referendum, along with the constitutional provision that an electoral campaign cannot be launched earlier than 90 days after the referendum, make it impossible for the June term to be saved, Simko argued. He expressed his disappointment over Wednesday's [16 February] parliamentary voting on the government bill to shorten the electoral term by a half. The proposal was rejected not because of failure of the opposition, but because of the surprising abstention of Hungarian deputies, he said. This fact, along with Wednesday's support for the "ill Slovak Government" by those deputies from the Meciar-led Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) who internally disagree with Meciar's policy, might affect today's voting on the deputies' bill concerning the same issue, Simko stressed. The bill on shortening the electoral term submitted by the opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL) differs from the government bill only in the proposed date of early elections, which the SDL wants in November. Simko drew attention to the current "Slovak Government's extraordinary privatization activity." In view of increasing speculations on a possible no confidence vote on the cabinet, "privatization has been underway even at night," he noted. KDH Deputy Chairman Emil Komarik said that Slovakia was facing the threat of dictatorship and loss of independence. If a temporary broad coalition government is created, the KDH wants to share part of the executive power, while supposing the new premier to be again a HZDS member, Komarik said.
