Speaking at a seminar on military education, Chief of the General Staff Adm. Liu Ho-chien noted that Beijing has decided to increase its defense budget by 20 percent this year to top U.S.$5.75 billion. He said that any cut in Taiwan's defense budget would further tip the already disproportionate cross-Taiwan Strait military balance. The Republic of China [ROC] military has requested a budget of U.S.$ 9.1 billion plus an extra U.S.$1.1 billion for the purchase of F-16s and Mirage 2000-5s. Liu said, however, that he fully understood the government's desire to seek balanced national development despite the current financial difficulties. Liu also warned that the potential military threat from Mainland China should not be underestimated. Taiwan can never be too careful, he said, as Beijing has obtained a large amount of advanced weaponry from the former Soviet Union and the United States continues to pull its troops out of the Asian region. Quoting Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek who said "learn from your enemies," Liu emphasized the importance of military education, and said Taiwan should pay more attention to the development of the military on the mainland.
