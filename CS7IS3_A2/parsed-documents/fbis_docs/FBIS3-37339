Assessing the workers' actions, Lysenka pointed out: "This is a success. The situation in the Republic is so complicated that people found it hard to make the decision to join the political strike. However, mass actions did take place and tens of thousands of people took part in them. We believe that we will soon see the real political results of this undertaking." Lysenka underlined that if the Strike Committee Council receives no answer to its petition by 1300 [1100 GMT] on 22 February, the general political strike will be resumed on the morning of 23 February. The same will happen if the administration begins persecuting the organizers of the action. Meanwhile, Kebich's Press Secretary Uladzimir Zamyatalin pointed out that "the ultimate decisive battle" urged by the strike's organizers had not taken place. Zamyatalin added that "common sense prevailed. This proves that our society is moving toward democracy."
