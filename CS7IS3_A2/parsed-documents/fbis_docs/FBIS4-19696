FBIS4-19696 "drweu077_q_94012" FBIS-WEU-94-077 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 TURKEY Ciller Vows To Fight Terrorism, Inflation Ciller Vows To Fight Terrorism, Inflation TA2004115794 Ankara TRT Television Network in Turkish 1700 GMT 19 Apr 94 TA2004115794 Ankara TRT Television Network Turkish BFN [Announcer-read report over video] [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has stated that the coming days will be a turning point in the fight against terrorism, and she called on the terrorists to surrender before the arrival of summer. Ciller also condemned the Serbian massacre of defenseless Bosnians, calling it the most disgraceful event in the history of humanity. The prime minister called on all concerned nations and international organizations to fulfill their responsibilities urgently and with determination to stop this human tragedy. In a speech she delivered at the True Path Party's assembly meeting, Ciller discussed the fight against terrorism, the new radio and television law, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and her recent visit to the United States. Ciller stressed that the fight against terrorism is continuing as planned and in determination. The prime minister noted that great success was achieved during the intense operations concentrated around Agri and Tendurek Mountains during the last week. [Begin Ciller recording] We had previously announced that a turning point regarding this issue would be reached during the summer months and this plan is continuing successfully -- with determination -- and it will be written in history as the victory of the 50th government, with the True Path Party as its major partner. [applause] Dear friends, nowadays, dissolution and disintegration has started amid the terrorists. We know that, within this framework, the terrorists are conducting propaganda directed at the young people and I would like to convey once more how wrong this is. The propaganda advises not to surrender to the security forces because they will be maltreated. This is definitely wrong. I am once more calling on these young people: The end of this road is distress. We are determined to eradicate terrorism. Let the lives of these young people be spared within this determination to eliminate terrorism. Let them come and surrender themselves to the state. The state will show affection to them. The state will embrace them and be just toward them. [end recording] Expressing her views on the law regulating radio and television broadcasts, Ciller said that the aim of the law is not to restrict broadcasts but rather to prevent broadcasts which may harm public order and the country's peace and security. Ciller explained that legal procedures similar to the one adopted in Turkey exist in all Western countries. Ciller said: Nowhere does the freedom of press and speech imply encouraging acts of incitement, which disturb the indivisible integrity and independence of the state as well as the tranquillity and security of the people. Ciller called the Serbian massacre of defenseless Bosnians the most disgraceful incident in the history of mankind. Ciller said these developments, which are exhausting the world's patience, are also harming the confidence in the United Nations and NATO, adding that Turkey is taking all necessary initiatives on the issue. [Begin Ciller recording] I am calling on all the world as I have done from Tuzla: I am calling on all concerned nations and international organizations to fulfill their duties urgently and with determination to end the human tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to save the crushed human pride. These people have a right to self defense. The least that can be done, if NATO and the United Nations are incapable of fulfilling their duties, is the lifting of the embargo, and I am urging once again that this step, at least, will be implemented urgently. [end recording] At the conclusion of her speech, Ciller briefed the party members on her recent visit to the United States. Ciller said that the real aim of her visit was to participate in the meeting held by the Elie Wiesel Foundation. Stating that lately there have been unjust allegations as to Turkey violating human rights spreading in Europe and the United States, Ciller said that all efforts in all forums will be exerted to prevent these rumors, which have intensified especially after the immunities of certain deputies were lifted. [Begin Ciller recording] How do other countries react when somebody arrives with another flag at the assembly; when there is an attempt to take an oath in another language, outside the official language; and when the contents of the oath are being changed? What actions were taken in Belgium? In France? How does the United States react to such a situation? I was happy to see that when asked these questions, the answers were: We would have done the same thing. However, we did not do the same thing. We really did not do anything when these incidents were taking place. Our determination regarding this issue and the step we took in the assembly were undertaken in an environment open to offensive proclamations by authorized persons and institutions. The steps we took came after these persons, who are accused of meeting with terrorists in the houses allocated to the deputies, were charged with cooperating with murderers and criminals. For that reason, our cause is just and we will continue to explain our side. I am glad to see that the more we explain the situation the more the realities are crystallizing. [end recording] Ciller said that during her visit to the United States she had an opportunity to meet with the U.S. President Clinton and discuss with him important foreign developments -- primarily Bosnia-Herzegovina. Explaining that within this framework, she also had an opportunity to explain to Clinton the economic stability program, Ciller said that the U.S. Administration expressed its open political support for the economic package. However, Ciller continued, the IMF and the World Bank did not influence the 5 April decisions. [Begin Ciller recording] We made these decisions not to gain the support of the IMF or the World Bank. We made these decisions to be independent from them, because we believe they are needed for the Turkish people's prosperity, before unemployment spreads all over the country and people are laid off en masse, before inflation reaches 4,000 or 5,000 percent, and before the vicious circle in the economy becomes irrevocable. I would like to say openly and with utmost sincerity that these decisions would have been taken regardless of the IMF and regardless of the World Bank support. These decisions were reached not because the IMF or the World Bank wanted but because they were needed for the prosperity of the Turkish people and were taken independent of them. However, I was glad to see that these organizations are supporting these economic measures. This is very gratifying for us, because in this way we will be able to reintegrate with the world money markets as well as revive the credit mechanism which was getting disconnected. [end recording] Ciller added that they will solve the issues left to the 50th government, and which are the result of years of errors, undaunted and with determination.
