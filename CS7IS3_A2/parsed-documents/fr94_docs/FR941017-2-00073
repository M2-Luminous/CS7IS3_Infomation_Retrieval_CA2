FR941017-2-00073 FR941017-2-00051 By letters dated February 24 and March 31, 1994, the licensee provided information to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PA DER) regarding the impact of power uprate on cooling tower performance. In the February 24, 1994 letter, the licensee indicated that the uprated power levels would increase the temperature of the circulating water leaving the main condensers by approximately one degree Fahrenheit. Operation at uprated power will cause additional heat to be rejected to the circulating water through the main condensers. The additional heat rejection would occur as a result of operation at slightly higher condenser pressures and discharge of circulating water from the main condenser with slightly higher temperatures as described above. The licensee provided a revised cooling tower matrix to the PA DER which addressed cooling tower operation at uprated power levels. The licensee noted that the lowest 7-day moving river temperature average for which cooling tower operation is required dropped from 53 ○F to 51 ○F. In general, the effect of operation at uprated power would be to increase the duty cycle of the cooling towers. By letter dated September 27, 1994, the PA DER recommended extension of the thermal variance (Section 316(a) of The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, P.L. 92&hyph;500, as amended) for the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station. The state concluded that an increase in the plant's rated power level will not change the relative abundance, distribution and species composition of fish in the Conowingo Pond provided the station is operated in accordance with the revised matrix. The PA DER indicated that the NPDES permit will be renewed in the near future to include the revised matrix. The operating speed and characteristics of the circulating pumps will not be changed for power uprate. Thus, the volumetric flow rate and velocity of intake and outfall from the circulating water system would not be expected to change because of operation at uprated power levels. As stated above, the temperature of the water discharged from the condensers is expected to increase slightly; however, the licensee has determined that the increased heat load is within the capacity of the existing cooling towers. The operating matrix for the cooling towers was revised to maintain the temperature characteristics of the plant discharge plume equivalent to those of the existing plume. Because the flow rate, velocity and temperature of the plume are all not expected to change, no change to the overall thermal plume is expected. The licensee does inject sodium hypochlorite into the circulating water system to retard growth of microorganisms with system components. The sodium hypochlorite injection rate is determined by the flow rate through the circulating water system, which will not change as a result of operation at uprated power levels. The licensee indicated the increased heat rejection rate from the cooling towers may lead to an increase in concentration of chemicals and contaminants in the cooling tower. However, the licensee is required by the NPDES permit to sample for residual chlorine in the outfall of the cooling towers on a daily basis and to maintain residual chlorine concentrations within the limits of the permit. The concentrations of residual chlorine are not expected to exceed the existing permit limits. Based on the expected minimal effect of uprated power operation on cooling tower chemical concentrations and the monitoring requirements of the NPDES permit, the staff concludes the impact of any potential increase in cooling tower chemical effluent concentration on the environment is not significant. Effluent discharges from other systems were also considered. Effluent limits for systems such as roof drains and yard drains, the auxiliary boiler and the sewage treatment plant are established in the NPDES permit. Discharges from these systems are not changed by operation at uprated power. Thus, the impact on the environment from these systems as a result of operation at uprated power levels is not significant. Because the flow rate and velocity of influent to and effluent from the circulating water and service water systems will remain unchanged by operation at uprated power levels, no increased entrainment of planktonic organisms and or impingement of fish is expected. As part of the request to update the NPDES permit, the licensee submitted a report of aquatic sampling that was performed in the Conowingo Pond in October and November 1993. The report was provided to the NRC in the June 29, 1994 letter. The objective of the study was to ``determine the relative abundance and distribution of fishes in Conowingo Pond, particularly the thermal effluent, and compare the results with the historic record.'' The report concluded that ``No obvious changes in the species abundance, except for the gizzard shad in recent years, were observed between 1993 and the historic record. Changes in the abundance of a particular species has historically been associated with year class strength. Strong year classes are associated with increased abundance of a species.'' Samples of the gizzard shad were generally stronger than the historic record for the various sample locations and methods.
