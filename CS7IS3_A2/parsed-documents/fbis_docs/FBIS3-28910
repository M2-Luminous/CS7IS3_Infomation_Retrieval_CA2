This is not a numerical target. [Correspondent in English with simultaneous translation into Japanese] I think the Japanese really thought last July that they could reach an agreement. Among the industrialized seven [G-7] nations, Japan has the most tightly closed market. Why? [Clinton] First of all, the G-7 agreement or the framework agreement we signed with Japan last summer, was good. Both sides understood that they had to implement the agreement. However, the people who signed the agreement last summer are not here to fulfill their agreement. I do not mean to say that they were lacking sincerity. However, we ourselves could not reach an agreement on the basis of the previous agreement. [Same correspondent] Why? [Clinton] We could not agree on what kind of evidence we could use to measure market liberalization, for example. [Hosokawa] We understand that we have made some progress on the issues of government procurement or insurance services. Unfortunately, however, we could not clear the issue of numerical targets. We deeply regret that we could not reach an agreement on setting numeric targets. As the president said earlier, both sides will readjust what we can readjust and try to buckle down to the task to reach a better agreement. [Correspondent] When do you think you will reach an agreement on what you could not do this time? [Hosokawa] I do not know. As soon as possible, I hope. However, we may need time to cool off. [Correspondent in English with simultaneous translation into Japanese] Mr. President, let me ask you a question on the Bosnian issue. There is a possibility that there will be discord between you and President Yeltsin. He is saying that NATO does not have the right to launch air raids on Bosnia. But, you are saying that NATO does. Is there a way to fill the gap? [Clinton] We talked about it on the phone today. The secretary general of the United Nations told President Yeltsin that NATO is acting on the basis of the resolution the Security Council adopted last summer. In other words, NATO has the authority to stop the shelling of Sarajevo. I think NATO will remove weapons from areas within a 20-kilometer radius from Sarajevo. However, discussions are now underway. Anyhow, this will bring about peace in the long run and we agreed, as a short-term measure, to stop the act of killing civilians. [correspondent] Now that the trade agreement has failed, how optimistic is your administration about the possibility of a future agreement? [Clinton] I just do not know. As you know, the problem may be a parlance matter or an emotional matter. But, Japan's position is that it does not want to set numerical targets that may lead to managed trade. I understand their position well. We want some kind of objective standards to measure whether Japan's market opening is progressing. Without such objective criteria -- as in the past -- it is quite difficult to measure progress. For that reason, we want to have qualitative or quantitative targets. Supposing trade is very imbalanced in the period from 1992 to 1995, we need to measure whether progress is being made. We also need to see how foreign exchange and Japan's economy have turned out, and whether U.S. companies have made products which have competitive power in quality and price, and attract the Japanese market. For that reason, we have stressed that we want objective criteria or standards to measure whether progress is being made in opening the market. But we have failed to reach an agreement on that point. [Correspondent in English with simultaneous translation into Japanese] My question is about Bosnia. It has been reported that the United States said it is willing to give up imposing sanctions if the Serbians cooperate in talks on peace. Are you planning to send U.S. peacekeeping operation [PKO] troops? What will you do about it; and are F-15 fighters heading toward Bosnia? [Clinton] In terms of troops, we will send less than half, although we have not specified the number. Second, we have never discussed any partial lifting of the embargo. As far as I am concerned, I have never discussed such a possibility. [Correspondent] Although the previous governments agreed to launch negotiations on objective criteria, do you think the preceding government made the wrong decision, or does it mean that the Hosokawa government will cope with this issue in its own, new way? [Hosokawa] Well, we believe that certain progress has been made on each issue we have negotiated so far. Therefore, I think that it does not mean we will start from scratch, and we need to further promote negotiations with the results of past negotiations in mind. Does this answer your question? No? [Correspondent] The Miyazawa government decided and agreed to start negotiations on objective criteria. What I want to ask you is whether you think the Miyazawa government's decision was wrong. [Hosokawa] No, I do not think so. Our understanding over the issue of numerical targets was different. We could not clear up the matter. [Correspondent in English with simultaneous translation into Japanese] Mr. President, what sort of measures do you think the United States can take to keep a watch on Japan's attitude or manner, and are you thinking of changing the United States' position in order to make it difficult for Japanese companies to continue business activities in the United States? [Clinton] Until 0400 this morning, we made efforts to come to an agreement. So, I am not prepared to say. We need to give further study to what you have said. I think now is the time to think about many things. [Correspondent] Mr. President, citizens of Japan strongly support the Hosokawa government's policy on deregulation or non-interference by the government. When that is the given background, if the United States presses Japan to set import volumes in advance -- which is tantamount to asking the government to interfere -- do you think the citizens of Japan will accept this? [Clinton] We are not asking for that. I think that is the bottleneck which is making an agreement impossible. We are not asking Japan to make a commitment to import certain volumes by certain dates. What we want to do is measure progress on market opening, using objective criteria. One thing that could be used as a criteria is the level of imports, another could be exchange rates, another could be Japan's domestic demand, and how many U.S. products are being used in the United States, Europe, or other countries could be used as criteria as well. What efforts U.S. businesses are making to do business in Japan or in the Japanese market could also be used as criteria. We are not asking Japan to practice managed trade. I think what Japan is concerned about is that if there are numbers among other criteria, the numbers will take on a life of their own. That is not what the United States intends, even though, no doubt, that has become the bottleneck on arriving at an agreement. [Correspondent] You two are said to have also talked about the situation on the Korean peninsula. Around the end of this month, the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] will have to confirm or deny whether North Korea is developing nuclear arms. How serious is the situation? What will you and Prime Minister Hosokawa do if it is determined that North Korea is not observing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty? [Clinton] On that question, we discussed various options including sanctions. Japan, China, South Korea, and the United States agree that the Korean peninsula should be free of nuclear arms. The fact that North Korea is unwilling to accept the IAEA inspections is a cause of very much concern to us. We will see what options we have. But I think it is clear that the sanctions are among them. [Hosokawa] We are also strongly concerned over the issue. The issue will face a big hurdle soon or within the next 10 days. I hope that North Korea will move in a desirable direction. As the President just said, Japan wants to work together with the United States, South Korea, and China in working on that country more strongly. If a possible economic blockade or sanctions are discussed at the UN Security Council, Japan will do as much as it can within the limits of its constitution. [Correspondent] I have a question for both of you. To look back on the negotiations between the two countries, I feel mutual mistrust has grown between them -- the United States thinking it has been deceived, and Japan thinking the objective criteria will be used in sanctions. Do you think such mistrust will be removed in the course of future negotiations? [Clinton] I personally trust Prime Minister Hosokawa, and respect him very much. In fact, my respect has only kept on growing. I have particular respect for efforts put into political reforms, the leadership displayed by Japan in the Uruguay Round of talks, and the leadership shown by Prime Minister Hosokawa in opening up the rice market. I must note efforts made in deregulation and tax reductions. I feel Japan is moving in the right direction. Both of us came to our posts as top leaders of the two nations when frustration and irritation was rising after years and years of trade negotiations. This issue of trust is certainly important, and is a serious problem that cannot be overlooked. But this issue of trust can be resolved. The reason why the trust is being threatened is because the trade imbalance remains large while the prices of consumer goods in Japan are high, and because this fact is having a negative effect on American citizens. Aside from that, my personal respect for the prime minister and the government is great indeed. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, you have discussed many things with President Clinton. The United States is saying that even though it wants numerical targets or objective criteria, it does not want managed trade. Can you believe this? [Hosokawa] Nobody wants managed trade. This can be said -- commonly -- of all countries. As the President mentioned, we are afraid lest the numerical targets should take on a life of their own. If that happens, as it did with the Semiconductor Agreement, that is in fact the practicing of managed trade. I told him in today's summit meeting that establishing numerical targets runs counter to the basic stance of my cabinet, which promotes deregulation. [Clinton] If we were asking for the semiconductor agreement, that would be right. But that is not what we are asking for. What we are asking for is what we agreed to last summer, which was a way of measuring by objective standards the progress being made in opening markets. I want to say we are not seeking anything for the United States, that we are not seeking for other countries as well. We sought no special access or special treatment. We just seek a list, if you will, of those things by which you could determine whether progress is being made or progress is not being made, that there are reasons other than closed market policies for the lack of progress. There could be other reasons -- no domestic demand, changes in exchange rates, inadequate efforts by Americans, uncompetitive products and services. [Correspondent] I think that opening the Japanese market is very important. I think Japanese consumers and Japanese people believe that. But I think the reason you could not come up with any agreement today in the talks is that the numerical target approach is not really popular among Japanese people, Japanese industries, and Japanese bureaucrats. So, I am wondering, Mr. President, whether you thought it was possible to come up with any agreement, result, or outcome in near future with the numerical target approach. I also wonder whether you were disappointed with the Japanese people. I heard that Mr. Gore raised a question about Japanese bureaucrats in talks with Mr. Hata. I wonder whether, Mr. President, you think the Japanese bureaucracy is a kind of burden or barrier in opening the Japanese market. [Clinton] I wish you had never asked that. I understand that numerical targets are not popular among Japanese people and the Japanese Government. But Americas trade deficit with Japan is not popular among the American people and the American Government -- it is hard to explain it, year in and year out, it is always getting bigger. I think, in every society, the permanent government is more unchangeable than the changing government. I think that is true in every society and, in some societies, it is more true than in others. And the stronger the permanent civil service is in making policy, the more likely they are to become unchangeable. If you look at the history of Japan after the Second World War, having one system for the last forty-five plus years in which you produced for your own market and the world, had high savings rates and low consumption rates, as well as relatively closed markets and relatively high-value products, worked dramatically to improve the living standard of your people. But, at some point, as your growth rates became more normal as in the last 10 years, and as the capacity and desires of your people alter, now you have to develop a more open economy and society. I could not say any more than the prime minister did in the book that he wrote and gave to me to read. So, I do not want to pick on any particular section of the Japanese society. I want to just say that we must process the change, and we are both committed to it. That is the good news. I also think it is good news that we did not come up with an agreement today that did not mean anything. We just have to keep dealing with the issue and trying to find some way out of it, because we have to come to trust each other across systems that are still very different. Thank you very much.
