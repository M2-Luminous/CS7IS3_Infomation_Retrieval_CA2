Environmental divisions of local government administrations throughout Japan cooperated on the survey, the first of its kind to collate data from 158 sites between Hokkaido in the north and Okinawa in the south. National surveys conducted by the environment agency since 1983 have been more limited in scope, including data from only 29 sites. The new survey findings clearly show higher levels of acid rain on the Japan sea side of the mountain range which runs through the center of Honshu Island compared to areas on the Pacific coast side. The findings show that northern Japan and mountainous regions experience an ``acid shock'' in spring when snows melt and release highly acidic substances into streams and rivers. The results point to a need to document the effects of this on the environment. A total of 63 environmental centers cooperated on the survey between April 1991 and March 1992. They sampled acid levels and amounts of sulphuric acid and nitric acid content in rain and snow. Average pH levels, a measure of acidity and alkalinity, ranged between 4.3 and 4.9. Numbers from 7 downward on the scale indicate increasing acidity, while numbers upward from 7 indicate increasing alkalinity. A figure of 5.6 is accepted as normal. Among 39 sample sites which could not be expected to receive any pollution from domestic urban areas, the Hokuriku region around the Noto peninsula in particular experienced more than 15 millimeters of sulphuric acid-containing precipitation per square meter over a 30- day period in the winter. This was more than three times the lowest levels in the survey, which were found in Hokkaido. With the exception of parts of Aomori Prefecture, other areas from the Tohoku Region in the north and stretching across to the Sanin region, central Kyushu and the western part of Shikoku Island, all received large amounts of rain containing higher than normal levels of sulphuric acid. The high sulphuric acid content in rain in Kyushu is attributable to volcanic activity, but scientists who conducted the survey said that on the Japan sea side of the country in particular, there is a strong likelihood the acid has been brought by prevailing westerly winds.
