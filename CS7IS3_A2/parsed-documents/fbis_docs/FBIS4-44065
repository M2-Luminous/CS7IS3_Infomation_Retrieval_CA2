It also demands it contributes to formulating a political and economic order in Europe based on free consent and solidarity between the European nations with respect for their history, civilization, and traditions. The treaty for the EU is our answer to this challenge by history, it sets the bases and determines a stronger international presence by a united Europe. However, the march toward European integration is a continuing process. We look to the future with optimism. The intergovernmental conference in 1996 will give us the opportunity to diagnose the possible weaknesses of the current system and to proceed with the necessary readjustments with the participation of our new partners. However, as a community of democratic countries, we cannot proceed without the support of our citizens. The positive result of the Austrian referendum, which we welcome with particular joy, constitutes a clear message of optimism and confidence in tomorrow's Europe. On this occasion, I would like to again express our appreciation to the outgoing European Parliament for the spirit of cooperation it demonstrated and for the majority that voted for this expansion. I am very happy because today all of us are given the opportunity to meet here to formally seal a successful outcome to an official negotiation that lasted for one year and for which important efforts were made by 16 European states and by the European Commission. As president of the European Council, I am proud of the successful outcome of these negotiations during the Greek Presidency. I congratulate you and welcome you to the ranks of the EU.
