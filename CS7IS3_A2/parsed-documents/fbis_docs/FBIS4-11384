FBIS4-11384 "drlat080_m_94009" FBIS-LAT-94-080 Daily Report 13 Mar 1994 Brazil PT Promise To Modernize Armed Forces Detailed PT Promise To Modernize Armed Forces Detailed 94SM0319B Brasilia CORREIO BRAZILIENSE in Portuguese 13 Mar 94 p 9 94SM0319B Brasilia CORREIO BRAZILIENSE Portuguese CSO [Article by Helio Contreras: "PT Promises To Modernize Armed Forces"; introductory paragraphs in italics as published] [Text] The PT [Workers Party] has a plan for the Armed Forces that provides a budget capable of preventing obsolescence in the military institutions and advocates the establishment of a Ministry of Defense following studies involving the participation of admirals and Army and Air Force generals. The plan's author, Colonel Geraldo Cavagnari, told CORREIO BRAZILIENSE yesterday that the Calha Norte program for occupying the Amazon border region and strengthening activities in that area by the government's civilian authorities would continue if the PT's candidate, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, was elected president of the republic in the elections on 3 October. The plan for the defense sector was requested of Cavagnari by the PT's Office for Coordination of the Program. It has already been submitted to Lula and will be approved at the party's next national meeting, which will be held in Brasilia in April. The director of the Strategic Studies Group at Unicamp [Campinas State University] says that the portion of the military budget earmarked for modernizing the military institutions will have to total at least 2 percent of GDP [gross domestic product]. Currently, it is 0.6 percent. But he admitted that "everything will depend on the needs of other sectors." Navy To Defend Entire Coast The author of the PT's plan for the Armed Forces, Col. Geraldo Cavagnari, calls for modernizing the Navy "to ensure that the Navy has what it needs to operate in defense of the coast." According to Cavagnari, "that modernization process may--eventually--make the Navy really capable of operating in blue water to defend a number of national interests in the South Atlantic." In Cavagnari's view, "there must be continuity in the Navy's nuclear program so that in the 21st century, it will have nuclear-powered submarines giving it a greater range along the Brazilian coast." The colonel said that "nuclear-powered submarines will be vital if the Navy is to make it difficult for the sea to be used by any country acting contrary to national interests in the vicinity of the Brazilian coast." In Cavagnari's estimation, nuclear-powered submarines "must be seen as a defense weapon, which is how the Brazilian Navy itself views them, and not as an attack weapon." The author of the PT's defense proposal also emphasized another submarine-related matter: the submarines must not be armed with ballistic missiles (strategic missiles with a range exceeding 500 kilometers) carrying either conventional or nuclear warheads (payloads), another point on which the Navy agrees. Army Must Improve Strategy The essential thing for the Army, according to Col. Cavagnari's evaluation, is "to increase its tactical and strategic mobility." He explained that tactics "involve the speed of movement in a theater of operations and require equipping the Army with armor and helicopters so that it can move faster." Strategy will enable the Army to reach the area where a defense problem exists in the shortest time possible. To do that, it will have to have the means required for that mobility. Those means can be aircraft as well as transport ships. Since the financial limitations will probably persist for the next four years, the director of the Strategic Studies Group at Unicamp said that "the ground forces will therefore have to be organized in such a way that they will be located near strategic areas." Col. Cavagnari said that "although there are no external threats to Brazilian sovereignty in the Amazon Region, military presence in the area is necessary because it constitutes 60 percent of the national territory and is practically unexplored, besides which it has several problems requiring a solution." The former instructor at the Army Command and Staff School (ECEME), who was also an officer in the Army General Staff's Department of Strategy, said that there must be continuity in reequipping Army units. Air Force To Get More Aircraft In Col. Cavagnari's opinion, the Air Force "will have to be in a position to monitor and defend the airspace." Interception capability will continue to be located in the most sensitive areas of the national territory: population centers, industrial centers, and so on. The FAB [Brazilian Air Force] is to receive the entire quota of AMX aircraft called for in the Italian-Brazilian agreement. That number is 54, but the FAB has received only 20 aircraft. During the four years of the next administration, new aircraft may be acquired to improve the FAB's ability to defend the airspace, a mission it currently performs with Mirages and F-5's acquired in the 1970's. Those two aircraft are no longer produced by France and the United States. Cavagnari supports continuity in the Brazilian Space Program, which will guarantee "mastery of the technology for strategic medium-range ballistic missiles, among other technological advances." According to the Unicamp strategist, that missile will probably not have a range of more than 1,500 km. He mentioned the Complete Space Mission, which has already made it possible to launch a satellite, designed by the National Space Research Institute (INPE), for collecting earth data (of ecological interest). Brazil may soon be able to launch satellites using its own Satellite Launch Vehicle (VLS). The INPE satellite was placed in orbit using an American rocket.
