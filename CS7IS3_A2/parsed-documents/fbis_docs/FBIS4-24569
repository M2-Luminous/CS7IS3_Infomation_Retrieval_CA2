Local officials said Friday [27 May] that the project will cost 120 million yuan (about 13.79 million U.S. dollars), of which 4.31 million U.S. dollars will be covered by donated money from the U.N. fund and another 6.23 million U.S. dollars will be covered by World Bank loans. The plant will be built and managed by the Shanghai Maritime Transport (Group) Co. The plant at Waigaoqiao, Shanghai, will have a 300m waterfront, with a dock to handle ships with 35,000 dead weight tonnages. It will be equipped with modern greasy dirt and sewage treatment facilities. The whole project is expected to be finished in 1995. By then, the plant will help treat 400,000 tons of greasy dirt and sewage and 100,000 tons of water polluted by chemicals a year. Construction of similar environmental protection projects has also started in five other port cities: Dalian, Tianjin, Ningbo, Xiamen and Guangzhou. The building of the projects in these six ports will involve use of a total of 30 million U.S. dollars of donated money from the U.N. fund and 15 million U.S. dollars of loans from the World Bank.
