Could this be regarded as a continuation of your U.S. visit from the political point of view, or is it a coincidence? Can we speak of Georgia's new role? And how founded is the irritation of the Russian press and of certain circles with the visits to the United States by Nazarbayev, Kravchuk, and yourself? The view has been expressed that the United States is gaining spheres of influence from Russia. [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. As I have already said, Jim Baker's visit is connected with his being a cochairman of a committee for the salvation of Georgia. On my arrival in Washington we had a very short meeting and we agreed that he will come to Tbilisi and we will continue our exchange of views on the fate of democracy in Georgia, on the economy of Georgia, and on the main ideas for business relations between Georgian and U.S. business. His advice is essential for us. He has great experience. [passage omitted] It was considered essential that the American community, that U.S. citizens listen to my views on various issues. The main direction of my speeches in the United States -- you attended meetings and listened to them -- was that it is inadmissible to permit a recurrence of the cold war. This issue was covered from different points of view but my principal approach was that this would be a disaster for the world and every country would pay a high price for that. There is no reason for anyone to be irritated or jealous. All ultrareactionaries, from our region or from others, dream of an ice-age. I think that my contention that Russia and the United States should continue in partnership to handle all complex issues of the modern world found a fertile soil in the United States and I hope that the wishes and aspirations of the majority of Russian people are directed toward this principle of partnership. As for the visits to the United States or to any other country by heads of the CIS countries, I think these are ordinary events which should not surprise anyone. An independent country is independent because its leader can himself decide where to go and where not to. Now, your question about whether Georgia's role will increase: I would say that interest toward Georgia is substantial. It is natural that if we manage to achieve stability, if we manage to settle the Abkhazian issue by normal political means, to settle the issue of Samachablo, and to revive our economy, we will have our own identity and gain our place in world politics. It is natural that this will result in a new function of the state. This will be a function of determining not only internal policy but also policy in foreign relations. You have said that individual public figures in Russia make claims against the United States for widening their spheres of influence. I do not think that this is the case today. Nowadays, we should have a different comprehension of spheres of influence. Today, people will find themselves in these spheres of influence not depending on who is strong but depending on what principles of Weltanschauung they have and what model of economic development or rather what experience of economic development they are offered. We have to say that we have already determined our relations with Russia and it is impossible to speak more than has already been said. We have said that we want friendship with Russia, we want close relationships. At the same time, we need relations with the whole surrounding world. I think that these first reactions to trips by presidents [of the CIS countries] will pass. Everything will be understood in the right way and life will go ahead in a normal way. [Oniani] Just recently we spoke about the economy. The hardships of the postcommunist years in Georgia seem to be due to a naive attitude toward the economy. This has already been said repeatedly. Speaking of the economy, the people used to say -- and quite loudly -- that for the sake of independence they are ready to eat grass. Eventually it appeared that it is not that simple. Yesterday, at the first congress of the Union of Georgia's Citizens, most of your speech was dedicated to economic problems. You said that economic stabilization will begin in the country in 1995. It is clear that foreign investments will require a legislative basis. This is an issue which has been repeatedly put forward in France and in the United States by foreign partners. Speaking of the Cabinet of Ministers, you said that ministries should be structures of political significance rather than economic. How far do you think the present cabinet will manage to implement the reforms you and outher speakers mentioned? Moreover, the parliament is going to discuss the issue of the cabinet at its sitting tomorrow. [Shevardnadze] Yesterday's congress was a very serious occasion. I have no doubt now that it will be a mass movement. I cannot help saying that the delegates' businesslike and professional speeches made me happy. The speeches were very comprehensive. I would highlight the youth. They crowned the congress. [passage omitted praising speakers, audience, documents passed at the congress] As for what will happen in the parliament, of course, it is difficult to forecast. I would say one thing. I request this from both the majority and the minority. I have planned meetings with them. I ask them to approach the issue in a very serious way. I want the radio listeners to hear it and know it. Change for the sake of change will never be effective. A change should not be an end in itself. I said yesterday that no magician will come to the Georgian Government. And the introduction of 1, or 2, or 10 inexperienced people into the government means that they will not be able to do anything during the next three or four months. They will find it very hard. Seeking a scapegoat will cost the state even more. If it were for me, I would not replace the principal staff. There is talk about corruption and that some ministers cannot be trusted. This is another thing. This needs yet additional arguments. A general conversation is not sufficient. [passage omitted on the current situation in Georgia and prospects of reviving the economy] In this situation, any replacement of ministers could have grave consequences. This should be considered by parliamentarians. Above all, a majority of the ministers, especially those in charge of the economy, have had experience in international economic relations and have acquired a minimum of the knowledge needed to handle foreign investments and import foreign products. This is a school. A new person will find it difficult to start from the very beginning. That is why I say that the parliament should take all this into consideration. If the parliament makes a decision which cannot lead to an improvement in the situation, this will further undermine the authority of the parliament, of its chairman, and of the head of state, too. It is necessary for parliament to attach much more attention to the creation of legislative bases, especially regarding foreign investments. We have found plenty of partners. Incidentally, Mr. Baker named one big industrialist, who works in the sphere of oil- prospecting, and said that he has serious claims against our legislature. He is ready to come to Georgia along with other companies. He believes that there is much oil in Georgia. He knows there are people who will work. But the existing laws are not sufficient for such wide-range cooperation. Therefore, apart from changes in the cabinet and sacking or changing ministers, the parliament should do its best to create a legislative basis. My remarks that there should be certain improvements in 1994 and that 1995 should become a year of stabilization and that improvements will be felt by all families in 1995, are not simply cheap talks, provided the approach in parliament, in government, and in all rayons and regions is serious . [Excerpts] [Oniani] In your speech you spoke about the role of the constitution which is in the process of being drafted. You claimed that it is necessary to introduce the post of president to serve as an essential element in overcoming the crisis. After all the negative assessments of the presidential post which were made by the former opposition and in view of general attitudes, how much chance do you think this idea has of being accepted? And how necessary is it for Georgia to have a president? [Shevardnadze] [Passage omitted: Shevardnadze says he spoke about this at the congress but he knows his speech at the congress was too long to be published] By all means, a country like Georgia needs a strong power, a strong executive power and correct relations between the executive power and the parliament as well as a judicial power. A country which is in crisis and which has a peculiar (?geopolicy) will not be able to stabilize itself itself with a relatively weak power. I said yesterday that the president's power and authority should be a guarantee of the country's security, integrity, and unity. As for our bitter experience, I would like to say that history knows good and bad presidents in various countries. Some have been good, some bad, and some even criminal. This happened in the United States but the United States did not reject the idea of the presidency. We need a good and strong president. I have been convinced of this by numerous discussions. The people have had experience. They know what sort of person not to elect. And this means a lot. I think there is a rather wide and interesting spectrum of political figures at present. There is a big choice. However, this is my own idea and it may not be accepted by the constitutional commission. Neither may it be accepted by the parliament and the people. [Passage omitted elaborating] It can be said that certain mistakes are made not only during presidential elections -- this should also be considered -- but during parliamentary elections, too. Not many parliaments are ideal, so to say. I do not mean our parliament. [Oniani] And yet another phrase from your speech: Abkhazia will have the autonomy stipulated by European or world standards. You said this and added that the CIS, and especially Russia's experiences and serious achievements in the construction of the state should be taken into consideration. How should we understand this? What does it mean? Today, yet another round of talks about Abkhazia will take place. How efficient do you think it will be considering that in Abkhazia progressively thinking Abkhazians -- I mean the Movement for Peaceful Abkhazia -- managed to issue a statement on the current situation in Abkhazia. This means that such people exist. The people have always existed but the main thing is that they have managed to say this aloud. This means that the situation is changing. [Shevardnadze] Speaking of Abkhazia yesterday, I meant that it could be autonomous or something else. I meant Abkhazia's political status, in principle. I also spoke about the political status of Ajara. The rights Abkhazia had before the war, before the conflict, met all world standards. I spoke about this at the UN Security Council and this was unexpected for many. We are ready to have a wider look at this issue, to distinguish functions as is needed for each to do his own job. As for the Russian experience, I am talking about a constitutional solution to the problem. I consider it to have been Yeltsin's big victory when he managed to induce the people to adopt the constitution in the shape he suggested. I am referring to the rights, duties, and representation of the subjects [of the federation] in the supreme bodies, in the parliament in particular. I think this experience should be discussed in the press as well as on television and so on so that the people can have a better idea about it. It is a very interesting experience. I have been told that the presentation of the UN secretary general's report to the Security Council has been scheduled for today. Decisions will not apparently be made today or tomorrow, as far as I understand. But I believe that the report will be an ideal reflection of the situation in Abkhazia. Now, with regard to the recent broadcasts of the Movement for Peaceful Abkhazia, I have to admit that I am not well aware of this. I listened to it in the same way as you did. Certain radio stations have registered this. It has been said that this originated in Abkhazia, in Sukhumi, that is, in the heart of Abkhazia. As far as I know, ethnic Abkhazians residing in Abkhazia as well as from the outside take an active part in this movement. I do not think that it comes from the Tbilisi, from Tbilisi Abkhazians. It is important because the appeal to live in peace, to return to Abkhazia, and to restore the age-old traditions we have had for centuries is coming from Abkhazia. [passage omitted: exhibitions are planned to demonstrate Georgia's intellectual and industrial potential. Shevardnadze welcomes the exhibitions, praises young scientists and entrepreneurs, and promises assistance] [Oniani] And, finally, Batono Eduard, you yourself have said -- and it is frequently said -- that we have to declare war on the mafia and on saboteurs. But, unfortunately, cases of sabotage are still numerous. The authorities and law-enforcement bodies seem to be unable to combat this. If we add the social dimension to this, the question arises naturally: How long will things last like this? How long will this inactivity last? There are evident cases of sabotage which are not followed by any reaction. [Shevardnadze] I would like to answer you like this. The fight against the mafia has begun and it will continue and its scale and pace will not reduce. Of course, it is not at all easy to eradicate the mafia or to supress it. This is not only a Georgian phenomenon. I should say that as one economic structure of a state is replaced by another, this is accompanied by the stirring up and establishment of mafiosi clans and then it is rather difficult to eliminate the clans. Mafiosi structures create a rather undesirable climate, if I may say so, even in highly developed countries. We should come to the conclusion that we have to assist and care about law-enforcement bodies. Society should be mobilized. This process has commenced and thus stirred up hopes, I believe. We must support the people who do not tremble they talk about combating mafiosi clans. I want to declare that the pace of the fight will not decrease and I want to assure radio listeners of this.
