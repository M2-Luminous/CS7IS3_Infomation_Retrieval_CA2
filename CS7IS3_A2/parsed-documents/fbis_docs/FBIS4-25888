The number of newly established foreign-funded enterprises was 10,739 in the first quarter of this year, down 43.6 percent compared to the same period last year. There was also a 50 percent drop in new foreign investment and registered capital, according to the latest SAIC statistics. "The introduction of a new taxation system, which cuts down preferential tax treatment for foreign-funded ventures, is a major factor affecting new foreign investment," said Hou Lin, head of the Enterprise Registration Department of SAIC. Other policy readjustments, such as the suspension of duty-free import of foreign cars by foreign-funded firms in China, and the increasing competition among industries vying for foreign funds also played a part. Two other factors also contributed to the slowdown. The first are the preferential policies adopted by some nearby Asian countries to attract foreign investments, and the second is the tightened economic control designed to cut down the scale of capital investment. "The slowdown in the growth of foreign-funded firms is normal and it is good that the State standardizes foreign firms and joint ventures and improves their management in China," Hou said. He added that the rapid growth of foreign-funded firms in the past two years saw some unhealthy practices. For example, bogus joint ventures had been set up to take advantage of Chinese preferential policies. A small increase in the number of foreign-funded firms was reported in. Beijing, Jilin and Tibet Autonomous Region. However, the number plunged by more than 50 percent in 12 provinces and regions including Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, Hainan and Hunan. About 70 percent of the foreign investment went to the industrial sector while investment in real estate, public utility projects and consultancy services is cooling. The number of joint ventures decreased by 50 percent in the first quarter but the number of foreignowned firms rose by 6 percent, according to SAIC statistics. There were a total of 167,000 overseas-funded businesses in the country by the end of last year.
