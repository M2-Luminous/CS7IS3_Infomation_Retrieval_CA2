"Immense work has been done to draft the accord, taking into account the interests of different sides," presidential council member Aleksey Salmin wrote in the newspaper ROSSIISKIYE VESTI. "It has not yielded a balanced result in every instance, regrettably, and the text itself could do with more editing. But the main thing is not what the end result of text work is but what the accord is going to bring about, how it will work." Salmin thinks that it is necessary to create a mechanism of implementing the accord. "An important and necessary step has been taken, but the most important thin lies ahead -- the concept behind the idea of the document has yet to me materialized." "The great number of signatories is creating an illusion of unity of the country's political forces," PRAVDA says in a commentary. "But this is not really so. Not only the communists and the Yabloko faction have refused to sign. The socialists, democratic christians and a great number of trade unions declined to sign. This should make the president think why." "What we watched yesterday (during the ceremony of signing of the accord) was only the beginning of a complex and even painful process of search for concord in Russia", the newspaper TRUD said. One other event is highlighted by many newspapers -- the killing of a Duma deputy, Andrey Aizderdis. The newspaper RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA writes: "We would not like to dwell on versions of the murder, for the motive for the crime by no means reflects its substance. The substance is related to the reform course against which no minister and no fine programmes of combating crime can protect us. The redistribution of property, the formation of a new elite are not amusing trifles, as the ideologues of the course and their supporters would have us believe. There are more contestants of room at the top of Russia's new society than there is room for them. They are going to compete tooth and nail." ROSSIISKIYE VESTI publishes a number of versions of the murder of the State Duma deputy, including political assassination, contract killing for economic reasons and mafia revenge. "It is known that Aizderdis was the publisher of the newspaper "KTO EST KTO" (WHO IS WHO) in Moscow's suburb of Khimki. In one of its recent issues, the newspaper published a list of "underworld leaders." The newspaper prefaced the publication with a statement that it is "the first ever publication of a near exhaustive list of criminal authorities, which was not available to law enforcement operatives until now." The newspaper TRUD said, citing sources in the Russian Interior Ministry's chief directorate for combating organised crime, that the murder was prompted by Andrey Aizderdis' commercial and banking activity. According to ROSSISKIYE VESTI, before his election to the State Duma, Aizderdis was MKD bank president and headed a cooperative which built roads and housing." KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports on the work of the president's security service. Commenting on former President Mikhail Gorbachev's "unscheduled meetings with crowds," a presidential security service member, Andrey Oligov, said "former members of the Ninth Chief Directorate (the former KGB's personal security department) know that "all unplanned sorties of Mikhail Sergeevich to shake hands with common people were simply stage-managed. Out in the street he would sometimes, without being aware of the fact, talked with KGB agents who were strategically placed in the right place at the right time." PRAVDA carries an interview with Vyacheslav Kebich, head of the Belarusian Government. The Belarusian premier said the only way out of the crisis was "only through creating, in close alliance with Russia, an effective model of the economy and fair and just society."
