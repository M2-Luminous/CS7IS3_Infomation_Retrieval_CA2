Yet a few weeks later, Boris Yeltsin sent a surprise letter to Western leaders, calling on them not to expand NATO. Why was the Russian president's behavior not consistent with the declaration? [Kozyrev] Maybe because he did not read the declaration very carefully. We diplomats are accustomed to studying every single document with painstaking care, but nondiplomats tend to skim them. The things we are saying today are contained in the Russo-Polish declaration. In conformity with the CSCE, we believe that any decisions reached by Poland are an expression of that country's freedom of choice. The Polish state defines its own needs and expectations, and takes sovereign steps in this or that sphere. It also decides whether to take part in the work of various international organizations. However, the declaration says nothing about Russia, an independent state just like Poland, not having the right to present its own ideas, especially on how fast the European security system is to be established. Just as we believe Poland may decide freely on whether to join NATO, we believe that there is no point in hurrying to join NATO. There is nothing inconsistent about that. [Graczyk] In that case, what do you mean by the expression "Russia's special interests in this part of Europe"? [Kozyrev] The Russians and Poles have historical links. We share a border in the Kaliningrad Oblast, and we both belong to the Baltic Cooperation Council. The very creation of this council is proof that both countries share common interests. One reason for this, of course, is that both of our countries border on the Baltic Sea, to say nothing of our cultures and economic relations. Minister Olechowski presented me with a Russo-Polish economic cooperation program. That is also evidence of special ties between our countries, stemming from a desire to develop cooperation in particular spheres. But that does not mean that we have imperialist longings or a desire to dominate others or indulge in diktat, and I am sure Poland does not want to dictate an economic policy to us. It would not be fair to interpret Minister Olechowski's speech in such a way, even though he did mention a special interest in cooperating with Russia. By the way, Russia's "special interests" do not apply only to Europe. They also apply to other parts of the world--for example, Mexico. [Graczyk] Poland is also interested in other eastern neighbors, including Ukraine and Belarus. How do you assess Polish diplomatic moves in this region? [Kozyrev] As a great power, we value ourselves too highly to develop an inferiority complex. On the other hand, we respect democratic Poland too much to detect any Polish neoimperialism in such positive aims as economic development or political and cultural cooperation with CIS countries. Although I myself am sometimes accused of harboring neoimperial tendencies, I cannot say the same about my Polish friend and colleague. [Graczyk] Differences of opinion between Poland and Russia on security in this part of Europe are well known. Both you and Minister Olechowski have declared a rapprochement of views since the Krakow meeting. [Kozyrev] Our perspectives are undergoing constant modification. It would be naive to think that, with the speed of change today, the declarations of any one politician will continue to be valid in 10 years' time. That would be a miracle of diplomacy. Therefore, every hard-pressed diplomat reacts to his surroundings, shifting the balance in his views and adjusting his stance. Minister Olechowski and I are keeping a close eye on what is happening around us. We also listen to each other and take each other's views into consideration--hence, certain nuances and changes of opinion. But, basically, we agree that a common Europe has to be built together by means of dialogue. But one should not make hasty and unpremeditated decisions that could turn out to be inconvenient for one side or the other. We must all continue to work on this. One cannot expect miracles in diplomacy.
