Anders Bjoerck and Francois Leotard told a press conference that they were agreed on the need for "rather determined methods" to reopen the airport, which has been closed to air traffic since the beginning of the Bosnian conflict and which is needed for the supply of humanitarian relief. On Tuesday the UN secretary general said he would approve the use of air power in Bosnia-Herzegovina if United Nations personnel on the ground called for it. The two defence ministers said they had agreed on other "concrete proposals" that they could not for the moment reveal. "We must not make threats without being able to implement them," Leotard said. He said the ministers had discussed "the hundreds of Serb guns hidden around Sarajevo and in several villages" and the danger for UN troops and Bosnian civilians in the event that military action was taken. Bosnia's separatist Serbs, who have surrounded Sarajevo and held it under siege, with daily bombardments, for the past 21 months, have dismissed the likelihood of international military action, pointing to previous threats to use force that have not been followed up.
