FBIS4-5770 "dreas072__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-072-A Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Remodeled FSX Considered as Training Aircraft Remodeled FSX Considered as Training Aircraft OW1304083694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1304083694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The Defense Agency [DA] and aircraft makers, such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, have begun considering plans to designate a redesigned version of the next-generation support fighter (FSX) as a successor to the current aircraft being used for high-level training since the latter is becoming outdated. The FSX is currently being developed with joint Japanese-U.S. efforts. Initial plans called for purchasing at the most about 130 of these aircraft, which were originally intended as support fighters. To turn them into high-level training aircraft, aircraft makers would be required to increase their total production to a little under 200 units. The increased production is expected to reduce unit production costs. Another advantage is that it would help U.S. military industries, which are suffering from defense spending cuts, to make more profit. The FSX is a successor to the F-1 support fighter. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is the primary contractor for its production. Since the maximum number of these aircraft to be purchased is approximately 130--a rather low figure--unit cost is said to range from 7 billion to 8 billion yen. Consequently, reducing production costs has been a problem. Meanwhile, the T-2, a domestically produced high-level training aircraft, has served as the basis for designing the F-1. A little under 100 of these aircraft were produced as of 1988. It made its maiden flight in 1971, much earlier than the F-1. The aircraft has become outdated, and several of them have already been decommissioned. The DA considers selection of a successor to the T-2 as an important issue in its next defense program, which starts in fiscal year 1996. Preparations have already begun. Initially, there were plans for Japan to independently develop a supersonic aircraft to replace the T-2. Since, among other reasons, Japan would have to bear development costs, circumstances are such that it would have to give up on the plan to build a completely new aircraft. Should the FSX be successfully transformed into a training aircraft, the DA would purchase about 200 of these aircraft. It is hoped that production costs would be reduced as a result of mass production.
