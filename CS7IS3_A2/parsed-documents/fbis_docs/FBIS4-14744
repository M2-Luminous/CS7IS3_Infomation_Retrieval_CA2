Our country's only cyclotron, which cost us 15 billion karbovantsi, has remained idle for six months. There is not enough money for the energy and heating that it requires. Just as there is no money at the Academy of Sciences, the government is also in no hurry to help the scientists. The Institute's financing from the budget is only 40 percent.... As a result, there is not enough money to conduct basic studies. It is as though they have become unnecessary. Specialists, who even now are not so numerous, are looking for other jobs. For example, in Russia, where salaries are higher and where there are possibilities for advancement. However, perhaps the worst thing about this is that young people are leaving the Institute -- commercial structures lure them away. In the course of time, Ukraine may find itself without nuclear specialists. At the same time, we have 15 nuclear power stations, and, by the year 2000, it is envisaged to have at least another five units commissioned.
