The World Bank delegation is conducting talks with several officials of the Moroccan Government. The purpose of the visit is exploratory, according to the members of the delegation. They also met with the board of the Union of Moroccan Banks, the General Federation of Businessmen, and the Governor of the Central Bank. They visited the regions of Morocco in which projects partially or fully funded by the World bank are located. The World Bank delegation is also waiting to meet with Moroccan Prime Minister Mr. Mohamed Karim Lamrani. The preliminary statement the delegation issued after its arrival in Morocco this week said that the World Bank and members of its board want a greater familiarity with trends in the Moroccan economy, especially in the areas of liberalization and privatization, project funding, the banking system, investment, and related operation and regulations. The World Bank indicated that it had offered Morocco, over 30 years, over $6.7 billion in loans and assorted funding. It is now committed to participation in funding 30 development projects, with loans worth a total of $2.9 billion in the areas of agriculture, irrigation, housing, the environment, education, public works, transport, and others. The World Bank report for 1993-1994 published in Washington last week indicated that Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia are the Arab countries that have obtained the highest percentage of the Bank's loans, and the largest rate of foreign investment. The report explained that the economic liberalization pursued by these countries has helped them to obtain increased foreign investments. For their part, Moroccan sources said that the World Bank's total loans represent nearly a third of Morocco's total foreign debt, which stood at $20.5 billion at the end of last year, of which 17 percent were commercial loans after the rescheduling arranged with the London Club last year. According to the statement made by World Bank Vice President Koch Fiers [name as transliterated] during his Moroccan visit two weeks ago (he met with King Hassan II in Marrakech), the World Bank is seeking to boost the volume of loans offered annually to Morocco, to approach $800 million to $1 billion annually, as against about $560 million last year. The Bank, however, wants in return to be familiar with the new (profitable) projects that it can fund in whole or in part, saying that the Moroccan economy needs to prove its ability to absorb these loans. The World Bank mission's presence in Morocco coincides with the continuation of the parliamentary discussion of the $10 billion 1994 budget plan, which stipulates increased local economic liberalization and a decrease in the budget deficit of 1.5 percent of gross domestic product, and economic growth in excess of 7 percent. The Moroccan Government wants to use 1994's privatization revenues, estimated at $400 million, to boost economic performance, develop the employment field, and reduce the tax burden imposed on companies and individuals, besides permitting the local and foreign private sector to invest in strategic sectors that had been the preserve of the public sector, such as energy, transport, irrigation, communications, and public works. It is waiting, in light of the World Bank delegation's visit, to define the volume of loans the Bank will offer Morocco in 1994 and 1995, part of which Morocco wants to allocate to fund youth projects and provide additional job opportunities to help the local economy adapt to the global economy after the signature of the GATT accord in Marrakech in mid-April this year. That occasion will be attended by a number of heads of state from industrialized countries, including President Bill Clinton, according to Moroccan sources preparing the holding of the global GATT conference.
