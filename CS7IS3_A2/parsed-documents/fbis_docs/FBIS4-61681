FBIS4-61681 "drsov089_e_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 UKRAINE International Affairs Kiev Wants Cooperation With EU Without Nuclear Treaty Kiev Wants Cooperation With EU Without Nuclear Treaty LD0605163194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1540 GMT 6 May 94 LD0605163194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Certain European countries condition Ukraine's signing of the Treaty on Partnership and Cooperation with the European Union with ratification of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons by the Ukrainian parliament. This was said by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko at a press conference in Kiev today. Zlenko said he had heard this "disturbing note" during his talks with Deputy Chairman of the EU [European Union] Commission, the European Commissions Commissioner for Foreign Economy Leon Britten which had finished in Kiev today. "We do not yet know the names of these states, however such an approach is unacceptable for us," Zlenko emphasized. He stressed that Ukraine was carrying out the trilateral statement on nuclear disarmament made by the U.S., Russian and Ukrainian presidents. He added that the Ukrainian leadership was doing everything possible in order to join the treaty on non-proliferation. Zlenko suggested that the conditioning of the treaty on cooperation with that on non-proliferation could create a "dangerous precedent." He said this could be in the interests of forces trying to put Ukraine in a difficult situation from the point of view of international public opinion. Britten stated that the EU leaders had never sought to establish an inter-dependence between the two documents and urged the countries which had put forward such a condition to disassociate themselves from it. However, Britten called on the Ukrainian leadership to speed up ratification of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Britten said that the EU would consider possible assistance to Ukraine with construction of two energy blocks on two nuclear power stations, which would help Ukraine with energy supply and put the Chernobyl nuclear power station out of utilization. Britten told INTERFAX-Ukraine that the amount of aid had not as yet been defined and would depend on what aid the world community would be able to give to Ukraine. He added that the issue on the Chernobyl nuclear power station would be discussed at the G-7 meeting this summer. Britten also announced that a Treaty on Partnership and Cooperation between the EU and Russia had been worked out. It would be submitted to the EU leading bodies in the near future.
