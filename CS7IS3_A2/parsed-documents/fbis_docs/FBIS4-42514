They have been deprived of the phantasy by which they live. Lately, market participants speculated from week to week on falling interest rates, and with this hope the prices rose. But this tooth of constantly slightly dropping interest rates was surprisingly pulled by the Bundesbank two weeks ago. This not only concerns the lowering of key interest rates by half a percent, described in exaggeration as significant. In addition, there were statements by the Bundesbank president about the cleared-up horizon, which were taken as an interest-rate pause until summer or fall, or even as the lowest interest rate benchmark. So even the minimal lowering of the third key rate this week is of no help. Sales of fixed-interest securities predominate, prices are tumbling, and long-term interest rates are rising. Thus the calculation of the Bundesbank might work out. The declared goal of its signal two weeks ago was favoring long-term investments through lower interest rates for short-term investments. This is backed by the hope of the guardians of the currency that those active in finances, by switching from the money market to the capital market, could break down the dam of the accumulated money supply. For since the end of last year, tax and interest rate uncertainties have produced a decided inclination in investors toward short-term disposable money. Nurtured by relatively high interest rates, billions are parked in accounts and time deposits instead of flowing into long-term securities. The excessive money supply is not the only headache for the Bundesbank, which can still proudly point to its strong German mark. So far, no one has been able to refute the thesis that the liquidity glut may harbor the germ of future inflation. At the same time, the interest level in this country must remain attractive for quite some time to finance unification. It is not own capital which dominates the bond market. In 1993, there was an influx of 226 billion German marks from abroad, which was highly welcome in view of the necessary transfers to east Germany. Since February, the tide has turned, and foreigners are again withdrawing their deposits. The savings rate of Germans also is no longer what it was, because the savings rate of 11 percent has reached its lowest point in seven years. It is fortunate that the dollar also plays in the trans-Pacific field of tension and does not outstrip the strong German mark. What was it the BHF bank said? The Bundesbank needs a thick skin, also because the new slick financial maneuvers can turn any monetary gnat into a financial elephant.
