The State Customs Committee's directive is a temporary normative act that remains in force, as indicated in the Customs Code, until comprehensive regulations regarding the processing classification are promulgated. The new document specifies, in part, that goods may be imported for processing only by enterprises at which processing operations are included in the normal production process. And goods subject to excise tax may not be considered goods for processing at all. Moreover, if goods imported for processing are placed into free circulation on the internal market (which is permitted), a duty, the value-added tax and a special tax must be paid. In the opinion of experts, the special processing customs classification is not particularly relevant to Russia at present, given the present capabilities of its production branches. Experience indicates that Western partners are interested in processing goods at Russian facilities only when what is involved are hazardous production processes that are restricted or banned altogether in most developed countries. Therefore, when goods are brought into Russia for processing, what is usually involved is the importation of waste products of the chemical industry or nuclear power engineering. However, even without the special directive, operations to process such goods may be carried out only after special permission (a license) is received from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. At the same time, it is no secret that the special processing classification has often taken the place of the temporary importation classification, especially since the introduction of procedures requiring mandatory advanced payments when various property is imported on a temporary basis (for a period of up to one year). On the other hand, in the absence of a normative basis, the special processing classification has been used as a niche for evading excess taxes when goods subject to excise tax were imported. For example, the ordinary decanting of alcohol from barrels into half-liter bottles was called processing. So now importers have lost the possibility of utilizing the processing classification, under which customs duties are not collected, in order to relieve their tax burden. Some Mandatory Conditions for the Importation of Goods Under the Special Processing Classification in Accordance With Directive No. 01-12/74 of the Russian State Customs Committee - Goods are imported into Russia for processing by the enterprises that directly carries out the processing operations, and are produced in accordance with the enterprise's usual production process. - The goods imported for processing are not subject to excise tax. - The level of customs duties on the goods imported for processing does not exceed 100 percent of their value. - The processing period is no longer than six months. - The enterprise submits a pledge to a customs agency that the products of processing will be re-exported in accordance with customs export regulations.
