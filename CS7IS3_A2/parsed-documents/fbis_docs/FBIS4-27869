North Korea said in a statement issued by Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu on Friday that they would push ahead with their withdrawal from the NPT and would expand "self-reliant nuclear energy industry" under the present manner. "This is an extremely dangerous idea that makes a mockery of the hope of the international community and all the Korean people for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," the government said in a statement. The statement released by Yi Song-kon, Seoul-side chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, said the North's recent unilateral replacement of fuel rods at a 5-megawatt atomic reactor was an act of fundamentally shattering the joint declaration of denuclearization. "We in our part will continue to strive and take all available steps to strictly implement the denuclearization declaration under all circumstances," it said.
