Krishtalev and I. Roytapel: "Development of the Power Generation Sector and Social Problems"] [Text] Last week a meeting with Academician Chingiz Dzhuvarly, a leading specialist in the field of power generation in Azerbaijan, was held at the Baku Institute of Social Administration and Political Sciences. He informed his listeners about the current situation in power generation and its situation in Azerbaijan, and associated social problems. The academician elaborated on two problems facing the power generation industry in Azerbaijan and the world: first, power generation per se and increasing the equipment's efficiency; and second, transfer of power over distances. Azerbaijan currently produces 4 million kwhr of electric power. It is envisaged to bring the power output to 10 million kwhr by the year 2005 (one large station in the West produces about 12 million kwhr). On the subject of exporting electric power and Azerbaijan's potential, Academician Dzhuvarly said that our republic may become an electric power exporter and even now, in this difficult time for us, we export a quantity of power to neighboring Georgia. In an interview specially for GUNAY, the scientist emphasized that according to the terms of the contract with a Western oil consortium, all payments for power consumption will be made by representatives of these companies. Chingiz Dzhuvarly also said that the republic population is not being deprived of its legitimate share of electric power despite the increase in power consumption due to oil companies' activities, since currently only 40 percent of the power produced is being utilized, and the other 60 percent "disappears" who knows where. Academician Dzhuvarly talked about the trends in electric power generation from so-called small-scale sources--solar, wind-powered, and tide-powered power stations. The potential of solar energy is extremely great. If we process only 3 percent of the energy of our sun we will produce approximately 1 trillion kw. But, noted the academician, another serious problem arises--the problem of safety of life on the planet. The scientist named the limits for developing power generation and civilization on Earth--100 billion kw per 10 billion persons. If the capacity is increased above 100 billion kw, irreversible changes may occur on Earth, and a catastrophe is inevitable. Ch. Dzhuvarly also shared his forecast of social relations in the future: He believes that large, developed, militarily strong countries in pursuit of gain will encroach on the interests of small, less developed countries, imposing on them a certain population and power generation limit, because overproduction of power and overpopulation may destroy civilization.
