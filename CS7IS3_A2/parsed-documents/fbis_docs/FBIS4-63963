In view of that, a news conference was held at which presidential representative in the oblast Valentyn Melnychuk stated that it had been a purely preventive measure, which had nothing to do with a "new" accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant [AES]. Serhiy Parashyn, general director of the plant, assured journalists that his collective had "rendered such an accident impossible." In his opinion, the idea of closing down the Chernobyl AES has been artificially spread at the initiative of certain circles in the West. The people who are mainly interested in this are those trying to obtain funds from Ukraine's budget for implementing expensive projects.
