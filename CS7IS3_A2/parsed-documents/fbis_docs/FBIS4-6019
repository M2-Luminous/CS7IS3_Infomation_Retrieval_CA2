The message says President Kim Il-song founded the chuche idea to provide the universal truth of the perfection of man, a mighty sword for the transformation of the nature and society and has built a powerful socialist state independent, self-sustaining and self- reliant in national defence, on the land of chuche cultivated by himself. Noting that it is a feat of the century worthy of particular note that he has perfectly solved the question of succeeding to the revolutionary cause, it stresses that as chuche Korea has the leader at its head and is guided by the sagacious leader Comrade Kim Chong- il possessed of literary and military accomplishments, it has gained a far-flung fame as an invincible country with solid, singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses and as an ever- victorious country strong enough to defeat any aggressor forces at one blow. "Advancing under the bright rays of chuche with the great leader as the sun of the nation, Hanminjon and the people of all walks of life have been able to steadfastly maintain the life-line in shaping the destiny and continue the movement for turning the fascist colony into an independent and democratic land, without slightest vacillation in spite of the fascist suppression and the grim trials and adversities," it says. The message expresses the resolution to hasten the modelling of Hanminjon on the chuche idea, invigorate the righteous anti-U.S., anti-fascist struggle for national salvation and activate the reunification movement under the banner of the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation with the immortal chuche idea of the great leader and his constant view of "believing the people as in heaven" as the motto of the life and struggle. It wishes President Kim Il-song good health and long life.
