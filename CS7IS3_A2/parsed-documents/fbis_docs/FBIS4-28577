This is because the continued massacre, sabotage, and destruction of the national and people's property are the causes for the losses of property and human lives and a major obstacle hindering the process for national reconciliation and for the nation's restoration and reconstruction. The RGC also wants to recall that it has all along displayed genuine goodwill in pursuing the policy of peace and national reconciliation of His Majesty the King, especially his superb initiatives to bring about an immediate end to the massacre in Cambodia. The RGC has always expressed its support for all the superb ideas of His Majesty the King, particularly the king's proposals and pleas for a complete, immediate, permanent, irreversible, and unconditional cease-fire throughout the country. But unfortunately, the Khmer Rouge obstinately have refused to abandon their strategy to prolong the war and have continued to massacre, menace, and destroy the peaceful life of the Cambodian people. The Khmer Rouge have resorted to all schemes and means and raised all sorts of illegitimate and unreasonable proposals and arguments, which run counter to the wish of the Cambodians and world community, in an attempt to hinder His Majesty the King's lofty ideas for peace and national reconciliation and unity, particularly his proposal made at the roundtable meeting held in Chhanghsu-on Palace on 27 and 28 May 1994 calling for a complete, immediate, and irreversible cease-fire on the spot to be observed everywhere on 15 June, beginning at noon. Firmly adhering to the spirit of love for peace and national reconciliation of the RGC and the people throughout the country, the RGC fervently expresses its desire for the coming roundtable meeting on 15 June to achieve success in bringing about a clear specification on the schedule for a complete, immediate, on-the-spot, and permanent cease-fire. [Dated] Phnom Penh, 11 June 1994
