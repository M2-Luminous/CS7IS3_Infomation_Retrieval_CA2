FBIS4-59745 "drnes095_n_94005" FBIS-NES-94-095 Daily Report 11 May 1994 LEBANON Hizballah TV, Others Violate Political News Ban Hizballah TV, Others Violate Political News Ban NC1605075394 Beirut AL-NAHAR in Arabic 11 May 94 p 4 NC1605075394 Beirut AL-NAHAR Arabic BFN [Text] Ba'labakk, AL-NAHAR--Following a compulsory suspension lasting 50 days, Al-Fajr Television, the organ of Hizballah in the Ba'labakk region, violated the Cabinet decision banning the transmission of political news and programs. Two violations occurred, on Sunday and Monday at 2015, when the television broadcast two newscasts. Viewers confirmed that the casts contained news of the resistance. But the television did not carry the newscast last night, Tuesday, after REUTER reported the violations. The newscast was replaced by a film about the resistance. This step was taken amid the three-day-old government crisis caused by the seclusion of Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. Ghassan Darwish, director of Al-Fajr Television, confirmed the newscast had resumed but said that the focus was on social, cultural, economic, and sports news. The violation in al-Biqa' followed other violations recorded in Beirut recently. These included the Phalangist Party's Voice of Lebanon, which carried an economic newscast including political news, and Hizballah's Al-Manar Television, which broadcasts political speeches by men of religion. It is known that Al-Mashriq Television is broadcasting Syrian television's newscasts while CVN Television broadcasts newscasts by the London-based Saudi MBC Television.
