Ishii, 68, denied taking any money from Obayashi and pleaded innocence. Ishii's accomplice Mitsuo Moriya, 66, who was his one-time aide and charged with conspiring with the mayor to accept the bribe on Ishii's behalf, said he took delivery of the money but denied a prosecution contention that it was a bribe and that the two conspired to take it. Ishii, Moriya and the two businessmen entered separate pleas at their first trial session at the Tokyo District Court on Monday. It is the last in a series of trials on alleged payments to local government officials by major construction contractors. The two Obayashi executives are Koreaki Hagiwara, 66, former vice president of Obayashi, Japan's fourth largest construction firm based in Osaka, and Juichi Konishi, 59, former head of the builder's Tohoku branch in Sendai. The two are charged with giving the 10 million yen bribe to Ishii on Oct. 7, 1992. Hagiwara and Konishi told the court they gave Ishii the money to help his mayoral election campaign, accepting a prosecution argument their action constituted bribery. Ishii, who resigned as mayor after his arrest last year, is also on trial on charges of receiving bribes from several other major contractors in similar attempts to get orders for public works projects in Sendai. A series of bribery scandals has implicated eight contractors -- Hazama Corp., Shimizu Corp., Nishimatsu Construction Co., Mitsui Construction Co., Taisei Corp., Kajima Corp., Obayashi Corp. and Tobishima Corp. as well as Daishowa Paper Mfg. Co. In the series, 31 people, including two governors, two mayors and more 20 executives of construction companies have been indicted. The only remaining trial related to alleged bribery by major contractors is that of former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura expected some time between late June and early July.
