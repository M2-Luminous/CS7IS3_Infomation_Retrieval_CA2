They are being studied to learn the secrets of this Russian technology, and integrate it with that of Proel (Alenia-Finmeccanica), thereby leading to the creation of an all-Italian propulsion system. The Russian engines, produced by the Fakel company, are of the electroionic plasma type. The molecules of a gas (xenon), are ionized inside them and brought to a high temperature. They leave at high velocity, generating the thrust. These engines have an extremely high efficiency and this makes them ideal for use with telecommunications satellites, both to keep them in their correct positions in orbit and also for making changes to the orbit. Chemical rockets are used at present. These require heavy tanks filled with hydrazine. The electrical propulsors on the other hand are small, light, and consume very little. This means that their use reduces the weight of the satellites by 20 percent. The Russians have been using these propulsors for 20 years. However, because the construction technology was not very refined, they had the handicap of a limited life. Now that they have arrived in the West, they will be revised to obtain better results. Proel, which has already acquired precious experience with the similar technology of the electronic gun for the Tethered satellite and with the development of neutralizers for the German ionic engine Rit, is now developing a project for a completely Italian engine to be used on future satellites. Company president Marco Gerevini stated that: " We have received a contract from the ASI [Italian Space Agency], valued at 8.5 billion lire, to perfect this new technology within 28 months." Designer Gianfranco Cirri added that: "About 20 billion lire will then be needed to build a prototype to fly. All the parts for this could come from Proel."
