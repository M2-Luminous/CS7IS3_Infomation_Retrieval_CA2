[Beilin] Deputy foreign minister is accurate. [Segal] Our correspondent Shlomo Raz has just reviewed the difficulties on the Syrian track, which seem to be the result of the blooming relations with Jordan. [Beilin] Regrettably, this is not illogical. When we signed the Oslo agreement, the Syrians panicked a little and felt cast aside. As a result, they did not advance and even withdrew in the negotiations. I assume that the Jordanian affair does not please them very much. They would like to control the process and set the pace for the Palestinians and the Jordanians, just as they do in Lebanon. I am very glad that neither the Palestinians nor the Jordanians are willing to accept the Syrian pace, which naturally is much more cautious and rigid. I also hope this will not result in a real setback in the process with the Syrians, which is extremely important for us and, in fact, contains the makings of a comprehensive regional agreement. [Raz] In view of this, was it not a mistake to progress on the secret tracks with Jordan because, as you said, Syria is the country that holds the key to a comprehensive agreement in the region? [Beilin] Absolutely not. Our policy has always been to make progress with any neighbor we can: the Palestinians, the Jordanians, the Syrians, or the Lebanese. We seek to attain as much as possible with each of the parties -- all the way up to signing a permanent peace accord -- regardless of the others. We would be very glad if they all went along with us. We would be very glad if we could sign peace agreements with all the parties simultaneously. At the same time, we will allow no one -- not even the Syrians -- to have the right to veto moves by another party. As far as we are concerned, we will always take the risk of someone getting offended or staying behind if we face the opportunity of signing an agreement or making progress in that direction with some other party. This is why I am very happy about what happened with Jordan. I believe we made important progress. I hope the Syrians will also realize that comprehensive peace in the region is, first and foremost, to their advantage. [Segal] We have just heard that Dennis Ross is now meeting with Itamar Rabinovich. Do you believe Warren Christopher will come to Israel? [Beilin] I cannot tell; neither does my evaluation make much difference, when we will know the facts in a few hours. I can say one thing: Whether we like it or not -- and I, for one, am not happy about it -- there is no way to attain peace with Syria without the Americans. In order to make peace between us and the Syrians, they must come here and shuttle between Damascus and Jerusalem -- not just once, twice, or three times. If they think it is worth their while to come here only if it is clear in advance that progress will be made, there will be no progress. On the other hand, if they come here and work between the capitals, progress will be made. This is why I very much hope that they will not make a hasty decision not to come to the region and that, when they come, they will devote the necessary time to this issue, because the situation is ripe for making peace between us and Syria. The broad common denominator exists. There are gaps, but although they are very wide, the bridge between them is in sight.
