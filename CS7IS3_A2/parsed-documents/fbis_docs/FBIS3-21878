"That is drug money!" protests a courageous postal customer waiting in line. Caught. The man with the plastic bag loses his nerve, flees the room, and leaves behind 20,000 marks [DM]. A little later, accomplices of the hindered depositor surround the post office on Lindenstrasse and one of them forces the branch chief to give back the money. An untypical failure. Normally the money laundering on the Alster works very smoothly. What street dealers of the Turkish mafia deliver today is in the accounts of the drug clan beyond the Bosporus tomorrow. The police are powerless. Sigmund Zwirn from the Hamburg Customs explains the money laundering system: "The drug money is paid into general accounts of Turkish banks agents at different post offices. These financial institutions themselves are not allowed to accept any cash. They just handle the clearance system and have nothing to do with drugs." Advantage for the mafia: Whereas normal financial institutions check the identity of depositors with every foreign transaction, Turkish bank agents do not require this in the case of the so-called "guest worker money." In this way, about DM240 million flows to Turkey every year from Hamburg alone and some DM50 million from Bremen. Sigmund Zwirn cannot say how much dirty money is involved there. He does, however, register an increase in the suspicious transactions. "Formerly adolescents and asylum-seekers took sums as large as DM100,000 to the postal windows. Now, because of the new law on money laundering, the money couriers come only with amounts under DM20,000 but they come more often and accompanied by bodyguards. Or they hire Germans who handle the formalities for them." Postal bankers do regret that the Yellow Giant is being misused by the Turkish drug mafia as a money laundering machine but they do not feel responsible. Postal bank spokeswoman Marianne Bork: "The legislators must give thought to these abuses, not us." Other banks, other customs: When, for example, the Bremen Savings Bank learned two years ago from the customs search that drug money was being deposited at their windows as well, it immediately ended its relations with the Turkish bank agents. The money laundering of the postal service is not the only way in which about a million a day in drug money reaches Turkey from Hamburg alone. In Hamburg-Fuhlsbuettel, policewomen pulled a total of DM45,000 from the underwear of two Kurdish women in a check before their departing flight. Spicy is the fact that the women were flown in at the expense of the Justice Department to testify in the trial of a drug dealer.
