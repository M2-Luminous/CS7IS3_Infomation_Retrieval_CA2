The statement says that the government wants to "fully control the state, offices, banks and supervisory boards of state enterprises" by filling important posts with members of the ruling coalition parties. "The Freedom Union comes out against this policy" and will support the development of self-governments, reads the document. In his address to the council members, Party leader Tadeusz Mazowiecki also pointed to a growing threat from the government and the president to independent institutions of a democratic state, such as the National Radio and Television Council. After a heated debate, the UW Council appointed 11 persons to the newly created posts of national secretaries of the party. Their task will be to monitor government policies in important areas of economy and public life and react to government decisions. Leaders of the party denied the new posts were modelled after the shadow cabinet in the British system of government, an opinion prevailing in the press recently. Among the 11 secretaries are Jerzy Osiatynski (in charge of economic policy), Wojciech Arkuszewski (economic system), Piotr Nowina-Konopka (foreign affairs), Michal Boni (social policy), Bogdan Borusewicz (public security).
