He said: Some time ago, the French Foreign Ministry claimed "a decisive measure against North Korea", manifesting its official stand to support a UN resolution on "sanctions". Earlier, during U.S. President Bill Clinton visit to France, the French prime minister and government officials agreed to his proposal for "sanctions" against the DPRK. Such moves of France are aimed at preventing the "nuclear issue" which has become an international focal point from being solved through DPRK-U.S. talks, having a greater say by poking its nose into the matter, goading Northeast Asian countries onto a conflict and thereby fishing in troubled waters. The situation in our country now has become extremely strained due to the anti-DPRK moves of the United States and its followers. Our people are making full preparations to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the country in face of the enemy's moves. The French authorities cannot be ignorant of the fact that "sanctions" against the DPRK under such circumstances may lead the situation to a catastrophic phase. Nevertheless, France fell in with the United States' view in the clamor for "sanctions" without any idea of its own and danced to the tune of others, edging itself into other's [words indistinct] for the convocation of an international conference, [words indistinct] to shame. Judging from this, one can see clearly that France is not interested at all in the question of defusing the present crisis on the Korean peninsula but persistently seeking to gratify its sinister aims. We cannot but throw into question the reckless behavior of the French authorities. We have already declared more than once that in case any "sanctions" should be imposed on us not only the parties taking the van in enforcing them but also those who back them would be held responsible. The French authorities must know that our warning is not an empty word and ponder over the matter. If France wants to save its face and discharge its responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, it should help toward a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation, instead on joining in the act of bringing the issue into extremes.
