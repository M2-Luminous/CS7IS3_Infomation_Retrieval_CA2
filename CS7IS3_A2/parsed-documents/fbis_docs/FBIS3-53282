What are the reasons and what do you think is happening? [Aloni] Let me stress at the beginning that this government has decided to do all it can for peace. This is our choice and the clock will never go backward. We are, indeed, ready to honor our commitments under the Gaza-Jericho first agreement. We want the Palestinians to lead and run their own lives in the self-rule territories. But the Palestinians and the world must know that Israel now is not speaking with one voice. We are divided. The government wants true peace, but it only represents one segment of the people. There are other segments who do not believe and do not want peace. They believe that God has given the sons of Israel this entire territory and that the Palestinians have no place among them. But thank God, they are not a majority. We are the majority, but their voice is louder. This is the kind of conflict we have in our society. [Al-Hinnawi] Very well, but what is your and your party's position concerning this conflict? [Aloni] Our policy is clear. I agree to give up all the territories occupied following the 1967 war. The Palestinians have a right to set up their own state in the West Bank and Gaza, but this is not the government's viewpoint, because it knows that the Israelis are living in fear. Some of the fears are justified and some are not. For 15 years, the previous Likud governments continued to emphasize to the people the need to not trust anyone and that this justifies the occupation. This is the reason why the extremists brand us as traitors and agents of the Arabs. We suffer from Israeli extremism the same way you suffer from Arab extremism. [Al-Hinnawi] But aren't you concerned by the eroding support for the peace agreement with the Palestinians and the Likud's sweeping victory in the municipal elections, particularly since some of the constituencies have been Labor strongholds for decades? [Aloni] Actually, I am not disturbed. The erosion you are referring to following the signing of the agreement is natural, particularly with the continued confrontations in the occupied territories. This week, support for the agreement started to return to what it was the day after the agreement was signed. There are 148 in favor and 146 against [not further explained]. I expect the number of supporters to increase in the coming weeks. As for the Likud's victory in the municipal elections, this has nothing to do with the agreement. Municipal elections are about individuals, not policies, and in these elections the Israeli voter gives his vote to the person he thinks will provide the best services to the city or the village he lives in. [Al-Hinnawi] What do you think is the real problem behind the Israeli Government's insistence on controlling the crossing points between Egypt and Gaza and Jordan and Gaza? What is the reason for shrinking the Jericho area to be given to the Palestinians? Don't you see that this insistence on the part of the government will harm the chances of peace? [Aloni] The fact is that the Israeli public now cannot agree to leave the question of borders outside Israel's control, because the time is not yet ripe for this. Confidence must be built first. In addition, the Declaration of Principles did not include any reference to these points. I understand Yasir 'Arafat's position. He wants to gain as much as he can for his people after all these difficult years. The Israeli Government is surprised every day by 'Arafat's increasing demands. The same is true for Jericho. Under the agreement, we agreed to hand over the city of Jericho and the camps around it to 'Arafat, but now he is demanding the Jordan Valley, although the agreement absolutely did not mention it. No one among the Israelis thought of abandoning the area north of the Dead Sea and up to the Damya bridge during this stage. [Al-Hinnawi] Does your party hold that same view? [Aloni] If it were up to me I would have immediately agreed to relinquish all the occupied Palestinian territories to the Palestinian people and let them establish their own state. But I am a member of the government and bound by their policy, although my views are well known. But this is what will happen eventually. Therefore I say to 'Arafat: Be patient just a little more. You have been patient for a long time and will not wait more than you already have. Let us proceed one step at a time. We have to be realistic and act according to the signed agreement. [Al-Hinnawi] News reports, particularly those carried by REUTER, have said that Israel has presented to Egypt a map detailing the huge wealth hidden under the sands of Sinai, including the uranium used in making atomic bombs. As minister of sciences, what do you think of these reports? [Aloni] Your report is correct, although it is not complete. We indeed presented this map to Egypt as a sign of the goodwill and confidence in relations between the two sides. What was not published was that we discovered that Egypt has a similar map and that it knows everything about Sinai's wealth. [Al-Hinnawi] Reports say that Israel has actually reached a peace agreement with Jordan but it has not been announced as yet. What is the truth about these reports, and what is the latest on talks with Syria? [Aloni] An initial agreement has indeed been reached with Jordan. There are no problems with Jordan. But King Husayn is waiting for progress in negotiations with Syria before he announces the agreement. As for Syria, I believe that we have reached common ground and that talks will resume very soon. We are willing to make everything possible to reach an agreement with Syria. [Al-Hinnawi] What about the problem of settlements in Golan? [Aloni] I admit it is a problem. It was caused by the fact that the previous Labor government allowed settlers to live in Golan. So, the government has made some commitments to the settlers. The situation is different in the West Bank settlements, which were built with the Likud's permission. But we will find a solution. We should not forget that when the Labor government permitted the building of settlements in the Golan, the international situation was totally different from what it is today. The Soviet Union was a superpower and it was furnishing Syria with weapons. The situation is different now and I believe that we will find a solution. I would like to tell Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad that he has a great opportunity to go down in history as the leader who contributed to the establishment of peace in the region. Israel is prepared to relinquish Golan if al-Asad is willing to establish real peace. [Al-Hinnawi] How do you envision regional cooperation after the establishment of peace, particularly since there has been much talk lately about a Middle East market? [Aloni] I believe that the beginning should be something like the Benelux cooperation among Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Cooperation can start among Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Syria. This can later be followed by cooperation involving the Middle East states similar to the European Common Market. I think that this will be the picture in the end. As minister of communications, it pleases me to say that there are telephone lines linking Israel with all Arab states. The citizen in any Arab state can pick up the phone and contact Israel directly. This was inconceivable just a few years ago. I believe that Egyptian diplomacy has played a great role in bringing views closer so that peace and prosperity can prevail in the region.
