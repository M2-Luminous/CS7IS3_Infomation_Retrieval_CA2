[Karasin] The main thing, in my opinion, is that since the 1991-1992 period, which was difficult and dramatic for the diplomatic service, the Foreign Ministry structures have stabilized and interaction between subdivisions, along center-embassies lines, has strengthened. Whence also the more composed, business-oriented mood of the diplomats. Russia's new foreign policy realities have made necessary a qualitative retuning of thinking and practice. The Foreign Ministry is now characterized by a state, not party, approach to its activity. We are actively mastering the skills of interaction with all the Russian state and political structures, considering the state of public opinion, and trying to speak more broadly and simply about actual foreign policy in order that it be comprehensible to and accepted by Russians. Doing this is, as you will understand, very difficult, but essential. [Grudinina] Russia's foreign policy is today the most active zone, perhaps, where different positions clash and sharply worded and, at times, mutually exclusive statements are made. How is this being reflected in the practical activity of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is it helping or hindering? [Karasin] Real pluralism and a comparison of positions and opinions not only do not hinder but also help considerably in the formation of foreign policy approaches at the state level. That pluralism geared to a search for the most appropriate approaches cannot be confused with "megaphone" statements behind which a responsible attitude and an aspiration to make a constructive contribution to Russia's foreign policy are barely discernible is another matter. Avowed self-publicity is an inevitable concomitant here also. I am convinced that foreign policy is far from being the sphere in which it is possible "to fully expose oneself" to the world just for fun. Like it or not, the country's foreign prestige depends on this. State-minded commonsense needs to be displayed here. It would seem that, considering the sensitivity of the foreign policy theme, we could polemicize far more effectively within the framework of the current state structures--committees, councils, and other mechanisms, especially since a sufficient quantity of them has been created. I frequently ask myself why problems of industrial production, agriculture, commerce, and education are not discussed publicly with such intensity and sharpness. Because, most likely, the majority understand that this is primarily specialists' business. Although, to be honest, there are far fewer "delicate moments" in these fields than in foreign policy. This sphere probably merits a special approach. We should treat it solicitously and avoid excessive revelations and public mistakes in the eyes of the world. Otherwise some politicians will be temporary winners, some will be thinking about their counter-play, and long-term national interests will be the losers. [Grudinina] There are in the Foreign Ministry, most likely, as in other state institutions also, serious internal problems that disturb people and that need to be resolved. Could you distinguish the most important, most painful problem? [Karasin] I was, I confess, expecting this question. There are many problems, of course, and they are, for the most part, typical of all public service. But there is one that disturbs all of us most of all. It is the question of the future of the country's diplomatic service. The Foreign Ministry has always been characterized by a continuity of the generations and strict professional schooling. A diplomat is not simply a government official but a person to whom state interests have been entrusted. He has to renounce the euphoria of simple solutions, accustom himself to painstaking work, and know the value of the actual and the sham result. We are today observing a dangerous trend of a drain from the Foreign Ministry system of both experienced and young specialists, which raises the serious question of what Russia's diplomatic service will be like in three to five years and the more distant future. If we disregard the details, what is fundamental is the problem of financial support for diplomats working in the central machinery in Moscow. Please understand me correctly. In no country can diplomats be compared in terms of living standard with businessmen nor, to be honest, do they aspire to this. They derive satisfaction from service of the country and take pride in this, but, granted all this, they have sufficient for the decent support of their family. With us the situation is different. A well-trained graduate of a higher educational institution with a knowledge of two or three languages receives on coming to work in the Foreign Ministry R55,000 (for comparison: An army lieutenant receives R200,000-R250,000), and after 20 years' service a Foreign Ministry counselor receives R130,000. Is it surprising that under such conditions young people are being forced, primarily from "family considerations," to go into private structures and sell Snickers bars and chewing gum, getting 10-15 times more for this. The time has come to sound the alarm. The professional structure, which the country needs and whose formation has taken several decades, could fall apart. [Grudinina] We have to agree with your arguments. But the question as to the sum that an increase in diplomats' pay would cost the treasury arises. [Karasin] I would like to make clear once more that we are talking only about the central machinery of the Foreign Ministry. Those who work in Moscow. And, following repeated cuts, there are little more than 1,500 of these remaining. I would say for comparison that there are in the U.S. State Department, with an approximately similar structure, 10,000 diplomats. It is obvious, in my opinion, that economies in the diplomatic service will not resolve the problems of the state budget but could cause the country's interests palpable harm. It is indisputable also that Russia's diplomatic service needs high professionals no less than the armed forces or intelligence, say. [Grudinina] There has been frequent talk recently of the need for an active search for off-budget sources of funding of state institutions. Could not the problem be resolved this way? [Karasin] I am convinced that the possibilities of the Foreign Ministry in a search for such sources are extremely limited. Entangling public service, in such sensitive areas as foreign policy, what is more, in commerce and business is an extraordinarily risky and, in the long-term, unjustified venture. The microbes of "official enterprise" could very quickly eat through the entire organism of the diplomatic service. Everyone should concern himself with his own work, giving it all his efforts, time, and ability, otherwise the state will be the loser.
