In a weekly press interview here, Wu Jianmin, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said China does not need to mediate between South and North Korea inasmuch as there is a dialogue channel between the two Koreas. "The Chinese Government wishes to see South and North Korea resolve their problems through their direct and constructive dialogue and negotiations," Wu said. Asked to comment on the report of North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Wu said he heard nothing about it. He added, however, that if the report were true, it could be a welcome news. "It is in accord with China's consistent policy that problems should be settled through dialogue and negotiations between direct parties involved," he said. On the remarks allegedly made by a senior U.S. State Department official to the effect that China had assisted in North Korea's missile system and nuclear development, Wu rejected it as an "irresponsible and totally unfounded allegation."
