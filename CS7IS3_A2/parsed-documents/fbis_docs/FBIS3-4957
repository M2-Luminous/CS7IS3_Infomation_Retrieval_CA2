Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said, "it is hard to tell whether Japan's economy is at this stage capable of rapidly recovering. We have problems like the yen's surge and asset deflation." Referring to reports that the United States may revive its Super 301 trade legislation, Hiraiwa said, "I hope the U.S. will not take such punitive measures against Japan." He said that instead "Japan needs to carry out practical and concrete steps...to stimulate domestic demand, relax various government regulations, and open up its markets."
