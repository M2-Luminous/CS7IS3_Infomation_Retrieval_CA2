Is that the main aim of your current tour? [Talabani] It is one of several aims. I discussed with the officials with whom I met all the issues related to Iraq, including the Kurdish issue. [passage omitted] [Husayn] What was their response as regards armament and training of police and security forces? [Talabani] They were understanding and sympathetic. In France in particular, the position was understanding and encouraging -- which prompted me to be more optimistic. [Husayn] And how do you think Turkey will react to your armament? [Talabani] I do not know exactly. I believe it will not agree. [Husayn] And Iran? [Talabani] It will strongly oppose it. It will consider it an imperialist Zionist conspiracy...through to the descriptions the Iranian press is so good at when it comes to making up lies and fabrications about anything to which it is opposed. [passage omitted] [Husayn] The war between the Turkish Government and the Kurdish Workers' Party has intensified in recent months, and Turkish forces do not hesitate to carry out operations inside Iraqi Kurdistan. You opposed that, but what have you done to prevent it? [Talabani] We have made great efforts with the two parties to prevent the fighting from being moved to our areas. We asked the Kurdish Workers' Party to operate away from our areas, and we asked Turkey to leave to us the task of guarding and protecting the border on the Iraqi side. But the two sides have taken account of that and continue to violate the sanctity of Iraqi territory. [passage omitted] [Husayn] There are reports that the Iraqi Government is seeking to resume negotiations with you over self-rule, that it has expressed willingness even to accept the federal formula proposed by you, and that France and Turkey tried to mediate between you. Is there any possibility of resuming the negotiations? [Talabani] First of all I would like to stress that neither France nor Turkey has spoken with us in this connection, either directly or indirectly. All that has been said in this connection is baseless. The essence of our current position is that the Kurdish movement and the Kurdish people in Iraq have an elected parliament and a government. And that this movement and this people are part of the Iraqi opposition movement. Any dialogue or negotiations with the government must be decided by the two councils representing the Iraqi opposition and the Kurdish people. I mean the Executive Council of the Unified Iraqi National Congress and the national assembly (parliament) of the Kurdistan region. I personally believe that there is no hope or benefit from a dialogue with the Saddam regime, with which we tried dialogue and negotiations in the past and even recently. As is known, I have since 1963 led and participated in negotiations with successive Iraqi governments. After all this time, I have reached a firm conviction, namely that there can be no solution to any of Iraq's numerous problems -- including the Kurdish problem -- without the establishment of a democratic system in Baghdad. The Saddam regime in particular does not want a solution to these problems, so "whoever tries it will regret it."
