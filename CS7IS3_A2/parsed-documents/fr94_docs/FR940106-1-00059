FR940106-1-00059 FR940106-1-00011 This historically-based approach is consistent with EPA's National Program Guidance for Biological Criteria for Surface Waters (USEPA 1990). EPA's National Program Guidance recommends that aquatic communities in waterbodies subject to anthropogenic disturbance be assessed in comparison to similar, but unimpaired waterbodies (a reference condition). Although the Guidance discusses designation of a reference site to compare directly with an impaired waterbody, analysis of historical records is also recommended. In the case of the Bay/Delta, a reference waterbody is not available. Instead, reference conditions have been based on historical information. The proposed salinity criteria reflect estuarine habitat conditions that existed prior to 1976. In the recent State Board hearings, EPA, NMFS, and USWFS recommended standards that would restore habitat conditions to levels that existed in the late 1960's and early 1970's (USFWS 1992g, WRINT&hyph;FWS&hyph;10). 8 This period generally reflects conditions that occurred in the estuary before fish habitat and populations began to experience the most recent significant declines, and therefore serves as a useful definition of a healthy fishery resource. Land use patterns and upstream water developments had largely stabilized by the end of this period so that increases in project impacts are the dominant change associated with the subsequent decline in fishery resources. The reclamation of wetlands was largely complete by the 1920's, and the largest of the upstream developments, Shasta Reservoir, was completed in the early 1940's. 8 This restoration goal is less protective than the ``without project'' goal targeted by the State Board as part of its water quality standards in 1978. In the 1978 Delta Plan, the State Board adopted standards intended to achieve levels that would have existed in the absence of the state and Federal water projects, and agreed to revise the standards if necessary to achieve this goal. This ``without projects'' goal was never formally incorporated into the State's water quality standards, and its continued validity as a stated goal is in question given the court's decision in United States et. al. v. State Water Resources Control Board, supra ) (reviewing the 1978 Delta Plan and rejecting the ``without projects'' approach). EPA continues to believe that fully offsetting the impacts of water development should be the goal of long-term planning efforts by the State Board and other agencies. However, because of the precipitous decline in the biological communities of the estuary in the last decade, this goal is no longer reasonably attainable in the short term, given the existing physical facilities and water project operations in the Delta. As a result, EPA, USFWS and NMFS have recommended that the State Board immediately set standards sufficient to restore estuarine habitat conditions to those that existed in the late 1960's and early 1970's, and to establish a long-term goal of fully offsetting the impacts of water development (USFWS 1992g, WRINT&hyph;FWS&hyph;10). This long-term goal is consistent with the goals of the recently-enacted Central Valley Project Improvement Act (Title 34 of P.L. 102&hyph;575, 106 Stat. 4600) (Central Valley Project Improvement Act), which include programs to mitigate the adverse effects incurred as a result of the construction of the CVP. Ideally, EPA would use the late 1960's to early 1970's habitat conditions as both the targeted level of protection and the historical reference period. However, to better reflect the natural variability of wet and dry years, EPA is proposing criteria that vary according to the ``water year type''. The water year type concept is already fully integrated into the operations of California water management, and the State Board's classification of years into one of five categories (wet, above normal, below normal, dry, and critically dry) is accepted as the standard water year type classification scheme. The period of the late 1960's to early 1970's, however, contained no dry or critically dry years and only one above normal year. Thus, in order to provide an adequate representation of the different water year types, EPA is proposing the use of the period 1940 to 1975 as the historic reference period. An examination of the historical record reveals that this 35 year period was one of fairly consistent hydrological conditions. The period is bracketed by major hydrological changes_the construction of Shasta Dam immediately before this period, and the extended drought and increased water exports beginning immediately after this period in 1976. Including the longer 1940&hyph;1975 period as the historical reference period allows better estimation of the salinity regime for different water year types than would use of only the late 1960's to early 1970's. Given that the hydrological conditions were fairly consistent throughout the longer 1940&hyph;1975 period, EPA believes this longer historical reference period serves as a better long term indicator through all water year types of the habitat conditions existing in the recommended target years of the late 1960's to early 1970's. The development of the historical salinity regime is presented in appendix II. Salinity records extend back only to 1967, whereas daily flow estimates are available from October 1929. Using models created by California DWR relating flow and salinity allows reconstruction of the salinity regimes in the historical reference period. _Basis for locations selected. Three locations for the proposed 2 ppt isohaline were selected to correspond to protection of three different types of estuarine habitat in different water years. Together, the use of these three locations will maintain the natural variability in salinity levels that characterize the historical data set at medium to lower flow levels (those substantially within the control of upstream diverters). Roe Island. The 2 ppt isohaline occurs at or below Roe Island at times of high outflow accompanying storms with uncontrolled runoff, as well as at times of high water releases from upstream dams. These flows carry many young fish from the Delta downstream into Suisun Bay. Because the entrapment zone will consistently be near the broad shallows and large marsh areas of Suisun Bay, the young fish and other organisms associated with the zone will be distributed into these diverse and productive habitats, greatly increasing the extent and value of their available habitat. This location will also maximize the inputs of production from Suisun Marsh and the shallows of Suisun Bay into the entrapment zone, and will provide greatly increased areas of medium to low salinity nursery habitat for estuary dependent species in San Pablo Bay.
