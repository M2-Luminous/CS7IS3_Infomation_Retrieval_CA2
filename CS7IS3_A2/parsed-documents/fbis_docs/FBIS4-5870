"Japan will not change its policies and will continue steadily implementing its latest measures," Fujii told a regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. The Bundesbank's policy-making council decided overnight to cut its discount and lombard rates by a quarter of a percentage point to an annual 5.00 percent and 6.50 percent, effective Friday. Fujii declined to comment on overseas policy, only saying that lower rates help a country's economy. The timing of the rate cuts would allow other European nations to follow suit ahead of the international financial gatherings in Washington. Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial nations are expected to meet on April 24 before a spate of twice-yearly meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. With Germany set to portray its rate cuts as soothing growing concerns over the recent trend for a rise in long-term market rates in G-7 nations, Japan may be under pressure to demonstrate a commitment to reducing its huge trade surplus. The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.
