FR940713-2-00137 FR940713-2-00079 (4) MSTC acknowledges the provisions dealing with MSTC's rights and obligations set forth in CFTC's order approving the CME's stock pledge program. To accommodate the proposed rule change, MSTC added to Article I (``Definitions and General Provisions'') of its rules definitions of Limited Purpose Participants and Limited Purpose Account, added to Article II (``Settlement Services'') Rule 7 which describes the Limited Purpose Participant Program, and added to Article V (``Participants'') Rule 1 (``Qualifications of Applicants to Become a Participant'') paragraph (i) which sets forth the qualifications of a limited purpose participant. III. Discussion The Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the purposes and requirements of Section 17A of the Act. 7 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal meets the requirement of Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) that a clearing agency be organized and have the capacity to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible. 8 7 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). 8 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3) (A) and (F) (1988). In approving MSTC's rule change creating a limited purpose participant, the Commission recognizes the desire of market participants, even in the CFTC regulated futures market, to meet their margin requirements with assets other than cash or government securities. The MSTC proposal extends the use of equity securities as margin to FCM's that are also clearing members of a board of trade. 9 MSTC has structured the proposal to limit the services available to limited purpose participants so that only those services necessary to pledge securities to CME's pledge account may be accessed. In addition, the CME has agreed to indemnify MSTC for and from all claims, losses, liabilities, and expenses arising from any actions MSTC takes or does not take in accordance with the instructions received from CME. 10 9 CME Rule 901 sets forth the requirements and obligations for clearing member status at the CME. A clearing member must demonstrate financial capitalization commensurate with the CME's requirements, and a clearing member must continue to maintain such financial requirements or suffer suspension and revocation of its clearing house membership. If the CME were to revoke the clearing membership of a FCM, that FCM will not be eligible for MSTC's limited purpose program. 10 Point 1 of letter agreement between CME and MSTC (October 5, 1993). The Commission believes that the structure of the program and the safeguards that MSTC has built into the program should reduce the risk to MSTC in holding securities pledged to CME. In light of the fact that the CME clearing house, not MSTC, bears the risk of loss on the futures positions creating the performance bond requirements, the Commission believes the proposed rule change satisfies MSTC's obligation to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible. IV. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that MSTC's proposal is consistent with Section 17A of the Act. 11 11 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 12 that MSTC's proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;94&hyph;04) be, and hereby is, approved. 12 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 13 13 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1992). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
