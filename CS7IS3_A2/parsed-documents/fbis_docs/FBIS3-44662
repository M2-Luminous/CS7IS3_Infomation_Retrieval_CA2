No decision has yet been taken on the form of the bill, although this matter will be considered by British ministers when the governor, Chris Patten, visits London later this month. Cliff Bale has this report: [Bale] The government tabled a partial electoral bill in the Legislative Council last month. It's expected to be enacted by the end of February. Government officials insist that a second bill, focusing on the more controversial issues relating to the 1995 Legco elections, must be tabled shortly afterwards, which means probably in March. What's undecided is the form of the bill. There are several options: Mr. Patten's original blueprint, revised proposals put to China last year, or possibly some sort of compromise. This matter is set to be discussed during a meeting of the British Government's Cabinet Committee on Hong Kong, which according to British sources, will meet during Mr. Patten's visit to London later this month.
