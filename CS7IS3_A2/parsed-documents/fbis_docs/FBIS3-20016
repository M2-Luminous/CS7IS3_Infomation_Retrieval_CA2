In a statement after the meeting, Denktas reported that the chamber officials briefed him on their contacts with the Greek Cypriot Chamber of Commerce and he, in turn, spoke to them on recent developments concerning the confidence-building measures package. Denktas explained that the package was changed extensively in favor of the Greek Cypriots, adding that equality and balance must be secured. Denktas declared that he concurs with the chamber of commerce view to the effect that if the package is accepted in its present form, the benefit to the Turkish Cypriot side is practically zero. Asked to comment on the Greek Cypriot administration spokesman's statement that the Lefkosa [Nicosia] International Airport matter is a minor issue, Denktas said that the disagreement or the difficulty is over basic issues and these cannot be termed as minor matters. Every issue and every article is serious and vital, Denktas went on, because if there is to be an agreement, it must be one that envisages well-intentioned cooperation and protects the rights of the two sides in a balanced way. He stated: Once the balance is upset and the door is opened to the advantage of one side against the other, we cannot achieve anything. Therefore, it is wrong to advocate that only minor issues are outstanding and that everything will be all right once these are resolved.
