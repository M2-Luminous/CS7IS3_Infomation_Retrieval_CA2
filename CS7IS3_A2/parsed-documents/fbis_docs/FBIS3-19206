The survey shows an atmosphere "in favor of the European Union [EU]," even among supporters of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] and the Greens. The analysis shows that subjects relevant to the EU and membership questions have been superimposed on the provincial elections, Ulram said. Some 54 percent of the 1,500 persons asked (500 in each province where elections were held), took a positive view toward EU accession, while 25 declared that they were against it, and 21 were still undecided. The figures were, of course, different in the individual provinces: With 62 percent supporters and 19 percent opponents, the mood in favor of the EU is most marked in Carinthia. In Salzburg 58 percent were in favor of accession and 22 percent skeptical. Even in Tirol the EU supporters are slightly ahead of opponents: 41 percent took a positive view, 35 percent said they were skeptical, and 23 percent were still undecided. The scientists also drew cautious conclusions for the nationwide parliamentary election in the fall: The Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] and the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] are struggling with structural problems. After its unsuccessful petition drive for a nationwide referendum [on the immigration issue], the FPOe has overcome its low, and, according to Plasser, it might climb across the 20-percent level. Despite the failure in Sunday's election, the chances for the Liberal Forum to stay in Parliament are still intact, and the Greens have overcome their structural problems. The success of the Tirolean OeVP, which managed to retain its absolute majority of parliamentary seats and in the government, is partly the result of its EU strategy. Plasser said that Governor Wendelin Weingartner managed to do something that is normally bound to fail, namely to walk a tightrope: He managed to secure the support for the OeVP of both EU supporters (with his basically positive attitude) and EU skeptics (by signalling that he was ready to fight for the best possible results for Tirol). Plasser said that one interesting feature was that EU supporters are not confined to the SPOe, OeVP and the Liberal Forum but that EU accession is also backed by FPOe and Greens supporters. FPOe supporters appeared to be polarized in Sunday's election (with 44 percent for and 39 percent against EU entry), a phenomenon that has appeared in nationwide surveys before, while among the Greens there is a clear 59:19 percent majority against membership. In view of these figures, Plasser expects FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider to make a tactical change of course: His policy critical of the EU was probably timed to last exactly until 13 March, and, Plasser suspects, the FPOe leader will now quietly wait for the EU referendum and not raise the EU issue until the parliamentary election campaign -- when he knows he can benefit from it again. According to a preliminary analysis of the election result carried out by the IFES [Institute for Empirical Social Research] Institute as early as on Sunday night, the result of the EU negotiations had a strong influence on the election result in Tirol, Carinthia, and Salzburg. By and large, it turned out that the FPOe mainly appealed to people who are worried about their future, while the Greens rather managed to win the support of Europessimists. On the other hand, both the FPOe and the Greens lost EU supporters, which benefitted not only the two coalition parties but also the Liberal Forum. It was in Tirol and Salzburg, in particular, where the FPOe lost a significant number of EU supporters. The election analysis shows that it was possible to win votes with a clear, pro-EU position. The analysis carried out by IFES for ORF television shows that there was strong movement within the Carinthian electorate. Five percent of former SPOe voters cast their vote in favor of the OeVP this time, while another 5 percent voted for the FPOe. Yet, the OeVP not only won votes from the SPOe but also 4 percent from the FPOe. On the other hand, 6 percent of former OeVP voters abstained, while 1.5 percent wandered off both to the SPOe and the FPOe. According to this analysis, the FPOe, in turn, lost 1 percent of its voters to the Liberal Forum. The FPOe's success was mainly the result of people who abstained in previous elections and now voted for it. According to IFES, in Salzburg the movements of voters between the parties was not quite as dramatic as in Carinthia. There, the OeVP lost 4 percent to the FPOe and more than 1 percent to the Greens. On the other hand, the OeVP received 1.2 percent of former FPOe voters. The SPOe lost 2 percent each to the FPOe and the Liberal Forum. One percent of former Greens voters wandered off to the Liberal Forum. Three percent of former FPOe voters did not go to the polls this time.
