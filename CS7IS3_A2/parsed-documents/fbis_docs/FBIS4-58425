It marks the realization of a great dream and a unique vision by the peacemakers, who kept their faith, under difficult circumstances, in the noble goal of peace. Their participation in this occasion is living testimony that the world is fully committed to this great issue. It is also a recognition of the wisdom of those who made this achievement possible. We are looking forward to further support. Let us extend to them all material and moral support so that the agreement the Palestinians and Israelis have signed can be implemented. They took no chances or risks when they opted for peace. Let us prove to the critics of both sides that none of their fears were founded. Let us continue our efforts with the same will and determination to achieve the same success on the other peace tracks. This is the essence of the comprehensive settlement to which we are committed. Finally, we must waste no effort to achieve a global peace. We must also turn our attention to the tragedies taking place in many regions. It is our common commitment to unite against any violation of the dignity of man. God bless us and may peace prevail on earth. Thank you.
