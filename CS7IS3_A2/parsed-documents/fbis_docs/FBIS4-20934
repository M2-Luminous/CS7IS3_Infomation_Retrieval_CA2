Defense Ministry sources in Sanaa categorically denied this. They said such claims tarnish the image of Yemen and obstruct the implementation of the pledge and accord document signed in Amman to achieve Yemeni reconciliation. Defense Ministry sources in Sanaa said an officer called Col. 'Ali al-Hadi, a member of the south Yemeni Socialist Party and armament director at the Defense Ministry, is currently in an East European state to make a deal to purchase long-range missiles against the will of the Defense Ministry in Sanaa. In another development, Yemeni newspapers spoke about a recent clash between the northern and southern forces in the Shabwah area in southern Yemen, in which five were killed. A north Yemeni source, however, said it was a clash between tribes and only two were killed.
