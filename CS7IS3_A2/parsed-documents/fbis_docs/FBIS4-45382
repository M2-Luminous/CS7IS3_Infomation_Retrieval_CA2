Policing in this historic district, 190 km south of Jaipur, has taken a different turn now with the decline of terrorism in Punjab. Although the police heaved a sigh of relief after peace descended in neighbouring Punjab focus has now shifted to prevention of smuggling of narcotics and opium from the nearby districts of Mandsaur, Ratlam and Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh and Jhalawar, Kota and Baran in Rajasthan. Other incidents of social crime have also increased, the genesis of which can be traced to the multi-purpose river project on the Chambal river. According to the SP, Bundi, Mr. Srinivas Rao Janga, "Since the late 1960s, when construction of the Chambal project commenced, migrants from Punjab started settling in the southern belt of Bundi in large numbers mostly in Alphanagar. With terrorism at its zenith in Punjab a strict vigil was kept on the activities of Punjabis settled in Sriganganagar and Bundi." In 1991, acting on a tip off, the district police raided the residence of one Harbail Singh and arrested six noted ultras. This district, unlike Sriganganagar, was not a hot-bed of terrorism, but according to Mr. Janga, due to its strategic location and remoteness was an "ideal hiding place" for terrorists. "The situation has changed today and Bundi is emerging as a conduit for opium trade in the Hadauti (southern Rajasthan) zone," he pointed out. The Aravallis range runs through Bundi dividing the district into two near-halves. This demographic factor has had its impact on crime. The district is used as a major transit point for transportation of drugs to Delhi and from there to Nepal. It is suspected that due to stringent action by the Kota district police and other enforcement agencies, the opium smugglers have changed their route. "While originally the contraband was taken along Mandsaur, Jhalawar, Kota, Tonk and Jaipur, reports now reveal that from Kota it is diverted to Patan, Lakheri, Indergarh (all in Bundi) and to Sawai Madhopur from where on the broad gauge railway network the consignment is either despatched to Delhi or Bombay," Mr. Janga said. Interestingly, while 14 and 23 cases were registered by the police here in 1992 respectively under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotrophic Substances Act (NDPS), a special vigil is being maintained on the basis of a report from the State intelligence Department at Jaipur, which expressed fears about the growing illegal trade.
