He announced that on Saturday Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had sent a verbal message to the main participants in the recent Geneva meeting on Bosnia -- the U.S. state secretary, the British foreign secretary, the French and German foreign ministers. According to Churkin, Kozyrev expressed his concern and urged his colleagues to resort to their influence on the parties, for instance, on the Bosnian government in order to achieve implementation of the Geneva Document forbidding the parties from launching any offensives. Neither should they try to resolve their problems by military actions, Churkin pointed out. On the issue of the positions of the conflicting parties, Churkin said he would not appraise their conduct while hostilities were going on, though these were not wide-scale offensives. At the same time, a contact group continues its work. On Tuesday or Wednesday the group will meet the conflicting parties in order to discuss the territorial demarcation in Bosnia under the 49:51 proportion (as it had been decided in Geneva). The Interfax correspondent asked Churkin, who has several times been to the zone of conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, what he could advise to politicians in Kiev and in Simferopol due to the deterioration of the situation around Crimea. "A `Yugoslav version' is the worst that could happen. It cannot be forgotten that human life is precious as a value in itself and when seizing political power over destroyed territories one will lose more than win," Churkin remarked.
