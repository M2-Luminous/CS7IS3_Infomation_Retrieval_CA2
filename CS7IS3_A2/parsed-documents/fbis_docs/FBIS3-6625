This is the first time that the Hosokawa cabinet's support rate dropped below 50 percent. The most common reason given by those interviewed in a survey conducted last August, when the Hosokawa administration was inaugurated, was that "we trust the prime minister." In the recent poll, however, the number of respondents who cited the same reason declined to 11.9 percent, showing decreasing public trust in the Hosokawa cabinet. This is a serious situation for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has been relying on the high support rate most for dealing with the political situation. The drop may also negatively affect the stalled Diet session. As for political parties, support rate for the three coalition parties -- including the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which opposed the cabinet reshuffle and insisted on joining "the SDPJ, Democratic Socialist Pary, and liberal forces" -- grew. The poll was conducted from 10 to 13 March by interviewing 2,000 men and women and 68.9 percent of them responded.
