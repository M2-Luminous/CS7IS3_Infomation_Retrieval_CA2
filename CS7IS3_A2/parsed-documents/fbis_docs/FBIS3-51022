He added that the "faults in the security mechanisms" are to blame for the recent incidents in Santiago del Estero. Cavallo said that the provinces that joined the federal fiscal pact must extend the elimination of taxes on gross income, and concentrate on tax collections on wholesale and retail business where "there is still a great deal of tax evasion." Cavallo then referred to the guerrilla actions in Mexico, saying that "the Central American guerrilla organizations were able to operate in Mexico due to faults in the security system which did not prevent an attack on cities." Cavallo also denied that the Economy and Interior Ministries would concentrate in their hands the government's social spending, while admitting that coordinated action would be carried out to discover "what part of the spending each ministry does." Cavallo also confirmed that the government "will not retreat on the reduction in employers' contributions," but indicated that the collection for social projects and for the PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan] will not be reduced -- rather, "to the contrary." He added: "There will be no losses. The collection for social projects will be either maintained or increased." Cavallo made these comments today during a news conference to discuss various current economic and political issues. He first referred to the strike called by the CGT [General Confederation of Labor], saying that the measure is within "constitutional rights, but there is no reason to do it; it will not be useful." Cavallo said that what caused the strike was the decision to reduce employers' contributions, which is a decision that "should not have surprised anyone, because we always said we were going to reduce them." "Social projects will not lose one cent," said Cavallo in a direct message to the union. He added: "The collection for social projects will be increased with relation to 1993." He admitted, however, that "there may be some problems in redistribution." He added: "This is what the National Administration for Health Insurance is for." Cavallo indicated that the contributions' reduction will represent "greater production, lower prices, investments, and new sources of work." Regarding the government's alleged persecution of unions, Cavallo said: "The operations of the DGI [General Directorate of Taxation] began in October-November, and not when the reduction in the contribution was decided." Regarding politics, Cavallo agreed with presenting a single list for the election of constituent members in Cordoba Province. In answer to a specific question on this issue, Cavallo said: "The technical answer is that it seems to me that the single list is a very good thing, because there would be more constituent members from the Justicialist Party and the UCD [Democratic Center Union] than from the Radical Civic Union." Cavallo added: "If the Radicals have a majority, they would obstruct the economic process because their only chance to win the elections is if the economic program fails." He added: "If there is a confrontation I might consider the possibility of becoming a candidate for the Constituent Assembly, but if the results of 3 October 1993 are reflected I will be quite satisfied."
