FBIS4-1019 "drafr075_c_94028" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA NPKF, Thokoza Hostel Inmates Exchange Fire NPKF, Thokoza Hostel Inmates Exchange Fire Sexwale Calls For NPKF Head To Resign MB1904153694 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1457 GMT 19 Apr 94 MB1904153694 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- ANC premier designate for the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region Tokyo Sexwale on Tuesday [19 April] called for the resignation of the head of the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] on the East Rand. Addressing about 1,000 township residents in the vernacular in Thokoza's Khumalo Street he said the NPKF's East Rand chief issued ineffectual orders and he usually sent only a handful of troops to handle extremely tense situations. Mr Sexwale added the ANC was going to ask for members of the SA [South African] Defence Force [SADF] to return to the East Rand and act and operate in conjunction with the NPKF. Mr Sexwale's comments came against a background of running battles Monday and Tuesday between opposing hostel residents and township dwellers. On Tuesday, SAPA reporters in the township saw at least half a dozen cars ferrying wounded to Natalspruit Hospital. Spokesmen at the hospital reported five deaths and at least 40 wounded in the violence. The ANC leader's comments also follow demands by the Inkatha Freedom Party -- whose supporters dominate the hostels -- that the NPKF withdraw from the East Rand's townships by 5PM on Tuesday. The IFP also demanded the immediate return of the SADF to the East Rand. SAPA reporters in Thokoza said it also appeared as if SADF troops were returning to the township to restore order. By 2.30PM on Tuesday order had been restored to lower Khumalo Street by what appeared to be defence force troops. A spokesman for the SADF's Wit Command told SAPA the army was lending "limited support" to the peacekeepers at the request of the NPKF. It did not mean a full scale military return to the East Rand was imminent, said Major Christo Visser of Wits Command.
