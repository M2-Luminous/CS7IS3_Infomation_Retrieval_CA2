Soldiers had given vent to their fury. The results were mass murders, destruction, and deportation. Vukovar is a synonym for incredible human suffering. The streams of refugees are witnesses and victims of innumerable crimes against humanity. Tomislav Mercep at that time was responsible for Vukovar. He had been brought to power during the confusions of the founding of the independent state. Today he is an adviser to the Croatian interior minister. A confidential letter to President Tudjman states that Tomislav Mercep was responsible for attacks on private apartments, looting, torture during interrogations, and even executions. The person who wrote this in August 1991 is the Croatian Government's representative in Vukovar. Who is this Tomislav Mercep? The construction engineer first drew attention to himself with his militant speeches. Anyone who does not want to live in the Croatian homeland can look for a new one tomorrow, he grandly stated in the election campaign in 1990, addressing the Serbian population in eastern Slavonia. Croatia, Croatia, the enthusiastic crowd chanted. One year later, Mercep formed the first unit of volunteers at the order of Tudjman's party, the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ]. In Bogdanovci, a small village near Vukovar, he gathers 2,000 men around him, whom he swears to the common cause. It is 10 March 1991, the state of Yugoslavia still exists. The gathering is secret and illegal. Mercep announces that certain equipment is available and will be distributed soon. Then the territorial defense forces have to learn how to use them. Everyone here understands what he means. The arming of the secessionists begins. Months later it is primarily Mercep's volunteers who fight against the Yugoslav People's Army and are equipped with the powers of a special police force. Subsequently, more and more excesses are committed, for example in Gospic. The masters changed several times in the town at the front line. Serbian troops in December 1991 discover 24 bodies in the orthodox cemetery -- executed, hardly buried, some of them charred. It turns out that most of them are Serbs. However, the Croatian public prosecutor of Gospic is also among the victims -- a declared opponent to Tudjman's regime. Only Tomislav Mercep's special units can be the killers. Some of them later boasted that they had killed 150 Serbian snipers in Gospic -- this is hardly possible without the knowledge and support of their commander. The Zagreb mass-circulation paper GLOBUS publicized several other cases. Mercep's death squadrons, the paper's headline stated, had killed a Serbian family in Zagreb and arbitrarily shot people in Pakracka Poljana. UN investigators did find 19 bodies there. Asked about the accusations, Mercep denies any guilt. But he says: [Begin Mercep recording, in Serbo-Croatian with superimposed German translation] What are 19 dead Serbs compared with what was done to Croats? By the way, if one wages war, one does that to kill as many enemies as possible. After all, one does not go to the front to sell ice cream. [end recording] As I said before, this man is an adviser to the interior minister, dealing with matters of the rule-of-law state and responsible for the establishment of the police forces. In the offices of Helsinki Watch in Zagreb, all cases of war crimes are painstakingly collected. For the employees of the organization, this is sometimes a dangerous job. One of them has been shot at. Chairman Cicak has been repeatedly attacked. Publicizing crimes and dealing with one's own guilt is not particularly popular in today's Croatia, since it means to finally pay farewell to the long -- perhaps too long -- cultivated role of the victim. [Begin Cicak recording, in English with superimposed German translation] The fact that we were attacked by Serbian aggressors cannot mean that we keep silent about what Croats have done to the Serbian minority in Croatia. Here, too, war crimes have been committed and it is absolutely necessary that Croatia itself punishes them with the means of a rule-of-law state. We must not brush that off to the international community. [end recording] [passage omitted] Tough words also come from Stipe Mesic, president of the Croatian Parliament. He has recently parted with Tudjman and his party. [Begin Mesic recording, in Serbo-Croatian with superimposed German translation] The rule-of-law state in this Croatia does not work. There is a lot of corruption and Mafia-like connections, even with the highest places of the state. Those who are guilty are not prosecuted, civic rights are in massive danger. [end recording] Does he believe that things will change in Tudjman's era, that war crimes will be punished? [Begin Mesic recording] No, absolutely not. There is no chance. [end recording] [passage omitted]
