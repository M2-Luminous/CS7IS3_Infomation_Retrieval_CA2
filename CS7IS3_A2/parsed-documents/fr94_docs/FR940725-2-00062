FR940725-2-00062 FR940725-2-00036 (B) Have achieved, during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. For grants for faculty fellowships, qualified applicants will meet the general statutory funding preference if a minimum of 50% of the nurse anesthetist faculty are teaching in medically underserved communities. Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Traineeship and Education Program Grants: ``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates in academic years 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93 or 1993&hyph;94 who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified setting. Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted. ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94, the rate of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings. Established Funding Priority for Traineeship and Education Program Grants: The following funding priority was established in FY 1993 after public comment (58 FR 42079, dated 8/6/93 and 58 FR 40657, dated 7/29/93) and the Administration is extending this funding priority in FY 1995. A funding priority will be given to programs which demonstrate either substantial progress over the last 3 years or a significant experience of 10 or more years in enrolling and graduating students from those minority populations identified as at-risk of poor health outcomes. Established Funding Preference for Faculty Fellowship Grants: The following funding preference was established in fiscal year 1990 after public comment (55 FR 36325, dated 9/5/90). A revised version is being extended in fiscal year 1995. A funding preference will be given first to faculty who will be completing degree requirements before or by the end of the funded budget year, second to faculty who are full-time students, and third to faculty who are part-time students. These title VIII grant programs are not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs (as implemented through 45 CFR part 100). Also, these grant programs are not subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements. Dated: July 19, 1994. James A. Walsh, Acting Administrator.
