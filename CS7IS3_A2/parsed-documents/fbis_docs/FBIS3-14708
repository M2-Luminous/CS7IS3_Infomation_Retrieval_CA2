This indicates that there has been no change in the Syrian proposals and views on the peace negotiations and topics of discussion in these negotiations with the Israelis since U.S. envoy Dennis Ross's visit to Damascus. The Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the chain of events since the stumbling Palestinian-Israeli agreement has proved the Syrian views to be correct and demonstrated that partial solutions do not establish peace in the region, that the peace proposed by Syria is in harmony with the Security Council resolutions and the essence of the U.S. initiative, and that the Israelis should not believe that without such a peace the Middle East could possibly emerge from the circle of wars, violence, and disturbances. The Syrian official accused Israel of obstructing any progress in the peace process and of persisting in its practices which are preventing the U.S. efforts from making any progress. The Syrian official also said: Israel cannot continue to pursue that line. It is very important that it should abide by Security Council Resolution 904 and accept international protection for the Palestinian people. It is also important that it should, in future Washington negotiations, discuss the future of the occupied territories and undertake to withdraw from them. He added that the Washington negotiations cannot go on for ever and cannot remain as they are now. He said that Israel has two options, namely peace and security or return to wars and the law of the jungle. That is why the United States, which is committed to peace, is requested to play the main part in bringing about a change and in making Israel comply with the basis of the peace process, that basis being the U.S. proposals. The Syrian official pointed out that the massacres Israel is committing against the Palestinian people can only mean that Israel does not want peace, and that the failure to take any serious and practical measures against the Israeli policy has encouraged Rabin's government to commit more massacres and more acts of terrorism, as confirmed when six people were martyred and dozens wounded last Wednesday. The Syrian official said that any progress in the peace process will depend on ending Israel's disregard for the United Nations and its resolutions.
