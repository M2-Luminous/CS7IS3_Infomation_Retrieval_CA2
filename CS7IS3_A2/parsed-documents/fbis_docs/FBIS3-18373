[Zwickel] I expect overwhelming approval for the strike. Some months ago approval was still not so great. Since then it has increased constantly. [BILD] Why? [Zwickel] This is primarily due to the employer's blocking attitude and to the fact that the working people have realized how important binding wage contracts are, because they have oriented their plans for life toward that. The employers want clearly to worsen these contracts by canceling them at the expense of the employees. And now the working people say: Not with us! [BILD] Is the strike assuming political dimensions? [Zwickel] We want to limit the strike. We do not want to ruin the economy with strikes. With the strike ballot in Lower Saxony and the possibility of expanding it to the area of the "western coast," we want to make it clear that we will limit the conflict regionally. However, if the employers respond with lock-outs in other areas and if, at the beginning of the super election year, the shameful Article 116 of the Labor Promotion Law -- which the Federal Government wanted -- for the first time leads to hundreds of thousands of people outside a strike district being turned into the streets without financial support, then we will have a large-scale conflict with political dimensions. [BILD] If the employers' chief negotiator now calls you and asks: Could the two of us meet for breakfast at some time and try to find a solution.... [Zwickel] I prefer to breakfast with my wife. But joking apart: Readiness for negotiations alone is insufficient. An offer must be put on the table. We want to reach a compromise as quickly as possible. This must be done during the first two weeks of the strike in Lower Saxony. If this is not done, there will be strikes in two wage areas after the second strike ballot. [BILD] And what if nothing happens then, either? [Zwickel] Then we want to wait and see. However, I think that there are not just firebrands among the employers but also people with a sense of responsibility. If this is not so, the strikes must continue until a compromise is found. [BILD] What is your goal? [Zwickel] We want safe employment and are also willing to have wage increases included in this calculation. [BILD] But the economy is in a bad state.... [Zwickel] We have made concessions to the employers in many fields. However, they are practically forcing us to strike. [BILD] How full are your coffers? [Zwickel] They are full enough for us to be able to finance the strike. However, we cannot finance lock-outs. [BILD] How do you, as IG-Metall chief, feel before a strike? [Zwickel] I am aware of my special responsibility. I am very worried about the employers' likely decision to impose lock-outs. Then the people's behavior might become uncontrollable. When hundreds of thousands are locked out, there is the danger that they will no longer follow their trade union. I am worried about the spontaneous individual reactions that develop if people want to get into their companies and are prevented from doing so.
