What impressed the people most about the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, during his two-day visit here, apart from his simplicity and unassuming manners, was that he scrupulously refrained from attacking any political party or leader. The gesture was, however, not reciprocated by his Bihar counterpart, Mr. Lallu Prasad Yadav, and his colleagues, none of whom, barring the dissident Cooperative Minister, Mr. Ramdeo Singh Yadav, showed the usual courtesy of receiving the visiting Chief Minister as they did when the West Bengal Chief Minister, Mr. Jyoti Basu, came here recently. As though this was not enough, a procession of so-called Dalits, organised obviously at the behest of the establishment, held up the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister's motorcade. Also, derogatory slogans were raised against the former Chief Minister and Scheduled Caste leader, Mr. Ram Sundar Das, whose Loktantrik Samajwadi Party merged on Sunday with the Samajwadi party. Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, on his part, showed restraint and political finesse. When, at a dinner meeting at the residence of Mr. Kapildeo Singh, national general secretary of the Samajwadi party, Mr. Ramdeo Singh Yadav presented a list of 57 ruling Janata Dal MLAs (Members of Legislative Assembly), including 28 Ministers, who, he claimed, were ready to break away from the party, the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister counselled patience. `Let us wait for the opportune moment and devote our energies to strengthening the Samajwadi party.' That Mr. Ram Sundar Das has assumed a key role in the political calculations of the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, so far as Bihar is concerned, and that gate crashers with dubious antecedents such as Mr. Pappu Yadav, MLA, detained once under the Crime Control Act, would find no place in the party, were clear from the tone and tenor of Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav's utterances at the merger meeting. The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, according to sources close to him, was annoyed at slogans -- `Pappu-Mulayam zindabad and Bihar needs a leader like Pappu' -- raised at a civic reception according to him, albeit out of courtesy he did go to Mr. Pappu Yadav's residence to wish him and his bride a happy married life.
