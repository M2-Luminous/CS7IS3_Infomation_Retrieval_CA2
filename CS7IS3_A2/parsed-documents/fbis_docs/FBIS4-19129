It has never been clarified whether these weapons have been used against Kurds, SPD Bundestag group chairman Hans-Ulrich Klose said in the Bundestag today. If the German Foreign Ministry is now requesting proof of such allegations from human rights groups, then this is "evidence of a miserable failure on the part of the Foreign Ministry over many years." Klose advocated civilian CSCE observers investigating conditions in Turkey. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party [FDP]) must launch a relevant initiative immediately. The CSCE has responsibility for this, not least because the conflict is threatening to extend beyond Turkey. Klose added that Germany is greatly affected because the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) does not shrink back from terrorism even in the Federal Republic. This is unacceptable. Klose stressed that those who abuse the right to hospitality must be "prosecuted, sentenced, and expelled." However, the expulsion orders can only be executed "if, in each individual case, proof is furnished that the deportee will not be tortured or killed in Turkey." [passage omitted]
