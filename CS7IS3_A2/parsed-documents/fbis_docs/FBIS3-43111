Dudin, Moscow; UDC 533.6.011.55+532.526] [Abstract] Hypersonic flow of a viscous gas over a plane delta wing with finite length at a null angle of attack at a given surface temperature with a symmetric wake is considered in a Cartesian system of coordinates with an origin at the delta wing vertex assuming that the characteristic Reynolds number is large yet subcritical, so that the boundary layer and wake flow is laminar, and it is further postulated that an intermediate interaction regime is realized on the principal wing section and in the wake, and that strong interaction areas form only in the wing vertex and leading edge vicinity. The boundary value problem is solved by the finite difference method. For illustration, a plane delta wing in a flow is considered allowing for the wake flow. The pressure distribution on the wing (and, for comparison, that of a delta wing with a given trailing edge pressure), the boundary layer displacement thickness distribution, the friction stress coefficient distribution in the longitudinal direction, the velocity and enthalpy distribution on the wake axis, and the pressure distribution along the wing span with an interaction parameter of _ch_[.sup]*[/]=2 are plotted. The findings demonstrate that the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing within a 0.5�_ch_[.sup]*[/]�3 interaction parameter range differ from those of a wing in a flow with a given trailing edge pressure by 10-15%.
