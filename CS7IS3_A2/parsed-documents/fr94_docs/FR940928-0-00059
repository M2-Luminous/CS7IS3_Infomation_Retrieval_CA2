FR940928-0-00059 FR940928-0-00019 (5) The Color Rendering Index of a general service fluorescent lamp shall be tested and determined in accordance with section 4.5 of Appendix R of this subpart and rounded off to the nearest unit. 5. Newly redesignated §430.24 is amended by adding paragraph (r) to read as follows: §430.24 Units to be tested. * * * * * (r)(1) For each basic model of general service fluorescent lamp and general service incandescent lamp as those terms are defined in paragraphs (15) and (16) of the definition for ``basic model'' in §430.2, samples of production lamps shall be tested and the results for all samples shall be averaged for a 12-month period. A minimum sample of 20 lamps shall be tested. The manufacturer shall randomly select 3 lamps from each month of production for 7 out of the 12 months required for the average. In the instance where a basic model of general service fluorescent lamp or general service incandescent lamp has been manufactured for less than 7 of the preceding 12 months, the number of lamps selected shall be divided as evenly as possible among the months of production to attain a minimum sample of 20 lamps. The lamp efficacy of the sample lamps shall be the quotient of the average of the lumen output and watts input measurements to insure that any represented value of lamp efficacy or other measure of the energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor a higher value shall be no greater than the lower of (i) The mean of the sample or (ii) The lower 99 percent confidence limit of the true mean divided by 0.99. (2) For each basic model of general service fluorescent lamp except for medium base compact fluorescent lamps, as defined in paragraph (15) of §430.2, random samples of production lamps from 12 months of production shall be selected for testing the Color Rendering Index (CRI). The CRI shall be represented as the average of a minimum sample of 20 lamps from the same production lots which were chosen for measurement in §430.24(r)(1), i.e., the manufacturer shall measure all lamps for lumens, watts input, and CRI. The 20 CRI measurements shall be averaged to insure that any represented value of CRI of a basic model for which consumers would favor a higher value shall be no greater than the lower of (i) The mean of the sample or (ii) The lower 99 percent confidence limit of the true mean divided by 0.99. 6. Section 430.25 is added to read as follows: §430.25 Laboratory Accreditation Program. (a) To comply with the testing requirements in section 323(b) of the Act, test procedures for certain products given below shall be carried out by accredited test laboratories. The accrediting body shall be the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) or a foreign organization recognized by NVLAP. NVLAP is under the auspices of the National Institute of Standards and Technology which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. NVLAP accreditation is granted on the basis of conformance with criteria published in 15 CFR part 285 ``The National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program Procedures and General Requirements.'' (b) The test procedures for general service fluorescent lamps, general service incandescent lamps, incandescent reflector lamps, and medium base compact fluorescent lamps, as specified in Appendix R to this subpart, shall be conducted by test laboratories accredited by NVLAP or an accrediting organization recognized by NVLAP. NVLAP standards for lamps and luminaires are given in handbook 150&hyph;01, ``Energy Efficient Lighting Products, Lamps and Luminaires,'' August 1993. A manufacturer's or importer's own laboratory, if accredited, may conduct the applicable test procedures. 7. Section 430.32 is amended by adding paragraph (n) to read as follows: §430.32 Energy conservation standards and effective dates. * * * * * (n) General service fluorescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps. (1) Each of the following general service fluorescent lamps manufactured after the effective dates specified in the table shall meet or exceed the lamp efficacy and CRI standards shown in the table below: Fluorescent Lamps 1Lamp type 1Nominal lamp wattage 1Minimum CRI 1Minimum average lamp efficacy (LPW) 1Effective date 4-foot medium bi-pin >35W <35W 69 45 75.0 75.0 Nov. 1, 1995.

(2) Each of the following incandescent reflector lamps manufactured after November 1, 1995, shall meet or exceed the lamp efficacy standards shown in the table in this paragraph:
