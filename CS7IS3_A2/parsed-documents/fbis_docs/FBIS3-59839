I met him in the house where he is still in seclusion. A few guards are stationed around the house and along the road extending to the hills. The road is unpaved; it is so rough that we almost plunged into a ravine when the driver of the car that took me to interview al-Bid did not pay attention to a deep hole which he tried to avoid. Some 10 minutes after my arrival in al-Bid's residence his press secretary Dr. 'Abdallah al-Haw joined us. We talked about the progress of the Yemeni press and the large number of publications of which many Yemeni citizens do not know the names. The publications total 120 dailies and weeklies. The director of al-Bid's office entered the room and informed me that the vice president was on his way. A minute later I saw myself standing in front of this man with thick black hair and deep set eyes. Signs of exhaustion were clearly evident on his face. But the years of struggle against British colonialism together with his colleagues until 1967 have toughened his resolve and solidity. After greeting me we sat. He asked me about the AL-SHARQ newspaper, its circulation, and affiliation. When you sit with al-Bid you feel that you want to draw closer to him in order to hear what he says in a low voice. When he answers a question words cascade out of his mouth, almost unstoppable. He wants to say everything so that everybody will hear him. He wants to put the facts before the world. He said he will not return to Sanaa, the Yemeni capital unless the 18 points he submitted to end political confrontation are implemented. He pointed fingers at one of the ruling coalition parties accusing it of conspiring to assassinate the YSP leadership of which he is the chairman. He said he is on top of the list. In this interview 'Ali Salim al-Bid revealed many secrets of the current political conflict in Yemen. Nobody knows how or when will it end. ['Abd-al-Salam] Your excellency brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, YSP secretary general and vice president: Following the arrival of the new Qatari ambassador 'Abdallah al-Ansari in Sanaa and after he was received by the Yemeni foreign minister, how do you evaluate the Yemeni-Qatari relations now and in the future? [Al-Bid] First, we welcome the arrival of his excellency the new Qatari ambassador and any other Arab ambassadors to Sanaa. We are very interested in enhancing diplomatic activity with our brothers in the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] states. Our relations with Qatar are good. We hope they will develop even further by elevating them to a higher level of action that would strengthen these ties. We highly appreciate the state of Qatar and its people, and we hope that the arrival of the ambassador will start a new phase of activity between the two countries. ['Abd-al-Salam] Mr. vice president: The Gulf crisis had some negative impact on Gulf-Yemeni relations. Do you believe that the clouds that have led to conflict have vanished completely, or some are still marring the relations? [Al-Bid] The Gulf crisis is part of the Arab situation; it is the focus of attention by many parties. But I hope that we will deal with our Arab situation with a new vision. We are responsible for what happens in the various Arab countries; we are responsible whether we are far or close to these developments. The deterioration of the Arab situation calls upon us to review its causes. I believe that the Gaza-Jericho agreement is a landmark; it calls for a pause by all Arabs. I believe that this situation will move us to a new, advanced era. We cannot say...[text missing] But this calls for a greater debate and discussion among all the Arabs of the question of responsibilities, including the Gulf crisis and its effects. The issues are interlined; they should not be separated from one another. We all in the Arab homeland are paying the price of the Gulf crisis. We find that our enemies have derived strength from our weakness. Developments in the Arab arena call for the adoption of a serious stand and demand that we should have the capabilities to overcome the crisis. No one should depart from the Arab course and we should not hold any party in particular responsible for it. All these developments happened in the presence of everybody, both those who supported the war and those who opposed it. The situation has harmed the Arab nation as a whole; it is our responsibility to address the problem. We cannot conceal its impact on all of us. This calls for standing together in order to overcome this situation. I do not think that anybody who is proud of this nation and its history would accept this situation without feeling pain and suffering. I wish we all will succeed and hope to continue to exchange views, follow up events, work together, and go back to what we call the fundamentals. For example, we should once again advocate the fundamentals of Arab nationalism and maintain our links together as Arabs and as brothers. All this existed some half a century ago when Arab nationalism was at its peak. But now Arab solidarity has begun to vanish and advocating it has once again become a struggle and a national task. We have reached a situation that calls for adopting a serious stand. The Palestine problem, as an Arab cause or as an Arab-Israeli conflict, used to join us together. We now have reached the point where we call it the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Then it would be said that we should not be royalists more than the king so that we will get rid of this difficult trial. If national commitment no longer exists, what would then bind us together. I am afraid that the ties that bind us together will weaken if the nation faced a problem. As a result of this situation it can be said that the general situation is deteriorating. But I believe and I am optimistic that deterioration is followed by revival. I hope that all the resources will be available to us and all the good people in the Arab nation will demonstration a revival spirit so that we will continue our struggle and to be proud of our history and nation. ['Abd-al-Salam] Your excellency is aware that the Yemeni unity which you and President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih achieved has gladdened the Arab nation and Arab governments and peoples. Do you believe that the basis on which this unity was found are sufficient to protect it against any political crises that it might face, or is it in need of new bases in order to provide greater protection for this unity? [Al-Bid] In theory and on the basis of documents the unity is not suffering from any problems. But the ability to shoulder the unity's responsibilities has decreased; that is lesser than what is required to build unity based on nationalist and democratic principles. But in practice we were incapable of advancing on the path of unity building. Consequently it has become clear in the Yemeni arena and to everybody that this situation calls for review in order to once again arouse the forces. If we remain in the same position in which we are now and are satisfied with the unity and democracy slogans, did not take practical steps along its path, and developed its slogans from being a public rhetoric and theories into reality, we will find that we have failed our duty toward our unity and aspirations. Some people look at this as a national dream. The proponents of any cause should adopt a national dream for which he should struggle in order to realize. Some say that this only enables us to escape reality, shifting from one position to another and leaving the problem outstanding to be dealt with later. But it is these two ideas that have led us to this tug of war situation. There are unity and democratic forces that want to go ahead on this path and have the ability to do so. Other forces do not have such ability. Consequently they are impeding our movement and obstructing it. The question is now raised on a national level. When we were unable to raise the question in the bodies and within the framework in which we operated, we were forced to put the matter to the people; it is the concern of the people after all. Our role was only to sign on what the people wished. But when we saw that different concepts are developing in the people's mind--something that cannot be ignored--we believed that we must once again go back to our people, to dialogue, to debating issues, and to taking substantial measures. Our masses accept nothing short of substantial measures that would ensure for them the ability to advance and to build this grand Yemen with its 13 million people and an area of no less than half a million square miles. All the Yemenis and all the good people are looking forward to this building. But when the resources are unavailable, efforts to ensure erecting this building weaken. This creates a situation in which frustration disappointment prevails. Therefore, we find that this dream is blurred and facing difficulties. I do not think that the problem is theoretical. It is due to our inability to arouse endeavors and to lack of efforts. During the past three-and-a-half-year period the efforts were not up to the building level. Some people aspire for ownership but they are satisfied with the slogans. This is our problem; it is the problem in many Arab countries. We think that it costs us nothing to say anything. Demagogy is rampant in politics and in many Arab situations. Some of us may be think so. Never mind. And yet we say "no prayer," "Leave it to God." This is a major task that calls for major endeavor and strong people. We have confidence in all the good people and our people. We do everything that might help leveling the path and stay close to the people's will. ['Abd-al-Salam] The political scene in Yemen has definitely witnessed several activities in order to bring views closer between you and his excellency President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. Can you talk about these efforts and the results achieved so far? [al-Bid] We need no mediation between us, but probably our people are in need of a mediator between them and their officials who should wake up and honor their pledges and commitments. All the efforts that are being made are, of course, good. We do not need people to (?educate us) because we are responsible and are aware of the situation. What is needed is credibility in what we say and announce to the people. This is what is needed. Mediation is probably in order to clarify a few things. But things between us are clear and the agreements are open and clear. The failure to implement them is the cause of what we are suffering from today. I believe that we have no need for mediation. If we do not prove our credibility we want witnesses to testify that we are not up to the promises we have made. ['Abd-al-Salam] Can it be said that Qays al-Zawawi's visit to Aden was part of the efforts to break the deadlock in the crisis, or was it a courtesy visit because His Majesty Sultan Qabus was unable to visit you when he visited Yemen recently? [Al-Bid] Brother Qays al-Zawawi visited Sanaa and Aden. The visit, we were told, is in order to follow up the issues that were discussed during His Majesty, the Sultan's, visit to Sanaa. Our brethren in Oman are concerned about the situation, and we appreciate the efforts they are making. They have proposed nothing specific. The discussions dealt with the situation, the exchange of views, and development of the bilateral relations. Yemen claims that the Arabs originated from there. We consider Yemen to be for all the Arabs. We are not embarrassed nor feel awkward when any of Arab brothers asks about our situation. Indeed this makes us very happy. We are gladdened by their interest in us and their wishes to us to make progress so that all we will be happy. We are happy to light a candle for Yemen so that we can diffuse some light also to other Arab arenas. I believe that this is a brotherly interest that stems from the desire to develop relations and be reassured about the Yemeni situation. ['Abd-al-Salam] It is obvious that the present discord is due to party disputes. You have submitted 18 points for the solution of the crisis and for your return to Sanaa. The GPC [General People's Congress] responded with 19 points most of them contrary to yours. This means that the points of agreement are still far apart. Doesn't your excellency see that these differences could endanger your historical achievement? [Al-Bid] First, our historical achievement will be endangered if we do not take practical steps to build it, regardless of whether party issues are raised or not. Issues should be dealt with from a nationalist standpoint. The points which the YSP raised were approved by all the other parties that are outside the government. Those have been condensed into 16 points, which you can see. We regard these 16 points as containing all the 18 points. They only had them redrafted. The proposed points reflect all the concerns of the Yemeni people. These were not party issues. They reflect our fear and anxiety over delaying taking steps that would strengthen the edifice of freedom and democracy. It is not a question of political bickering. Every party expresses itself differently. Perhaps our brothers in the GPC think that the 19 points are all the problems the people are suffering from. The people have matured; they can distinguish, they can understand, and they can eat with their own hands. They can also distinguish which are the issues that serve them. We are in favor of the issues that serve the people. We are not against discussing any subject raised by any quarter. The most important thing is that these issues should be relevant to the people's problems; problems of their country; their security; and their building of a unified state on all the Yemeni territories. There is need to create a genuine democratic climate. This work calls for making efforts. We realize that certain things need time to be implemented, such as growth, development, and completing building the state machinery. But we believe that certain urgent measures should be taken that need no effort on our part, such as the apprehension of outlaws and terrorists who are causing disturbances for the nation. We should arrest them and bring them to trial publicly. Those who reject this demand are not a problem. What do they want those who reject this demand? For example, we say that army camps should leave [urban areas] according to the unity agreement. The people and the major towns are demanding this. They should move and leave according to the agreement that has not yet been implemented. I do not think that this costs anything. Therefore, we believe that certain issues could move. On the contrary, because the camps are now in a position different from where they are supposed to be, from where they can defend national sovereignty. These forces are in a position that is too distant from the task of defending Yemen. For this reason we can see that certain issues can be solved. This would build up trust among the parties and the coalition; it would develop good relations between the people as well as the feeling that we are working for them in order to reassure them and create more stability in the country. ['Abd-al-Salam] In a recent speech President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih reiterated the term "the red lines" that should not be crossed. Is there a prior agreement on these lines between you to ensure the preservation of unity, or is it the present circumstances that have led to talking about these red lines? [Al-Bid] I believe that the red line is to ignore peoples' problems; the red line is to disregard peoples' issues; the red line is not to build a unified state; and the red line is to consecrate sectoral mentality; the red line is to impose a pattern over another; it is not to have sufficient enthusiasm to establish the unitary state, the "Yemeni Republic." The red line is also to ignore the existence of others. This is how I understand the red lines. This is what causes the loss of unity and eliminates our noble dreams for which we are struggling. You may ask for clarification, but this is how I understand the situation. I wish neglecting struggle and disregarding peoples' problems were a red line because the results will affect all of us. If we ignore the citizen's problems, we cannot build; if the state of institutions is not established, there will be no law. Instability is a red line that will lead to the disintegration of the unitary state of which we have been dreaming. I wish this was so. We might differ in our interpretation of this matter. The red line is the stand on which the people agree; it is to forsake the unitary state or to try to adopt a method or manner that will not lead to building unity. To raise a slogan and not practice what it preaches is unacceptable. I believe that this is the situation that should prevail. The interest and love of the country is what should prevail and be the common denominator binding us together. ['Abd-al-Salam] Following the Yemeni defense minister's recent announcement that Yemeni armed forces will stay away from the current political struggle, does your excellency believe that this is sufficient for you to drop one of the 18 points, the one concerning the need to move the army and the armed men to outside the cities, particularly Sanaa? [Al-Bid] No, we do not object to [the army] being neutral. This is our view in the YSP. The armed forces should not be involved [in politics]. Their position is quite different from the proposed tasks of building a unified armed forces for the Yemeni republic. These are two different questions. It is true that we should not involve the armed forces in political disputes, but this does not mean that we should adopt a negative attitude toward building national and unified armed forces established on scientific basis and on recognized national standards of efficiency in order to defend national sovereignty. That is, the two subjects are quite different. The question concerns the current problem. We should not involve the army in these issues, that is in debates and discussions. The army should devote its attention to the country. ['Abd al-Salam] Recent reports spoke of a large-scale campaign of assassination against YSP members and cadres that was recently uncovered, including the assassination of 11 key leaders. How true is this report? [Al-Bid] This is a serialized story that began some time ago; it is not new. Maybe it is the YSP's lot to make sacrifices on behalf of others for the sake of unity and democracy. The party has made major concessions and we spare nothing for the sake of this country. Such possibilities are often part of hostile activities and run counter to the activities of our allies. This is regrettable and we have drawn attention to it sometime before. I believe that this is proposed even in the 18 points which we submitted. We must face these situations and put an end to them. Because there is a proverb that says: "Today it is with you and tomorrow it will be with your brother." Another proverb says: "If your brother had a hair cut moisten your hair." The blade goes from one head to another. We should be alert. Hostile activities and violations could take place. Vigilance is required by everybody. ['Abd-al-Salam] Three and a half years have passed since unity. Did it achieve anything that would raise the standard of living of the citizen who have attached great hopes on unity to realize this goal? [Al-Bid] The chaos that prevailed during this period has obstructed progress toward improving the people's life. We have been supporting unity. We all in Sanaa have struggled for unity, for order, and for the establishment of the state of law and institutions. We did not accept the spread of chaos. What has been happening every day unfortunately was spreading chaos, weakening the state, and preventing it from imposing its authority on the Yemeni territories. The situation now is even worse than what it used to be before unity. There was a government in Aden and its mechanism was everywhere and in every central department. But we could no longer administer the government through which we deal with the citizens' problems, with development, and with the standard of living. ['Abd-al-Salam] The unified Yemeni currency which was to come into circulation when unity was announced has not been issued. Has it been abandoned? How do you explain the increase in prices and the drop in the dinar value? [Al-Bid] The new currency was part of our agreement, but the abandonment of many agreements has affected our present situation. Had all the agreements agreed upon been implemented during the transitional period we would have found ourselves in a better position to deal with the issues of the unitary state. But this failure is now having an impact on the situation. When we entered into unity the value of the dinar was $3 to the dinar. Since the day of unity and up to this day the value of the dollar has become almost 2 dinars. [sentence as published] This drop happened five times. The drop in the currency value and the high prices are due to the economic policy. The economic policy in Yemen since the unity has been unstable. Some of the activities to which we were accustomed have been suspended. For example, we used to draw up five-year plans and annual plans. These have stopped. It has become apparent that the state is producing a deficit rather than controlling it and putting an end to it. Smuggling is continuing. When we come to Sanaa we see goods on display but most of it is smuggled. There are no official documents showing that these goods entered the country legally. Many officials are aware of this situation. If it was not for the protection of some big fish in the state smuggling would not have continued. This is the cause of chaos. Smuggling and the smugglers and those who want to perpetuate this situation do not want a unitary state, a state of laws and regulations because it would put an end to the chaos in the economy. A state would lay down the basis for development, a correct economic policy, and a policy for currency issuing, dealing with deficit, developing revenues, expanding development, and creating more job opportunities rather than more deficit. ['Abd-al-Salam] Is there a consensus in your party politburo and central committee on your attitude toward the present crisis? [Al-Bid] The present attitude is actually that of the YSP politburo and the central committee. We are accustomed to reflecting the party's unanimous will. These points represent the party's politburo on practical issues. But we also have our own views on the development of the country in general as stated in our election program, our views as strugglers with a cause in our country. Our party has submitted these points and welcomes discussing them and discussing other points as well. ['Abd -al-Salam] What is your latest attitude toward the question of returning to Sanaa or continuing to stay in Aden? [Al-Bid] Really, I do not wish anybody to ask me about returning to Sanaa because Sanaa is my town and I know when I have to go there. I went there willingly and I know the way to it. When my national duty and my responsibility call upon me to be in Sanaa, God willing I shall be there. When I see no reason to do so then staying in any part of the Yemeni homeland is a matter to be decided upon; it is left to be decided upon the day when the situation calls for our presence. Our presence is unnecessary when all there is to be done is to focus on a single issue and ignore the rest. I hope...there is no reason for the people to tire themselves. We have before us issues that we must discuss. Without being serious in Sanaa, the capital of the unitary state. [sentence as published] I see no reason to discuss where the human being should be located. The human being is found were there is work, there is a job, there is a plan, and there are bodies that work. We shall find our way to Sanaa. After three and half a years I believe that we can stay wherever we happen to be; staying close to the people is better. We can at least comfort them, even if morally. Our citizens and kinsfolk have suffered a lot in the provinces in the past. We thought that all the government departments have been busy trying to solve the citizens' problems throughout the republic, but what we found was failures. We believe that these failures had a negative impact on the citizens' life. We must work with renewed effort and do all we can in order to pull the country out of this situation, and to stay wherever we like in Yemen. Where there there is work is where we should be.
