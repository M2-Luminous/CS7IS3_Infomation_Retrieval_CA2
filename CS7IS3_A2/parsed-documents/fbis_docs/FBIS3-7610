Recalling that SPA Chairman Yang Hyong-sop issued a statement on January 15 fully supporting the intention expressed by Yi Ki-taek at his New Year press conference to visit Pyongyang and meet with the great leader President Kim Il-song for the self-existence of the nation and the improvement of the North-South relations driven into a stalemate and that Yi Ki-taek reiterated his intention to visit the North on several official occasions, the spokesman says: "We consider that his invariable intention to visit Pyongyang is an expression of patriotism out of the desire to break grave impasse at present and open a bright horizon for the nation. "Anyone who is concerned over the destiny of the country and the nation must not block the will to visit Pyongyang and have a significant meeting with politicians but provide all necessary conditions and conveniences. "We express the belief that his Pyongyang visit, if realised, would make an affirmative contribution to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, national reunification and other outstanding issues between the North and the South."
