[Reporter Andrzej Kruszynski] I have visited all of the Slav countries from Poland to Bulgaria, the Russian politician said, and everywhere I saw stagnation, factories not working. Now, when the ideological system has collapsed, we can transfer the resources that until now have been earmarked for armaments to meet the economic needs. It is easier for us Slavs to reach an understanding because our languages are so close. At the same time, we will spend less on transportation in trade between us than in trade with the West. Economic issues, including the strengthening of links between the banking structures of Poland and Russia, were discussed during meetings of the Russian politician with business representatives and, as he described it, with politicians of the new Poland. According to Zhirinovskiy, they are politicians from outside the present political setup. However, he declined to name them.
