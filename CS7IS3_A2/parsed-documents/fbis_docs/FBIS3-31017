Are you alarmed by that? [Jovanovic] It is not new that the question of military intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been made topical. For a long time, it has been part of a tested strategy in the policies of several Western countries. A strategy that aims at putting psychological and political pressure on the Serbs in Bosnia, while the need for some of these countries to offer their services to the Islamic bloc, in order to achieve a balance in their relations, is another element of this course of action. At any rate, the wish for such intervention is absurd because at present neither a basis nor a justification for it exists, all the more so since in this civil war it is precisely the Serbs who have had to defend themselves constantly against attacks from the Muslim side for a relatively long time. [Schneider] Do you not think that this sounds somewhat cynical after the horrible massacre in Sarajevo last Saturday? [Jovanovic] Only if the blame can be laid on the Serbs by an objective side. But this is not the case here, which was also confirmed by British UN General Richie after he had had a close look at the scene. In his report to the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] he explicitly points out that it is impossible to say whether the shell was fired from a Serbian or a Muslim position. As you know, the latter is said to have already happened before, precisely before important UN resolutions or peace negotiations, so that one could suppose that there is method in it. [Schneider] A Muslim from Sarajevo would probably answer you now that UNPROFOR's attitude toward the Serbs has always been friendly... [Jovanovic] Therefore, I deliberately talked of an "objective side" before. Here I mean, for example, an expert commission consisting of Serbs, Muslims, and UNPROFOR people. Believe me, the FRY has the greatest interest in finding and severely punishing those who are responsible for this massacre of innocent civilians. A criminal act like this is an infamous blow against the general peace process and, for that reason alone, it has to be speedily cleared up. By that time, I can only appeal to the parties involved not to permit any manipulation of this tragic event by politicians or the media. Possible intervention, whatever the excuse for it may be, would only mean more war and far less peace. The solution for the Bosnian problem is to be pursued through the negotiations in Geneva and not through bombs. [Schneider] Should this course not be possible in the foreseeable future, do you actually see the danger that the Bosnian civil war will also spread to Macedonia or Kosovo? [Jovanovic] The civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina might only spread to other areas if -- to put it cautiously -- those foreign "factors" whose interests are also otherwise involved in this war wished it. The temporary orientation of the attention of the public and the mass media toward Kosovo and Macedonia or, to be more straightforward, the downright provocation of war in these regions, could be a variant in the game of interests of these factors. At any rate, my country is not interested in prolonging the civil war in Bosnia by a single day, to say nothing of spreading it to other areas. [Schneider] However, Zhirinovskiy's recent visit to Bosnia, his inflammatory nationalist speeches, and the exuberant applause of the Serbs there have again caused serious doubts in the West about Yugoslavia's desire for peace. How do you -- to change the subject for a moment -- assess Zhirinovskiy's success in the election and his chances in Russia? [Jovanovic] The rise of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, headed by Mr. Zhirinovskiy, is an important fact and a special phenomenon. It is a phenomenon that requires more profound studies and a more serious explanation than is possible in an answer to a journalist's question. At any rate, his chances to continue to influence his country's domestic policy life and foreign policy will also depend on whether his party finds the right answers to the real needs and problems of today's Russia and how good they are. [Schneider] Let us finally come back again to the present Yugoslavia: Must the separate peace agreement that was recently concluded with Croatia and that the Croatian media celebrated as recognition not appear to the Krajina Serbs as a betrayal because of their problems with President Tudjman? [Jovanovic] What you call a separate peace agreement is an agreement between the FRY and the Republic of Croatia on the mutual opening of official representations and offices. It is not recognition, but an important, constructive step and the clear beginning of a normalization of the present situation, which is to be concluded by the establishment of full diplomatic relations. However, as I have said: This agreement is only the beginning of this road. It does not prejudice the solution of the existing problems, particularly not the problem of the Serbian Krajina. However, the agreement will certainly facilitate the gradual solution of these problems and help to establish peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina more quickly. [Schneider] Foreign Minister, thank you for the interview.
