Unlike previous trade fairs, this trade fair took place after the United States lifted its trade embargo against Vietnam, thus allowing for the participation of giant foreign companies and consortiums. Some countries had as many as 40 exhibition booths each. After a period of interruption because of difficulties on their part, the Russian Federation and East European countries, which were Vietnam's former trade partners, have returned to the Vietnamese market. They participated in this fair with dozens of exhibition booths." We had an encounter with Mr. Aleksandr Araganov, marketing director of the Voltine Volgagrade company. He told us of the past trade cooperation between his company and other Vietnamese trade partners. He said: "We regard Vietnam as a big trade partner. Earlier our Voltine company sold many car tire products in the Vietnamese market even during the period when the U.S. trade embargo was still in place. The financial settlement between our company and your country had some difficulties, but both sides sought to tackle this problem by exporting their goods in the form of barter trade. Although there are many companies now advertising their car tire products in Vietnam, we are not balked at facing such competition because the tires manufactured by the Voltine company are destined for use by heavy-duty trucks and agricultural machines." This was the first time for the United States to participate in the Vietnam International Trade Fair with large consortiums and companies such as Coca Cola and the Chrysler Auto Manufacturing Consortium. Mr. Sirigaba, a representative at the Chrysler Jeep truck booth, said: "The Chrysler consortium in particular and other American companies in general were very pleased to see the U.S. embargo against Vietnam being lifted. We are also very excited to make a comeback to do trade business with Vietnam. We affirm that Vietnam with over 70 million in population is an important market." He went on: "It is regrettable that we have been a little bit late entering the Vietnamese market when compared to other countries." Among those participating in the fair were Japan, China, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The fair, which was held at the Giang Vo exhibition complex in Hanoi, featured over 350 exhibition booths which were organized into nine sections. This year the volume of goods on display at the fair were three to four times as many as that in last year. "The U.S.-owned Cola Cola company tried to reduce the price of its products below production cost for competitive and advertising purposes. But because of the poor customer-service attitude adopted by its personnel, the company's products were not welcomed by customers. Whereas, all the refreshment soft drinks -- a product manufactured under the joint venture between Vietnam's (Pecatro) company and the Russian Federation -- of the Minsk company's booth, were sold out thanks to its guaranteed qualities and hospitable attitude of its customer service personnel." Worthy of note is that "only two hours after the opening of the trade fair, the booth of the VINACOMEX Import-Export Construction Company, was able to ink a contract to sell a shovelling machine worth $210,000. Thanks to the display of their unique indigenous products, the booths of Thai Binh and Hai Hung Provinces were also able to attract many some dozens of foreign trade delegations which came to discuss business affairs. With the Thai Binh booth in particular, foreign customers agreed to purchase relatively large quantities of metal products and bicycle parts." Many people believed that the results obtained from this fair exceeded our expectations.
