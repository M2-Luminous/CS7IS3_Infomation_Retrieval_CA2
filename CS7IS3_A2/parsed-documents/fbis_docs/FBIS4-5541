Vengerovsky, and the chairman of the committee for issues of social federations and regional organizations of the state Duma, V. Zorkaltsev, with regard to the grave situation currently created on the Korean peninsula. The joint statement said: "We are surprised and angered at the fact that some quarters of the United States, seeking the establishment of a so-called `new world order', have raised a new unjustifiable condition to our traditional ally, the DPRK, and are increasing the tension again, threatening that they will resume the `Team Spirit' joint military exercises with South Korea and not come to the third-round of the DPRK-U.S. talks." The joint statement called upon the DPRK and the U.S. to take all necessary steps to continue the talks for guaranteeing peace on the Korean peninsula.
