In the report delivered at the request of the State Council, Chen Jinhua said: Generally speaking, the 1993 plan for national economic and social development was successfully implemented. China's social production continued to increase rapidly; its key projects construction and technological transformation strengthened; its foreign trade and economic and technological exchanges expanded further; business in its domestic markets was brisk; its science and technology, education, and other social undertakings developed vigorously; and the livelihood of its urban and rural people continued to improve. He said: In 1993, we scored major successes in the national economy. At the same time, there were still prominent contradictions and problems in our economic life. These problems, which occurred in the midst of progress, aroused the serious concern of governments at all levels. Vigorous measures have been taken or are being taken to resolve them. Chen Jinhua put forward six major tasks for this year's national economic and social development: 1) persistently attaching prime importance to agriculture and developing the rural economy in an all-around way; 2) running well large and medium state-owned enterprises by vigorously readjusting their structures, improving their management and operations, and raising efficiency; 3) maintaining a reasonable amount of investment in fixed assets and optimizing the investment structure; 4) opening wider to the outside world and actively and effectively using foreign capital, resources, technologies, and markets; 5) earnestly shifting economic construction onto the path that relies on scientific and technological progress, and further developing educational undertakings; and 6) improving the people's livelihood continuously and developing various social undertakings. Chen Jinhua stressed the need to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control to fulfill the 1994 national economic and social development plan in an all-around way. For this purpose, the report points out: The basic point of departure in carrying out macroeconomic regulation and control is to maintain balance and unity between reform, development, and stability. The main task of macroeconomic regulation and control is to maintain a rough balance between the total demand and total supply in society. We must exert efforts to control the size of the increase in the general level of commodity prices. The macroeconomic regulation and control system needs to be continuously improved in the course of in-depth reform. In the report delivered at the request of the State Council, Liu Zhongli said: Total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 billion yuan (including income of 69.384 billion yuan received from domestic and foreign debts), covering 113.1 percent of the budget and up 23.2 percent compared to the previous year. Total state expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan (including 33.735 billion yuan spent to pay for the principle and interest of domestic and foreign debts), equalling 112.5 percent of the budget and up 21.2 percent over the 1992 figure. This resulted in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan, which was not in excess of the budgeted figure. Liu Zhongli said: In accordance with the provisions of the original contract financial responsibility system, localities, based on the principle of achieving a balance between revenues and expenditures, were allowed to spend more from increased revenues after fulfilling the contracted task under the system. As a result, the large increase in local revenues brought about a corresponding increase in expenditures. This was the primary reason why total state spending considerably exceeded the budgeted figure. Liu Zhongli pointed out: Overall, the 1993 state budget was well implemented. Under the unified leadership of party committees and governments, fiscal and taxation departments at all levels have done much work to ensure the continuous deepening of reform as well as a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. He then said: We are now in an important period in which the economic structure is being transformed and the economy is developing rapidly. Not only is the contradiction between the supply of funds and the demand for funds very sharp, but management in various sectors urgently needs to be improved. To solve these problems once and for all, we will comprehensively reform the fiscal and taxation systems this year according to the decisions and unified arrangements of the party Central Committee and the State Council. We will seize this opportunity to further improve fiscal and taxation management and gradually establish fiscal and taxation operating mechanisms, meeting the requirements of the socialist market economy so that fiscal and taxation management will be standardized and legally institutionalized, and so the country's financial situation will be improved as soon as possible. Liu Zhongli stated: This year's state budget is again drafted according to the principle of tightening control over expenditures so as to maintain a basic balance between total supply and total demand, and to alleviate inflationary pressures. The guiding ideology is to implement in an all-round manner the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the party's 14th Central Committee; to ensure the smooth progress of reform of the fiscal and taxation systems as well as other major economic reforms; to continue to strengthen and improve marcroeconomic regulation and control; to actively develop financial sources, pay attention to improving enterprise efficiency, and make the growth of financial revenue commensurate with economic development; to persistently act according to our capacity; to readjust the expenditure structure; to appropriately increase investment in agriculture, education, science and technology, infrastructure, and other major projects; to maintain a necessary increase in expenditures for national defense, judicial, procuratorial, and public security departments; to strictly control investment in general fixed assets and expenditures for consumption; and to promote a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy as well as all-round social progress. Liu Zhongli added: According to the general plans of the party Central Committee and the State Council, this year we have conducted a major reform of the fiscal and taxation systems and the system of profit distribution in state-owned enterprises. After reforming the fiscal and taxation systems, the size [kou jing 0656 1777] of the budget has somewhat changed. According to the guiding ideology for drafting the budget and its changed size, we have made initial arrangements for the 1994 budget: state revenues total 475.995 billion yuan (exclusive of income from domestic and foreign debts), up 7.7 percent over last year in terms of comparable items; expenditures amount to 542.914 billion yuan (exclusive of repayments for principal and interest of domestic and foreign debts), an increase of 15 percent over last year in terms of comparable items. This leaves a deficit of 66.919 billion yuan. Liu Zhongli called on fiscal and taxation departments at all levels to seize this opportune time, seek truth from facts, change their work style, and work hard to ensure the success of reform of the fiscal and taxation systems and implementation of the budget. To this end, he pointed out: It is necessary to do solid work to ensure the desired results will be achieved in the reform of the fiscal and taxation systems. Efforts should be made to improve and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control and to promote a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. We should seize this opportune time to reform the fiscal and taxation systems as well as to improve and strengthen the levying and management of taxes. We should improve the method of issuing treasury bonds to make it a success. We should keep the total amount of expenditures under control and make certain there are funds for key projects.
