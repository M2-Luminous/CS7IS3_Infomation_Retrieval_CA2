[passage omitted] The Cabinet then reviewed a report by Interior Minister Hasan al- Alfi in which he discussed the internal security situation and the Interior Ministry's efforts on this matter. Al-Alfi pointed out that the ministry is following a plan based on a clear-cut security strategy. Noting that confronting extremism remains a key security element, the interior minister pointed out that improved methods have been recently introduced. More extensive security operations against dens of extremism have been mounted, particularly in shantytowns, Upper Egypt, and some other governorates. Coordination between state security and public security agencies has been stepped up to pursue and swiftly arrest fugitives. The minister noted that the list of suspects at airports, ports, and other points of entry and exit has been widened and extra measures have been taken to confront leading extremists with a view to isolating them and cutting off their contacts with their cadres. In addition, any signs of agitation or escalation by extremists are being dealt with firmly and their schemes among the masses are being frustrated. The minister pointed out that plans by the military wing of the terrorist organizations have been aborted, their influential leaders have been arrested, and their dens stormed. He noted that his ministry is confronting some signs of corruption and deviation as part of the government's policy and in a bid to demonstrate the integrity of the regime. The interior minister pointed out that security cooperation with some Arab countries in the areas of coordination and handing over fugitives is being upgraded. He reviewed his contacts during the Arab interior ministers' meeting in Tunis, adding that they have led to the arrest of some fugitives. He referred to the decline in the rate of seizure of unlicensed weapons, cases of drug trafficking, embezzlement, squandering of public wealth, and bribery. During the meeting, the Cabinet approved a number of draft laws, including one regulating the use of foreign currency. The new bill lifts the current restrictions and procedures that are no longer compatible with the free exchange regulations in Egypt and allows travelers to take out foreign currency without any restrictions or documents. The Cabinet also approved a draft law organizing the cotton trade in the country. The bill seeks to liberalize the sale and purchase of cotton in accordance with the market economy and the principle of free trade. The Cabinet also approved a draft law setting up a Cotton Exchange for spot transactions to be called the Mina al-Basal Exchange. Cotton will be sold and purchased through this exchange, which will be based in Alexandria. The Cabinet also approved a draft civil code that will remedy the loopholes that exist in the current law. Under the new law, automation will be introduced to prevent the forgery of identity cards and all relevant information for each citizen will be stored and given a computerized number. The Cabinet also approved a number of international agreements.
