And shoppers do not always come back loaded with the foods they wanted. Whether asked for pasteurized milk packets, coffee, oil, household soap, pasta, sugar, or any other basic consumable, the shopkeeper's answer is always the same sharp "oulech," accompanied by a pathetic "aouli" ("my dear") as if to apologize for the answer. The truth is that Bejaia has seldom experienced such a scarcity of such a broad range of products. Usually, even when other governorates report tensions, Bejaia barely shudders, and that is mostly due to the fear of being affected by shortages, which translates into a veiled [sic] sudden increase in consumption. The self-defense reflex then works to its full extent. The reasons that the governorate is somehow "sheltered" are many. The nearby port, the existence of large local production units (ENCG, ENAJUC [expansions not given], flour mills, etc.), added to a smaller population, estimated to at most 1 million, made it possible each time to cope stoically with market perturbations. This time, however, things look different and are affected by the prevalent feeling of malaise, not to say depression, that prevails in the economy as a whole. "Lacking raw materials, production units slowed down." "Add to that import reductions, and we had to reach a dead end," Mr. Nait-Slimane, general manager of EPIDAL [expansion not given], explained, pointing out that his company just marked time during the past year. "Partly because of a lack of aggressiveness on the part of the EPIDAL GEIC [expansion not given], partly because of import restrictions imposed, among others, by the ad hoc committee, and mostly because of declining production at national enterprises, which are themselves hampered by inadequate import quotas. All this brought us this deplorable situation," he commented. It so happened, he said, that even traditional safety stocks were depleted and are no longer available "to relieve the demand, and therefore the pressure on the market. We are forced to sell on a day-to-day basis. And seldom does a delivery last more than one week," Mr. Zaidi, a sales manager, commented, adding that his own company is experiencing the worst problems in getting supplies. "It has become a complex exercise, and often we must call on our own personal relations; otherwise, we couldn't do it," he concluded. Paradoxical as it may seem, however, speculation--the consequence of any shortage--has not yet appeared, except that a few grocers conspicuously increased their prices, asking, for instance, 150 Algerian dinars for coffee, 22 for sugar, or 190 for butter; the rest maintained an honorable position. It is true also that the workers' consumption cooperative system works fully to appease tensions. No matter how small the quantities offered for sale, they have the merit of being distributed equitably and benefit first those who need them. As a result, opportunists fail to attract many people if all they have to offer is basic consumables. At any rate, you hardly see any street vendors peddling that kind of goods, contrary to what is the case elsewhere, in large Algerian urban centers. However, should the tension persist, there would be a potential risk threatening the "cooperative system" that constitutes a patent factor of equilibrium in distribution.
