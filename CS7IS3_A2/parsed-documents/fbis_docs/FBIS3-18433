G."-initialled report: "Complaints About a Lack of Understanding"] [Text] Bonn, 1 March -- On Tuesday [1 March], Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister Hassanov had a meeting in Bonn with Development Minister Spranger and officials from the Foreign Ministry, during which his country's conflict with Armenia over the enclave of Nagorny-Karabakh was discussed. Hassanov complained about a lack of understanding on Germany's part and said that Germany was favorably disposed toward Armenia's position. The Azerbaijani Foreign Minister was unable to meet his host, Foreign Minister Kinkel. Kinkel had remained in Brussels, because of the negotiations with Austria and Finland on admission to the European Union. He wrote Hassanov a letter in which he said that the Federal Government was ready to cooperate with Azerbaijan and work out a joint statement that would serve as the basis for the development of relations. Kinkel asked Hassanov to wait for him in Bonn, but the Azerbaijani foreign minister left and observed in annoyance that he had enough to do in Baku and had to meet the Swedish chairman of the CSCE working group responsible for Nagorny-Karabakh, Elaisson, on Wednesday. Spranger wants to send one of his ministry officials to Azerbaijan to examine project opportunities. This is to be followed by the drawing up of a program for cooperation. Hassanov spoke to Bundestag Deputy Wimmer, the chairman of the parliamentary group dealing with the Caucasus. Wimmer wants to bring about a meeting between Azerbaijani and Armenian deputies in Germany. Hassanov said that Azerbaijani deputies were ready to take part in such a meeting. The Armenians have yet to agree. The Azerbaijanis have as little against Wimmer's mediation attempt, which is to bring about negotiations between the deputies on finding a solution to the dispute over Nagorny-Karabakh, as they do against the intentions of Russia and Turkey to become involved in finding ways to reach agreement. The initiative came from Wimmer, but Azerbaijan would also like "Germany to be actively involved in finding a solution to the problem." Azerbaijan has only one condition for an end to the fighting: "Armenian troops must withdraw from the occupied territories." Azerbaijan is prepared to negotiate over a "guarantee status" for the Armenians living in Nagorny-Karabakh. Hassanov described such guarantees as "special rights." International observers, above all the CSCE, could be involved in determining the content of the guarantees. The Armenians living in the enclave could have the same "full rights" as the Azerbaijanis. This would not affect the question of belonging to the Azerbaijani state. Speaking in Bonn, Hassanov charged that Armenia wants to carve up sovereign Turkish territory with the help of the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], the Kurdish underground organization. By contrast, Azerbaijan maintained "clear interstate relations" with Turkey, relations that were constantly becoming closer. Azerbaijan's embassy in the Federal Republic is housed in the Turkish Embassy building. Hassanov was not keen to talk about developments in Russia and their possible consequences for Moscow's relations with other states that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union. Hassanov reacted with apparent incomprehension to questions about Russian imperial aspirations, such as have been noted in the Baltic republics. Hassanov said that in contrast to the Baltic republics, there were no Russian troops stationed in Azerbaijan. There were neither official or unofficial statements emanating from Moscow that allow one to conclude that Russia wished to establish military bases in Azerbaijan. The release of the putschists Khasbulatov and Rutskoy was an internal Russian matter and the result of a decision made by the Russian parliament. After Azerbaijan achieved independence in 1989, relations with Russia at first cooled. Now, however, after President Aliyev came to power, efforts were being made "continually to improve relations." The process is underway. Aliyev was a member of the Moscow Politburo during Soviet times.
