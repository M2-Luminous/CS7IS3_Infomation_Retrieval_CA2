Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo and his wife visited this sister nation in January because the candidates of the National Liberation and Social Christian Unity parties invited them to observe the electoral process. Mr. Lacayo seized this opportunity to talk with the two candidates about the good relations that Nicaragua hopes to have with the new Costa Rican Government that will rule this country for the next four years. He also spoke to them on behalf of those Nicaraguans who work or want to work in Costa Rica. He received from current Government Minister Luis Fishman and from the two candidates words of support for the Nicaraguan workers who go there protected within the framework of the agreement signed by the Labor Ministries of the two countries. The agreement guarantees such workers the full enjoyment and benefit of the labor rights in force in Costa Rica. The current Costa Rican Government believes that those Nicaraguans who go there unprotected within the framework of the said agreement are exposing themselves to mistreatment by unscrupulous people who take advantage of the Nicaraguan workers' lack of legal documents to avoid paying minimum wages and other social benefits. This constitutes a crime that Costa Rican authorities are willing to fight by issuing the pertinent documents through the mechanism agreed upon by the Labor Ministries of the two countries. [Dated] Managua, 16 February 1994 [Signed] Presidency of the Republic, Information and Press Directorate
