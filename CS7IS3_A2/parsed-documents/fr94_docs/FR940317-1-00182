FR940317-1-00182 FR940317-1-00015 The FAA has taken several steps to address the overflight issues in Hawaii. In 1986, the FAA conducted a study of helicopter sightseeing operations in Hawaii. As a result of that study, recommendations were made to the State and to operators in Hawaii to improve safety and community relations. Also in 1986, the FAA conducted a joint study with the State on heliport and airport access. A result of that study was a helicopter operating plan for Hawaii. Numerous meetings have since been held with NPS personnel, industry, and local communities, including four public meetings conducted in January 1994. Impacts to Parks and Their Resources At some parks, including Grand Canyon National Park, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, and Haleakala National Park, the temporal and spatial extent of commercial air tours are, in the judgment of NPS managers, impairing park resources and visitor experience. While the NPS and FAA are interested in evaluating potential solutions to the problems at these parks, they are also seeking solutions that will make it possible to avert problems in the future throughout the national park system as have developed at these parks. Cultural Resources Very limited information is available on the response of structures to subsonic aircraft and helicopters. The greatest potential risk to historic structures and cultural resources in units of the national park system is from helicopters. The noise characteristics of helicopters are such that they tend to excite nearby structural elements at their resonance frequency, causing low frequency vibrations, rattle, and in some cases, damage. The sound pressure is greatest at structures in the plane of the main rotor, such as could be the case for a helicopter approaching cliff dwellings. When representative cultural resources were reviewed for probability of damage, most were found to be at some risk from commercial air sightseeing tours. Mesa Verde (Colorado) and Canyonlands National Parks (Utah), among others, protest fragile prehistoric stone and adobe structures, including granaries and cliff dwellings, as well as associated cultural materials that are susceptible to damage from helicopter-induced noise and rotor wash. The cultural and spiritual values commemorated in units of the national park system like San Antonio Missions National Historical Parks and the battlefields of the Civil War can be wholly lost by frequent and intrusive commercial air sightseeing tour overflights. As further examples of areas impacted by aircraft overflights, Mount Rushmore National Memorial and the Statue of Liberty National Monument are cultural icons that can be adversely affected in significant ways be commercial air tour overflights. At the Statue of Liberty, an impending aircraft service would take off and land helicopters from a floating raft less than one-half mile from the statue. This service would be added to two existing commercial sightseeing helicopter operators that account for 115 flights per day and a service that operates four fixed-wing aircraft on air tours. Similarly, the experience of Mount Rushmore National Memorial for the visitors on the ground can be irretrievably lost as a consequence of the aircraft flights close to memorial. Wildlife Effects
