Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali met on Saturday Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs at his request to discuss Russian troops withdrawal and guarantees of national minorities' rights in Latvia. After the 45-minute meeting Birkavs told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that his visit to Geneva was caused by a "new situation" called forth by the April 5 instruction by the Russian president stipulating, in particular, creation of military bases on Latvian territory. In his words, this situation "has brought about an extremely high political tension" and requires an "utterly new assessment and additional international support". The Latvian prime minister believes this document should be officially withdrawn "at the highest level". Birkavs gave to understand that the instruction had complicated the signing of an agreement with Russia on troops withdrawal. However, Latvia is ready to sign such an agreement, he said. According to Birkavs, Another subject for discussion during the meeting with Butrus-Ghali was the "so-called violations of human rights" in Latvia. "I would like to say that in its turn, upon troops withdrawal, a law on citizenship which will take into account many recommendations of the Council of Europe and the CSCE high commissioner for national minorities will be adopted", Birkavs said.
