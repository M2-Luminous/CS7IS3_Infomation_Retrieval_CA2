Exactly 22 years ago, our heroic and combative revolutionary POOR PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY-EGP-emerged. Today it is an active URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] member. TO STRUGGLE AGAINST SOCIAL INJUSTICES. On this 19 January we are 22 years old, taking the revolutionary message to the poor people, Indians, and Spanish-speaking Indians [ladinos], to our brothers seeking peace with social justice, respect for human rights, and economic and political changes. We have achieved acceptance by the people in general. The government and Army have tried to defeat us militarily with great offensives against our war fronts during 1987 to 1988 and during February and May 1993, which ended with a suspension of the dialogue and the fall of Serrano Elias. Our fighters and cadres have known how to face and defeat Army offensives. We firmly continue our revolutionary struggle and are willing to sign peace if the government and Army accept to make deep human rights, economic, and political changes in the country. If this is not the case, the armed struggle shall continue, because they have never defeated us. UNTIL WE REACH FINAL VICTORY POOR PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY - EGP - THE PEOPLE WHO ORGANIZE PEOPLE WHO TRIUMPH! LONG LIVE THE 22D EGP ANNIVERSARY! LONG LIVE THE CUC!
