FR941230-2-00035 FR941230-2-00027 [Docket No. 94N&hyph;0351] Draft Proposed Regulations on Mammography X-ray Equipment Standards and on Medical Physicists Standards; Availability AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of two draft proposed regulations prepared by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). One draft contains standards for mammography x-ray equipment and the other draft contains medical physicists standards. The draft documents are intended to implement the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 (the MQSA). The MQSA requires the establishment of a Federal certification and inspection program for mammography facilities, regulations and standards for accrediting bodies for mammography facilities, and standards for mammography equipment, personnel, and practices, including quality assurance. Prior to publishing the proposed regulations, FDA is making available two draft regulations concerning personnel qualifications for medical physicists and the quality standards for mammography equipment in order to receive additional information about these subjects. DATES: Written comments by January 30, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit written requests for single copies of the draft proposed regulations to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ&hyph;240), Food and Drug Administration, 9200 Corporate Blvd., Rockville, MD 20850. Send two self-addressed adhesive labels to assist that office in processing your requests. Submit written comments on the draft proposed regulations to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. Requests and comments should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. A copy of the draft proposed regulations and received comments are available for public examination in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles K. Showalter, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ&hyph;240), 9200 Corporate Blvd., Rockville, MD 20850, 301&hyph;594&hyph;3311. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA is announcing the availability of the October 1994 draft proposed regulations regarding mammography x-ray equipment, and the December 2, 1994, draft mammography medical physicist standards regulations that are being developed to implement the MQSA (Pub. L. 102&hyph;539) that was enacted to establish minimum quality standards for mammography. The MQSA requires that, to provide mammography services legally after October 1, 1994, all facilities, except facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, must be both accredited by an approved accrediting body and certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary). The authority to approve accreditation bodies and to certify facilities has been delegated by the Secretary to FDA. Pursuant to authorization from Congress, FDA promulgated interim regulations to ensure that mammography facilities meet minimum quality standards. These regulations, which were published in the Federal Register of December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67558 and 67565), and amended on September 30, 1994 (59 FR 49809), became effective on October 1, 1994, and will remain in effect until final regulations are promulgated. FDA is currently developing proposed regulations for quality standards for mammography x-ray equipment. Prior to publishing proposed regulations on this subject, FDA has made the draft available to mammography x-ray equipment manufacturers in order to gather additional information about the technical capabilities of mammography equipment currently in use and the feasibility of efficient implementation of the draft proposed equipment standards by the radiology community. Further, FDA has shared a draft proposed regulation concerning medical physicists' qualifications with the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine in order to obtain information from these organizations about the potential impact of the draft proposal on the availability of medical physicists. The agency is publishing this notice in order to make the two draft proposed regulations available to the public. Although all members of the public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposed regulations when they are published in the spring of 1995, interested persons who wish to comment on the draft proposals may submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) on or before January 30, 1995. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The draft proposed regulations and received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will consider any received comments in developing final regulations. Dated: December 23, 1994. William K. Hubbard, Interim Deputy Commissioner for Policy.
