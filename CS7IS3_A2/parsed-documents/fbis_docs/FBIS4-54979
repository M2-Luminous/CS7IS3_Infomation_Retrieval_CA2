[passage omitted] [Havel] I would like to say that the principle of civic disobedience as such is a respectable form of defense by a group of citizens in the conditions of a dictatorship, apartheid, and so forth. In my view there is neither room, motive, nor logical reason for such a principle of disobedience in a democracy where power has really come from the people -- in free elections. It also strikes me as somewhat alarming that this view is voiced by an official of the party which has on many occasions throughout its history proved its opposition to democracy. I wonder if this appeal is not a harking back to the communist methods of conquering power. [Tamchyna] I hope it will not sound too lofty if I say that all the world's eyes have over the past few days been focused primarily on the Republic of South Africa [RSA], where the first multiracial elections are over and the results known, and probably no one expected those results and the new division of political forces to solve all the problems of the Republic of South Africa. My question is probably something like this: Will the new political structure of the Republic of South Africa be able to appreciate the concept of democracy not only in terms of its advantages and rights but also with all the duties and responsibilities it entails? [Havel] The process of national liberation and extrication from white domination is a logical, legitimate, and lawful one which has taken place throughout the world, and I think that the fall of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa is cause for universal delight. The Republic of South Africa naturally faces a difficult time ahead. All countries which freed themselves from colonial domination have experienced and are still experiencing difficult times, but they probably do have to pass through this phase. Since you are asking me, I would like to take the opportunity to praise the achievements of President de Klerk, who at one time paid an official visit to our country during which we talked at length. He really is a courageous man. He has made a decisive contribution to these changes. He was well aware that after putting into effect the changes he is now instituting and which he considers to be right, he would lose the presidential office. But he put justice before his own position. I think he is a man who deserves worldwide recognition and who was rightly awarded the Nobel prize. By this I do not mean to say that Nelson Mandela did not deserve it. All that remains for me to wish him is that, if he is indeed elected president at the beginning of next week, he might lead his country wisely through the period which awaits it. [passage omitted]
