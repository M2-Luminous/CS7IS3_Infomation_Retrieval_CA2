That was the only time available. After all, conversion has become disorderly partisan warfare. Not only does it not have a strategy or tactics, it does not even know whether to advance or retreat, trapped in the pincers of the disorder in the state. Acrid is the smoke of financial conflagrations and the doused bonfires of the way stations of the helpless. Is the Russian Government really indifferent to the destruction of the military-industrial complex? First and foremost we no longer have a military-industrial complex as such, Aleksey Nikolayevich explained. There are only the high-technology sectors left. But so far neither the president's entourage nor the government has found the time to take a look at them. However, their verbal tirades have been simply staggering. At first the president blithely promised that by the first fall the military industry would keep the people watered and fed with the "harvest" of its conversion projects. But then the drought came, reducing the ruble to worthless scraps of paper. Then last August the government adopted the alleged armament -- but really disarmament -- program; in November it "adjusted" it; and at the end of December Chernomyrdin ordered a complete review. The results are shameful. Not even from the very first days but rather the first hours of the new year the fulfillment of the defense orders for 1994 was on the brink of catastrophe. This is because in the previous two years the collectives of enterprises working on military hardware had suffered damage comparable to that caused by a nuclear strike. The most specialized sections had come to a complete standstill and dropped out of the manufacturing process. To restore them now will take nothing less than heroic efforts surpassing even the labor exploits of the Great Patriotic War. And even then it will take not months or years, but decades. A gloomy but objective forecast. It is based on the colossal brain drain of top-class people not just from enterprises but also from scientific research institutes and design bureaus. The first wave of extreme poverty swept away the most highly qualified doctors of sciences, the second wave took candidate doctors with it. Today it is the wave of "top specialists." Yet each of them is like Saltykov-Shchedrin's peasant whose labor keeps two generals fed. What you have left are those young kids who detest the idea of running away and those who like everything the way it is. [PRAVDA] Aleksey Nikolayevich, are Russia's intellectual knights not signing up with subcontractors? Where are they going to beat their swords into plowshares? [Shulunov] First of all, quite a few foreign firms have absolutely no interest in importing defense staff into their countries. Those people are far more necessary over here because they possess not only military secrets but also purely civilian secrets which are sometimes incomprehensible to foreign entrepreneurs. The most talented design staff are being offered work not in offices but at home. They are being equipped with personal computers, equipment, cars -- work at home rather than wasting your time on chaotic public transport. We guarantee personal secrecy and a living wage. Very many people are joining commercial structures in this country -- small but lively and well-equipped firms -- they are designing and taking part in the production of and trade in purpose-built instruments, apparatus, technologies, and household goods. It is very good that such activity has started up in our country. After all, just two years ago such an infrastructure did not exist here. But the bright lights also beckoned our talented defense specialists from abroad. The U.S. Congress and State Department adopted an urgent decision to admit and welcome Russia's best minds, especially those from the military-industrial complex. They set a generous quota: 11,000 people a year. But it was emphasized that they should be from Russia, not Ukraine or Belarus. They can expect very considerable financial assistance to help them adapt, the promise of the accelerated acquisition of American citizenship, and the promise of cost-of-living and "training" allowances. At a time when defense specialists are publicly becoming impoverished -- in December the "average" wage was 35,000 rubles [R] -- the competition among people wanting to lead at least a normal life was very great. The demand for the export of rare intellects and talents is growing but will mean an irreparable loss for this country. It is time to understand clearly that some people would really like Russia to cease being a world power with a unique science and a mighty scientific and technical and defense potential and be transformed into a raw-materials appendage of the West, the East, and then Africa, too. There is evidence of this to date: Last year the export of technical output fell to 5-6 percent. [PRAVDA] The president has published an edict providing for an increase in the level of pay to eight times the minimum wage for fulfillment of the state defense order and 10 times that figure in the nuclear industry. [Shulunov] This is a two-edged sword. The first is in the budget. After all, we do not have the financial results for 1992 yet. We got through 1993 entirely without a budget, papering over the cracks one department at a time and even taking each event as it came. It is hard to judge what is in store for us now. But the budget is covering at most 65-70 percent of the planned items and areas of expenditure. And here is the second edge of the financial sword. The payment of defense orders is planned to be at last year's level. But because prices are rising all the time and wages are trying if not to get ahead then at least not to lag behind, the state's military finance coffer is becoming a purse for small change. Here is a surprising detail which shows that our present authorities are truly in their infancy: No one yet really understands what the state defense order is. There is not even a single interpretation of the terminology itself. For example, we in the defense industry take it to mean the Defense Ministry's order paid for by funds issued to it by the state. And the Defense Ministry shares our view. But the tax inspectorate takes it to mean something completely different. The Finance Ministry has its own interpretation and the Economy Ministry understands it quite differently. Consequently, at the very highest level it is not a financial struggle going on but a war of words. But there is no time for that kind of thing. At the moment the government is merely plugging the financial gaps: First there was the cost of the referendum; then the struggle against the Supreme Soviet and the possession of its territory; finally there was the cost of the parliamentary elections, the ratification of the Constitution, the overhaul of the White House, and the move there. Of course, in view of these daily costs, losses, and political concerns it has no time to worry about providing hauberks, especially those which still jingle rather than those which are completely rusted through. [PRAVDA] But the hauberk is a museum piece. Whereas conversion and the fulfillment of the defense orders are already turning into disorderly partisan warfare. [Shulunov] It may be said that there is financial and economic robbery going on. Here is an example. A characteristic feature of our defense industry was the enterprise which was like a whole city. These enterprises' assets included not just an impressive social base but also enormous common boiler houses. In midwinter they have been left without fuel because of the colossal rise in the cost of coal and fuel oil. They have had to ask the banks for enormous credits regardless of the interest rate. Meanwhile, they knew in advance that these loans would virtually not be repaid. After all, in the first three weeks of December alone insolvency debts rose from R15 trillion to R19 trillion across the country. At the same time we were owed R700 billion by the military who a year ago were counting on the state budget when they concluded with enterprises what seemed to be modest state defense order contracts calculated down to the last cent. But they ceased to be able to pay in April, when finance became more like a political fiction. Defense workers are now caught in a vicious circle from which there is no escape. I think that there will be an unprecedented explosion in the second half of January, at the latest. After all, we no longer have the means to pay for the fuel or materials essential to production. And the banks will refuse to grant new credits. A financial cataclysm is looming. [PRAVDA] Aleksey Nikolayevich, but only a few months ago there were ways for defense industry personnel to make an organized withdrawal from the cycle of financial crises and massacres, by exporting and selling arms on the world market. [Shulunov] Yes, for two years Russia's most progressive forces worked in harmony on the creation of a new and very flexible structure to ensure the success of arms exports on the market front. The Defense Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and the State Committee for the Defense Industry were among our active allies. We all tried to at least restore what had been lost in the potholes of perestroyka. Nor did we avoid mistakes either. The Commission for Military-Technical Cooperation was set up to prevent them, and it began working on a regular basis, virtually every week. But then came a bolt from the blue. In line with the 18 November edict of the president we totally reorganized the existing system without, however, creating a parallel structure, hastily destroying everything that had been tried and tested. De facto, without any analysis, without knowing what other shortcomings were "looming" around the corner, without formulating a new strategy, perestroyka was once again undertaken, and in an utterly unqualified and incompetent manner. It is hard even to calculate the tremendous damage. I think 1994 will be a write-off for military-technical cooperation, because we have been driven back to where we started in late 1991 or early 1992. But it's a hopeless lament.... [PRAVDA] Maybe those on high have become aware of the awful experience of abortive conversion and military readaptations [voyennyye perelitsovki] in the world's major powers? And the solution? [Shulunov] The solution is already known in all its detail. The U.S. military industry conducted the first experiment in conversion in the late seventies-early eighties. It was extremely unsuccessful. But it is thanks to this experiment that the most rational way has been found. When major corporations own the number one or number two-ranked manufacturers of recognized categories of arms, they buy out their weaker competitors and carry out either horizontal or vertical integration, keeping weapons production wholly to themselves. Their former rivals, rid of the burden of competing in military production, acquire civilian firms with the profits they derive from this situation and continue to lead a peaceful, tranquil life. The result was that both the corporations and the state benefit. The U.S. Defense Department's considerable reduction in arms purchases has not meant a drop in the production of military hardware. And last year 15 percent of the output produced "captured" its own sectors of the world market. In 1995 it is planned to export around 30 percent of the arms produced. The competition, needless to say, is very tough. But the Russian leadership is, regrettably, somehow too busy to formulate a foreign economic strategy on military-technical matters. We do not yet have the right to dream of an expansionist policy. But it is high time we reconquered those positions we hastily surrendered on our traditional markets. A start has been made. The thing is that over the past two decades we have exported arms worth $120 billion. The bulk of them -- complex equipment -- with a long service life, around 30 years. What is more, there is more Russian military aviation equipment in the world than anyone else's -- there are more than 5,000 of our combat aircraft in the arsenals of various countries in the Near East, India, China, and Africa. But, in accordance with past tradition, government licenses were needed for annual repairs and deliveries of expendable material and spare parts. And the government's distraction with domestic affairs made it very hard to organize this. We finally succeeded, quite recently, in winning round our leaders and obtained permission to supply spare parts direct, earning around $4-5 billion a year. Even at the present crazy ruble-dollar exchange rates, manufacturers will make profits of 300 to 1,000 percent. Profitable or what! But I don't know how this will develop. We agreed with the former minister of foreign economic relations to abolish altogether as of 1994 furtive taxes on military exports. But it is hard to tell the future now following the 18 November edict. [PRAVDA] Yet we do also have experience of conversion. After the Great Patriotic War conversion on a Soviet scale was indeed a total affair. And urgent at that! Leningrad's Kirov Plant switched in a matter of months from producing tanks to producing the world's first skidding tractor. The same thing happened at thousands of other enterprises. [Shulunov] Yes. But, first, you had the powerful state planning system of the time. Today, as well, conversion should be unified and planned. Second, it rested on iron labor discipline, which is now being eroded from above. Third, the stable financial position of the state was strengthening. Despite outside attempts at interference the state increased production year after year and the budget grew steadily, rather than waning as is happening now. Well, we must go on fighting. This is not, regrettably, the postwar period. The Battle of the Kursk Bulge lies ahead, not just for defense personnel but for all industry. Enough of partisan warfare.
