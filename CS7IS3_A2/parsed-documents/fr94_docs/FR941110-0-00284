FR941110-0-00284 FR941110-0-00018 Diellia erecta, a member of the spleenwort family (Aspleniaceae), is a fern that grows in tufts of three to nine lance-shaped fronds, each 20 to 70 cm (8 to 28 in) long. The fronds emerge from a 1 to 2.5 cm (0.4 to 1 in) long rhizome covered with brown to dark gray scales. The frond stalks are reddish brown to black and smooth and glossy, 2 to 21 cm (0.8 to 8.3 in) long, and have a few stiff scales at their bases. Each frond has 15 to 50 lance-shaped pinnae arranged oppositely along the midrib. The pinnae are usually between 2 and 4 cm (0.8 and 1.6 in) long and 4 to 8 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) wide. Ten to 20 sori, which may be separate or fused, are borne on each margin of the pinna. Each sorus is covered by an indusium (protective membrane) that falls short of the edge of the frond and runs parallel to the edge of each pinna. This species differs from other members of the genus in having brown or dark gray scales usually more than 2 cm (0.8 in) in length, fused or separate sori along both margins, shiny black midribs that have a hardened surface, and veins that do not usually encircle the sori (Degener and Greenwell 1950, Hillebrand 1888, Robinson 1912, Smith 1934, Wagner 1952). Historically, Diellia erecta was known from the Kokee area on Kauai; the Koolau Mountains on Oahu; Pukoo, Pelekunu Valley, and Kaunakakai Gulch on Molokai; Mahana Valley and Hauola Gulch on Lanai; scattered locations on West Maui; and various locations on the island of Hawaii (HHP 1992c1 to 1992c3, 1992c6, 1992c8 to 1992c11, 1992c16, 1992c18 to 1992c26). Currently, Diellia erecta is only known from Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. On Molokai, there are four locations with an unknown number of individuals at Halawa Valley, Kahuaawi Gulch, Makolelau, and Puu Kolekole on private land (HHP 1992c12, 1992c14, 1992c15; Robert Hobdy, Hawaii State Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW), pers. comm., 1991). On Maui, there is a total of at least 38 individuals at 7 locations: 4 populations on West Maui at Iao Valley on private land, and Kanaha Stream, Manawainui Plant Sanctuary, and Papalaua Gulch on State land; and 3 populations on East Maui at Olinda, Waiopai Gulch, and near Makawao on State and private land (HHP 1992c4, 1992c5, 1992c7, 1992c13, 1992c17; HPCC 1990a; Joel Lau, HHP, and R. Hobdy, pers. comms., 1992). On the island of Hawaii, there are 2 populations on State land: 1 at Honomalino with over 20 plants, and 1 at Manuka NAR with at least 1 plant (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Statewide, this species has a total of 13 populations and approximately 63 known individuals. Diellia erecta is found in Diospyros sandwicensis (Lama)/'Ohi'a Lowland Mesic Forest between 210 and 1,590 m (700 and 5,200 ft) in elevation (HHP 1992c21; HPCC 1990a; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). Other associated plant species include Dodonaea viscosa ('a'ali'i), Dryopteris unidentata, Pleomele auwahiensis (halapepe), Syzygium sandwicensis ('ohi'a ha), and Wikstroemia sp. ('akia) (HPCC 1990a). The major threats to Diellia erecta are habitat degradation by pigs, goats, and cattle; competition with alien plant species; and stochastic extinction due to the small number of existing individuals.
