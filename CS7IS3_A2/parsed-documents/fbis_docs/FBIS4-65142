Speaking at his weekly briefing, Ataman strongly denied foreign press reports on so-called forced emigration of 3,500 to 6,000 Turks of Kurdish origin following operations by security forces in the region and of villages being burned down. "We knew the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist organization would try to send some of our citizens voluntarily or by force to northern Iraq, group them together and present them to the foreign press as `Kurds escaping Turkish oppression,'" Ataman said adding that this action aimed at increasing the foreign pressure on Turkey. "The organization has started to transport its sympathizers as well as others from the region to northern Iraq in small groups and are also aiming to obtain money from the United Nations for their own," he said. "The terrorist organization is trying, as ever, to deceive the foreign public and stage a new play completely based on its own scenario," he said. "It is trying to obtain United Nations money through its own supporters in the process." "There is no question of any village being purposefully bombarded or destroyed by security forces," he said. "Some of the villagers have been already moved to safe regions in order to escape PKK terror and there has been some damage in some hamlets or villages where the security forces have clashed with terrorists." "In these cases, our innocent citizens, as always, are compensated by the state," he said.
