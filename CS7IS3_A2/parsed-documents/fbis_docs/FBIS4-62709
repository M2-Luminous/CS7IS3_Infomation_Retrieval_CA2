Because the payments crisis has not only drawbacks, but, however paradoxical it may sound, it also has its pluses. It forces one to reduce budget expenditure as much as possible, which stabilizes the state's monetary circulation. Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko tells what came of this policy in the first quarter. [Pyatachenko] As is known, budgetary receipts were in line with the structure of the plan for socioeconomic development in 1994 and had to account for about 40 percent of the total annual revenue. It was, therefore, necessary to take advantage of the Supreme Council's permission to grant credits amounting to 10 percent of quarterly expenditure. During the first quarter, the budget received 67.5 trillion karbovantsi [K], including K8 trillion from the National Bank in the form of credits to cover the intra-annual gap between the receipts of revenues and the need to carry out expenditure. In the first quarter, the expenditure constituted K64.1 trillion. Thus, you can see that the revenue was K3 trillion 400 billion greater than the expenditure. [Vlad] Hryhoriy Oleksandrovych, the budget did not receive all those revenues, which had been expected.... [Pyatachenko] The value-added tax came to K12 trillion 96 billion, or, to put it differently, to 110.6 percent of what had been planned. Taxes on the profits of enterprises contributed K13.5 trillion or 121.6 percent of what had been expected. The situation is much worse with regard to the receipts of excise duty. It was expected that K4.3 trillion would be contributed, but only 1.6 trillion (36.5 percent of plan) was recorded. This is due to the fact that we established exceedingly high rates of excise duty on alcoholic beverages, television sets, and a number of other goods. This situation will change in the second quarter, because the rates have been lowered. The state must regain its lost ranking in product sales. Besides, we received more taxes on citizens' profits than had been planned, despite the considerable decline in production. [Vlad] Not only in terms of prices, but also in terms of commodities.... [Pyatachenko] In terms of prices, everything is fine because the price factor has played its role, as well as the payment of much higher wages than planned, but you are, indeed, right about the commodities. [Vlad] In the first quarter, the profit from the external economic activity was to amount K6 trillion, but in fact.... [Pyatachenko] K2.4 trillion, or 40 percent. Besides, the budget only received 10 percent of the capital earned through implementing the privatization program. [Vlad] Despite the more or less satisfactory statistics you are quoting, the financing, on the part of the state, of the social sphere in the first quarter seems not to have stood up to criticism.... [Pyatachenko] We planned to allocate K13.3 trillion for the social protection of the population, but only allocated K7.9 trillion. Support for the state's sociocultural institutions was somewhat better.... [Vlad] What did defense industry expenditures amount to in the first quarter? [Pyatachenko] It was expected that we would remit K4.7 trillion, but, in fact, it received only K2.4 trillion. [Vlad] What can you say about crediting industrial enterprises from the budget? [Pyatachenko] In order to give support to those enterprises that underwent a profound payments crisis, the National Bank issued a credit of K11 trillion for three months at an interest rate of 120 percent. However, this is outside the budget. [Vlad] Everything that the budget failed to finance in the first quarter has already gone down the drain? Well, inflation.... [Pyatachenko] What we could not do for lack of time, we will catch up with in the second and third quarters. [Vlad] Hryhoriy Oleksandrovych, in the past, budget expenditure was covered at the expense of credits and the credits -- at the expense of budget receipts. Is this tactic undergoing a change? [Pyatachenko] A radical change. This is already a strategy, rather than a tactic. We no longer grant credits. Financing from the budget is done exclusively within the limits of receipts. The National Bank's emission is in conformity with the "ceiling" of the increase in the gross domestic product.
