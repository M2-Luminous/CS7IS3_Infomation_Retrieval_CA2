Even now, this situation has not been alleviated. In some districts, enterprises have stopped production completely or partially, because they have no money to buy raw materials or pay wages. We must conscientiously study and analyze this situation. Why Are Circulating Funds for Industry Insufficient The issue of insufficient circulating funds for industry is really something which has cropped up in the course of exercising the macro-economic control. However, we should point out that due to the high rate of growth of our national economy, this phenomenon had actually appeared since the first half of 1993. The macro-economic control and the tightening of the money supply have aggravated this situation. The high growth rate of the national economy demands even more circulating funds for industry. 1. According to an analysis, the amount of investments in fixed assets was more than 700 billion yuan in 1992 and 1.1 trillion yuan in 1993 of which the portion of projects completed and went into operation cost about one trillion yuan. The minimum circulating funds needed was 100 million yuan. Under ordinary conditions, the amount of circulating funds needed was about 30 percent of the fixed assets. Therefore, the amount of circulating funds needed to buy new equipment for production would be approximately 100 to 300 billion yuan. 2. The amount of loans used as circulating funds for industry totalled 1.5 trillion yuan at the end of 1992, and the total industrial output value rose by more than 20 percent. Thus, there is a need to increase the amount of circulating funds for industry by 300 billion yuan. 3. The prices of industrial raw materials have increased. According to statistics compiled, the prices of capital goods have increased by 30 percent, and the cost of investment by 40 percent. On the basis of the price increases of capital goods, we need to duly increase the amount of circulating funds by 450 billion yuan. Due to the high rate of growth and the decontrol of the prices of capital goods, the amount of circulating funds needed would exceed one trillion yuan, of which tens of billion yuan are needed in support of national construction projects. It is precisely for this reason that from October 1993, the specialized banks had poured capital into industrial enterprises in the form of loans and in other forms, while the central bank had helped the specialized banks in doing refinancing. Although the reserve ratio of the specialized banks on their deposits rose from approximately 1 percent to 13.9 percent, some of their funds have not been released yet. Nevertheless, we should admit that the banks have truly increased the amount of loans used as circulating funds for industry. Then why is there still a shortage of money on the market? From the aforementioned estimates, we should realize that due to the rapid rate of growth of the industrial output value and the acceleration of the price reform, we inevitably need a large amount of circulating funds. In seeking a high rate of growth, we must pour in a large amount of capital and fixed assets. Without money, we are unable to develop our economy. We must also pay a price for the pricing reform and expand the supply of circulating funds for industry. Right now, many of the state-owned industrial enterprises in China still remain on the track of planned economy. Their efficiency is still quite low. It is difficult for the whole society to keep pace with the excessively high rate of growth with its current accumulation. This would inevitably cause inflation and price increases, and make factories pay more for their raw materials. From this, we can see that we actually need and can achieve a higher rate of growth in the development of our economy, but the rate of growth is still dependent on the monetary and material supplies, and the amount of material supplies (including those additionally produced and those imported from abroad) is still determined by the amount of available funds (including Renminbi and foreign exchange). To believe that the rate of growth should be as high as possible without taking into consideration the amount of available funds and that even if inflation swells, it will not affect the rate of growth is an unrealistic idea. How To Tackle Issues Regarding Shortage of Circulating Funds for Industry According to a bank survey, the reasons causing shortage of circulating funds for industry are as follows: 1. Some of the enterprises in the fields of textile, coal and chemicals are not doing well in selling their main products and they have a large stockpile of manufactured goods. They owe others a great deal of money, while others also owe them a great amount of money. No matter the money is easy or tight, the enterprises have little circulating funds. 2. Enterprises recklessly raised funds and borrowed money, and there is always a constant flow of money out of the district, causing a shortage of funds in a certain district. 3. Enterprises have insufficient circulating funds. Ten percent of the 5,000 large- and medium-sized enterprises fail to maintain a definite percentage between their circulating funds and their total capital, while 20 percent of them fail to maintain a fixed amount of circulating funds. The situation in smaller enterprises is even worse. They mainly rely on bank loans. Once the bank tightens the money supply, they are in trouble. 4. A part of the circulating funds is used as investments in fixed assets. When enterprises have no money to develop technical innovations, they use circulating funds to do so. 5. Enterprises continue to manufacture slow-moving products. 6. Enterprises owe each other more and more money. This situation is worse in the fields of machine-building, building materials and iron and steel industry. It is mainly because of investment curtailment and lack of construction funds. The aforementioned examples indicate that shortage of circulating funds for industry has existed long time ago. it is main because of the fact that enterprises' tax burdens have already accounted for 90 percent of their net revenue (or the total amount of profits and taxes). This percentage may reach 94 percent for some large enterprises. Enterprises have lost their function for self-accumulation. Meanwhile, the financial authorities have also stopped appropriating any fixed amount of circulating funds for enterprises. Nor would they allocate funds to help enterprises develop technical innovations. Enterprises have no accumulations of their own, and they are unable to develop technical innovations without money. Naturally their products will become unmarketable. Such enterprises cannot compete with their counterparts which are not state-owned. When our national economy was rapidly growing in 1992 and 1993, signs of reckless fund raising and money borrowing and illegal use of circulating funds to develop technical innovations had cropped up. After China exercised the macro-economic control, the phenomenon of chain debts surfaced among enterprises. Therefore, the basic contradiction is the fact that our state-owned industrial enterprises are still on the track of planned economy, while they are losing their abilities for self-accumulation and self-development. Whenever the bank tightens the money supply, there will be an even greater shortage of funds. Right now, state-owned enterprises are slow in carrying out reform and they lack vitality. This is the main reason why they are short of funds. The state-owned enterprises are unable to keep pace with the rapid development of our national economy. They can neither advance nor retreat. To earnestly reform the mechanism of state-owned enterprises, help them reduce their tax burdens and truly invigorate them is the only way to fundamentally tackle the issue of money shortage for the enterprises.
