Thus far, the number of cultural markets has developed to 19,581 in the province. These markets have played a positive role in building the socialist spiritual civilization, in meeting the ever-growing demands of the masses on cultural life, in settling down the surplus work force in society, and in increasing financial revenues of localities. However, along with the constant development of cultural market, some problems have been revealed, and some unhealthy articles have been put on market for sale, thus polluting and corrupting social environment and social atmosphere and arousing the broad masses of the people to great indignation. Major indicators are: First, the cultural market has been flooded with illegal publications. Over the past two years, the Shenyang city cultural market administration department alone has ferreted out 120,000 copies of illegal books and periodicals of more than 300 categories. Second, the situation of publicly showing obscene video tapes has gained ground. Of the 2,000-odd video tape projection units in the province, a considerably great number of them are very poorly equipped. To pander to low tastes of some persons in society, these units have publicly projected the low-class films of Hong Kong and Taiwan and even the obscene video tapes of foreign countries. Third, some ballrooms have become the medium for prostitution and visits to whores. A few ballrooms have even employed young women to specially entertain the guests. In addition, the illegal running of video game recreation places and the confusion in performing market have also greatly jeopardized the society. For this reason, governments at all levels should attach importance to building up the cultural market, strengthen the control over the market, and persist in the principles of advocating the healthy ones, permitting the harmless ones, resisting the vulgar ones, banning the obscene ones, and dealing blows to the reactionary ones. In addition, governments at all levels should conduct an all-round inspection and rectification of the cultural market, ban all unhealthy cultural places, and develop and support healthy cultural places. At the same time, governments should accelerate the establishment of the rules and regulations on management of the cultural market, rapidly build the ranks of workers of cultural market management organs, and improve the level of management of cultural market.
