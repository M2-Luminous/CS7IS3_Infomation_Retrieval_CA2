China's endeavor to build a socialist market economy has yielded great success, the president said a press conference here today. He noted that China is not only one of Peru's most important trade partners, but also its third largest foreign investor. The current visit has enabled him to have a first-hand knowledge of the great achievements of his host country, said Fujimori, whose last trip here was made three years ago. China's successes would not have been achieved without the political system and the democratic form that conform to its own national conditions, he said. No matter what a political system or democratic form is called, it is crucial that they should fall in line with the conditions of that country, he stressed. Referring to Peru's experience, Fujimori said that the sort of democracy and political system Peru once inherited from the West had, in fact, infringed upon human rights and brought about disasters to the people and their nation. Since 1992, he said, Peru has been trying to build a political system that best suits its own national conditions. As a result, the economy has recovered, foreign exchanges increased and inflation effectively curbed, he said. No country should be allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, he said, adding that only when countries respect each other, can people develop economy, safeguard world peace and build up a new world order.
