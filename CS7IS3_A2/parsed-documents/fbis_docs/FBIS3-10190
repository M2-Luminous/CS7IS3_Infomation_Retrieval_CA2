The branch will be 360 km long, stretching between Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte. The pipeline's construction and the supply of steel pipes will cost $44 million. According to the state-owned petroleum enterprise Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], the gas pipeline, whose construction will take 14 months and will mobilize about 1,000 technicians and workers, will allow during its initial phase the transport of 640,000 cubic meters of natural gas per day, and 1.7 million cubic meters by the turn of this century. According to the bilateral agreements, as of 1997 Bolivia will supply to Brazil about 8 million cubic meters of natural gas from Bolivian gas reserves. It is necessary, however, to build a 2,333 km pipeline to carry the gas from the Bolivian town of Rio Grande to the city of Campinas in Sao Paulo State. Brazil will build a domestic network to distribute the gas in those states that are interested in purchasing it, such as Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul.
