Bursting Buds and Coup Rumors": "Cui Bono?"] [Text] Sergey Yushenkov (State Duma deputy): The destabilization of society currently benefits those who one way or another found themselves excluded from the State Duma on 12 December. They are dreaming of revenge following the October events. I wish to say that dozens of similar coup theories are currently in circulation. Judge for yourself: Why would Chernomyrdin want a coup when he has more power than anyone else in the country? As for Skokov, he's a busted flush.... And in general the very selection of "coup participants" is so inconsistent! When I heard about this I went up to Poltoranin and said: "How could you dare to prepare such a coup?" He laughed: "If I'd been doing the organizing I'd have done it properly...." Sergey Shakhray (Russian federation minister): I'm inclined to regard this as well-organized disinformation. Skillfully done, but not corresponding to reality. I think that the main purpose of the "leak" is to increase the president's suspicion toward his last political support (representatives of virtually all political forces have been lumped together in the circle of "conspirators") and bring discord into their relationship. Another purpose is to stir up society and clear the way in the public mind for a third force. The result has been achieved. It was professionally done -- you can sense the hand of the Security Ministry or the Main Intelligence Directorate. In my view the president himself has no interest in such a "leak." Stop Press: KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA sources in the White House have informed us that, according to the official story, the White House telephones are silent because of repairmen who inadvertently broke a cable. In their view it will take another two days to repair the line.
