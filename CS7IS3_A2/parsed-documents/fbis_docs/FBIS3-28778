"The U.S. has lately stiffened its attitude to seek numeral targets in the talks, because the talks are reaching a crucial point," said Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, [MITI] after the day's ad hoc cabinet meeting. Japan, for its part, remains opposed to introducing such "numerical" targets to measure progress in opening Japan's markets, he said. "But I believe we cannot afford to cancel everything we have discussed in the talks," Kumagai said, adding the two countries should agree on whatever issues they could. Areas for such partial agreement include simplifying Japan's government procurement procedures and increasing private-level cooperation programs in the respective automotive industries, he suggested. He also said the two countries have discussed in working-level negotiations including in the final accord the opinions of two sides about the numeral targets. Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to leave Thursday for Washington to review progress in the framework talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday.
