"Sincere Arab greetings, "O great Arab leader, I send you my sincerest Arab good wishes and through you to the struggling and mujahid Libyan masses, which today are rallying around you to express their unity and reaffirm their choice and affiliation. "Your voice which reverberated among the Bani Salim masses on 28 jumada al-thani 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 12 December 1993, has been the best expression of the nation's will and its right to life and proof of existence. "Brother leader of the 1 September revolution, "The Arab nation's masses have heard your powerful voice with awareness and heard you reaffirming the unity of its causes and defending them as an integrated whole, even if some rulers do not want that. The Palestinian popular revolution is looking toward you and the stone-throwing children are listening to you attentively. Your reverberating voice comes when the Arab revolution's forces, both Arabists and Islamists, are looking toward Arab Tripoli which is subjected to the ugliest form of blockade by the Western American circles and their tools. Your voice has reaffirmed the originality of the 1 September revolution and the credibility of its leader in order to silence those of the fifth column and the tools of doubt, treachery, and plotting. "Brother leader of the revolution, "It pleases me to reiterate to you, given my position as a fighting soldier affiliated to the nation's pan-Arab revolution and in order to defend the nation's causes, that my comrades and I will always be sincere and faithful soldiers in defense of any part of the greater Arab homeland. "To You, the leader, we send the fragrance of Palestine and the greetings of its children with best and sincerest regards. "Revolution until victory. ""[Signed] Your brother, Abu-Nidal"
