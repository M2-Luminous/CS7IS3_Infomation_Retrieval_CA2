Lawmaking Activity Resumed With New Vigor"] [Text] At the State Duma's new head office (the former building of the USSR State Planning Committee) yesterday, a number of Duma committees that have had time to move there held their meetings. The Legislation and Judicial-Law Reform Committee passed its opinion on the draft federal law "On the Basic Guarantees of Citizens' Electoral Rights," which was discussed by the committee back on 25 April. The opinion says that the draft's content is inconsistent with its name -- in particular, "regarding the extent to which a number of the draft's provisions, for instance, on electoral commissions, are related to the guarantees of citizens' electoral rights." Committee members think it arguable that the electoral commissions should be defined as bodies of state power and the Central Electoral Commission as a federal state body. In the committee's view, the law gives an unreasonably narrow interpretation of citizens' electoral rights, which boil down to the right to elect and to get elected, while the nomination of candidates, the conduct of electoral campaigns, and so forth have been left outside the term. In addition, the draft does not establish an upper age limit upon reaching which the citizen may not get elected. When assessing the document in general, however, the committee proposed that it be submitted to the State Duma for consideration, while at the same time setting up for further work a joint group made up of deputies, Duma committee staffers, and also representatives of the Russian president and the Central Electoral Commission. Having considered the draft federal law "On Making Amendments and Additions to the RSFSR Code on Administrative Law Violations," the Legislation Committee made numerous editorial amendments to it and recommended that the draft be brought in line with the Russian Federation Constitution, after which it should be put before the State Duma Council. The Committee on the Affairs of Public Associations and Religious Organizations was preoccupied with preparations for two roundtables -- 16 May, on the draft law on political parties; and 19 May, on the draft law on trade unions. The roundtables will be attended by representatives of parties and trade union leaders. Yesterday, a commission preparing parliamentary hearings on the threat of fascism in Russia held its meeting at the same committee. The Committee on Information Policy and Communications considered amendments to the Law on Coverage of Government Authorities' Activity by State-Owned Mass Media. According to Igor Yakovenko, a committee member, the law is currently leading in the number of amendments made to it. The committee decided to back only those that eliminate excessive regulation of mass media activity. In addition, the committee elected its representatives -- Igor Yakovenko ("Yabloko") and Valentin Chikin (Communist Party of the Russian Federation) -- to sit on the commission on state support for the mass media at the Russian Press Committee.
