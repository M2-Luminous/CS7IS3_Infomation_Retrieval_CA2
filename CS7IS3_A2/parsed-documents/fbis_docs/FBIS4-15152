Representatives of the Republic of Crimea's presidential administration told UNIAN they have information that the Ukrainian president is preparing a directive introducing a state of emergency in Crimea. Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent on 6 April, Vasyl Rudenko, the official in charge of the Ukrainian president's service for territorial matters, denied rumors of a state of emergency being introduced on the peninsula, said they are totally groundless and are being spread by members of Yuryy Meshkov's team. Vasyl Rudenko also pointed out that a body representing the Ukrainian president was set up in Crimea and that "under the legislation of Ukraine, relations between the autonomous republic and Ukraine are based on the law delimiting powers between their authorities." Interviewed by journalists on the same day, Yevgenyy Saburov, Crimean deputy prime minister, did not rule out a possibility of leaving that post in the situation that was arising. Interviewed by Crimean TV on 5 April, Mykola Mykhalchenko, head of the Ukrainian president's domestic policy service, who now is in Crimea, stated: "Many decrees being passed in Crimea surprise and genuinely distress me. A directive may contain two to three clauses and yet violate not only five to six Ukrainian laws, but also provisions in the Crimean Constitution." This, in his view, is "an example of disrespect for Crimea's own laws and is legal arbitrariness." The head of the Ukrainian president's domestic policy service also said the main task of the newly appointed representative of the Ukrainian president to Crimea would be encouraging political stabilization in the region and harmonizing political and economic relations between the governments of Crimea and Ukraine. "This is a very important task without which things will be bad both for Ukraine and Crimea," Mykola Mykhalchenko added. On 6 April, Crimean President Yuryy Meshkov met Valentyn Nedryhaylo, Ukrainian deputy internal affairs minister, who is on a planned working trip to the peninsula.
