Addressing the closing ceremony, Abulaiti Abudurexiti, Xinjiang Autonomous Regional People's Government chairman, called for seizing the opportunity, opening up wider, and successfully handling foreign affairs work to promote Xinjiang's rapid and highly efficient economic development. He said: Xijiang is located at a hot-point region for attracting foreign funds. It is necessary for foreign affairs departments at all levels to clearly understand this trend, emancipate their minds, boldly blaze new trails, enhance their consciousness of having foreign affairs work serve economic construction, and focus attention on the enthusiasm of all fields of endeavor for contacts with foreign countries. We must make full use of foreign affairs departments' characteristics of having extensive, multiple channels for contacts with foreign countries to vigorously establish links for economic departments. We must step up propaganda abroad to let the world understand Xinjiang. We must improve contacts with Chinese embassies and consulates abroad and strive to win their support and help for Xinjiang's opening up wider and conducting economic activities and trade. We must successfully build and manage ports open to the outside world, strengthen the building of spiritual civilization at these ports, increase their cargo handling capabilities, and guarantee smooth transportation to these ports to provide excellent services for opening up. Xinjiang has established economic, cultural, and other ties with more than 60 countries and regions, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, Japan, the United States, Western European countries, Hong Kong, and Macao. Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: It is necessary for all foreign affairs departments to cement ties with old friends, make more new friends, and establish a reliable network for contacts with foreign countries. While consolidating the existing markets, efforts must be made to expand the share of markets captured in Japan, the United States, Hong Kong, and Central Asia and to vigorously open up new markets in South Asia, the ROK, Russia, Eastern and Western Europe, and West Asia. While attracting foreign funds, we must continue to improve the orientation for industries, treat the new high technology industry and technical transformation of the old enterprises as the focal points for encouraging investments, and pay attention to the percentage of foreign funds that have been remitted to their recipients as well as the quality and efficiency of the utilization of foreign funds. He also stressed: We must open our doors wider to the outside world, successfully attract foreign businessmen and their capital, and strive to make the 1994 Urumqi Trade Fair an even greater success.
