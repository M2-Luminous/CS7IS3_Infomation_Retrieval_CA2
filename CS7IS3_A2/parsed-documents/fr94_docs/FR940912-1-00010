Pin injection or cable bundle testing would be required, but there should be no multi-strike or multi-burst requirement. Cessna proposes that to evaluate the induced effects of lightning to the systems under consideration, the following must be considered: Essential Functions: First Return Stroke Critical Functions: First Return Stroke; Multi-Stroke; Multi-Burst High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) With the trend toward increased power levels from ground based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics systems to HIRF must be established. It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling of electromagnetic energy to cockpit-installed equipment through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis of existing HIRF emitters, the FAA has used criteria for compliance with the HIRF protection special condition shown in paragraphs 1 or 2 below: 1. A mininum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18 GHz. a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe shielding. b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis. 2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated. ␣ 1Frequency 1Peak (V/M) 1Average (V/M) 10 KHz&hyph;100 KHz 50 50 100 KHz&hyph;500 KHz 60 60 500 KHz&hyph;2000 KHz 70 70 2 MHz&hyph;30 MHz 200 200 30 MHz&hyph;70 MHz 30 30 70 MHz&hyph;100 MHz 30 30 100 MHz&hyph;200 MHz 150 33 200 MHz&hyph;400 MHz 70 70 400 MHz&hyph;700 MHz 4,020 935 700 MHz&hyph;1000 MHz 1,700 170 1 GHz&hyph;2 GHz 5,000 990 2 GHz&hyph;4 GHz 6,680 840 4 GHz&hyph;6 GHz 6,850 310 6 GHz&hyph;8 GHz 3,600 670 8 GHz&hyph;12 GHz 3,500 1,270 12 GHz&hyph;18 GHz 3,500 360 18 GHz&hyph;40 GHz 2,100 750
