The radio will temporarily transmit six to eight hours daily and television about four hours daily. Engineer Hisham Makki, general coordinator of radio and television in the Gaza Strip, said Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has agreed to a request by Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, official in charge of the radio and television corporation, to use the Palestinian police building as a temporary office for the corporation. He added that one temporary studio for radio transmissions and another for the production of light television programs are being built in coordination with the Jericho municipality. He said Abu-'Ayyash has received donations from Arab and foreign countries in the form of equipment and funds. Germany, he said, offered to build a small studio and to pay the salaries of 15-30 persons working in it for one year. In a statement to QUDS PRESS, Makki, who had earlier worked for television stations in Jordan, Abu Dhabi, and Morocco, said experimental transmissions will begin on 1 July. He added that a questionnaire has been distributed among the citizens in the occupied Arab territories to determine transmission times suitable for them. He said work at the radio and television corporation will be governed by the need to safeguard principles, ethics, religion, and the Islamic creed. He added: The television will be the property of all the Palestinian people, as well as their mirror. It will not belong to any party and will be open for participation by all qualified and experienced parties. He said cultural, social, and political programs, as well as family programs and everything that pertains to the Palestinian affairs will be presented. Makki said he intends to prepare a program called "The Vigil Eye" to be presented by the public relations and moral guidance department of the Palestinian national security forces. The program will deal with police news and include reportage on their work as well as interviews. It will also deal with the conditions of prisoners. He emphasized that Palestinian television, in cooperation with the second channel of the French television, will cover the special occasion of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule areas, under the name of the Palestinian Radio and Television Corporation.
