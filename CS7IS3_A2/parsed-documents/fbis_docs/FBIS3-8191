In an interview in Prague on Thursday afternoon [3 March], he was taken aback by the postponement of the decision on a loan of the U.S. ExIm Bank valued at billions [currency not specified] for the completion of Temelin [nuclear power plant]. "I have not yet heard that. This is questionable information," said the Czech prime minister (who speaks fluent German and, of course, English). Now the crisis between Prague and Vienna has become even further aggravated. Klaus, an unreserved advocate of the market economy, does not understand why the Austrians and his counterpart, Vranitzky, want to torpedo a project that he regards as necessary for the--very good--economic development of the Czech Republic. Apparently, the Austrian intervention in Washington has now been temporarily successful after all. This provoked a harsh reaction from Klaus: "Whether these are three or eight deputies out of 480--this is not enough for me. This is also not enough for me after such aggressiveness from the Austrian side." "This Austrian reaction is really impossible for me. The completion of Temelin is absolutely necessary for us, and all reasonable Austrians within and outside the government know that. Nevertheless, they are playing this card for the election campaign." But is the government not making allowances for a real concern of the population? "As it happened, I was skiing in St. Anton, and I saw an opinion poll on ORF, according to which the three most important topics for the Austrians are pensions, full employment, and crime, but not Temelin. I do not believe that Temelin is something that the Austrians have deep in their heart. It is rather a political matter and is connected with the elections." But what about relations between the Czech Republic and Austria? "Normal daily relations between Austria and the Czech Republic, between hundreds, thousands, and millions of people, will continue completely normally, without any deterioration, which may only take place on a large-scale political level, where the political card is played." It is often heard from the Czechs that the Austrians want to keep them in tutelage. "This is not a question of pride; it is a question of wrong arguments on the Austrian side. What alternative have you proposed to us? You proposed investments for your firms, which are often owned by the state and subsidized (transformation into gas power plants--the editors). This was not a gift; it was only state-organized lobbying for Austrian investments in our country. Austria's proposals are not so innocent, and the Austrian politicians should not pretend to be so innocent." Should Austria have been more tactful? "The question is put in an absolutely wrong way. The construction work in Temelin has already progressed very far. The decision was not new, and this should be taken into account. The other question is: The ecological catastrophe for us is northern Bohemia, with the coal power plants, not southern Bohemia, with nuclear power." It is said in Austria that it is intended to export electricity from Temelin in order to improve the Czech balance of payments? "We do not need to improve the balance of payments. It is active. We told Austrian politicians a hundred times--no, we are not building Temelin for electricity exports--but no one wants to hear or understand that." Apparently Vaclav Klaus really feels misunderstood. What is his wish for relations with Austria? The answer is characteristic of this strict liberal: "We are moving very quickly to a free society, a free market economy, and an open society. Therefore, we expect the same of others who had the advantage that they did not have to live under communism for 40 years. I mean opening up not only in the field of economy but also in a wider sense."
