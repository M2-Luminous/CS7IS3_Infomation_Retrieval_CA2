The United States always confronts Sudan at international forums. Indeed, it endorses the Sudanese statement opposing the government. The question is: What does the United States want from Sudan? Are there any non-Sudanese forces behind the hardline U.S. stand toward the Sudanese Government? [Sabdarat] First of all, the United States wants Sudan to abandon its cultural awakening plan. After the collapse of the socialist camp, the United States now believes that it is a real danger to have Islam as the second major power after the United States. In other words, the United States believes that the power of Islam and Muslims cannot but be the second major power. Therefore, it is in principle against Islam. In fact, the United States is against religions because its real religion is materialism. So, it does not want Islam to be the alternative to the capitalist collapse, which will eventually afflict the Western camp as it afflicted the socialist camp. The United States believes that Sudan is the model for a new Islamic state, one that is different from those Islamic states in which Islam is a mere facade -- just the way the United States wants it to be. Therefore, killing this model has become the main concern not only of the United States but also of Britain, which is more hostile, and of Western countries, in general. I believe that the issue of Bosnia is an example of this inclination. These Western countries do not at all want the establishment of a fully Islamic state in the middle of Europe. They also do not want an Islamic state in the middle of Africa or the Middle East or in strategic places anywhere in the world. Hence, the United States' hostility toward Sudan does not target a certain party, it is a continuous and blatant hostility toward Islam. It is also a conflict of cultures. This is a well known conflict, even though it remained hidden in many occasions. However, it now began to emerge in its real blatant form. [Bakhit] How do you explain the stand of Aldo Ajo Deng, former deputy speaker of the parliament, in terms of seeking political asylum in Britain and in terms of joining the opposition? [Sabdarat] I believe that Aldo Ajo became convinced that his generation has no place in Sudan after he saw that rulers of Sudanese regions and commissioners comprise a new generation. He saw that his generation, which created part of the Sudanese movement, has a weak future. Moreover, he had an ambition of becoming the vice president. However, he found out that a young man from the new generation would take that position. Then, he and others were subject to many temptations. He believed other people's talk about an approaching end to this regime. He succumbed to pressures and followed the road he is on now. [Bakhit] What are your expectations about the talks to achieve peace? [Sabdarat] I always believe that sitting at a dialogue table is a sound start. However, it is not always certain that those who sit around this table will end up achieving peace. The available facts confirm that the rebel movement has no alternative to dialogue. After it has been encircled, the rebel movement cannot achieve any goal on the military level. Practically, the movement cannot depend on the outside world in order to separate the south because this issue is also an issue of war. The separation of southern Sudan cannot be achieved by a UN decision. Even if the United Nations and the entire world imposed this, the south would remain part of Sudan. Sudan has sacrificed thousands of martyrs for the sake of maintaining its unity. The issue remains inflamed and the war continues. Therefore, I believe that the movement is at its weakest and its only means of saving face is peace. This is especially true since the model we are establishing now is a practical model. We are making real peace on the ground in Bahr al-Ghazal, the Upper Nile, and vast parts of Sudan's Equatoria. We are doing so through development and work so that the model of peace inside Sudan will be that of real peace. I believe that if the rebel movement understands these facts, peace can be achieved. [Bakhit] However, the government has constants that cannot be shaken and so does the rebel movement. The question is: How can peace be achieved? Don't you think that the issue will turn into a useless dialogue? [Sabdarat] First of all, the rebel movement does not have any constants. At one time, it talked about a federation, then about a confederation, and later about self-determination (separation). Now, it is talking about sharing authority and wealth. Hence, there constants are tactical. We will not change our own constants, which stipulate that Sudan is one united country and that a federation is the ideal model for rule in Sudan. Therefore, I believe that when the rebel movement demands its right to self-determination, it is asking for the maximum in order to achieve the minimum of what it wants. [Bakhit] A short time ago, the government announced that two foreign military aircraft penetrated Sudan's airspace, What is the story behind this? In other words, how true is this? [Sabdarat] The truth is that two warplanes flying at an altitude parallel to that of civil airplanes were monitored. Some quarters and Arab and foreign ambassadors were informed about this. There is an ongoing investigation to find out the identity of these warplanes and their objectives. [passage omitted]
