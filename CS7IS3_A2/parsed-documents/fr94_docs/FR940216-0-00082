FR940216-0-00082 FR940216-0-00010 One commenter recommended that EPA evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this program separately for small and large refiners, and also that EPA consider granting small refiners more time to comply with the requirements (as is allowed by California for California reformulated gasoline). The California reformulated gasoline program requires all refiners selling gasoline in the state to produce reformulated gasoline, and thus does not afford any flexibility to refiners, large or small. The federal RFG program, however, does not require 100% production of RFG in any region, nor does it require that every refiner produce RFG. Hence, small refiners can choose not to produce RFG and instead supply conventional gasoline if the costs of complying with the program are too burdensome. For those small refiners electing to produce RFG, the option to select between per gallon and averaging standards, as well as the ability to set their own baselines, gives them flexibility to meet the standards in the manner that is most cost effective for them. Furthermore, the enforcement structure is based on a single set of standards for Phase II RFG. Allowing some refiners to comply with a different set of standards would require additional and more complicated enforcement provisions, and could jeopardize the fungibility of reformulated gasolines. 17 Since EPA believes that the existing program provides sufficient flexibility to small refiners, there is no need to pursue multiple enforcement programs. See section XV for additional discussion of the impact of this rule on small refiners. 17 For Phase I RFG, the standards are set at the statutory minimum for both VOCs and toxics. EPA could not lawfully allow small refiners less stringent standards or more time to comply with the Phase I standards. b. Fuel Parameter Control Costs. Fuel parameter control costs and interrelationships between fuel parameters are integral parts in the evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of Phase II RFG controls. The costs and interrelationships used to develop the VOC and toxics standards were estimated from the results of refinery modeling performed by Bonner and Moore Management Science, 18 by Turner, Mason, and Co. for the Auto-Oil Air Quality Improvement Research Program; 19 by Turner, Mason, and Co. for the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA); 20 and by EPA in-house (using the Bonner and Moore refinery model). 21 EPA used these regional refinery models to estimate the cost and interrelationships of various fuel parameter controls. The final average nationwide costs were obtained by weighing the regional values by the estimated fraction of total reformulated gasoline (RFG) production in each region. 18 Bonner and Moore Management Science, ``Study of the Effects of Fuel Parameter Changes on the Cost of Producing Reformulated Gasoline,'' Prepared for EPA under contract through Southwest Research Institute and the National Institute for Petroleum and Energy Research. This data, as well as data generated by EPA in-house, was made available to the public through the following document: ``DOE and API Phase II Cost Estimates,'' EPA Memorandum from Lester Wyborny, FSSB, to the Air Docket, November 4, 1993. 19 ``Costs of Alternate Gasoline Reformulations, Results of U.S. Refining Study,'' Turner, Mason & Co. for the Economics Committee of the Auto/Oil Air Quality Improvement Research Program, April 1992. 20 ``WSPA Study of the Cost Impacts of Potential CARB Phase 2 Gasoline Regulations,'' Turner Mason & Company for the Western States Petroleum Association, November 18, 1993. 21 ``Aromatics and E200 Reformulation Costs,'' Memorandum from Lester Wyborny, EPA, to the Air Docket, December 10, 1993. Many comments were received on the costs used in the proposal. Some of these comments, and EPA's response, are summarized here, while the RIA contains a complete discussion and analysis of the comments received. Several commenters questioned the appropriateness of using independent refinery models to generate costs for control of individual parameters. In addition, they questioned the aggregation of results from regional models to generate national average costs, and recommended instead using a model from the region likely to realize the highest costs for producing reformulated gasoline (PADD 1). While using regional models to estimate national average costs requires an acknowledgment of the inherent limitations in such models, EPA believes that it is appropriate to use them for the purpose of determining the costs to produce reformulated gasoline. The limitations and assumptions made in using the refinery models and the results of this analysis are discussed in detail in the RIA. The manufacturing cost of producing gasoline is the sum of the capital recovery cost and the operating costs, adjusted for changes in the energy content of the fuel (to represent consistent fuel economy). VOC control is mandated only during the high ozone season, and thus all costs were allocated to the high ozone season in the refinery modeling work. In contrast to VOC control, toxics control and the benefits from reductions in toxics emissions occur year-round. Although the costs of toxics control should be determined on an annual basis, EPA used the same costs that were used for the VOC analysis, since it had been determined in the RIA (and supported by many comments received) that additional toxics control would be highly cost-ineffective. The level of either VOC or toxics control that is cost effective is not greatly affected by the accuracy of the costs, due to the magnitude of reductions achieved. Some comments received on the proposal raised the concern that this method of determining costs did not accurately reflect all of the costs of the program, since the ``compliance costs'' for record keeping and enforcement, as well as costs incurred by pipelines or other entities, were not included. While it is true that ``compliance costs'' will be incurred as a result of the reporting and enforcement requirements of Phase II RFG, EPA does not anticipate the costs to be greater than those incurred by the Phase I RFG program. Refiners will already be supplying the information required by EPA for Phase I, and will continue to do so under Phase II. Hence, there is no additional cost of compliance to add to the costs of Phase II RFG. Other factors affecting incremental fuel parameter control costs include the amount of reformulated gasoline produced by the refinery and the effects of fuel parameter changes on fuel economy. Because producing reformulated gasoline reduces flexibility in refinery operations, the cost of producing such fuels increases with the amount of reformulated gasoline that is produced in a given refinery. In this analysis, EPA used a scenario of RFG production based on participation in the reformulated gasoline program by the nine mandated areas, those areas which had opted into the program as of August 14, 1993 (the close of the comment period on the proposal), the entire Northeast Ozone Transport Region (including both attainment and nonattainment areas), and all other ozone nonattainment areas. This scenario was chosen to represent the Phase II RFG program that would result if all eligible areas opted into the program. Since the Ozone Transport Commission has not announced plans to opt-in to the RFG program, and the only additional nonattainment areas that have opted into the program since August 14 are those located in Kentucky, the volume of RFG production used for this analysis is overstated by about 20 percentage points. As a result, the cost estimates are higher than will likely be experienced, since use of RFG in the entire Northeast would severely limit refinery production in that region, incurring somewhat higher costs to individual refiners, particularly to those refiners which for economic reasons would choose not to produce RFG and merely continue producing conventional fuel. EPA evaluated the costs for incremental control levels for a variety of fuel parameters. This evaluation revealed that the greater the level of control, the higher the costs of achieving that level. Complete information on the development of the individual parameter costs is provided in the RIA. Several comments were received questioning the validity of evaluating the cost-effectiveness of Phase II RFG on a parameter by parameter basis. The recommended alternative was to evaluate the cost of producing a gasoline meeting the standards for a variety of refinery configurations, and to use this information to determine the cost-effectiveness of the standard. As explained in the RIA, EPA determined that it was appropriate to evaluate cost-effectiveness on an incremental basis to properly compare fuel controls to other forms of emission control.
