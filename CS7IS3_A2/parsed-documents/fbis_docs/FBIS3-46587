But the jury is still out on whether the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has developed a bite to match its bark. With recent high-profile actions against bid-rigging and cartels, including last year's first criminal convictions in 17 years, even adversaries acknowledge progress. "I remember people saying the FTC is a dog that doesn't bite," says a U.S. official involved with Japan. "They're certainly biting now." But the official quickly sounds Washington's undimmed cry -- "the antimonopoly law has to be enforced in a stronger way." Indeed, the head of the commission, while highlighting the FTC's recently beefed-up powers and repeating his vows to crack down harder, stops short of saying the commission's work will begin to reduce monopolistic practices in Japan in 1994. "I'd like to hope so. That's my wish," says a grave-faced Masami Kogayu, the FTC's chairman. "But I am not optimistic." Despite the commission's recent attention, "there may be enterprises or sectors that will not heed the antimonopoly law, through misunderstanding or overconfidence," he says, the former vice finance minister choosing his words precisely as he sits bolt upright in a low-slung chair in his broad, sparse office. In an interview in Tokyo's Kasumigaseki government district and briefing Japanese reporters, Kogayu spells out recent FTC actions, defends antitrust enforcement and asks observers to stay tuned. In mid-December, ruling on an indictment sought by the FTC, the Tokyo high court convicted four major printing companies of bid-ridding contracts to make peel-off stickers for pension notification cards. It fined each company 4 million yen. Seven months earlier, the court found eight makers of plastic food wrap guilty of price-fixing, fining them 6 million to 8 million yen each in Japan's first criminal antitrust action since a mid-1970s oil cartel case. Although "it's a little bit too early to tell," the two cases "are probably an indication of a new trend in antitrust enforcement by way of criminal enforcement," says trade law expert Mitsuo Matsushita, a Tokyo University law professor. Formal actions, including the rare criminal indictments, rose from seven in fiscal 1989 to 37 in fiscal 1992. Through December, the commission took 16 actions in the year starting last April but with seasonal disparities the fiscal 1993 count may exceed the previous year's, Kogayu says. Japan's antitrust policy, more carrot than stick, "heavily relies on a more informal enforcement, guidance and so forth," that can mount to some 800 cases in a year, Matsushita says. But that's just what irks some foreign companies. "Lack of vigorous application of the antimonopoly law and ambiguous explanations by the Fair Trade Commission for pressing or not pressing certain cases" block foreign would-be competitors unfairly, the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan said in its 1993 white paper on trade. "This selective application of antimonopoly statutes is often seen as preventing full access to Japan's complex distribution system," the report says. Washington is asking the FTC to study several business sectors, a senior U.S. trade official says, adding U.S. proposals in bilateral talks "focus on competition policy and enforcement of the antimonopoly act." Kogayu notes that the FTC has vowed to step up indictments. Its enforcement of the antimonopoly law, enacted in the wake of World War II, "does not stop at just inflicting an extremely severe burden on business violators, it is very closely linked with a deterrent effect," he says. By far the most common formal action is a warning, accompanied by what Kogayu calls a uniquely Japanese enforcement tool -- automatic surcharges on the portion of sales that the FTC judges to be ill-gotten. In the last two years, the Diet has raised the surcharge rate and boosted the maximum fine for criminal antimonopoly law violations by 20 times to 100 million yen. Critics say an FTC study group watered down its original plan to recommend even stiffer fines and Kogayu acknowledges that the maximum is about one-tenth that under U.S. antitrust law. But he stresses the FTC's panoply of fines and surcharges, its commitment in principle to supply some documents to plaintiffs in civil suits and the effect of bad publicity on offenders. "Evaluated in total, the deterrent effect against violators of Japan's antimonopoly law is absolutely not less than that of America or Europe," Kogayu says. "I think it is by no means inferior." He also points to action on other fronts. Since their 1965 peak of 1,079, the number of cartels exempted from the antimonopoly law has been squeezed to 71 and the FTC is requiring the remainder to show proof why they too should not be eliminated, Kogayu says. In November, the FTC searched the offices of such leading electronics makers as Sony Corp. and Toshiba Corp., seeking evidence of bid-rigging for giant video screens. Commission investigators also searched Shiseido Co. On suspicion it illegally forced retailers not to discount its cosmetics. "Our tools have been strengthened and we have just begun using them," Kogayu says. "Please watch our actions. The results are now coming out."
