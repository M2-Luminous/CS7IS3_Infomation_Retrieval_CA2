In principle, this new round of talks, recently described by Economy Minister Mr. Mourad Benachenhou as an occasion for real negotiations, is expected to conclude the two consultative rounds started since the inauguration of Mr. Redha Malek's government last September on a rigorous financial policy that Algeria should adopt if it wanted to secure support from the international financial community. The signing this month of a letter of intent, i.e. a document in which the authorities present the program of economic reforms for the coming years, is a matter on which Algeria is pinning a great deal of hope as the sole means of cutting the payment of its debts so as to start economic revival. The economy minister did state to THE WASHINGTON POST three days ago that there was no other way if we wanted to avoid a rise in inflation and a total collapse of the economic system. This type of agreement with the IMF imposes, in return for the rescheduling of debts, a series of conditions which have adverse effects at the social level. But Algeria hopes to secure a sort of special treatment, taking into consideration the political circumstances the country is going through. In this respect, Benachenhou expressed a great confidence as he stated in Algiers that the file of negotiations was under control, and the government was trying to persuade the IMF to take into account the exceptional situation in Algeria. He had also already stated at the beginning of the year: we will be negotiating firmly with the IMF to arrive at a harmonious financing program without overlooking social repercussions.
