That has created anxiety that the modernization projects for the Turkish Armed Forces may be delayed. In fact, the contracting for several projects has been postponed. The project for the production of F-16 aircraft was the first to be affected by the financial crisis. The Turkish Defense Fund, which was established by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Turkey after the Gulf War was to have been used for the production of 160 F-16 aircraft. Turkey's share in the fund, which totals approximately $3.5 billion, is $500 million. Turkey did not find it difficult to contribute $100 million to that fund before the value of the Turkish lira against the dollar fell. However, Ankara is now worried about how to fulfill the remaining part of its obligation, which totals $400 million. The effort made to create an annual source for 50 million Turkish lira for the installments Turkey has to pay to the fund has not yielded results because the Defense Industry Executive Committee, which is chaired by Prime Minister Ciller, has been unable to meet. Meanwhile, it has been reported that several of the delayed contracts have been shelved. Those that are expected to be suspended are: 1. Modernization of F-5 and F-4 aircraft. Many of Turkey's F-5 and F-4 aircraft were to have been modernized. The modernization of each of Turkey's F-5 and F-4 aircraft will cost $3 million and $700 million respectively. 2. Multiple rocket launchers. Turkey purchased 12 multiple rocket launchers in the past. It received an offer by the manufacturing firm for another 24 launchers. 3. Naval helicopters. The purchase of four naval helicopters, which the naval forces have asked for, is another project that has been affected by the decrease in the value of the Turkish lira against the U.S. dollar. 4. Minesweepers. A decision was made to purchase six minesweepers in 1989. Offers were made to Turkey by several firms. It has been reported that the project will cost approximately $1 billion. 5. Antiaircraft fire control systems. Several firms offered to sell 35-mm automatic antiaircraft fire control systems to Turkey at the end of 1991. However, Ankara asked for offers on a new list of requirements that was drawn up by the General Staff. 6. Sikorsky helicopters. An effort is being made to find a source of $500 million for 50 Sikorsky helicopters. Plans have been made to have them manufactured in Turkey. However, it has been reported that the project will be delayed until 1995. 7. Border security. The establishment of "physical security barriers" on Turkey's eastern and southeastern border is another defense project that has been affected by the decrease in the value of the Turkish lira against the dollar. The physical barriers are required for obstructing the infiltration of Workers Party of Kurdistan militants into Turkey. The project required an allocation of 4 trillion Turkish lira in 1994. Meanwhile, the fate of the project for unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, which will contribute toward the maintenance of border security, has also been linked to the situation of the Turkish lira against the U.S. dollar. The Turkish Space and Aviation Industry has manufactured and successfully tested several of these aircraft.
