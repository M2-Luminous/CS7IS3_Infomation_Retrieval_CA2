They said the heaviest Moslem attacks in the past 24 hours were in the areas of Doboj, Mt. Ozren in northern Bosnia and Mt. Vlasic in the central part of that former Yugoslav republic. Early on Monday, Moslems opened artillery fire on Doboj, a strategically important Serb town in the Bosna River valley, with sporadic mortar shellings of Serb positions in the areas of Trebava, Mt. Ozren, Teslic and Gradacac around Doboj. Moslems also continued attacks on Serb positions and settlements near the Serb town of Brcko on the Sava River. Moslems are still launching infantry attacks on Serb settlements of Ilidza, Nedzarici and Ilijas in the Sarajevo area, Bosnian Serb Army sources said. Bosnian Croats violated the ceasefire in the area of the Croat enclave of Orasje in northern Bosnia, where combined Bosnian Croat and Croatian Army troops are firing at Serb positions from small arms as well as anti-aircraft guns and mortars. Croats also renewed attacks in the area between Dubrovnik and the Serb town of Trebinje in the Dubrovnik hinterland in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina.
