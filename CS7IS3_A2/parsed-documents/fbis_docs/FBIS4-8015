On behalf of the government, he made a brief farewell speech, and stressed that, although it is debated today, the past four years will go down in history as an epoch-making era. "These four years characterize the change in era, the change in approach, in other words, the change in political system. "Although law-making work will cease for now, the country must be governed. The government considers it its fundamental task to create the conditions needed for an honest election and the creation of a parliament that accords to the will of the public. "The government also considers it its obligation to give an account of its work over the past four years to the nation, for the first time in decades," the Prime Minister said.
