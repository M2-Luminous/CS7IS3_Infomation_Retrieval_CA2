The draft budget proposed by the government has been adopted as a working base. But at the same time the government is invited to revise all the main budgetary indicators to allow for new economic priorities, and to present the draft again for a first reading. We will not, however, suspect the poor Duma deputies of economic sabotage. On the contrary, in my view, they displayed exceptional resourcefulness in seeking a constructive solution to a complex problem. The draft budget was composed in an extremely hardline monetarist spirit, as if at the behest of Gaydar and Fedorov. And not because Premier V. Chernomyrdin has suddenly rallied to the colors of Milton Friedman. At heart he is still a sector specialist, but the current political situation compells him to hoist the monetarist flag higher than Gaydar and Fedorov themselves. There is no real money in the state coffers, and all the problems of budget funding can be resolved only by the nomenklatura method of "removing difficulties" through back-stage bureaucratic horse-trading. That is to say, today we bailed out this lot, tomorrow we will bail out another lot, and a third lot the day after. To bail out everyone at once -- that is, to adopt a budget which would satisfy the interests of all lobbyists -- is not possible. A way out of the impasse was found, as was to have been expected, during lobby negotiations, during which Chernomyrdin won over the agrarians by promising them money "later." The aforementioned Duma decree, which was compounded on the principle of "bread now and jam tomorrow" was also a reflection of this "consensus." V. Zhirinovskiy took part for the first time in lobby horse trading on an internal economic theme; in exchange for his support for the compromise decision, he -- evidently maliciously -- demanded the inclusion in the protocol of the decree a demand for the resignation of Ministers Yerin, Kozyrev, and Chubays. The demand was indeed included. This testifies not only to deputies' political "flexibility," but also to their social alertness [sotsialnaya adekvatnost], their understanding of the "scientific" fact that the real conflict of interests lies not in the sphere of voucher privatization, foreign policy, or the battle with crime. All this is secondary. The crucial topic in Russian life is competition between the major sector groups over the sharing out of national income.
