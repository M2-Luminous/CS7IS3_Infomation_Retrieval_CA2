Kokov, president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, at Government House in Nalchik on 19 March: "V.M. Kokov: 'The Situation Today Is Such that the Struggle for Power and Questions of Politics Must Be Relegated to the Background, and We Must All Concentrate on Constructive Labor and the Economy'"] [Text] The conference was opened and anchored by V. Kudayev, leader of the Office of the Press of the President of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. V.M. Kokov, president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, began the meeting with journalists with the traditional opening remarks. He said, in part: "A political situation is shaping up both in Russia and in Kabardino-Balkaria today which differs fundamentally from that which prevailed prior to 12 December. However anyone might care to characterize the present situation from the viewpoint of politics, it is more definite and more distinct than prior to 12 December. And the reason for this is primarily the Russian people's adoption of the constitution of our federative state. The constitution has enshrined unequivocally the fact that human rights are the priority in our state. It has also unequivocally enshrined the integrity of our fatherland, and these are strong aspects of the constitution, and this is why we voted for it. But what I would like to emphasize is this: The constitution is now a dependable basis of the separation of powers. Not of a struggle for power but of the legal separation of the various branches of power. Today the Russian state represents in terms of form of government a republican, presidential state combined with parliamentary activity. And it is this particular feature of the situation now taking shape that should be recognized by all people who live in our fatherland. Each branch of power is called on to concentrate exclusively on its own powers determined by the constitution. The period when the representative authority adopted and decided under its own jurisdiction all questions without exception came to an end on 12 December. "And we must recognize this also. It must be recognized by both the legislature and the executive. And they must cease the wrangling over whose chair is the higher. Proceeding from this situation, I say: The period of political blather must end both in the Russian state and in Kabardino-Balkaria. "Not questions of politics but questions of the economy are moving onto the agenda today. And we shall not for this reason get far with slogans: Let us live in unity, let us live in friendship, let us live in harmony. For the economy has reached the point beyond which lie destitution and a powerful social explosion. And the organs of power and administration in Kabardino-Balkaria, therefore, should concentrate all their thoughts and efforts on the accomplishment of specific economic and social tasks. We are for this reason entering into a period when we must do everything possible to ensure that all enterprises and all forms of ownership work for the good of the people of Kabardino-Balkaria. We proceed from the simple formula: Let all forms of management and enterprises of all forms of ownership develop equally in Kabardino-Balkaria, hence let there be many rich people in our republic, but let there be no poor people in Kabardino-Balkaria. That is, our policy must consist of ensuring freedom of development for enterprises of any form of ownership and at the same time of ensuring a strong program of social protection of the populace so that we have no families or people living in poverty here. "Can the Government of Kabardino-Balkaria cope with this, in words, seemingly, simple and comprehensible task. We believe that it can. A message of the president to the Parliament of Kabardino-Balkaria will be ready in a few days, and if we obtain its approval there, a specific government action program in 1994 will be confirmed on the basis of this document. Today we are working intensively on making the present year a year of a change in the dynamics of the economy of Kabardino-Balkaria. The endless decline we have had in the past five years must be stopped in 1994. Industry and agriculture and other sectors must in the present year make a turn toward their ascent, toward normal conditions and forms of development. "A living standard of society is shaping up in Kabardino-Balkaria today that may be regarded as the limit. The consumer basket in Kabardino-Balkaria, say, costs approximately R60,000, and we have today one-third of the population below this R60,000 in terms of income, and this means a great many people. We must do everything to ensure that the level of personal income at least cover the subsistence minimum, which is calculated by various methods, but which is close to reality. We will in this connection adopt very serious measures in the very near future, on questions connected with the organization of pay included. Note that people employed in the nonproduction sphere receive more than R90,000, those working in the production sphere, only R60,000 approximately. It should, it would seem, be the other way about, and those who do not produce material benefits should at least be on the same footing as those who manufacture commodities. But this is the paradox, the distortion in the organization of pay. We intend to implement, as I have repeated many times, a strong program of targeted subsidies also. We will necessarily arrive at a level of the organization of social protection of the populace where all additional payments we make to the populace will be brought together in single compensation payments, and they will be granted on the basis of an application. That is, to those who come and apply to the social protection authorities and declare their income, that is, in targeted fashion. A situation is now shaping up, therefore, in which struggle for power and questions of politics must in Kabardino-Balkaria, as, equally, in the Russian Federation also, be relegated to the background, and we must all concentrate on constructive labor in the name of emergence from the profound crisis in which the economy and policy have found themselves." After the opening remarks of V.M. Kokov, president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, journalists put to him a number of questions. Iskhak Guzeyev (of the newspaper ZAMAN): "The state of the economy at present for both Russia and Kabardino-Balkaria is, truly, a most important issue. Leaders of the republic's social and political organizations are saying that they also are concerned by this and are declaring their intentions and their desire to assist, contribute, and participate in the development of the economy of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. How do you see their participation here?" [Kokov] I am familiar with this gathering, which calls itself the Assembly of Political Parties and Movements of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. But the assembly's entire tone is not one of help for the government but of the emphasis of manifest and clearly expressed opposition to it. I reject, therefore, such help and such cooperation in categorical form. If specialists of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria have specific proposals, this is another matter, and the doors of both the President's Office and of the government are open, and we will officially even solicit their proposals pertaining to the government's future program of activity. In addition, the text of the message of the president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria to the republic's parliament has today already been distributed to approximately 50 percent of senior officials and specialists. And it is from the proposals that have been received, with their maximum possible consideration, that the message will be modified and presented to the Parliament of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. It is this form that could be a practicable mode of the social and political movements' participation in the elaboration of the government program for 1994. We are prepared to make available to any political movement or party today all the material at our disposal. Tazal Mashukov (of the newspaper KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA PRAVDA): "There have been especially many letters in the newspaper's mail in recent days connected with your edict 'On Certain Measures of Rehabilitation of the Balkar People in Connection With the 50th Anniversary of Their Repression,' which was read out at the mourning assembly on 8 March. It was not published in the press, and for this reason everyone is interpreting it each in his own way. What is the future of this important document?" [Kokov] I will say that this edict was not born on 8 March 1994. In all recent years, which have been called restructuring, the community of the republic and the authorities have been involved in problems of the complete rehabilitation of the repressed Balkar people. And not only the Balkar people. Representatives of other nationalities suffered measures of repression also. A principal demand of the national movements, on the basis of which they emerged, essentially, was the restoration of the rayons. A second point was the formation of a parliament which would take account to a greater extent of the interests of the peoples populating the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. A third desire, absurd, in my view, of a certain negligible part of the Balkar people was separation from Kabardino-Balkaria and the creation of their own state. Such things were the basis of all these movements in recent years. And, if you recall, the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria approved the decision of the first congress of the Balkar people in defiance of my wishes and my protest. I said at that time literally the following: "We have today turned not the best page in the history of the relations of the Kabarda and the Balkars." Then that same Supreme Soviet adopted a decision on the need for the restoration of the rayons. You remember this also. But on 8 March 1994 I signed an edict with regard to the developing political situation. Some people believe that I exceeded my authority. I, however, believe that I did not exceed my authority by writing: "to rename Sovetskiy, Cherekskiy Rayon." I would like to ask normal people: How is this bad for anyone, to whatever nationality he may belong? Another point. There is written there: "To consider it essential to restore Elbrusskiy Rayon, incorporating the village of Kendelen with the consent of its inhabitants." I ask you: Whom does this formula not satisfy, what is unreasonable about this? Or another point--the formation of a commission and the submittal to parliament of a proposal concerning the territorial-administrative arrangement of Kabardino-Balkaria. What is unreasonable or incomprehensible here? I would like to say that the meeting hall, the thousand people present at the assembly, accepted the edict with complete understanding and approval. And I consider this a normal step in satisfaction of the moral damage which was caused the Balkar people. If the head of the Russian state finds it possible at this time to make profuse apology on behalf of the Russian state to the Balkar people, why can the head of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, accommodating long-standing desires, not rename one rayon and not form another rayon following consultation with the people who will be called upon to live in this rayon? This today is merely a subject of speculation, and it would seem time to stop this. This step is aimed at adjusting the protracted, if not opposition, then at least strained situation in the relations of the peoples inhabiting our republic. I, as a citizen of Kabardino-Balkaria, not as an official, am absolutely sick and tired of the period of fruitless opposition. And I believe that each day of such opposition works against each Kabarda, each Balkar, each Cossack, and each individual residing on the territory of our republic. Aspirations to have done with the opposition and to secure peace and harmony in the republic were the motivation for this edict. And I will insist before parliament that it approve this edict, schedule a referendum in the village of Kendelen, and form a commission to consider other questions of the administrative-territorial arrangement of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria. And not only of the Balkar rayons. Of both the Cossack and Kabardin rayons also, perhaps, if this is economically expedient and corresponds to the present times. This is my attitude toward this edict. And its future is this: We will uphold and defend it in parliament, and I hope for the good sense of our corps of deputies and that they will support the edict and I am absolutely convinced that this document will serve as a good foundation for stable work in the future. As far as other parts of the edict are concerned, such a part as, for example, the instruction to the Constitutional Commission to work on the formation of two chambers, in one of which all the peoples of the republic are represented, I have never seen nor do I now see anything wrong here. If we want to live in peace and harmony. After all, we are all maintaining that we are today for a united Kabardino-Balkaria. Then please explain to me, a Kabarda, what is threatening about the fact that there will in one chamber be, say, 11 Balkar deputies, 11 Russians, and 11 Kabarda? What is the threat to me? There is no threat, especially since we live in the Russian Federation, whose constitution has clearly determined that all changes of the borders of components of the Federation are possible only by mutual consent, that is, a power solution of territorial questions is 100 percent excluded. And whoever summons us to this, to power solutions, is a criminal, a criminal before the constitution, and we will deal with him with the full severity of the laws of the Russian Federation. Marina Kardanova (of the newspaper SOVETSKAYA MOLODEZH): "Last Saturday the NSBN [National Council of the Balkar People] adopted a resolution demanding the restoration of all the Balkar rayons and a solution of the bicameral parliament question. It stipulates that unless these questions have been settled by our government and president within a month's time, the NSBN will go to the leadership of the Russian Federation and the Federation Council with a request for consideration of the question of the creation of a Republic of Balkaria within the Russian Federation. "How do the government and the president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria intend to react to this and what is the possible response of the Federation Council to this request? "And the second question. At what stage is our relationship with the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation in respect to the payments of the promised compensation to the persons who suffered from political repression?" [Kokov] To speak of questions of territorial rehabilitation of the Balkar people, in Kabardino-Balkaria it has progressed the best compared with any other repressed people. This is my assessment. Some may agree with this, some may disagree. But judge for yourselves. I will give you some approximate figures. Thirty-five thousand persons of Balkar nationality were forcibly deported. Today the Balkar population constitutes, in the Russian Federation at least, 90,000. Thirty-five thousand are at the present time living in the ravines, and these ravines could not physically sustain a larger population. Everything is distributed there down to the last scraps. Putting up an extra house there is a problem. Where does the rest of the population live? On different territory, most likely. And whoever is campaigning for the separation of Balkaria is pushing his people onto a disastrous path because the day this happens, a large part of the population would be "squeezed" into the ravines. And would be "squeezed" by various methods. Power methods, necessarily. This would mean blood and a tragedy for the people. So it is that all these years I have been trying to show that the people that experienced such a tragedy in their history should not once again take a path that would lead to blood and to senseless loss of human life. This is the elementary content of all our efforts geared to ensuring that the republic be united. We are today so integrated that no one could disunite us. And this is, therefore, an absurd preoccupation. As far as the response to the decision of the NSBN is concerned, this is an organization that is not even registered as yet, I believe. Yet it was formed to create the Republic of Balkaria, and the Constitution of Russia permits this only with general consent. There has been no consent, that is, the subject of the creation of this organization is played out. I am not, therefore, thinking of any special response to any such statements. I have already responded to these statements. And if some people have nothing to do and want to take this matter further, let them do so. But the prudent part of the Balkar people reacted to this at the time of the ballot in the elections for the Federation Council with unanimous support for the candidacies of both the president and the prime minister for the Federation Council. Not of Kokov, not of Cherkesov, but of the president and the prime minister and their program. And our program is unequivocal--the republic must live eternally, as thus far, as a united family and must tackle the urgent tasks that confront its inhabitants. There will, therefore, be no reaction on the part of the government. As far as the Federation Council is concerned, it will not, I assure you, respond to the territorial division of Russia. I do not recognize any divisions or any movements that could lead to a confrontation and to innocent victims and I will put a stop to them with all the powers at my disposal. In short, the Federation Council will, I am sure, not respond to such requests. Because the corps of deputies there now is sufficiently serious and balanced. Concerning the second question. If you noticed, the edict of the president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, which is being criticized once again by certain figures of various movements, contains the following point--rendering persons of Balkar nationality who suffered repression in the period 1944-1957 lump-sum material support. Why did we write this in? Because the question of the payment of sums of compensation to all persons in the Russian Federation who suffered repression is today economically onerous, and a consummate unified procedure in Russia has not been worked out. Some people say: Pay on a family basis, others, on an individual basis. Some say: The minimum salary times 100, others, 40. This question is at the discussion and modification stage. But we are participating actively, and the question of compensation payments for people who suffered repression will, most likely, on the whole, in the very near future be settled on the scale of the Russian Federation. But lest we plunge it into a common precedent of such a kind, we sought to ensure that the edict of the president record a clause not on compensation payments but on material support for persons of the Balkar nationality who suffered repression. And it is this question that we will have settled in the very near future. In addition, we already have R1 billion here, which many people are mentioning frequently. We will start payments from this R1 billion to the most elderly people. According to our, Kabardino-Balkar, procedure, if it is not a part of the Russian procedure, we will adjust it. But holding on to this money any longer without doing anything with it would be simply criminal. The money must work either for man or for the republic. And we will begin these payments to persons who suffered repression in 1944. Miloslav Bityukov (of the newspaper YUG): "Your message to parliament. When will it be delivered? What is its main idea? Is it a political or economic document?" [Kokov] The main idea of my message will consist of the righting of the economy of the republic in 1994 and making the latter a year of change. But jettisoning policy from the message absolutely would be wrong. And I would describe my document as political and economic. But I am sure of one thing--it will determine the main directions of our activity and will be a sound basis for a specific program, bolstered by figures, of government activity. All this is to take place in April, within the framework of the present sitting. I will have it in finished form next week, probably. I want to get more opinions and have more support for the message in advance in order that the debate in parliament might be more productive. This is my mission. [Bityukov] Could you in this connection familiarize us at least with the heads of the message? [Kokov] I promise that the leading newspapers will receive it and that they will have an opportunity to discuss it. And I would be sincerely grateful for any criticisms and suggestions you express. We all ultimately have a single goal--the well-being of our republic. Who conceives of the achievement of this well-being in what way is another matter. This could be disputed also, but if we were to adopt a program of activity in 1994 which is consummate and which has been approved by the vast majority of the people of Kabardino-Balkaria, its successful realization would be predetermined. Oleg Guseynov (of the newspaper SEVERNYY KAVKAZ): "What is your attitude toward the proposal of Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of Kalmykia, concerning the abolition of his constitution and the recognition in Kalmykia only of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, which, incidentally, was supported by NSBN Chairman S. Beppayev?" [Kokov] I take a negative view of this. The richness of our fatherland consists of the fact that more than 150 peoples and nationalities live here. This multilingualism, this diversity, is the might of the Russian fatherland. But at the same time we have all been speaking for several years now about our sovereignty, about the right to self-determination. This is why, participating in the constitutional process and the work of the final commission, I sought to ensure that the Federal Treaty be an official appendix to the present constitution (even if it might to some people appear formal). And, thank God, 2 million copies of the constitution, to which the Federal Treaty is officially appended, have been published. In addition, this problem was once again discussed at my last meeting with the president of the Russian Federation, and the following agreement was reached--constitutionally structured or formally structured, the Council of Heads of the Republics will function. If only so that the president of Russia and the leaders of the republics might exchange opinions on various matters. Second, we agreed that Kabardino-Balkaria and the Russian state would conclude an official treaty. And literally yesterday we discussed who would take part on the side of the Russian state, and who, on the side of Kabardino-Balkaria. And the task is to ensure that the treaty satisfy our requirements and at the same time strengthen the Russian state also. The proposition of the president of Russia on this matter is that he and the center do not need one gram of the authority which could be realized locally, in the regions and components. He needs merely the authority that guarantees and ensures the integrity of the Russian state and its security. Therefore, the president of the Russian Federation suggests, work out a treaty that satisfies you in full, and we will sign it. And this, in my view, is the correct solution of the questions of relations with Russia. We will move along the path of full federalism, along the path of the formation of a truly federative state. And what is wrong with this? Abolishing the constitution of a republic, in which there are particular features characterizing this people or the other, for that matter, and the wishes of this people or the other would be at least abnormal, therefore. I am absolutely sure that national distinctions persist today and I consider it premature, therefore, to rush to abolish one's constitution. And it is Kalmykia's business according to which constitution it should live, according to the Russian Constitution or some other.... We are thinking of devising a constitution in the course of this year and, as I said earlier, adopting it. A constitution that accommodates in full the interests of all the peoples of Kabardino-Balkaria. Tatyana Mochalova (of the Kabardino-Balkaria Television and Radio Company): "You have said that this year will be pivotal in an economic sense. What ways out of the economic crisis do you see if it is considered that ours is a subsidized republic and that the financial position of the industrial enterprises continues to deteriorate? "And, second, if the conflict at the Tyrnyauz Tungsten-Molybdenum Works has been resolved, how?" [Kokov] The government and also a parliamentary commission and many specialists of the republic are today working on specific ways out of the crisis. But the main thing I have to say is this: The spring-field operations will begin in literally a few days' time, and it is important that agriculture in 1994 work at full stretch. The wavering is over. We held a meeting of activists of the agro-industrial complex and determined our positions in respect to the main directions of our activity in this sphere. Not one square meter of land in Kabardino-Balkaria must be left uncultivated. Not one normal, fit Kabardino-Balkar inhabitant will be left in 1994 without something to do in agricultural production. We intend to cater in full for the requirements in respect to truck gardens of everyone who desires this. We also intend to satisfy all applications in rural localities for adjoining personal plots of land before 15 April of this year. Do the financial possibilities for this exist? I believe that we have such possibilities, and our contacts with the federal government afford me reason today to give the firm assurance that we will cover agriculture's needs for financial resources, however pessimistic some people might be. Specifically, since the start of the year we have channeled R17 billion into agriculture. In addition, there are documents in the Ministries of Finance, Economics, and Agriculture of the Russian Federation, which have been coordinated with higher authorities, for a sum total of over R70 billion. Even if we do not manage to materialize everything, these funds are sufficient for ensuring that the agro-industrial complex operate to the full extent. Another point. We in the Russian Federation have settled questions connected with the development of a resort and tourism in Kabardino-Balkaria. There is a special decree, which we will obtain shortly, which determines the main paths of the development of these traditional sectors of our republic. The next direction. We have designated quite distinctly a program of hydropower construction in Kabardino-Balkaria. Whether there will be R38 billion, whether there will be R30 billion, it is a fact that this work in the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria will proceed apace, that is, this will be a sizable chunk in capital construction. We have designated perfectly distinctly the extent of highway construction. A large amount of work is scheduled in housing construction. And we will first and foremost display special concern for the needy, large families, the handicapped, and those who have been on the waiting list for many years. We will build for families of the inhabitants of hostels and barracks in the city of Nalchik approximately 1,400 apartments altogether. We will make a start on houses whose foundations have not been laid and will continue those whose foundations have been laid. The main problem for us is to secure the stability of the operation of the enterprises. It is this that we are all now working on: the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and individual directors of large enterprises. We will join the conversion program and will obtain some amount of money. But even if I am unable to get anything resolved within the framework of federal conversion programs, we have a backup move even here--we will have preferential credit for the industrial enterprises amounting to no less than R50 billion. I intend discussing this problem with the president of Russia in the next few days, incidentally, if possible. If not, it will be settled, most likely, 4-5 April, when the next sitting of the Federation Council takes place. But the most important thing is the intrinsic potential, which we have and are using far from fully. Many directors are, if you will excuse the expression, unfortunately, "totally ensconced" in office, not just present. And are giving no thought to the future and are not concerned for the fate of their work force. Today's criterion for the evaluation of any director: If the outfit is working, has steady wages, and makes the compulsory payments, thanks are due him. No one requires of him either plans or a product list and so forth. But if a person fails to cope with this task, does he have any right to be a director? Undoubtedly not. And for this reason many people are accusing us of saying that the skilled operatives should not be broken up. They should be. Operatives who have not blended in in five years will not do so in five months. This is futile. We must make personnel changes and entrust the work to those who are capable of operating under market conditions. Further, we must find a way out of the situation that has taken shape in respect to banking in Kabardino-Balkaria. Either we--the republic--have the right to dispose of our own financial resources or we will demolish the state by default. This is what I am talking about. Either an enterprise or myself are in debt to someone or someone is in debt to me, in either case, who is the winner? Only the bank. The multimillion-dollar fortunes of the present bankers and their institutions are being racked up on the nonpayments alone. Many enterprise leaders are "stripping" their work force through this loophole alone. So it is that I say that all state resources in Kabardino-Balkaria should be in the hands of the state bank. If the National Bank cannot handle this, we will establish a Bank of Reconstruction and Development, which would be entirely responsible for state funds. But all the billions we solicit and take from our populace amass interest via these banks in three or four months of mutual nonpayments, and the interest is pocketed. That is, we will adjust this matter also. We will also tackle questions of taxes, streamline and support some, stimulate others, and take from whoever today has possibilities. Now as far as the Tyrnyauz Works is concerned. We have long been involved in a persevering study of this works. Only understand that the works--the city--is a single whole. And we have already "hung" the entire infrastructure of the city on ourselves and have been financing it for more than a year. Is this not assistance to the works, which earlier supported this entire city? Another point. We obtained for them privileges in the electricity tariff, and the electricity tariff with them constitutes more than half of their prime costs. We are currently preparing a directive of the prime minister of the Russian Federation especially on the Tyrnyauz Works. And of the R700 million we had in reserve for the purchase of meat on the special quota, that is, for kindergartens, hospitals, and so forth, we recently gave them R600 million directly, I believe, so that they might square accounts down to a single kopek in respect to the miners' pay. And for this reason a conflict, whoever wanted to fan one in Tyrnyauz, did not eventuate. It was not, strictly speaking, the work force that assembled there but a small part of it, those who would like to have a separate state. There was for this reason no conflict there. We warned the management: If some people other than you can assemble your work force, they, the other people, should be the directors of this works, not you. This most likely had an effect. At least, they asked of us: Don't come here, we will sort it out ourselves. And they did so and reported that no decisions were adopted there. It is a fact that the miners are today in a difficult position, and may the entire population of Kabardino-Balkaria understand us if sometimes we make another gesture and take another step in support of them. Their working conditions are difficult, and we will do everything within our power to ensure that the Tyrnyauz Works function normally as a state enterprise. Igor Terekhov (of INTERFAX): "The structure of the Government of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria was formerly brought into line with the structure of the Government of the Russian Federation. There have now been changes in it. Will there be similar changes in your government? If so, of what kind? What is your attitude toward the proposal of V. Ardzinba, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia, concerning the integration of the economy of the Republic of Abkhazia in the economy of the North Caucasus region?" [Kokov] The structure of the government is not something frozen and given once for all. It should change. And the Government of Kabardino-Balkaria should now be changed both in terms of structure and in terms of numbers. If I am successful in all that I have in mind, and I am working on the papers, calculations, and feasibility at this time, the Government of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria and the entire system of the executive in general will in terms of numbers shrink by a minimum of 20 percent, optimally, 30 percent. Thirty percent is what I would like. I would not argue about anything over 20. This as regards the numbers. As far as the structure is concerned, we have 31 members of the government. This is the case, I believe. Estonia, a state, has 13 members of the government. But even if we are conditioned by Russian canons, 30 structural subdivisions is a lot, all the same. There are offices that could perfectly well be part of a single complex. And for this reason the number of ministries and departments, if I am successful, having convinced people and not having evoked serious opposition, in reducing them to 21-23 (I have both versions), I would consider my goal to have been achieved. But the system of the executive must under all conditions be competent, highly efficient, and operational. The executive should, I am convinced, encompass all components of the state, from the smallest homestead and settlement through the republic. And in this respect I am in confrontation, in disagreement, with the provision of the constitution which says that local government is separated from the state. I do not understand such a state, a Russian state, at least, in which people may at the bottom do what they want and at the top squabble endlessly. We should not have this. The smallest community should have, therefore, an authorized representative of the executive. Whether he is elected or appointed is another matter. This may be argued, but there should be such a person. I am for such a format and for such changes. Concerning the second question. I have the proposal from Abkhazia. I have the telegram. But when we discussed it, we framed the question this way: Would this not be interference in the affairs of another state? Would we not hereby be pushing Ardzinba himself and his parliament into a new confrontation? And it was for this reason simultaneously my suggestion that this meeting be held in Nalchik. These same thoughts had in parallel, apparently, taken possession also of the Krasnodar leadership, which also announced its desire for these meeting to take place in Krasnodar. I believe that questions of Abkhazia's integration in the economy of the North Caucasus are absolutely realistic and do not conflict with any international laws. And we should do everything possible to ensure that this integration take place at a durable level. As far as political problems are concerned, they should be discussed at a meeting of leaders of the North Caucasus and Abkhazia. These matters were the subject of a brief examination, incidentally, at the present sitting of the Federation Council, from which I have just returned. I noted in a brief speech that the techniques of the conclusion of Russia's treaty with Georgia contained a statement of the president of the Russian Federation prior to its signing to the effect that the treaty would take effect only after the all-embracing Abkhaz-Georgian question had been regulated. And the treaty, which has now been concluded, records in one article that it will take effect, like any other treaty, only after ratification. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation will not be submitting this treaty for ratification even within the first six months, consequently, the agreements we reached at that time will hold up. As far as other problems are concerned, they should be resolved only politically. I repeat: Now is not the time when territorial issues can be decided by force. Zufar Kambiyev (of the newspaper ADYGE PSALE): "Elections to local government authorities are being held in many regions of Russia at this time. When is it planned to hold such elections here?" [Kokov] If you recall the edict on elections to the parliament of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria and the changes we made to our constitution, it follows from these documents that we must form a durable constitutional commission to draw up a constitution in the course of the first six months, and then we would discuss it and adopt it before the end of November. I, for example, do not consider it necessary to once again plunge the population of the republic into some elections before the constitution is adopted. Consequently, we need to work intensively on the elaboration of the constitution and its adoption. And to hold elections to the local authorities with regard to the provisions of the new constitution. But there is another opinion also: Let us adopt a law on local government as soon as possible and hold elections in accordance with it. We will discuss these problems. But I would consider it possible to hold elections to the local authorities only in accordance with a new constitution, consequently, some time around October-November. There are boards under the auspices of the administration chiefs, and I believe that the administration chiefs could work without major errors and provide for control of both the economy and other social processes until then. Marina Kyasova (of the newspaper KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA PRAVDA): "A memorandum on civil peace and harmony is being made ready for signing at the Russian level. Could you, as a participant in the meeting in the Kremlin at which this matter was discussed, not express your attitude toward it? "Should a similar memorandum be drawn up in our republic?" [Kokov] I was invited to this consultative conference under the aegis of the president of the Russian Federation. Of all the republics, only Kabardino-Balkaria participated. I supported the idea of the memorandum and said there that any step in a direction providing for political stability should be supported. But in doing so I said also that we should not put our hopes in this document. There have been many agreements of all kinds, but they are not producing tangible results. I say: Let us live according to the constitution, and no memoranda will be necessary. Give us, consequently, a package of laws and a mechanism making it possible to realize all articles of the constitution that has been adopted. Were we to live and work according to the constitution, no memoranda would be needed. Such a memorandum would do no harm in the Russian state. It could do some good even. At least, those who are in charge of political parties and movements would, having signed this document, be compelled to abide by it, of course. And another point: Those who occupied extreme positions and who refused to sign it would be showing the whole people their true colors, that is, their reluctance to live in peace. This is important also. I support the memorandum, therefore. I do not consider it necessary to prepare a similar memorandum in Kabardino-Balkaria. Why? Because there are legitimately elected authorities and there is the constitution. And all parties and movements, whoever is in charge of them, should live within this framework. We, the authorities, are called on to ensure the functioning of all movements only within the framework of the constitution. [end Kokov] In conclusion V.M. Kokov, president of the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, appealed to the journalists as follows: "I have repeated this many times and repeat it now also--peace and harmony in the republic depend to a decisive extent on what you have to say. Let us bethink ourselves. Let us not bring to the people, the masses, information that agitates the public mind. Let us not support those who are endlessly pushing us toward the abyss. We do not need this. I repeat: Neither the president nor the parliament are forever. They are today allotted by the constitution a particular length of time. Let us in the name of the peace and prosperity of the republic support the activity of the legitimate authorities. The time will come when we will elect others. Prepare for new elections, consequently. This is prudent, this is normal. And, strictly speaking, should we some day live in a state based on the rule of law!? Yes. And we need, therefore, to expunge from our consciousness completely the possibility of the use of force to achieve our political ends. It is on this that I would ask you to target and concentrate your efforts."
