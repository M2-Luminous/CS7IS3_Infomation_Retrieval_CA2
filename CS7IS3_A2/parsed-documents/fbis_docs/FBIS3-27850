The compromise makes it likely the Diet will now approve the government's reform bills during its Saturday session. (House of Representatives) The lower house would have 500 seats, compared with 511 at present. This would include 300 from single-seat electoral districts and 200 chosen by proportional representation. The coalition originally proposed a combination of 274 single- seat constituencies and 226 chosen by proportional representation. (Voting) Voters would cast two ballots, one for a single-seat representative and another for a party on the proportional list divided into 11 regional blocs. The coalition originally proposed candidates for the proportional representation seats be chosen from a single nationwide list. (Party Fund-Raising) A politician may designate a single fund-raising organization to which donations can be paid. Companies may contribute up to 500,000 yen a year to an organization. The organizations would be banned after five years. The coalition originally proposed an immediate ban on company donations to politicians' support groups. (Political Parties) A party must poll at least 2 percent of the proportional representation vote to qualify to win a seat. Under existing regulations, the figure is 3 percent.
