Although Zheng expressed the hope that the Sino-U.S. talks in two days time would be a complete success, he stressed that the mainland has a very big trading market. Anyway, "if not in the east, then in the west," he said. When answering reporters' questions at a closed-door meeting of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] in Beijing yesterday, Zheng Hongye said: U.S. trade makes up only a small portion of the mainland's total foreign trade volume and is "not worth mentioning." He stressed that there are different views and opinions between China and the United States and the two sides have held several talks on the textiles issue. He believed, provided both sides observe the principle of "equality and mutual benefit," the problem will not be hard to resolve. However, if one keeps only itself in mind, it will be very hard to resolve the issue. He refuted the U.S. criticism that the mainland is not opening its market, saying that the it has never closed its doors to the U.S. market. What actually happened is that the mainland wanted to import some commodities from the United States, the latter refused to offer. But he did not clearly point out what the commodities were. On the forthcoming Sino-U.S. meeting on the textiles issue, which will be held from 15 to 17 January, Zheng Hongye stressed that he was confident that substantive results would be achieved. He also said, if the United States insisted on imposing economic sanctions on the mainland, the development of bilateral trade would be harmed. Anyway, he said, if the United States really imposes economic sanctions, the mainland still has many trade markets outside, "if not in the east, then in the west."
