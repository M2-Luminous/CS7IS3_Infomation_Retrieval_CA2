FBIS4-31605 "dreeu113_i_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-113 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Krajisnik Denies `Rift' With Serbia Krajisnik Denies `Rift' With Serbia LD1106001794 Belgrade TANJUG in English 2311 GMT 10 Jun 94 LD1106001794 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Belgrade, June 10 (TANJUG) -- President of the national assembly of the Bosnian Serb republic Momcilo Krajisnik said on Friday that "there is no rift between the Serb republic and Serbia, no-one shall cast a doubt on the harmony and determination of the Serb people and the justified objective -- life in one state, will be realized." Commenting the many speculations in the public about a cooling in relations between Belgrade and Pale, Krajisnik said "we perhaps have different views on many things, but this cannot be described as cooling in any way." The speculations on a cooling of relations were triggered by a statement on Tuesday by Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic who said that Yugoslav citizens cannot be hostages of any leader from the territory of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia [as received], the Serb republic, or the republic of Serb Krajina in former Croatia. Pointing out that the two-year war of Moslems, Serbs and Croats in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina "has to end," Lilic said at the time when ceasefire negotiations between the warring sides were underway in Geneva that the Yugoslav people "rightly expect the peace talks to succeed and cannot agree to the option that they are infinitely prolonged and undermined." In a statement to the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA, Krajisnik said that Lilic's statement "is not sufficiently defined and precise, and has therefore created confusion, but it cannot pertain to the Serb people in the Serb republic or in the republic of Serb Krajina." The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a federation of Serbia and Montenegro, is under comprehensive and binding sanctions which were imposed in May 1992 by the United Nations Security Council because of its alleged involvement in the Bosnia-Herzegovina war. [word indistinct] sanctions present a big problem and we are all engaged in the utmost towards their lifting, and different views should not be taken to mean a rift," Krajisnik said, adding that he his experience with Belgrade was positive. "In the contacts so far, Lilic has shown a special devotion to the Serb national issue and we hope he will elucidate on the stand he recently voiced," Krajisnik concluded. Special U.N. envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi and representatives of Bosnian Serbs and the Moslem-Croat Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina signed an agreement on a one-month ceassation of mostilities in Geneva on Wednesday. Akashi had proposed a four-month ceasefire, and the Serb Republic was for a lasting agreement, but it adopted the Japanese diplomat's proposal. The Moslem-Croat delegation, however, agreed four-weeks as the longest possible period for a ceasefire.
