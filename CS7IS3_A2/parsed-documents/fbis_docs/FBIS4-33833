The clouds lean lazily on the sides of the mountains here. The sun is light gray and somnolent. The day is already a humid whisper dragging itself along amid the mud and thorns. Here's to you: health and an alarm clock (so as not to stay asleep). From the mountains in southeastern Mexico, Insurgent Subcommander Marcos. Mexico, June 1994. Postscript for Nuncio, Abraham. The rocket [previous word in English] was shot down. The antiaircraft team commanded by El Beto (eight slings and eight very good marksmen) detected the rocket when it was about to land, 20 meters before its tip touched the ground. Eight stones, little stones, rough stones gave it the kiss of death on its right flank. As someone about to lie down, the rocket tipped to one side. Our people, as is customary, organized a party. When they were bringing the marimba, El Beto approached the fallen rocket and said: "It is paper and cannot be eaten...yet." No one heard him; the marimba was already beginning to play the song Carta Marcada and the couples, using the rain as an excuse, squeezed closer together. We had to wait for the arrival of the newspaper, which absurdly, as everything here, came via facsimile. The photocopy of the rocket remained filed under "R" (for "Rocket" as well as "Reproaches"). Greetings to Monterrey, the land of the brave. Cinematographic postscript. Aerial shot. It is raining. The gray from above and the moisture will make these lands green again. The burning of fields is over; something new is beginning to appear amid the rocks and mountains. Traveling shot. [Previous two words in English] Dirt, vines, and tall grass (they call them "houses" here). Women wash clothes in the stream very carefully, because "if they are scrubbed too hard, the clothes get torn and there is no thread to mend them." A boy is pretending an empty flip top [previous two words in English] cigarette box is a truck, loading it with pebbles. "They are sacks of corn," he tells the EZLN guard at the checkpoint who, amid the rain, tries to cover the boy with a piece of nylon [previous word in English]. It is useless, however; the truck is driving away from the checkpoint, and the guard must return to his position. Tonita washes her face with the rainwater she has collected in a can of light [previous word in English] drink. In an old wooden building, the only building with a metal roof (they call it "the school" here), amid dark faces, black eyes, mud-laden boots, old shirts, and red bandannas, men with mustaches discuss war and peace. The guard at the EZLN headquarters shivers coldly under the frayed plastic roof. The pole men from the barges arrive soaking wet: half sweat and half rain but all mud. Cold hands gather around the fire, weaving stories of big hats, squawk boxes [cajitas parlantes], and women who walk at night. El Beto stretches the opening of a balloon, which he has filled with water, and plays at making it rain. The water falls into the puddle at his feet. Moises and Tacho gaze at the swollen river then try to cross it on a wooden raft. No one says a word, they stare at the brown water as if they were looking at life. Longshot [previous word in English]. Maria, 30 years old with eight live children ("four of them died"), emerges at the bend of the main road carrying a pack of wood on her back: the weight, the leather strap [mecapal], and the mud force her to look down. She also carries an axe in her right hand. Josefa, 15, follows her with another wobbly pack of wood. Josefa is unconcerned about the mud; she is making sure the leather strap does not mess up her hair or pull out the eight "hairpins" she has fastened to her hair. Another bundle of wood follows, a scant few feet above the ground. Underneath it, barefoot, is Pedro, 8, one hand carrying a machete, the other holding the leather strap to help balance the weight on his head. Medium shot [previous two words in English]. Hortensia, an EZLN rebel and seamstress, proudly shows off her latest achievement: she has made a pair of pants out of five torn and ripped pairs. When she shows the pants to the men, they all remember they have something to do elsewhere. Hortensia remains with the pants in her hands: It has four different colors and, inadvertently, she says, a little flower at the crotch. Closeup [previous word in English]. Half covered by brown shirt sleeves, two hands use an awl and thick thread to mend a boot that has more scars than the back of Ahab's whale. The red bandanna provides relief for the blisters. Upward shot. Under a puckered brow, two eyes dance from one side to another, lips begin to move and, amid quiet, whisper: "Let my voice rise to the mountains and fall to the ground as thunder, that is what my throat would like from now on and forever." Downward shot. Someone is reading, with a rifle across his thighs. The words, sadly, reach out. "Yesterday the people woke up naked with nothing to wear, and starving, with nothing to eat, and today the day broke justly stormily and bleeding justly. In their hands, the rifles want to become like lions to get rid of the beasts they've had to face over and over. Even if you have no weapons, people of a hundred thousand powers, do not let your mettle fail you, get back at those who hurt you as long as you have fists, nails, saliva, and still have a spine, heart, and guts, your manly attributes and teeth." A right hand reaches out and turns the page of the book by Miguel Hernandez. The lens loses focus, hesitates, and then refocuses, zeroing in on the paragraph: "I am here to live as long as my soul can dream, and I am here to die whenever my time is come, in the bosom of my people, from now on and forever. Life is several swallows, but death is simply one. Audio off. "Who's there?" "The Fatherland." The echo can be heard amid the rain and the fog; the sound of feet squishing in the mud begins anew. Fade out. The color green splattered with brown and red, sort of hidden behind the gray and the final wink of the camera shutter. Audio off. A faraway plane fades into nothingness in the air.... It is over. The Sup [name as published] behind the lens stupidly believes that the word play [preceding word in English] on the camera really means "to play"... [jugar].
