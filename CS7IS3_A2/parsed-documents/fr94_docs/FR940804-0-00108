FR940804-0-00108 FR940804-0-00024 Rules governing the conduct of Department attorneys, or any other officials of the Executive Branch, may be promulgated only pursuant to constitutional or statutory authority. Congress's delegation of authority need not be specific or explicit. Chrysler Corp. v. Brown , 441 U.S. 281, 307&hyph;08 (1979). The Department believes that it possesses appropriate statutory authority to promulgate this regulation pursuant to two distinct sources: 5 U.S.C. 301 (``commonly referred to as the `housekeeping statute,''' Chrysler Corp ., 441 U.S. at 309 (citation omitted)), and title 28 of the United States Code, which in a variety of provisions authorizes the Attorney General and the Department to enforce federal law and to regulate the conduct of Department attorneys. Section 301 of title 5, United States Code, authorizes the Attorney General to ``prescribe regulations for the government of [her] department,'' ``the conduct of its employees,'' and ``the distribution and performance of its business.'' 5 U.S.C. 301. The Supreme Court has held that this provision authorizes the Attorney General to issue regulations with extra-departmental effect. See, e.g ., Georgia v. United States , 411 U.S. 526, 536 (1973) (holding that section 301 provided the Attorney General with ``ample legislative authority'' to issue regulations that established procedural and substantive standards binding on state and local governments); United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen , 340 U.S. 462 (1951) (federal government attorney could not be held in contempt for following an Attorney General regulation promulgated pursuant to a predecessor to section 301). Title 28 of the United States Code grants the Attorney General and the Department a variety of law enforcement powers including the power (through intermediary officials) to conduct grand jury proceedings or any other kind of civil or criminal legal proceeding; to conduct litigation, and to ``secur[e] evidence'' therefor; to detect and prosecute crimes; and to prosecute ``civil actions, suits, and proceedings in which the United States is concerned.'' 28 U.S.C. 515(a), 516, 533, 547; see 28 U.S.C. 509, 510. The Attorney General is also authorized to ``supervise all litigation'' to which the United States is a party and to direct United States Attorneys and other subordinate attorneys in the ``discharge of their respective duties.'' 28 U.S.C. 519. These provisions grant the Attorney General extremely broad authority to supervise the enforcement of federal law. In order for a Department regulation to have the force and effect of law, it must rest on a reasonable construction of the statutes delegating the authority to promulgate it and must not in substance contradict any act of Congress. See, e.g ., NLRB v. United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 23 , 484 U.S. 112, 123 (1987); Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp , 467 U.S. 691, 699&hyph;700 (1989). These rules represent the reasoned judgment of the Attorney General and of the Department about the lawful authority of federal lawyers effectively to investigate and prosecute crimes. One individual and a number of organizations, including the Conference of Chief Justices, posited that the Department is acting outside the scope of its congressionally delegated authority because this regulation assertedly contravenes the Department of Justice Appropriation Authorization Act of 1979, which requires all Department attorneys to be ``duly licensed and authorized to practice as an attorney under the laws of a State, territory, or the District of Columbia.'' Pub. Law No. 96&hyph;132, ยง3(a), 93 Stat. 1040, 1044 (Nov. 30, 1979), as carried forward by Pub. Law No. 103&hyph;121, 107 Stat. 1153, 1163 (Oct. 27, 1993) (reenacting provisions of Pub. Law No. 96&hyph;132). These commenters suggested that when Congress required Department attorneys to be licensed by a state bar, Congress implied that Department attorneys should be subject to all the rules and regulations of state authorities, regardless of their impact on officials carrying out federal law enforcement. Therefore, this regulation, by shielding Department attorneys from state disciplinary proceedings for violations of state rules interfering with effective federal law enforcement, is alleged to violate Congress's clear intent in enacting the Department's appropriation statute. The Department believes that these comments mistake the purpose and effect of the congressional requirement that federal attorneys have state licenses. That requirement, which is satisfied by admission to the state's bar and maintenance of bar membership, simply serves to ensure that the professional qualifications of all Department lawyers have in fact been examined. No comment received by the Department demonstrates that Congress intended the requirement to have the further effect of interfering with the Attorney General's ability to ensure effective federal law enforcement or of compelling federal attorneys to comply with state bar ethical standards that contradict federal rules. 2. The Department's Power to Preempt State Ethics Rules. One individual, one state court judge, and five organizations, including the Special Committee of the Conference of Chief Justices, commented that the Department does not have the constitutional power to preempt state regulation of its attorneys. It should first be noted that in most instances the force and effect of these rules should not depend on whether they preempt state ethics rules under the Supremacy Clause. As already noted, communications within the scope of the regulation are intended to constitute communications that are ``authorized by law'' within the meaning of DR 7&hyph;104, Model Rule 4.2, and analogous disciplinary rules. Therefore, if the relevant state rule contains an authorized-by-law exception, this regulation should be seen as constituting such authorization, thereby bringing any attorney communication permissible under these rules in conformity with that state law and eliminating the Supremacy Clause issue.
