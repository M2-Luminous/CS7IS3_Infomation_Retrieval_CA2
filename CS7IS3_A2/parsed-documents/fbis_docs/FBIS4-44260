One must look for a solution over the next three weeks until the special summit in Brussels on 15 July, Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel told the press on Monday [27 June]. One cannot yet see what the solution could be like. In a newspaper interview Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party), however, had praised Dehaene once again as a "dedicated European" and added that the European Union needs "a doer." Dehaene had failed to be chosen because of the British veto at the Corfu summit.
