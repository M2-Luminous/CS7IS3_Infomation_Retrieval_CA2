On March 17, Beijing Review correspondent interviewed Minister Wu. QUESTION: Minister Wu, you are preparing to lead a large trade delegation to the United States. What is the goal of your trip? ANSWER: The most important mission of my participation is to jointly preside over the Eighth Session of the Sino-US Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade to be held on April 13-14 in Washington, D.C., with US Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown. As an annual government-level meeting between trade representatives of the two governments, the committee session is the most important channel for discussions of bilateral economic and trade relations and other related questions. The session will be another major event following the Sino-US summit meeting in Seattle and the Eighth Session of the Joint Committee on Economics presided over jointly by the Chinese minister of finance and US finance secretary. During the forthcoming session, the two sides will discuss trade and investment policies, and cooperation in various industrial sectors, including those related to information, energy, transportation, chemical industry and environmental cooperation, and legal issues. As part of an effort to promote bilateral trade and US investment in China, our delegation will launch trade and investment negotiations in Los Angeles and New York on April 11 and 19 respectively. I hope the negotiations will allow American industrialists to gain greater insight into the situation in China since the introduction of the reform and opening policies, and will provide them with access to China's vast potential market. I also hope the meetings will attract more American business people to trade with China and invest in our country. The purchasing group which will accompany the delegation to the United States will make purchases depending on advances made during the bilateral business talks. Q: What will be the focus of the purchasing, and what will the level of purchases be in terms of funds? A: The purchasing plan includes petroleum exploration and production equipment, motor vehicles, various technologies and light industrial products. The amount of purchases will depend on advances made during the talks. Q: What about Sino-US trade and investment negotiations? What items will be included? A: The large-scale negotiations designed to promote investment and trade are being held in the United States for the first time since China introduced the reform and opening policies 15 years ago. They will be sponsored jointly by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Graham & James of the United States and the US Asian Association. The 200-member Chinese negotiating team will include senior officials in charge of investment and trade from eight ministries and commissions under the State Council, three corporations and 25 provinces and municipalities, as well as experts and entrepreneurs. Representatives from the six major corporations under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation will also participate in import and export negotiations. The chief aim of the delegation's trip is to introduce China's reform, opening policies and economic development, in order to enhance mutual exchanges and understanding, and to develop and expand economic and technological cooperation and trade between the two countries. The delegation also intends to encourage US business people to invest in China and further expand investment and trade cooperation between the two countries. About 800 key investment projects will be offered during the negotiations, including 60 hydroelectric and thermal power stations, 100 highway, railway, airport and wharf construction projects, 200 projects involving machine-building and electrical equipment, 100 electronics projects, 100 petrochemical projects, 50 projects related to metallurgy and other industrial raw materials, and 30 projects involving agriculture, livestock breeding and forestry. Q: How many similar purchasing delegation has China organized in the past, and how much have they influenced the development of Sino- US trade? A: The Chinese government has consistently attached importance to the development of Sino-US economic and trade relations. Since 1990, China has sent four large purchasing delegations to the United States, two for comprehensive purchases and two for automobiles and aircraft. All have yielded good results. The delegations have purchased products valued at over US$3.5 billion, including aircraft, motor vehicles, grain, chemical fertilizers, cotton, petroleum, and machinery and equipment. The purchases have promoted the expansion of Sino-US economic and trade relations. Another purchasing delegation will be sent to the United States during the joint committee's forthcoming session. The actions indicate that the Chinese government attaches great importance to increasing the volume of imports from the United States. Q: China experienced deficits in foreign trade last year, will substantial increases in imports from the United States further expand the deficit, and what influence will they exert on China's overall imports and exports? A: Deficits in Sino-US trade are unavoidable. We believe that a basic balance should be maintained between imports and exports. However, instead of reducing imports, we insist on attaining the goal by expanding exports. Our goal is to import advanced technology and equipment needed for our modernization drive and materials which are in short supply domestically. The value of imports during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95) is expected to reach US$400 billion. At present, about 80 percent of our country's foreign exchange earnings come from exports. If the deficit continues to grow due to the sluggish increases in exports, our foreign exchange income will definitely fall and will in turn adversely affect imports. I hope our trade partners will increase their imports of our commodities, in order to help maintain the coordinated development of bilateral trade. Q: The Chinese economy has developed rapidly and the whole world has expressed great concern about the opening of China's market. What is the current situation regarding the country's market? A: Opening to the outside world was the basic principle adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in late 1978. In recent years, we have further flung wide our market as part of our efforts to open our doors wider to the outside world. Since 1991 alone, we have cut import taxes on 6,537 types of commodities and have abolished the import regulation tax. We have also abandoned all import substitute lists and will refrain from making such lists in the future. We will gradually cut licensing controls on 53 kinds of commodities currently subject to import licence controls. Furthermore, we will bring the role of the market economy into full play as the basis for the optimized allocation of resources, strengthen the guidance of industrial policies, and gradually reduce administrative examination procedures and control. Reform of the management mechanisms of state-owned enterprises has expanded their management autonomy and has granted them more power in terms of imports. Thanks to the series of policies we have adopted to open the market further, the country's imports have grown steadily over the past three years. In 1991, our import value hit US$63.8 billion, up 19.6 percent over 1990. The figure rose even further to US$80.6 billion in 1992, up 26.3 percent over 1991, and to US$103.95 billion in 1993, a rise of 29 percent over 1992. Imports for this year will stay at or above last year's level, and the total import value over the coming seven years is expected to hit US$1,000 billion. The country plans to import 210 key technological items valued at US$30 billion between 1993 and 2000. Along with the reform of the foreign economic and trade system, measures will be taken to further open the market and bring it into line with the international market. Given the above- mentioned facts and well-based predictions, any reasonable person would conclude that China's market is indeed open to the world. I believe that the deepening of the reform of China's foreign economic and trade system will offer even more chances for the entry of foreign commodities into the Chinese market. Q: What is the current status of Sino-US economic and trade relations? A: As everyone knows, Sino-US trade has expanded rapidly since the two countries re-established diplomatic relations in 1979. According to statistics released by China's General Customs Administration, bilateral trade jumped from US$2.45 billion in 1979 to US$27.7 billion last year, a net 12-fold increase. During the same period, investments by US businessmen increased on an annual basis. At present, the number of US-funded projects in China has topped 8,000 with combined contracted investments of US$11 billion, ranking first amongst all overseas investors. More than 50 of the top 500 US firms have established business bases in China. Although some problems occurred in Sino-US trade relations last year, bilateral trade and US investment in China continues to grow. In my view, a major reason for the rapid development of bilateral trade and cooperation rests with the fact that the economies of the two countries have a strong nature of mutual supplementation. The United States possesses advanced technology and funds, while China has vast labor resources and potential markets. Each year, Chinese imports from the United States include large numbers of aircraft, and vast quantities of wheat, chemical fertilizers and other products, as well as machinery and electrical equipment, all of which are well received by Chinese clients and consumers. Along with the constant growth of the Chinese economy, imports from the United States have increased annually, with the value reaching US$6.6 billion, US$8 billion, US$8.9 billion and US$10.7 billion for successive years between 1990 and 1993. Although deficits occurred in foreign trade last year, our imports of raw materials and energy, which faced critical shortages, and machinery and telecommunications equipment needed for further economic development increased considerably. This once again shows that China is a market with tremendous potential and is a market open wide to the outside world. I believe that the sustained growth of China's economy and the country's grand economic development plan will create even more favorable trade and investment opportunities for American enterprises. We sincerely hope the US side will take positive and practical actions, cast aside man-made obstacles, lift controls on technology exports, and quickly resume the US Trade Development Agency's (TDA) financial aid for project feasibility studies, while at the same time providing US investors with risk guarantees from the US Overseas Private Investment Co., and reinstating preferential loans from the American Import and Export Bank to relevant construction projects in China. Such actions will help to further tap the vast potential of China's imports from the United States and US investments in China.
