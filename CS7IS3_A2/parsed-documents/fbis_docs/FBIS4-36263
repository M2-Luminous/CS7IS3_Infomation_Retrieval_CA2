Twenty-three people joined the delegation headed by Jalal Abu-Husayn, Labor's party secretary in Baqa al-Gharbiyya. After receiving permission from the Israeli authorities to travel to Jordan, the delegation met on Jordanian soil with Ratib 'Amr, the minister in charge of the occupied territories [name and title as published], who allegedly told them that King Husayn and Prince Hasan were out of the country. Seeing that you are here to see the king to offer him your condolences on the death of his mother there is no sense in your visit, 'Amr is said to have told them. [passage omitted] It has been learned from sources close to King Husayn in East Jerusalem that the king actually was in Jordan but decided not to grant an audience to the delegation when it transpired that they did not represent the Israeli Arab community and were affiliated with the Labor party. Furthermore, the sources noted, the visit was banned in view of reports on Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew and Arabic that the delegation was carrying a political message to the king from Israeli government sources. Jalal Abu-Husayn would not say whether he had been bearing a political message. Waqf Council sources in East Jerusalem (who arranged the visit of previous delegations) made it categorically clear that the Jordanian authorities were no longer interested in the arrival of condolence delegations calling on the king.
