De Leon said during a news conference that an agreement establishing a timetable for the negotiations and an agreement on human rights with international verification, which were signed last month, make "irreversible" the process to end an armed conflict dating back to 1960. The Guatemalan president explained that the main components of his peace plan are achieving reconciliation, meeting social demands, and ending the armed conflict. He added that these goals are supported by most local sectors and by the international community. "We have never been so close to peace," de Leon Carpio said. He insisted that the human rights agreement was the "Gordian knot" of the negotiations, but that as soon as this is overcome the process will advance more smoothly. The president, however, added that there are certain groups at home or abroad that could take advantage of any strike or social movement to create instability, but that the government is ready to neutralize their actions. As for the establishment of a truth commission or commission on the past, de Leon said that, after an analysis on its advisability, the government concluded that its results could be more negative than favorable to national reconciliation. He pointed out that investigations into serious human rights violations would be biased against the Army because "there are documents only" on this sector and not on the actions carried out by the guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG). "If the goal of that (truth) commission were to strengthen peace, the government would support its creation, but it could, however, widen the gap, open new wounds, and cause further polarization," the head of state added. Ramiro de Leon Carpio insisted that "the ideal" would be for Guatemalan society to learn the facts, learn who was responsible, and have them face justice, but said that "there are conditions that render this difficult -- there is currently consensus in this regard -- but the government is always willing to discuss this." As for a joint declaration issued on Sunday by the Central American presidents in support of peace negotiations in Guatemala, de Leon Carpio said that it is a recognition of government efforts and an initiative to strengthen the "final stretch" of the process. He pointed out that certain rulers, such as Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador and Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua, are experienced in this kind of process "and understand that the final route presents certain obstacles, some of which are natural and others provoked." Besides Cristiani and Chamorro, the declaration was signed by Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, who took office on Sunday, and by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina. Panamanian President Guillermo Endara attended neither Figueres' inaugural nor the "mini-summit" in which economic issues were also analyzed, because general elections were being held in that country. The rulers called on the URNG to "give clear signs of its political determination to reach the firm and lasting peace that all Guatemalans are demanding and that all Central Americans long for." Ramiro de Leon Carpio, however, pointed out that his colleague's call does not mean that the guerrilla group has not shown a willingness to end the armed conflict, because it signed agreements on human rights and on a timetable for the negotiations.
