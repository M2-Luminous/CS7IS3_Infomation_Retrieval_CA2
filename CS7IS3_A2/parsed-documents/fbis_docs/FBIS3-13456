Has this citizen been identified? And what is your response to Iraq's accusation that this citizen was sent by the Kuwaiti Intelligence Service? [Hamud] The Iraqi regime has always tried to hamper any progress in Kuwait. It has always tried to tarnish Kuwait's image in front of the international community. I believe this story was fabricated by the Iraqi media, which has experience in such fabrications. We will not try to identify this person because he might be an Iraqi who was wearing a Kuwait dress and claimed to be a Kuwaiti citizen. The Iraqi regime is used to such farces. This person might have also been in Kuwait before the invasion and the Iraqi regime is now claiming that he works for Kuwaiti Intelligence. The Iraqi regime is known for these fabrications. I believe that if there were Nobel prizes for media fabrications the Iraqi regime would be the winner. [passage omitted] [Al-Mash'an] There have been reports that another trench will be dug on the northern border. What is the purpose of this? [Hamud] A plan has been set to build a security wall. One of its phases is to dig the trench. Once the digging of the trench is completed we will embark on the second phase, etc., until we finish the three-phase plan. [passage omitted] [Al-Mash'an] When will the Central Committee begin to study the status of the al-Bidun [stateless persons]? Did the committee create a plan to solve this problem? [Hamud] The Central Committee is working to set up its headquarters and to recruit employees. After the 'Id, I will meet with the Central Committee to create a plan, lay its foundations, and begin the committee's working plan. The committee will then announce the steps it will follow in its work. It will also explain the way to submit applications to this committee. I would like to settle this issue as soon as possible. I am confident that the brothers who were consulted and who agreed to be members of the committee will do their utmost. We wish them success in their work to solve this problem. [passage omitted]
