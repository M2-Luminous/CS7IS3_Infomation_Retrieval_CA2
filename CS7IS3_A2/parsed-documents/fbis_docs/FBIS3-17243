It went under the banners "Down With OMON [Special Missions Militia Detachment] Terror," "Shame on Provocateurs," and "Defend the People's Mayor." The main theme in the speeches of the former city administrator V. Gilgenberg and a number of other former city administration functionaries, as well as figures from the Voters Association and city residents sympathetic to them, was that V. Cherepkov became the victim of a crude provocation organized and sanctioned by kray authorities and local court and low enforcement bodies. As usual, however, not a shred of proof was presented. Those who decidedly did not share this viewpoint--and there were more than enough of them-- were not given the floor, naturally. Former Mayor V. Cherepkov's address to the citizens was greeted with applause. In conclusion, rally participants adopted an appeal to the Russian Federation bodies of state power (the State Duma, the Federation Council, the General Procuracy, and others), also addressed to all Russian Federation citizens. In addition, the Voters Association issued a statement that in the event elections are not held on the original date of 27 March, it will hold another rally in Vladivostok at 1400 next Saturday. From the Editors: Monday morning the kray electoral commission consultant G. Popov confirmed that, judging from the speech yesterday by kray head Nazdratenko on local radio and television (Channel 3), elections to the Kray Duma and local self-rule bodies have indeed been moved, to 23 October of this year.
