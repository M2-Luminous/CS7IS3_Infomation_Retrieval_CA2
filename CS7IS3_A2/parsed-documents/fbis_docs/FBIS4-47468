Hydrodynamic characteristics and contact phase surface formation mechanism were studied in a previous work, and their high efficiency as compared with traditionally used mass transfer columns in contact devices of the bubble type has been demonstrated. In the present work the operating efficiency of fabric-type contact devices was evaluated in relation to basic hydrodynamic process parameters of the desorption of carbon dioxide from water with air. A mass transfer mechanism is proposed which is based on the existence and mutual effects of two types of contact surface phases having different restoration mechanisms. The mechanisms and formulas were confirmed experimentally. Figures 3; references 6 (Russian).
