"His suggestion that the homeland is financially self-sufficient is also absurd." Mangope should do as the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) requires and "allow free political activity in the homeland and change his government's attitude from resistance to co-operation. The final outcome is now inevitable, but the Mangope government must ensure that it is reached without more tears." BUSINESS DAY Housing Minister-TEC Confrontation -- Referring to the confrontation between Housing Minister Louis Shill and the TEC over Shill's "jumping the gun on the announcement of the R90 billion [rand] housing scheme," Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 10 March in a page-14 editorial says Shill has "shown poor judgment in taking on the TEC, and he is compounding his mistake by continuing to defy the council, whose legal position may be stronger than Shill believes." "There is little doubt that in announcing the housing programme, Shill was seeking to win credit for the National Party. The TEC was thus quite within its rights to rule his announcement an unfair electioneering tactic." BEELD Conservative Party Looking Vulnerable -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 4 March says in a page-8 editorial: "It is becoming clearer that the ripples which followed the remarkable Mandela-Buthelezi summit are only now beginning to make themselves felt. Ironically, what happened between two black leaders has thus far had its greatest impact on the lily-white Conservative Party [CP]. There could hardly be a better example of the irrelevance of the CP's whites-only politics. The fact that Mr. Mandela was able to persuade Mr. Buthelezi to consider registering provisionally for the election threw the Freedom Alliance, and in particular the CP, off balance. Without the IFP and Mr. Buthelezi who supported them in what they wanted to achieve, the CP suddenly looks uncertain and vulnerable." "Right-wingers are clearly beginning to realize in increasing numbers that participation in elections is the essence of politics. If it also means that the homeland ideal will be striven for in an orderly, constitutional manner, then the option becomes that much more attractive." Viljoen Should Press Ahead Democratically -- "After three painful humiliations, General Constand Viljoen ought to realize that the radical elements in the right wing, who unfortunately form the majority, want nothing to do with being reasonable," notes an editorial on page 8 of Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 7 March. "They seek confrontation, and as a result they are becoming an increasing danger to South Africa." "In the process the hero of yesterday and the day before -- the Moses who was to lead his people to freedom -- has become the 'traitor.' That is how cruelly the right wing treats those who offer choices different from the extremism of Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg and Mr. Eugene Terreblanche." "Gen. Viljoen must know that his entrance into politics, which held so much expectation, has now been virtually stripped of all credibility. He tried to use shuttle diplomacy between the radicals and the moderates in the Afrikaner National Front (AVF) as well as with the government and the African National Congress (ANC), but he is being increasingly rejected by his people." "Last Friday Gen. Viljoen registered the Freedom Front political party with the aim of participating in the election. There are indications that the decision was thoroughly planned, and must have been the result of strategic consideration, not a sudden impulse. We only hope that Gen. Viljoen and his spiritual allies do not allow themselves to be trampled by the AVF. We urge them to press on with their plans to fight for their homeland in an orderly, democratic manner."
