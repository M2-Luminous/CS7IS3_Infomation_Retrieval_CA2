Meeting with Qiao Shi, visiting chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, here this afternoon, Stich said China, which has a long history, exerts important influence on the world and is playing an important role in the United Nations. China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, he said, adding that the U.N. role in safeguarding the world peace is never like what it is playing now. He said China's role in the international security is of great importance to the world peace and security. Stich expressed his satisfaction with the growth of Switzerland- China relations and spoke highly of China's rapid economic development. He said Switzerland is very much interested in further expanding its economic ties with China. "The two countries have cooperated well in the UNESCO. We hope such cooperation will be extended to other areas," he said. Stich said he welcomed China restoring its status as a signatory party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Qiao expressed thanks for it, saying that this will not only benefit China's domestic economic growth, but also help promote the convergence with international economy and cooperation and the world peace as well. He told Stich that this morning he held talks with his German [as received] counterpart Gret Haller and met with head of Federal Department of Foreign Affairs Flavio Cotti and exchanged views with them on bilateral ties and issues of common interest. This will play a positive role in increasing mutual understanding and promoting the growth of bilateral ties, Qiao said. He said after the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in 1950, bilateral ties have been normally developed. Following the implementation of the policy of China's reform and opening up, such ties have been progressing steadily. "We are satisfied with the development of bilateral economic ties and trade. The exchanges between the two countries in culture, science and technology are fruitful," he said. Qiao said Switzerland is a country with high working efficiency and one of the highly developed countries in Europe. "It is our hope that bilateral ties will be boosted in various fields under the care of the president," he said. "We welcome more Swiss friends including members of the Federal Assembly and personages from all walks of life to China for visit. China is also willing to know more about Switzerland and draw on the latter's successful experiences," he said. Strengthening personnel exchanges between the two sides will bring benefits to facilitating mutual understanding. At the same time, he said China welcomes more Swiss entrepreneurs to China for investment. He said China pays great attention to maintaining its domestic stability. As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, it is willing to work together with all developing countries and developed countries including Switzerland to safeguard the world peace and promote the progress for the mankind. "It is our consistent view that maintaining the world peace is closely linked with China's economic construction. "So long as the world is peaceful and China is stable and united, its economic construction is hopeful," he said.
