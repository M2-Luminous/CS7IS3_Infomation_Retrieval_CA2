Baranov; place and date not given: "It Is Still Gloomy in Crimea"] [Text] A local constitution and parliament already exist on the Crimean peninsula, and there is also a president. The election of the president, however, is only half the issue. While daisies bloom in Alupka a session of the "main" parliament, lacking a speaker, is working out a new political course. Ivan Ermakov, a deputy of the Supreme Council of the Crimean republic, is our interlocutor. [Baranov] Ivan Fedosovich, elections indicated that the great majority of Crimeans are pro-Russian. Does it seem to you that Mr. Meshkov won a very perilous victory and should the Crimean parliament allow for the president with a speaker more familiar to Kiev? [Ermakov] The experience of numerous elections of recent years indicated that we are still not so much living with democracy as playing at it. Candidates, making fantastic promises, are playing, and the voters are also playing, forcing themselves to believe the obvious fantasies. In a month or so neither the one elected nor, surprisingly enough, the voters themselves recall those election campaign promises. I feel confident that Crimeans voted not so much for the person or his position as in opposition to the official course. As far as the "president-speaker" line is concerned, it is impossible to push through a convenient figure in our parliament. If Kiev wants to affect the state of affairs in Crimea, it is necessary to sharply change the position with respect to the republic, fulfilling numerous promises and taking decisive steps to expand economic rights of the region--right up to the creation of a free economic zone on the peninsula [Baranov] What do you believe would be the advantages and disadvantages of Crimea having two currencies in circulation? [Ermakov] Until a decision is made regarding a free economic zone in the Crimean region it is difficult for me to imagine a mechanism involving circulation of two currencies. If the SEZ (Free Economic Zone] is created, however, then the advantages are self-evident. That is indicated by international experience. [Baranov] There is a lot of talk in Moscow about the desire of the Russian community in Crimea to take part in the political life of Russia. Is that really so? [Ermakov] So far there have been too many problems within Crimea because of which that is hardly possible today. But the desire is an understandable one and I share it. [Baranov] Will the citizens of Crimea be able to obtain dual citizenship? [Ermakov] This topic was included in practically all of the election campaigns, including my own. An issue that important should not be put off. But neither the president of Crimea nor parliament have plans concerning secession from Ukraine, particularly in the light of economic disintegration, collapse of the financial system, and in the long-term, possibly the loss of statehood. We shall see what new members of the Ukrainian parliament will say--I am hoping for common sense. [Baranov] Speaking of common sense. Is resumption of work on the construction of the Crimean Atomic Electric Power Station possible? [Ermakov] The probability of that is low: first of all, everything has long ago been pilfered, and, secondly, it is necessary to return to the numerous expert reviews and determine whether it was emotion or real miscalculations by designers that did not permit the completion of this construction project. My view is that atomic electric power stations should not be built in Crimea. That would be a sin. Particularly since we have completely unique natural conditions for creation of ecologically pure sources of energy such as solar power stations. [Baranov] What should Crimeans and Russian vacationers expect from the opening of a national bank and a currency exchange market this year? Crimean coupons? [Ermakov] Because of the absence of a printing facility there can be no talk of a local currency. One should likewise not expect any radical improvement with the resolution of questions of financial health, but the problem with cash, credit, and foreign currency accounts will be eased. A true solution lies in the extension of statehood or the creation of a SEZ [Baranov] Who will the Crimean customs service be protecting? The vacationers? [Ermakov] So far talk about a customs service is limited to rumors. [Baranov] What if a "Russian Crimea" movement should appear tomorrow in Russia, or, in the manner of Aksenov, some "ideas concerning a common fate," what would the attitude be toward that in Crimea? [Ermakov] Like every normal person, I would welcome any movement in Russia, as well as in Belarus or Kazakhstan, which could benefit the people of Crimea with its multi-national population.
