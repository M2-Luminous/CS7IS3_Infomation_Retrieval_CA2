Tashbulatova, GUDOK correspondent: "We Learned How To Spend, We Will Learn How To Earn: Notes from the Fifth Assembly of Railroad Chiefs"] [Text] The results of 1993 and the results of the first two months of this year upset all the calculations: instead of the predicted drop in the transport volume, in the range of 4 percent, by last December the reduction had reached 20 percent and more. This recession continued in March. Despite the rigid stand of a number of railroads, they did not succeed in achieving any sudden change in remuneration for transport. As before, the mining, oil- and gas-extracting sectors, as well as enterprises of the chemical and timber complex, were insolvent. A number of major Russian enterprises periodically shut down and stopped shipping goods. The situation was similar on virtually every railroad. The problems of advance financing were exacerbated, both with respect to transfer of funds by the MPS [Ministry of Railways] and settlement of accounts with other railroads and enterprises. That is why the sector's "brain center" assembled in Yekaterinburg. The assembly constituted not only a unique training aid and exchange of opinions of the road directors, but also a means of working out future strategy and tactics. The measures outlined were obviously inadequate. The joint efforts of the roads to seek levers of influence on the deepest strata of the railroad economy had to be coordinated. As O. Sharadze, chief of the Gorkiy Railroad, said, because of the changed conditions, structural changes were necessary as well. "Whereas before, they pressed transportation on us and we had to decide how we were to convey things, now, in my opinion, the structures which are earning money have to be moved to the foreground. We all learned how to spend, but few learned how to earn. Therefore, I feel: we need to perform a structural reorganization so that the economy is in the foreground. This is the basis of all bases." Three main blocks of questions were singled out at the assembly. These were the economic interaction of the roads with respect to carrying out the government decree "On the Position of the Russian Economy and Prospects for Its Development in 1994" and the statutes passed by the MPS Collegium on 11 March 1994; improving the transport process, or rather, reorganizing it, in conformity with the new conditions, and carrying out state programs for traffic safety. I. Besedin, deputy minister, in speaking to the assembly participants, devoted his main attention to following a flexible tariff policy and granting broader rights in this respect to the railroad chiefs. As we know, a one-ruble rise in the tariff for transport will lead to a five-fold increase in prices on the commodity market. Meanwhile, along with insolvency, the increase in tariffs played a decisive role in the deterioration of the sector's economic situation. While in 1991, the increase in tariffs had virtually no effect on transport volumes, and many things in the economy were still moving due to inertia, the first abrupt crisis arrived in May-June 1992, when tariffs all in all rose by a factor of 62 compared with the 1989 price list. The situation then stabilized somewhat, but in November 1993, after the next rise in tariffs, by a factor of 1.5, a second crisis occurred: freight turnover dropped by practically 30 percent and more, and carriage charges began to be greatly in excess of the value of the goods transported. Within the limits of a single mainline, following a flexible tariff policy -- whom and how much does it benefit -- is within the jurisdiction of the railroad chief. But what happens when freight travels over two to three roads or more? The participants in the assembly suggested several perspectives on the solution to this problem. In the first place, granting rebates and concluding the appropriate contracts with the consignors of the dispatching road by telegraphed agreement with the road of destination. In the second place, it was proposed that for an operative and qualified solution to the problems of regulating tariffs in through service and for market research, with the development of the appropriate recommendations on organizing transport and tariff policy, a network marketing center, so to speak, a tariff administration, be created at the MPS. The next perspective had already been discussed at the MPS Collegium. The overall level of tariffs today is such that railroad workers have begun to lose out in the competition with motor vehicle transport, where the growth rates of the tariffs are lower -- not to mention small shipments and perishable freight, as well as reinforced concrete items and building materials, and moreover for long distances. The advantage in the tariffs stems from the fact that the production cost of motor vehicle transport does not include expenditures to maintain the highways. Meanwhile, the railroad workers, through tax on the railroad funds, by means of their own expenditures and accordingly, tariffs, even finance the motorists. On granting broader rights to the road chiefs.... This is a two-edged weapon, a serious question. Why? The railroad workers are regarded as monopolists, hence it is natural that the anti-monopoly committee pays close attention to railroad directors. Some railroads have already had to pay millions in fines for this reason. Here we need the skilled work of specialists, lawyers and economists, careful, impeccable work on preparing contracts and fulfilling all the necessary requirements. The MPS drew up methodological instructions, which give recommendations, scientifically and with substantiation, on organizing transport and the tariff policy. The assembly also paid great attention to problems of improving cost-accounting relations within the sector. The method of formulating and the level of accounting prices for the transport of freight and passengers in through service, along with the volumes of transport, prove to have a considerable effect on the financial results of the railroads. For most of them, the relative proportion of transport in through service and the revenues from it is overwhelming. Many years of practical experience show that the existing system of accounting prices does not meet the requirements of an objective evaluation of the railroads' financial-economic activity. The roads are not interested in seeking and realizing reserves for the rise and fall of expenses. For example, the Sverdlovsk Railroad had a 15-billion loss from transport in January, while the Baykal-Amur had a 15-billion profit. If one considers that the transport volumes on the Sverdlovsk are considerably higher, and the production cost is much lower than on BAM, this polarity in financial results can be explained only by the absence of objective criteria for formulating accounting prices. The identical level of profitability incorporated in accounting prices gives the advantage to roads which have a high production cost. For example, passenger transport is unprofitable. The size of the losses are tremendous, but meanwhile, given the existing formulation of accounting prices, the roads performing the largest volume of passenger transport are the most profitable. Is this not a paradox? The time is not only ripe, but over-ripe for a return to the tariff principle of distribution. Today even with unified tariffs the obvious economic problems can be solved through the Russian government. If BAM, for example, with the present tariffs, is unprofitable, everyone should know about it. The size of its losses should be known precisely. Today, however, reliable, and moreover accessible information on the economic situation of the railroads is practically non-existent. After all, every director wants to see the situation of his own road against the background of others, in order to evaluate the success of his actions and to determine the problems that require joint efforts. The Sverdlovsk Mainline proposed its own variant -- territorially differentiated tariffs. To accelerate their introduction one must take a look at practical experience and see what is happening as a result of this on individual sections. Let us say, with the next indexing of freight tariffs, by decision of the Russian Committee on Prices, a virtual coefficient is established for the Tobolsk-Surgut section, and so on, the road having been granted the right to exact and direct toward its income the corresponding additional carriage charge accompanying the dispatch and arrival of freight. A proposal was also introduced on rescinding the material responsibility of the roads for failure to adhere to the limit for financing transit roads. The road collectives should not bear the responsibility for the imperfection of the income distribution system. Wages constitute a large part of the operating expenses, and therefore, given the continuing recession in transport, one must not avoid taking note of this part of the expenses. This problem will be solved, in the first place through changing the work conditions for low-activity sections and stations, leaving the reserves of refrigerator rolling stock and the locomotive fleet alone, and taking organizational and technological measures. Today, however, although this question was also raised at the MPS Collegium, there is no proper basis for norms determining the number of workers on the basis of the drop in transport volumes and the accounting fund for labor wages. Many of the existing normatives and norms for service have grown obsolete and are unsuitable for the present-day situation. Meanwhile, dissonance is introduced by the main administrations, which sometimes instruct the roads to increase the number of individual categories of workers and demand that certain technological and other structural subdivisions be newly created. Every road acts on its own here. For example, the Sverdlovsk has put the emphasis on improving labor organization, and has used home duty, a fragmented work day, combining jobs within an enterprise and a short work day. All this, of course, was approved by the trade union. The assembly proposed that the existing tariff rates and wages on the railroads be reduced to unified rates and wages, established for the network according to the vocational qualifications of groups of workers, based on differences and difficulty, in accordance with the Tariff Agreement. Under the conditions of the sharp drop in the transport volume, the problem of setting quotas for the railcar fleet is a very urgent one. On the roads, the non-operating fleet -- MPS reserves, technological reserves, railcars belonging on spur tracks and those not in good working order -- sometimes exceed the operating fleet. The quota as a norm determining the minimum maintenance of the total railcar fleet for the volume of operations has lost its regulatory function. The station tracks are literally crammed with excess rolling stock. Under these conditions, an above-quota payment is added to the roads' additional expenditures to maintain an excess fleet, which should be compensated in accordance with a centralized procedure. It turns out that a road is penalized twice. It was therefore proposed that the financial responsibility of the railroads for adherence to the quota be eliminated, since the roads are virtually devoid of any possibility of regulating the fleets to adjust them to the established norm. The classic indicators for the use of rolling stock -- such as "work car turnover" -- are also obsolete. On transferring part of the locomotive fleet to other roads. How many documents have the main administrations passed, but there have been no substantial changes. For example, V. Predybaylov, chief of the Northern Railroad, complained that there are not enough diesel locomotives on the mainline, while there is an excess of electric locomotives. Another road uses old ones, which long ago worked out their motor life, such as VL22 electric locomotives. These problems, of course would be more easily solved by the road directors than through the main administrations, as is done today. "This assembly is distinguished from others by the fact that the Sverdlovsk has shown us the way a road interacts with the VPK [military-industrial complex]," said I. Paristyy, chief of the Moscow Railroad. We have already told, on the pages of GUDOK, of the goods produced by the Machine Building Plant imeni Kalinin. The visit made to Uralvagonzavod left no lesser impression on the participants in the assembly. The road chiefs were already familiar with many of the items of the "railcar maker" -- gondolas, tank cars with up-to-date modifications, in no way inferior to foreign analogs -- these are, so to speak, purely railroad items. But the forklift trucks, excavators and agricultural equipment for home vegetable gardens -- these were really impressive. The meeting with V. Seryakov, director of the Uralvagonzavod Production Association, was also interesting. At Kamensk-Uralskiy, the assembly participants visited the Oktyabr Production Association, and familiarized themselves with the latest innovations in the aircraft industry and, of course, with the production of an automatic locomotive braking control system (SAUT-II), on the development of which scientists from VNIIZhT [All-Union Railroad Transport Scientific Research Institute] and Oktyabr specialists collaborated. "We obtained a great deal of valuable information, related not only to stabilizing the sector's economy, but also to solving many practical problems on the Sverdlovsk Mainline," noted A. Ivanov, chief of the Far Eastern Railroad. "I, a student of the Ural school, am proud that the Sverdlovsk Railroad is giving an example of the way one must operate under today's difficult conditions."
