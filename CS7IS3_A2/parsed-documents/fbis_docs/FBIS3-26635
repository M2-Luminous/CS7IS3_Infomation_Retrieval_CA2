Qian Qichen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, attended today's tea party and extended cordial greetings to all State Council counselors and Central Research Institute of Culture staff on behalf of the State Council. In his speech, Vice Premier Qian Qichen said in the soon-to-be-elapsed Chinese calendar year, the entire party and the people of all nationalities in the nation have, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party basic line, seized the opportunity, deepened reform, and made solid efforts in realizing the establishment of a socialist market economic system. In the past year, China achieved rapid economic growth; the market thrived; the standard of living level improved; society enjoyed stability; people of all nationalities showed solidarity; various social undertakings achieved new progress; the anticorruption struggle led by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, which won the hearts and minds of the people, scored initial results; diplomatic work showed marked results, creating a more advantageous international environment for our country's economic construction. We are also pleased to know that the multiparty cooperation and political consultative system, under CPC leadership, has been further consolidated and that the party's united front work has been constantly strengthened. Members of the Communist Party and various democratic parties and patriots without party affiliation showing utter devotion to one other, sharing weal and woe, and joining in discussing national affairs have become an important feature in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The coming Chinese new year will be particularly crucial for building our country's socialist market economy as a number of major reform measures will be introduced that year. It is necessary to continuously give play to the political superiority of the united front work in the new period, to mobilize all positive factors, seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, and accelerate the pace of building the socialist market economic system. Qian Qichen said that in the past year, the state counselors conducted a massive number of investigations and enthusiastically advanced proposals on government work, to which leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and relevant departments attached great importance. Central Research Institute of Culture and History staff members worked diligently and achieved marked results in various social and cultural undertakings. In addition, Central Research Institute of Culture and History counselors and staff members also established ties with various overseas circles, forged friendships with them, and contributed to economic and cultural exchanges between China and overseas areas and to the great cause of reunification. At the tea party, State Council Counselors Office and Central Research Institute of Culture and History representatives reviewed their work in the past year and expressed their wishes to continue contributing to socialist modernization construction and to the building of spiritual and material civilizations with their knowledge and special skills.
