Commenting on the anti-war, anti-nuke demonstration staged by citizens and students in Seoul Tuesday after a rally marking the 75th anniversary of the March 1 popular uprising, the analyst says: These days the United States is working to arm its troops present in South Korea with Patriot missiles and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, dancing to its drum-beating, is making a frantic bid to introduce this sophisticated weapon even into the puppet army. The planned shipment of Patriots into South Korea by the U.S. and South Korean warmaniacs is a crime intended to drive the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. The prevailing grave situation urges the South Korean people and students to turn out in the anti-war, anti-nuke struggle so as to remove the danger of war and defend the security of the nation. It is quite natural that they are vigorously waging this struggle. The South Korean people and students will decisively crush the maneuverings of the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique to provoke a nuclear war by invigorating the anti-war, anti-nuke struggle.
