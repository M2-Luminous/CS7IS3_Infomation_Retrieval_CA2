FR941028-0-00067 FR941028-0-00009 OSM appreciates the commenter's suggestion. OSM believes, however, that persons should have the opportunity to seek review of the agency's decision by OHA as soon as possible upon the agency's determination that they are linked, through ownership or control, to violations. In the absence of a final agency decision, such review by OHA would not be routinely available. Accordingly, the proposed regulation provides for a final agency decision which may then be appealed to OHA by a challenger. If a challenger has new information which would lead OHA to conclude that the challenger is likely to win a reversal of OSM's decision, then such information would support temporary relief with respect to the decision. On the other hand, where OSM has reviewed information submitted and concluded that an ownership or control link has been severed, OSM may choose to reserve the right to reopen such decision in the event that new information or evidence comes to light subsequently. Such reservation of the right to reopen by the agency would be necessary to assure that the agency can correct its mistakes and assure the accuracy of the AVS. Thus, OSM can supplement the record with information discovered subsequent to any decision. Accordingly, OSM has determined not to adopt the commenter's proposal. In accordance with the above discussion, OSM has decided to adopt a final version of §773.24 which is substantively similar to the proposed version. OSM has, however, made some minor modifications to the proposed rule which are now described. In paragraph (a)(1) of the proposed rule, the rule provided for the challenge of links by persons linked to any person cited in a Federal or State violation notice. At the time that this proposal was published in September, 1991, OSM expected that most challenges would be by persons seeking to challenge links to violators to avoid permit blocks. In actuality, members of the regulated community have also routinely come before OSM seeking to challenge ownership or control links to persons who are not violators. The language of the proposal did not reflect this reality and was, therefore, too narrow. Further, the language was potentially inconsistent with language contained in the 1988 preamble to OSM's ownership and control rules. In that preamble, OSM stated, in relevant part, as follows: Procedures to Amend Applicant Violator System Information. In addition to the procedures described above, both individuals and organizations may seek to amend the information in the Applicant Violator System, independent of the existence of a permit application if they believe that the records are not accurate, relevant, timely or complete. See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38879 (October 3, 1988). Accordingly, the final rule broadens the proposed language to provide that ``[a]ny applicant or other person shown in AVS in an ownership or control link to any person may challenge such link'' even if the link is to persons who are not violators. OSM intends to protect due process rights and provide an efficient avenue to challenge information shown on AVS. The substance of paragraph (a)(1) of the rule proposed in September, 1991 is otherwise retained. Proposed §773.24 has been further modified to delete references in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) to proposed §773.26 and substitute references to final §773.25 in the place of the deleted section references. This reflects OSM's renumbering of the sections of the proposed rule. No substantive change in the rule has been made by such modification. Paragraph (b) of proposed §773.24 would have required that a person seeking to challenge ownership or control links or the status of Federal violations submit to OSM a written explanation of the basis for his or her challenge and provide relevant evidentiary materials and supporting documents. Proposed paragraph (b) did not explicitly state that the process of challenge described in this paragraph applied to links shown in AVS. That was OSM's intent, however, as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule. Accordingly, OSM has corrected the oversight in the rule language by explicitly incorporating this language into this final rule.
