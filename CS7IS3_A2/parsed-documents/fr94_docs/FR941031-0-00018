FR941031-0-00018 FR941031-0-00007 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 14 CFR Part 1215 RIN 2700&hyph;AA29 Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) AGENCY: National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NASA is amending 14 CFR Part 1215, ``Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS),'' by revising Appendix A to reflect the estimated service rates in 1995 dollars for TDRSS standard services, based on NASA escalation estimates. 14 CFR Part 1215 sets forth the policy governing the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) services provided to non-U.S. Government users and the reimbursement for rendering such services. The TDRSS represents a major investment by the U.S. Government with the primary goal of providing improved communications and tracking services to spacecraft in low earth orbit or to mobile terrestrial users such as aircraft or balloons. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of Space Communications, Code O, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Eugene Ferrick, 202&hyph;358&hyph;2030. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This regulation was first published in the Federal Register on March 9, 1983 (48 FR 9845). Each year since that time, 14 CFR Part 1215 has been amended by revising Appendix A to reflect the rate changes for the appropriate calendar years (CY). Since this revision of Appendix A to 14 CFR Part 1215 reflects the rate changes for CY 1995 and involves NASA management procedures and decisions, no public comment is required. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has determined that this rule is not subject to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, since it will not exert a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291.
