It has been two years since the Ukrainian Armed Forces were established. So, this question is still on everyone's mind today. This is understandable, because such issues as defense, armed forces, and defense budget are the center of attention in any country, the more so when a country only begins to reestablish its statehood, including its defense structures and mechanisms. Currently, these issues are vigorously discussed by the Ukrainian people at all levels -- in the legislature, the government, and the media. The Ukrainian Supreme Council has adopted a military doctrine and examined a concept of Ukrainian state security. One of the most important issues is, of course, the problem of nuclear weapons. Many controversies have been triggered by the debate over this issue, which becomes more vehement every day. In this article, I would like to touch upon a few aspects of this topic. First of all, is Ukraine a nuclear state? Everybody must understand that currently it is not. It is not the same to have rights to be a nuclear state (Ukraine undoubtedly has such rights) and to be one. At this time, Ukraine can neither use these weapons (Ukraine does not possess the control systems), nor is it able to independently provide secure and efficient maintenance of them (this is the sole competence of the producers of these weapons, who are not controlled by Ukraine). This way, the statements on "our" nuclear weapons that "do not have to be turned back to anybody," or on Ukraine's nuclear status, politely speaking, are not justified. A simple decision to detain the nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian territory will not make our country a nuclear state. Secondly, can Ukraine become a nuclear state? To become a real nuclear state, it is necessary to go through the entire process that other nuclear states have experienced, meaning to develop full-value nuclear potential (except the designing and production already existing in Ukraine). Should a decision on Ukraine's nuclear status be adopted, it will be necessary to develop our own nuclear-warhead technology, appropriate production forces, scientific potential, as well as solve the issue of nuclear testing (meaning to find a place on Ukraine's highly populated territory where tests could be conducted, since only countries that have well-developed nuclear weapons systems can introduce a moratorium on nuclear tests -- it is not possible to develop new nuclear weapons without testing). Theoretically, Ukraine is able to solve most of these problems (I will not say how many billions of karbovanetses or even dollars it would cost). However, it should be pointed out that given the current economic circumstances, this could be too heavy a burden. Thirdly, what could be the consequences of such a decision? It is not hard to predict the political consequences of such a decision. It is obvious that we will have to forget about help from other countries, in practically all fields. The sanctions against Iraq and South Africa should be remembered. A possibility of more decisive acts by other countries should also be taken into consideration, provided that those countries are really concerned about Ukraine's nuclear program. The military actions against Iraq's nuclear facilities may be cited as an example. This way, analyzing the political, economic, and military aspects of national security, it is hard to avoid the feeling that the "nuclear option" might not strengthen but weaken Ukraine's security. Additionally, nobody claims that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are not strong enough to protect the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, including deterrence measures. This can be provided by an army with conventional equipment, given its modern organization, the proper training of servicemen, and appropriate weapons. Undoubtedly, Ukraine's defense policy provides for strategic objectives that are to be conducted by the strategic forces. However, these forces and objectives cannot be confused with the temporarily united CIS Nuclear Forces. Not attempting to dwell on the strictly military aspects of this issue, it should be pointed out that besides such types of armed forces as infantry, air force, antiaircraft defense, and a navy, Ukraine should also have strategic forces, or at least a strategic command of Ukraine's Armed Forces. It must be understood that such forces should play a dual role -- to be a potential deterrent, meaning that the nature of their weaponry should deter a potential enemy, and to conduct regular strategic assignments. They could include such deterrence-strategic forces as the Missile Deterrence Forces, equipped with conventional weapons allowed by international agreements. First of all, such equipment should include highly accurate cruise missiles with appropriate ranges, ballistic missiles with highly accurate warheads of high yield, and nonnuclear intercontinental missiles, provided strict adherence to appropriate international agreements. Ukraine has defined its path to nuclear-free status. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian Strategic Forces can have conventional missile systems of appropriate ranges. The more so, because these missiles can be equipped with conventional warheads, particularly, with volume-explosive [obyemno-vybukhova diya], kinetic, and vacuum action modes. By the way, the firepower of these missiles, as well as of certain artillery systems, resembles that of certain weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear arms. I would put somewhat aside the possibility of using intercontinental ballistic missiles. The most important issue in this regard is the military expediency of such missiles and their maintenance. Installing conventional warheads on strategic ballistic missiles would be expedient only in case a warhead has a high energy yield, like the ones in volume-explosive and kinetic warheads. Otherwise, sending a few hundred kilograms of TNT to another continent would make no sense. Another problem is the possibility of developing, servicing, and improving such kinds of weapons. It is no secret that Ukraine is producing strategic intercontinental missiles. To equip them with nonnuclear warheads does not seem very complicated. However, such sophisticated carriers as intercontinental ballistic missiles should be occasionally tested. However, there are no appropriate testing grounds in Ukraine. So, it is necessary to reach an agreement on testing our missiles with Kazakhstan or Russia, where such facilities exist. The number and storage of such missiles also require deep consideration. Longevity and efficiency of these weapons depends on these factors. An appropriate missile-attack warning system is also very important. Without it, intercontinental ballistic missiles, especially those in silos, could become easy targets of a first strike due to their inability to launch a counterattack. The final decision, of course, rests with military specialists. Ukraine has some TU-160, TU-95, and TU-22m heavy bombers. Whereas the practically experimental TU-160 bombers, without spare parts and ground facilities, have a problematic value for Ukraine as strategic weaponry (they are useless as nuclear-capable aircraft due to their tactical and technical parameters), the TU-95 and TU-22m bombers have undoubted value for strategic tasks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The nuclear TU-95 bombers deployed in Ukraine can be converted into nonnuclear ones, which is allowed by the START I treaty, provided their further maintenance in Ukraine. There is no doubt about the expediency of using TU-95 bombers as heavy nuclear- capable aircraft, strategic surveillance aircraft, or reconnaissance aircraft. For example, heavy B-52 bombers with conventional munitions used by the United States in Vietnam proved highly effective. The modern TU-22m airplanes are also renowned throughout the world as counter antiaircraft forces, thanks to their superb technical parameters. Moreover, they are classified as conventional weapons. Such powerful long-range air forces could perform important deterrence assignments in the framework of Ukraine's military doctrine. Additionally, their second purpose could be launching powerful strategic and conventional attacks during regular combat. A considerable part of the Black Sea Fleet could also conduct Ukraine's strategic missions. The protection of Ukraine's southern sea borders is part of Ukraine's strategic defense. Submarines and vessels armed with cruise missiles and other kinds of advanced- technology weapons can successfully perform such duties. According to the present military doctrine, these forces may conduct strategic defense tasks in the place of nuclear weapons. The Airborne Forces are equipped with all kinds of modern aircraft, such as heavy AN-22 and IL-76 planes, as well as medium and light AN-72, AN-26, and AN-2 airplanes, which are equipped with special landing weapons and have adequately trained personnel (the remains of the 98th Division could become the core of these forces). The Airborne Forces should also be subordinated to the strategic command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, since they are also performing strategic duties. The Ukrainian Strategic Forces could also comprise certain mechanized well-armed infantry battalions, regiments, and brigades, which should be able to operate independently. The main units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces should be strong enough, first of all, to help the Strategic Forces repel any potential aggressor, and secondly, to prevent any possible encroachment on Ukrainian territory. All these forces should be mobile enough to conduct combat operations of various nature and magnitude, and given the minimum number of personnel, to operate throughout Ukraine. The Supreme Council's adoption of the final version of a realistic and comprehensive military doctrine will facilitate the quicker development of a modern armed forces that would be able to successfully perform complex tasks, which they are facing at the present stage of conversion into the new world order.
