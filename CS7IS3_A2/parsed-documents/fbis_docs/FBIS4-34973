The ceremony is linked to the activities that will be conducted in Cuba on the occasion of world population day on 11 July. Both programs will receive a contribution of almost $730,000 from the UN Population Fund and almost 2 million pesos from the Cuban Government. It is part of the cooperation program, which the UN Population Fund maintains with the island, which in the last four years has reached $4 million. (Reiner Rosembaum), the UN Population Fund's director for Mexico, Bolivia, and Cuba, told us the following: [Begin (Rosembaum) recording] I am very pleased to be able to practically initiate my work in Cuba with such a significant ceremony. Not only is it a great incentive for me, but with this program, we are in a position to fulfill the mandate of the UN Population Fund here in Cuba. We are also going to be able to meet the financial ceiling assigned to this country. [end recording] One of the programs includes research work in rural areas in order to propose a coherent population distribution policy that can promote the stability of the population and its link to the social, economic, and environmental development of its surroundings. The object is also to seek new forms of territorial planning based on a greater and more efficient participation of citizens and institutions. This program will be carried out by the Physical Planning Institute of the Economy and Planning Ministry. The other program is aimed at providing the largest amount of information to women and men of reproductive age about the various forms of contraceptive methods and family planning, which the country has available for its citizens. Among the purposes of this program is to voluntarily decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies and the dangers they present for women, especially for those under the age of 20. This program will be carried out by the National Sex Education Center linked to the National Assembly of the People's Government, the Public Health Ministry, and the Federation of Cuban Women.
