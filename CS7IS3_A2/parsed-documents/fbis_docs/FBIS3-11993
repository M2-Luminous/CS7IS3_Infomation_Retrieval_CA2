Melo, 34, replaces Luis Fernando Ramirez, who resigned after announcing that he had been chosen to run for vice president by opposition Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana. The new minister, Banking Superintendency chief until today, is a member of the Conservative Party, so Gaviria thus maintains the political structure of his cabinet, in which members of the ruling Liberal Party prevail. The resignation of Ramirez, 35, is the only one that has occurred in the wake of the intensive political campaign now under way in Colombia for the upcoming 29 May presidential elections. Insistent rumors in the press asserted that Government (Interior) Minister Fabio Villegas would tender his resignation in order to take an important post in the Liberal Party's leadership, but this did not happen. Likewise, other speculation held that Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin would also resign and accept the nomination for vice president on Pastrana's ticket. But this was ruled out by the foreign minister herself, who might be running for president in 1998.
