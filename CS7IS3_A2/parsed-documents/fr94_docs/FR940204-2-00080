FR940204-2-00080 FR940204-2-00055 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review January 28, 1994. The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirements to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. For further information on these submissions contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632&hyph;0276. Persons wishing to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, room 3235 NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;3561. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0207 Title: Sections 73.961 and 73.932, Test of the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) and Radio Monitoring and Attention Signal Transmission Requirements Action: Extension of currently approved collection Respondents: Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses) Frequency of Response: Recordkeeping requirement Estimated Annual Burden: 12,500 recordkeepers; 1.25 hours average burden per recordkeeper; 15,625 hours total annual burden Needs and Uses: Section 73.961 requires that all broadcast stations log transmission and receipt of the weekly EBS test and receipt of the semi-monthly wire service test. The recordkeeping of this information is necessary to document station compliance with this rule and to help enhance station awareness and participation in the National, State and Local Emergency Broadcast System. Section 73.932 further explains rule 73.961 and requires broadcast stations to log why they did not receive a weekly EBS test. The information is used by FCC staff as part of their routine inspections of broadcast stations. Accurate recordkeeping of this data is vital in determining the location and nature of possible equipment failure on the part of the transmitting or receiving station (or wire service). Furthermore, since the National level EBS is solely for the use of the President, its proper operation must be assured. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0465 Title: Section 74.985, Signal booster stations Action: Extension of a currently approved collection Respondents: Non-profit institutions and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses) Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement Estimated Annual Burden: 27 responses; .78 hour average burden per response; 21 hours total annual burden Needs and Uses: On 2/21/91, the OMB approved an information collection for 47 CFR 74.985(a) under OMB Control Number 3060&hyph;0465. On 1/21/92, OMB approved an information collection for Amendment of parts 21, 43, 74, 78 and 94 of the Commission's rules Governing Use of the Frequencies in the 2.1 and 2.5 GHz Bands Affecting Private Operational-Fixed Microwave under OMB Control Number 3060&hyph;0464. This information collection includes ยง74.985 (b), (c) and (g) amongst other rules. On 2/13/93, the Commission adopted a Report and Order in PR Docket No. 92&hyph;80, which further modified ยง74.985(g). On 10/30/93, OMB approved this modification through a correction worksheet (3060&hyph;0464). In this submission, we are bringing all portions of ยง74.985 under one OMB control number. All other portions of the approval for OMB Control Number 3060&hyph;0464 will remain under that collection. Section 74.985(a) requires signal booster stations to obtain the written consent from the licensee of the MDS, MMDS, or ITFS station whose signals are to be retransmitted. Section 74.985 (b), (c), and (d) are reporting requirements that are contained in the FCC Form 330 and will not be included as a separate burden within this rule section. Section 74.985(e) requires each application for a signal booster station to include a written consent statement of the licensee of each MDS, MMDS, and ITFS station whose signal is retransmitted. Section 74.985(g) requires that a MDS or ITFS licensee submit a certification statement to install a low power signal booster within 48 hours of installation of the booster station. Such applications must demonstrate compliance with 74.985(g). This written consent would be attached to an application for signal booster station and would be used by FCC staff to ensure that a booster station has consent to retransmit the MDS, MMDS, and ITFS station signal. The requirements in ยง74.985(g) would be used by FCC staff to ensure that a low power signal booster would not cause interference and that it has proper authority to retransmit an MDS or ITFS signal.
