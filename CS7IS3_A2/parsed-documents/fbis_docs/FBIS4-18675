He explained that he had abandoned the measure in order to remain "true to (his) philosophy" of "fostering unity among the French as much as possible" and "avoiding any unnecessary divisions." The prime minister said that he was "worried" by the violence which tainted a number of demonstrations and stated that "resorting to violence in a society is extremely dangerous. In Paris and a number of other cities, we have witnessed unacceptable violence for which, incidentally, the vast majority of young demonstrators were not to blame." He added: "This is a sign that we now face problems of moral, social, and national cohesion in our country, in particular in a number of cities, problems which we must address." Therefore, according to the prime minister, "together with unemployment and jobs, with training for young people, the problem of major cities, of integration into French society and [the promotion of] its values is a major challenge for our future." Mr. Balladur also stated that general implementation of the five-year legislationt [on job creation] will take place "within a month," after all relevant orders have been published. He added that he had "requested that, from now on, the people affected be informed ahead of time, that they be given the opportunity to voice their opinion, in short, that things be done as part of a consultation process."
