FR940712-0-00027 FR940712-0-00010 Background Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI is managed by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMP was prepared by the Council under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq .) (Magnuson Act), and is implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR part 675. General regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620. At times, amendments to an FMP or its implementing regulations are necessary to respond to fishery conservation and management problems that cannot be addressed within the time frame of the normal procedures provided for by the Magnuson Act. Section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act authorizes the Secretary to implement emergency regulations necessary to address these situations. These emergency regulations may remain in effect for not more than 90 days after date of publication in the Federal Register , with a possible 90-day extension. In 1993, the number of ``other'' salmon caught incidentally in the BSAI groundfish fisheries increased significantly over the 1991 and 1992 amounts of 36,000 and 39,000 fish, respectively. The 1993 total ``other'' salmon bycatch amount was 245,000 fish_approximately six times the bycatch level estimated for each of the previous 2 years and triple the previous highest bycatch amount of 72,000 ``other'' salmon estimated in the 1984 foreign trawl fishery. ``Other'' salmon bycatch was estimated to be below 10,000 fish, both prior to 1983 and between 1987 and 1990. ``Other'' salmon is defined as salmon other than chinook salmon. Historical data indicate that approximately 95 percent of the ``other'' salmon bycatch in the Bering Sea is chum salmon. Poor returns of chum salmon to western Alaska river systems during 1993 caused the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) to close commercial, sport, and subsistence fisheries in several western Alaska districts. Projections for 1994 are for below average returns in many districts. The salmon caught as bycatch in the 1993 pollock non-roe season were primarily in the size range of 3-year-old fish, which would have matured in 1994. Little information exists about the potential effect the 1993 chum salmon bycatch will have on the 1994 returns in western Alaska because stock composition of the chum salmon bycatch during the pollock non-roe season is unknown. However, the magnitude of the 1993 chum salmon bycatch in the pollock non-roe season is of concern, regardless of the origin of these fish. To respond to this concern, NMFS, in consultation with the Council, implements the following three measures under emergency rulemaking, to address the chum salmon bycatch problem in the 1994 BSAI pollock non-roe season: 1. Establishment of a 42,000 ``other'' salmon bycatch limit in the CVOA which, when reached, closes a portion of the CVOA to vessels using trawl gear; 2. Requirement for two observers on mothership processor vessels that receive groundfish caught in the CVOA during the 1994 pollock non-roe season; and 3. Requirement for electronic communication capabilities for each mothership processor vessel required to carry two observers under this emergency rule and for each shoreside facility that receives pollock harvested from the CVOA during the 1994 pollock non-roe season that is required to have 100 percent observer coverage under 50 CFR 672.27 or 675.25. These measures are described in detail and justified below. Salmon Savings Area At its April 1994 meeting, the Council requested that NMFS prepare emergency rulemaking that would provide the authority to close an area within the CVOA to all vessels using trawl gear if the ``other'' salmon bycatch in the CVOA during 1994 reaches 42,000 fish. This measure is intended to prevent 1994 chum salmon bycatch numbers from approaching the level experienced in the 1993 fishery. Establishing the bycatch limit at 42,000 ``other'' salmon accommodates pre-1993 levels while preventing excessive bycatch. This closure area (the salmon savings area) is defined by straight lines connecting the following coordinates in the order listed: 56 ○00 ’ N., 167 ○00 ’ W.; 56 ○00 ’ N., 165 ○00 ’ W.; 55 ○30 ’ N., 165 ○00 ’ W.; 55 ○30 ’ N., 164 ○00 ’ W.; 55 ○00 ’ N., 164 ○00 ’ W.; 55 ○00 ’ N., 167 ○00 ’ W.; 56 ○00 ’ N., 167 ○00 ’ W.
