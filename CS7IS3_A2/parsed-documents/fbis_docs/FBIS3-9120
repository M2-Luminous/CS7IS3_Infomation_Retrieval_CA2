Confirmation of this decision by the prime minister is a precondition for Solidarity suspending the strike. By the end of next week, the team will prepare "legal methods and a decisionmaking process" to facilitate the implementation of Solidarity's demands. These proposals will then be discussed at the next government meeting, which will make political decisions, Krzaklewski explained. He added that this team should identifiey those decisions that can be implemented later and controlled by a tripartite commission. Solidarity expects that the prime minister will confirm these decisions during a press conference on Friday. The decision to continue the strike also depends on a meeting with regional Solidarity leaders and chairmen of branch secretariats. Krzaklewski said that this decision will most probably be made tonight, when, after the prime minister's press conference, the staff of the National Strike Action Headquarters is to meet.
