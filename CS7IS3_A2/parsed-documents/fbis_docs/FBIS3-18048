Seasonally adjusted, production figures for November and December are the lowest figures "of production in the manufacturing industry recorded for two consecutive months during this recession," the recent weekly report of the Berlin Institute states. According to DIW calculations, the real GDP in the last three-months period was 1.5 percent below last years' lowest value: "If the stagnation were to prevail at this level throughout 1994, the annual result for 1994 would be exactly 0.5 percent below that of 1993." Yet stagnation is not likely, but rather a setback in the first quarter, the report says. As far as orders are concerned, the situation generally improved at the end of the year. However, expanded orders, which are the result of strong foreign demand, do not compensate for weak domestic demand. Domestic orders, which had comprised more than two-thirds of the total volume and are of considerably greater importance, have decreased. As far as the drop in private consumption is concerned there is no compensation either from the side of investment, the report states.
