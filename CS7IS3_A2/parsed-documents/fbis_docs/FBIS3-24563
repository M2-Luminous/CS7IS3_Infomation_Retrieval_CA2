A set of objects is assumed to be moving in space in a known manner, some of them having been already observed earlier and the pertinent data recorded in a special catalog. The remainder of them has not yet been logged. The observation time is subdivided into into equally long periods. It is furthermore assumed that, by a preliminary processing of the readings taken by one scanner, it is possible to estimate the state vector of a given object at the beginning of an observation period and evaluate the covariance matrix of the estimation error. There arises the problem of identifying the readings, namely of referring each to objects in the catalog or to one of the new objects, or to the set of spurious ones. Because an object can give more than one reading, it is expedient to tackle this problem by solving the relevant sequence of destinations problems where the set of readings taken within one observation period has been broken down into those three subsets and each of the identification hypotheses defined accordingly. The problem of identifying the set of readings taken within one observation period can thus be reduced to the problem of maximizing a certain functional which is defined on the set of all hypotheses and is proportional to the probability of the given one. The exponential dependence of the total number of hypotheses on the number M of measurements and on the number N of objects already in the catalog makes the identification problem so unwieldy that complete sifting through the hypotheses is not always feasible. A simpler procedure is, therefore, proposed: sifting the hypotheses in two stages, with fewer hypotheses to be sifted in each stage. In the first stage the entire set of known objects is subdivided into groups (``clusters''), namely into components of connectedness on a bilobate graph where the vertices represent all known objects and readings. Arcs are drawn to connect vertices when distances between them are smaller than a given threshold length. In the second stage the series of identification problems is solved separately for each cluster. Because one object can give more than one reading, a heuristic multistep algorithm is required for this procedure. The cost matrix in the destinations problems is best evaluated by the Monte Carlo method. The proposed procedure was tested on the following practical case: N= 2K[.sup]o[/]K[.sub]s[/], number of objects detected within one observation period N[.sup]o[/] � 0.1N, number of objects detected by several scanners N[.sup](ss)[/] � 0.1N, one scanner detecting 1-10 objetcs, number of scanners which detect objects during an observation period K[.sup]d[/] � 0.1K, number of new objects N[.sup]n[/] � N.
