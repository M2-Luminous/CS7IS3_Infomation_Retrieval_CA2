Lula is no longer the threat that led [Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries President] Mario Amato to predict, during the last elections, a flight of businessmen from the country if he won. Yet there is also no guarantee that, once elected, Lula will become a traditional president, like all the others. He begins by saying that he will not govern the country from Planalto Palace but he will be a field president, travelling the country, getting closely involved while solving the people's problems, and governing, together with his cabinet, in the field. Naturally, there is some electoral rhetoric in this. But beyond his promise of a new governing style, we have seen that Lula's trip around the country has made him a candidate apart from the rest. He did not begin campaigning with a government model prepared by experts in the great urban centers in mind. He comes from the interior, heading for Brasilia with his heart and mind on problems that are simpler and more important for the small communities, for the humblest groups of professionals. This union leader, who 15 years ago raised the conscience of the Sao Paulo industrial belt metal workers, found during his tours in the interior that 300,000 babassu nut harvesters in northeastern Brazil, a group larger than the Brazilian automobile industry workers, work under subhuman conditions. Lula speaks of a farming cooperative in Telemaco, Borba, (Parana), or of the peasants in Mirandiba (PE) [Pernambuco) or in Nova California (AC) [Acre], like Fernando Henrique Cardoso speaks of the Cavallo Plan in Argentina, or of the stages of an economic stabilization program. Naturally, the intellectual education of the two cannot be compared. Fernando Henrique is a professor with a PhD from the Sorbone University. Lula, who barely reads and writes, has gained a PhD on Brazil. It would not be surprising if, once elected with this curriculum, Lula ends up being a simple councilman, or a super mayor. But equally, nothing guarantees that Fernando Henrique's respectable curriculum and that of his not-always-respectable allies will ensure that he wins the elections. At least the coarse curriculum of Lula is more useful in obtaining votes than the text books of Fernando Henrique, mainly because this is a country of illiterates. Beside truly representing Brazil and maintaining a continuous line of political consistency -- Lula arrived in migrant worker trucks to become a factory worker in Sao Paulo, lost a finger while working on a power lathe, defied industrialists and generals, broke with labor union taboos, resigned his deputy mandate disgusted with Congress, and began smoking expensive cigars without losing his custom of drinking sugar cane brandy like a farm hand -- Lula's current main campaign asset is the sins of his contenders. Orestes Quercia, considered the probable winner of the internal PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] elections, received a setback that will be very hard to overcome: the attorney general is charging him with violating Law No. 171 on fraud, in a case of importing weapons from Israel to equip the Sao Paulo police when he was governor. Jose Sarney, who expects a miracle from the PMDB machinery, is Lula's ideal contender and the PT's best way to approach the PFL [Liberal Front Party], which has joined Fernando Henrique. Leonel Brizola is practically ignored by one third of the national electorate -- 22 percent in Sao Paulo, and 11 percent in Minas Gerais. Fernando Henrique is experiencing a delicate moment. As finance minister, he obtained an economic miracle: he created two inflations: one in real cruzeiros which he doubled from 20 percent to 40 percent; and another in URV [Real Value Unit] which is expected to reach 2.62 percent in April or 5.86 percent in a hypothetical calculation since January. Fernando Henrique depends on the success of the implementation of the new currency, the real. It is still doubtful if eventual success in curbing inflation will allow him reduce the distance between him and Lula. As a candidate, Fernando Henrique has still not left his office. Although he allied with the PFL, he has faded and obtained no gains. It took too long to reach the alliance. He lost some colleagues in this effort. In the process to choose a running mate for his ticket, an Alagoas senator, he ended by dividing the very party bloc he wanted to add to his own. Fernando Henrique runs the risk of being abandoned by the urban educated middle class that did not approve his alliance with the PFL and of losing the rural PFL followers if he does not quickly put out the fire in his alliance. In all, he is doing favors for Lula which the best campaign strategists would be unable to predict. If all this were not enough to allow Lula begin to show a winning profile for the first voting round -- even the numerous factions in his own party, including the most radical ones, suddenly seem to have been pacified -- there still floats in the air the Ayrton Senna effect. The feelings awakened by Senna's example must be channeled somewhere.
