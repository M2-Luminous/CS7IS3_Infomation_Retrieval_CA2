An official of the provincial public health department said that the World Bank has promised a 21 million U.S. dollar loan to Hebei to assist it in training rural doctors and improving rural clinics. Hebei began to undertake the six-year World Bank-aided project in November 1993, he said. When the project is completed, working conditions in 222 rural clinics will be improved and better medical services provided for 30 million farmers, he said. Now, 12 poor counties in Hebei are co-operating with the United Nations Children's Fund in improving medical care for rural women and children and promoting family planning, the official said. The counties have received 543 sets of medical equipment worth 3.5 million yuan from the fund, he said. Moreover, funds from other international organizations are being used to control tuberculosis [T.B.] in 111 counties, cities and districts in hebei, he said. By the end of 1993, 10,000 T.B. patients had received free medical treatment. Wang Youhui, vice-governor of Hebei Province, pledged to make efficient use of the funds from international organizations to improve medical care in rural areas, where 80 percent of Hebei Province's population lives.
