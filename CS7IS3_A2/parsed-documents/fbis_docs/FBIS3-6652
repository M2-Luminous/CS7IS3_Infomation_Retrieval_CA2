FBIS3-6652 "dreas054_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-054 Document Type:Daily Report 21 Mar 1994 North Korea Spokesman on 25 Feb DPRK-U.S. Agreement SK2103020694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0100 GMT 21 Mar 94 SK2103020694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0100 GMT 21 Mar 94 Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued the following statement in connection with the U.S. treacherous act [paesin haengwi] of totally overturning [chonmyon tujiboomnun] the agreement of the DPRK-U.S. New York contact dated 25 February. The statement of the spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry: The United States has committed a treacherous act of totally overturning the agreement of the DPRK-U.S. New York contact dated 25 February. As has been known, the DPRK and the United States in the 25 February New York contact agreed on the present four simultaneous action measures [tangmyonhan negaji tongsi haengdong chochidul] for a package solution of the nuclear issue, namely, suspending the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise, resuming the working delegates contact for the exchange of the special envoys of the North and the South, conducting inspections to ensure the continuity of safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], and holding the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks in Geneva on 21 March. This agreement on the simultaneous action measures was an important turning point that would enable the process for peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue which had been deviated [talson toeottun] to be on the right track again. From the serious desire to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue, we have faithfully implemented our obligations noted in the agreement. We accepted the IAEA inspection team at the scheduled date and have sincerely provided them all the conditions so that they could conduct inspection activities of a sufficient scope on the seven declared sites for ensuring the continuity of safeguards. Even in the abnormal circumstance where the IAEA side unreasonably demanded taking samples and measurements [siryo chaechwiwa chukchong] far exceeding the scope of ensuring the continuity of safeguards agreed with us [uriwa habuihan tamboui yonsoksong pojang pomwirul hwolsin chowol hanun], we showed the utmost good will of acceding to [suyonghaejunun] the IAEA demand as best as possible. We have also made all the efforts we can, such as holding the North-South working delegates contacts several times and proposing specific ways and proper measures to realize the exchange of the special envoys of the North and the South. However, since the announcement of the 25 February New York agreement, the U.S. side made only empty talk [pinmal]. It did not implement even one of its duties. Even though the United States announced the suspension of the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise and the date for the second round of DPRK-U.S. talks, it put forth an unreasonable precondition by saying that it will implement these when the IAEA's inspection is carried out satisfactorily and the exchange of special envoys of the North and South is realized. This is a violation of the New York agreement which regards simultaneous movement [tongsi umjigiungot] as a principle. The United States is instead making false charges by saying that the IAEA's inspection we received is unsatisfactory and that the exchange of special envoys of the North and South was not realized. Thus, it moved toward the road of overturning the New York agreement in which it decided to take simultaneous action measures. If we do not allow the IAEA's reinspection and do not realize the exchange of special envoys of the North and South, the United States is saying that it will resume the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise, suspend the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, and hand our issue over to the UN Security Council. At the same time, the IAEA Secretariat is launching the game to adopt a resolution to oppose us by convening the Board of Governor's meeting. At a decisive important period when the resolution of the nuclear issue is right before our eyes, the United States overturned the New York agreement openly and completely destroyed [homuloborida] the basis of the third round of talks. Thus, the United States prevented the prospects for resolving the nuclear issue. This stems from the unchanged hostile policy toward the North by the United States. The fact that the United States put forth an unreasonable precondition which is not even written in the New York agreement itself clearly shows that their intention from the beginning was not to resolve the nuclear issue through the DPRK-U.S. talks, but instead that this precondition was pursued under a political goal to crush [apsal] our Republic. The United States is distorting as if its unjustifiable preconditions were those which were agreed with us. However, these unjustifiable preconditions were rejected by our just assertion when the New York agreement was discussed. Nevertheless, after announcing the agreement, persistently insisting on the unilateral preconditions which were rejected by us cannot but be interpreted as an intentional scheme to overturn the New York agreement and, thus, to create a situation of confrontation. In reality, using the issue of the IAEA inspections and the North-South exchange of special envoys as the pretexts, the United States openly has laid bare its attempt to persistently wage the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise and to impose sanctions against us at the UN Security Council and, thus, is leading the international anti-Republic pressure commotion. All facts have clearly proven that the United States has no intent to hold talks any longer nor has it the will to solve the nuclear issue and that it is attempting to isolate and crush us by taking advantage [konggan] of the nuclear issue and the DPRK-U.S. talks. Because of such a breach of faith by the United States, a grave situation which may drive the entire nation into an aspect of confrontation and war is coming to the Korean peninsula today. Because the United States is leading the situation to an extreme [kuktan] by overturning the New York agreement and breaking up the DPRK-U.S. talks, it has become impossible for us to unilaterally implement any longer our duty related to the simultaneous action measures. Proceeding from this we has decided not to send our delegation to the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks. Now that the United States and the IAEA are deliberately distorting the results of the current inspections held to ensure the continuity of safeguards and, thus, are abusing them as the pretext of their anti-Republic pressure we will no longer consider it to be our duty to guarantee the continuity of the safeguards of the agency. This step of ours is taken pursuant to the principle of the New York agreement dated on 25 February that stipulates that the execution of the agreed-upon four simultaneous actions is needed for the overall implementation of the agreement. As long as the United States overturns the promise made with us, we will not be bound by our promise made with the United States. This position of ours is firm and consistent. In the 12 March 1993 statement issued by the Government of our Republic, we note that the basic reason for our declaration of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] was the U.S. policy of nuclear threat and of crushing us, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise and the IAEA's partiality. In the DPRK-U.S. joint statement issued in New York on 11 February 1993, we made it clear that we would unilaterally and tentatively suspend the effectuation of the withdrawal from the NPT on the premise that the DPRK and United States would continue talks to settle the nuclear issue. If the United States persistently avoids the DPRK-U.S. talks and resumes the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise, thus increasing the nuclear threat against us, and if the IAEA further expands its unfairness by distorting the result of its inspection of us and takes forcible measures and pressures, we will have to take the direction of putting into practice the measures declared in the Republic Government's statement dated 12 March of last year in order to defend the nation's sovereignty and the country's security. We are not in a hurry at all even if the DPRK-U.S. talks are not held, thus causing the settlement of the nuclear issue to be delayed. The United States should ponder about the seriousness of the present situation created and see it squarely. 21 March 1994, Pyongyang
