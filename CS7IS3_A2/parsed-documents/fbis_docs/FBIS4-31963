How would you briefly assess its work? [Marjanovic] After 90 days, there is a stable dinar, stable prices, a consolidated balance without a deficit on 24 July [date as heard], increased wages, and an increase in real consumption, as well as a standard of living that has more or less risen. That is everything that was included in the program. It has to be said here that I expect this to continue. I also expect systemic laws to be implemented in the spirit of the further realization of the program. [Petrovic] The Serbian Government endorsed the proposed package of taxation laws yesterday. In the speech you made today [at the Economists' Conference in Budva], you assessed that package as a system that is close to the taxation systems in most developed market economies in Europe. Do you expect the Assembly to adopt the package and to completely agree to it? [Marjanovic] I do. These are expert issues, so I do not believe there will be any differences if the decision is made on the basis of expertise and of what has been presented in the program. There could only be some bickering among the parties. Otherwise, I think that the draft laws in this sphere have been drawn up well and to a professional level. After all, I saw this confirmed by economists, our scientists today. Therefore, I expect any debate (?in the assembly) to be like this, at expert level, and this should be the case, so I do not think there will be any particular resistance to it. [Petrovic] Mr. Prime Minister, you are absolutely convinced that the program will be fully successful. Six months have passed and its results have contradicted the doubting Thomases. [Marjanovic] Yes, I am convinced and I see that many of our scientists today are optimists. I am more of an optimist, as they have nevertheless expressed some skepticism about the future, pointing in particular to the problem of property transformation. However, in my opinion, many things were omitted in the debate and we nevertheless have many chances of succeeding, regardless of whether sanctions will be lifted or not. [Petrovic] Thank you very much. [Marjanovic] Not at all.
