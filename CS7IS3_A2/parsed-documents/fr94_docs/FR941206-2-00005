FR941206-2-00005 FR941206-2-00004 Foreign-Trade Zones Board [Docket 38&hyph;94] Foreign-Trade Zone 77, Memphis, TN; Application for Subzone Status Brother Industries (U.S.A.) Inc. (Typewriters and Word Processors) Bartlett, TN An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the City of Memphis, Tennessee, grantee of FTZ 77, requesting special-purpose subzone status at the typewriter and word processor manufacturing facilities of Brother Industries (U.S.A.) Inc. (Brother) (a subsidiary of Brother International Corporation (BIC)) located in Bartlett, Tennessee. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on November 22, 1994. The Brother facilities include a manufacturing site (231,000 sq. ft., 25 acres) located at Brother Boulevard and Highway 64, Bartlett, and a nearby BIC warehouse (270,000 sq. ft., 20 acres) located at 3131 Appling Road, Bartlett. Both sites are within the Bartlett Municipal Industrial Park. The facilities (520 employees) are used to manufacture electric and automatic typewriters and word processors. Certain components are sourced from abroad, including circuit boards, disk drives, signalling devices, motors, integrated circuits, capacitors, diodes, transistors, resistors, wire, cable, springs, steel fasteners, pulleys and gears. It is estimated that foreign status merchandise would represent 50 to 60 percent of total product value. Zone procedures would exempt Brother from Customs duty payments on parts and materials used in finished products that are exported. On its domestic sales, the company would be able to choose the finished product duty rates (zero to 2.2%). The duty rates on components average 4 percent. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the plant's international competitiveness. In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is [60 days from date of publication]. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to February 21, 1995). A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations.
