The article accuses Hungary's coat-of-arms of unlawfully depicting three hills and a double cross, which it claims are Slovak symbols. The statement says, "On March 11 the head of the Foreign Ministry's relevant regional department summoned the Slovak charge d'affaires and presented him with a verbal note. "In the note, the Foreign Ministry recalled that several European states, as well as others, use among their national and state symbols ones that are identical or similar. This is regarded as a symbol of connection between the various peoples. The Hungarian Foreign Ministry considers it contrary to traditional friendship between the two peoples that the national symbols are made a matter of debate between the two countries. The Foreign Ministry has asked the Slovak side to adopt a formal position on the issue."
