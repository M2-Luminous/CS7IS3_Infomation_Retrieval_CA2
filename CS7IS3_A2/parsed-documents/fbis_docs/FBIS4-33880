The press reports add that Perez de Cuellar hopes to officially announce his decision in August. According to the newspaper EXPRESO, Perez de Cuellar's decision was announced by a group of Peruvian politicians, businessmen, and personalities who met him a few days ago in Paris, where Perez de Cuellar currently lives. The Peruvian presidential and legislative elections will be held in April 1995 but the deadline for the registration of presidential candidates is October 1994. EXPRESO reports that the former UN secretary general hopes Police Inspector General Antonio Ketin, responsible for capturing Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman in 1992, and Diego Garcia Sayon, former Andean Lawyers Commission chairman and an old leftist militant, will be his running mates. According to EXPRESO, Perez de Cuellar has "declined" any eventual alliances with traditional political parties that support his candidacy. He believes their support will do him more harm than good because they will take away votes from him. He has proposed, however, giving more participation in his eventual administration to the main party supporting him, the Popular Christian Party (PPC), if the main PPC leaders decide to withdraw their candidacies to the legislature. Perez de Cuellar approved a list of candidates to the legislature encompassing independent politicians identified with the opposition, such as Maximo San Roman, who was President Alberto Fujimori's vice president until the 1992 coup d'etat. The list also includes personalities such as former Senators Enrique Bernales (Socialist) and Raul Ferrero (conservative); Daniel Estrade, the leftist mayor of Cusco; and Bar Association President Jorge Avendano, among others. Moreover, political circles have reported high-ranking Peruvian media representatives also were present in the Paris meeting at Perez de Cuellar's request. The same sources reported that Alfredo Barnechea, a journalist and former candidate for Lima City Hall for the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance -- headed by former President Alan Garcia -- will be the 75-year-old veteran diplomat's campaign manager. Barnechea is married to Perez de Cuellar's stepdaughter. Perez de Cuellar's campaign will be launched next week with several new members and the collection of signatures to support the former UN secretary general's candidacy.
