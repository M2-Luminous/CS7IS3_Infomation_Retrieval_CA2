FR940610-2-00152 FR940610-2-00076 The Commission believes that trading options on an index (including a narrow-based index) of securities permits investors to participate in the price movements of the index's underlying securities, and allows investors holding positions in some or all of such securities to hedge the risks associated with their portfolios. The Commission further believes that trading options on an index provides investors with an important trading and hedging mechanism that is designed to reflect accurately the overall movement of the component stocks. Currently, when an exchange intends to list options on an index of securities which the Commission has not specifically approved previously for the listing and trading of such index options, the Exchange must submit a proposed rule change to the Commission pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. Pursuant to section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must find, among other things, that trading in options on the particular index will serve to protect investors and contribute to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. In this regard, the Commission must predicate approval of any new option proposal upon a finding that the introduction of such derivative instrument is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished public confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns. Accordingly, before approving an Exchange proposal to list options on a particular index, and consistent with its legislative mandate, the Commission must conclude that the Exchange has addressed several issues pertaining to the particular index, including the design and structure of the index, customer protection, surveillance, and market impact. Specifically, with respect to index design and structure, the Commission takes into account, among other things, the number of securities comprising the index, the market capitalizations of the component securities, their relative weightings in the index, their trading volume, and the extent to which the component securities individually, satisfy the Exchange's requirements for the listing of equity options thereon. It is with respect to these criteria, among others, that this order establishes generic standards which, if satisfied, would allow an Exchange to file a proposed rule change, effective immediately upon filing, to list and trade options on a particular narrow-based index 30 days from the filing date. 22 22 The Commission reiterates that an Exchange would not be foreclosed from pursuing formal Commission review of a proposal to list options on a narrow-based index that do not qualify for effectiveness upon filing under section 19(b)(3)(A). See supra note 15. The Commission believes that the listing and maintenance listing standards set forth herein are consistent with the criteria currently utilized in the Commission's case-by-case consideration of narrow-based index option proposals, and are reasonably designed to ensure the protection of investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission finds that the generic standards covering minimum capitalization, monthly trading volume, and relative weightings of component stocks are designed to ensure that the trading markets for component stocks are adequately capitalized and sufficiently liquid, and that no one stock or stock group dominates that index. Thus, the Commission believes that the satisfaction of these requirements significantly minimizes the potential for manipulation of the index. Two other important requirements are that at least 90 percent of the component stocks, by weight, must be eligible individually for options trading, and that no more than 20 percent of the index may be comprised of ADRs which are not subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. The Commission believes that these standards are necessary to ensure that index options are not used as surrogate instruments to trade options on stocks and/or ADRs that otherwise are not eligible for options trading., The Commission also believes that the number of securities required to constitute the narrow-based index is large enough to ensure that an index is not created for the purpose of obtaining more favorable regulatory treatment, e.g., with respect to position and exercise limits, as compared with the trading of options in the underlying stocks.
