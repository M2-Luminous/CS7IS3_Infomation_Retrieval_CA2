The device is fabricated on a 20mm x 60mm Y-cut Ti-in-diffused LiNb03 planar waveguide (single-mode for 1.3-micron-wavelength laser), and consists of a pair of spherical geodesic lenses and two surface acoustic wave (SAW) acousto-optic modulators (AOMs). The SAW interdigital transducer (IDT) is fabricated by conventional photolithography on a 0.8-micron sputtered Al film; each IDT has six electrodes with a length of 8mm and a period of 30 microns. Frequency-shifting range is 10 MHz, AOM center frequency is 107 MHz, and AOM drive power is 200 mW. Four figures, not reproduced, show the following: a structural schematic of the frequency shifter, frequency response of the AOM, three oscilloscope traces of secondary Bragg deflection, and two graphs of optical intensity distribution. There are no tables. References: 1. Davis, J.L. and Ezekiel, S., PROC. SPIE, 1978, 157:131. 2. Cahill, R.F. and Udd, E., OPTICS LETT., 1979, 4(3):93. 3.
