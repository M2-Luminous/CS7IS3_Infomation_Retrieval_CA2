The author of the article says: The work is a highly important work which indicates a way of improving party work in a revolutionary manner to meet the requirement of the development of our party and revolution after the modelling of the whole society on the chuche idea had been pushed to the foreground. The work clearly expounds the principled demand and concrete ways of effecting a new turn in party work such as the question of building our party into a vibrant militant party full of revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. For the justness and truthfulness of the idea and theory contained in the work, the great vitality of the work has been displayed in revolutionary practice and it serves as a historic work which marked an occasion of a great turn in the strengthening and development of our party. The great vitality of the work lies, first of all, that it made it possible to establish throughout the party a revolutionary system of working under the unitary guidance of the party centre. It is the unshakable creed and absolute rules of action for our party members and other working people to do things as demanded by the party and think and act in accordance with the idea and will of the party. The great vitality of the work also lies in that it filled the whole party with the revolutionary way of living and struggling with lusty vigour and enthusiasm. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said: "If a new turn is to be effected in party work, all the officials must shake off signs of decrepitude and make our party a vibrant party overflowing with revolutionary stamina and enthusiasm." The trait of which our party members and other working people are proud is to boldly undertake any task to fulfil the plan and intention of the party, make a breakthrough and tenaciously carry it to accomplishment. In the course of applying the idea and theory contained in the work, a radical turn has taken place in the work method of our party. To always mix with the masses, grasp the actual conditions of the lower units, give them a substantial help and solve everything in reliance on the wisdom and creativity of the masses is the inherent work method and habitual mode of work of our officials today. With a great turn in the method of party work and the strict application of the revolutionary mass line, the consciousness and creative zeal of the popular masses as the masters of the revolution and construction have been immensely enhanced and a constant upsurge is being effected in socialist construction.
