"If I cannot get my case handled in a proper way I will go to the Supreme Court in Beijing," Dr Philip Cheng said yesterday in his first public appearance since returning to the territory on Thursday night. "I will fight to the end," he added. Cheng, 64, remained optimistic he would win the civil countersuit, launched against a Changsha court official and the former general manager of a Hunan trade company. "I got my passport back, so I think the court will do justice again," he said. "I was involved in a business dispute so it should be handled according to legal procedures." Cheng yesterday gave further details of his seven-month ordeal, in which he was first held in solitary confinement for three days, then locked in a hotel for a week, after which he was barred from leaving Changsha for a month and then in effect prevented from leaving the country by having his United States passport confiscated. Eight local court officials detained Cheng in a Changsha hotel last August after the Hunan Arts and Crafts Import and Export Corporation accused him of breaking a contract to return U.S.$165,000 (HK$1.27m) it had invested in his Zhuhai bicycle helmet factory. According to Cheng, the Hunan company's former general manager, Liu Xianyou, altered the date of the contract to four months earlier and asked a local court official, Shen Xiaoguan, to arrest him. "At five o'clock we signed the deal and at six o'clock eight uniformed officers barged into the hotel room saying I was being detained over a dispute regarding the contract." he said. Hunan public security offcers were kept out of the hotel by court officials when they came to investigate the case, he said. "The court officials said: `There's no one here.' And I was in a little room trying to call for help," Cheng said. Cheng said he hoped the suit would not be seen as a comment on China's legal system or its reform policies. "The foreign publicity helped me get out, but it can damage the reputation of China and the Chinese people very much," said Cheng, a former professor at the Chinese University who became a fulltime businessman in 1991. "It is an isolated case perpetrated by a small band of individuals who sought to bend the rules of justice. What is most perplexing was the lack of influence even senior officials in Beijing had over this little fiefdom ... We need to examine why local Chinese officials are able to abuse their powers to such an extent," he said.
