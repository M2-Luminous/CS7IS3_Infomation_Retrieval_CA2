FR940705-2-00039 FR940705-2-00025 [Project 2114&hyph;024 Washington] Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County; Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and to Conduct a Scoping Meeting June 27, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 F.R. 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has evaluated four downstream fish passage alternatives addressed in the Mid-Columbia Proceeding (Docket No. E&hyph;9569&hyph;003) for the Priest Rapids Project. Staff's initial evaluation of the proposed modifications was issued on May 25, 1994, in an environmental assessment (EA). The June 3, 1994 transmittal letter for the EA stated our intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS). A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by staff and considered in the final EIS. Staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final decision. Scoping Meetings To obtain information from the public regarding relevant environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS, the Commission will conduct two public scoping meetings. The first scoping meeting will be held on Monday July 25, 1994 in Portland Oregon, at the Portland Building, 2nd Floor Auditorium, 1120 SW 5th Avenue, from 1 pm to 5 pm. The second scoping meeting will be held on Wednesday July 27, 1994 in Ephrata, Washington at the City of Ephrata Recreation Center, 112 Basin Street SW, from 7:00 pm to 11 pm. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend. The EA will be considered the initial coping document. Copies of the EA have been mailed to all entities who have expressed interest in this proceeding. The EA is also available in the Commission's Reference and Information Center, Room 3308, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20426 and will be available at the scoping meeting. We encourage all interested parties to read the EA prior to the scoping meeting. Objectives At the meeting the staff will: (1) describe the range of issues being considered in this post-licensing proceeding (2) review the conclusions and recommendations in the EA; (3) receive input from meeting participants on the alternatives considered in the EA; (4) identify any additional issues that should be included in the EIS; and (5) obtain any additional information that any entity feels should be considered during the preparation of the EIS. Procedures The scoping meeting will be recorded by a stenographer and all statements (oral and written) will become part of the Commission's public record for this proceeding. Interested persons who are unable to attend, or do not choose to speak at the scoping meeting, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record. All written comments must be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capital Street N.E., Washington, DC 20426, on or before August 30, 1994. All written correspondence should clearly show on the first page of each document the following caption: Priest Rapids Project, FERC Project No. 2114&hyph;024. Further, please note the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, requires all entities to file an original and eight copies of any filing with the Commission.
