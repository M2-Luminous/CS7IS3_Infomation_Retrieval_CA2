Net foreign debt, previously a limiting factor in economic policy, is now declining rapidly with the balance of payments showing a steady surplus, ETLA pointed out. "If state borrowing increases in the future as it has done so far our chance of pursuing an active economic policy will be reduced," said ETLA's chief executive, Pentti Vartia. "We cannot handle employment policy in a future recession by taking out new loans, for example, and interest on the national debt will become so large that it rules out the possibility of pursuing an active social policy." In spite of the expected upturn, unemployment will remain high in Finland. Five years from now, according to the research institute's calculations, only 80,000 more people will be employed than in 1993. New jobs will be created primarily in industry, while jobs will continue to decline in construction and agriculture. Steady Growth But viewed as a whole, the picture of the Finnish economy that ETLA has now painted is positive both for this year and for the next five years. Research director Jukka Lassila pointed out that we can now look forward to a long period of growth and that it could be as strong as 6 percent next year. Gross national product is expected to increase by 2 percent this year. "The rising interest level does not yet limit our growth expectations," said Lassila. "Interest has now reacted primarily to external factors such as interest rates around Europe, there are no real grounds for a rise in interest on the Finnish market just now." Private domestic consumption will start to increase gradually, ETLA predicted, but growth on the domestic market will continue to lag behind the growth rate in export branches. Private consumption is at around the same level this year as it was in 1986, but despite the fact that it is now rising by several percentage points a year it will still not reach the same level in 1998 that it had in 1990. Industrial investments will now grow rapidly, according to ETLA's prognosis. However the rapid growth is based on the assumption that the world economy also grows and that Finland becomes a member of the European Union, EU. Other factors that will influence investment resolve include Finnish competitiveness remaining good, improved profitability, and increased utilization of capacity. "In any case domestic market industries will not increase their investments much in the next five years," said Lassila, who also thought there would be no significant investment in new housing. Vartia saw no big problem in meeting the Bank of Finland's 2-percent inflation goal for the next five years. We have had such a deep depression that there are no big inflationary expectations in the wage sector, for example, and the fluid markka lessens the external inflationary pressure. Thus, according to ETLA, the big problem is the national debt. Offsetting the increased interest expenses would require a very restrained spending policy, and past experience shows that this kind of thing is hard to implement, the research institute noted. According to Vartia, the state's large debt means that the best thing we can hope for is a long period of growth, but only one that is more rapid than the basic 4-percent alternative can balance the debt level. And this also assumes that increased tax revenues do not lead to increased public spending.
