I have received reports from people in Hebron. [Al-Husayni] Yes. [Zissowitz] From the information you have, how many have been murdered, and how many wounded in the shooting spree. [Al-Husayni] About 35 people were murdered. There are 18 dead in al-Ahali Hospital, 11 in 'Aliya Hospital, and four in al-Maqasid, and we are being updated by the minute. [Zissowitz] Have the Palestinian negotiators in the peace talks worked out any response to this action? [Al-Husayni] Of course, but first of all we want the settlers to be disarmed. Second, we want international protection and a committee to investigate what happened, who is responsible, and how the Army responded. [Zissowitz] Do you doubt that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] did all it could to defend the Arab worshipers? [Al-Husayni] No, definitely not. The Army permitted a settler to enter a holy place with weapons and do what he did. It is clear that the Army did not do what it had to do. Later, the Army fired at people, apparently causing many casualties. I also have reports that the Army later killed two people. [Zissowitz] I am sure you do not deny that the Army is doing everything it can to defend the lives of Jews, yet it does not always succeed, and Arab terrorists succeed in harming and killing Jews. [Al-Husayni] It has never happened in a place under such heavy Army protection. It has to defend such a holy place yet it permits settlers to enter armed. What we want is for all settlers be immediately disarmed. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0750 GMT on 25 February carries a similar interview with al-Husayni by Itay Engel, in which al-Husayni is asked whether he joins the call to Palestinians not to carry out reprisals for the Hebron incident. Al-Husayni replies: "Today, I call on the people not to make reprisals, but at the same time, I can not ask people not to defend themselves."] [Zissowitz] Did you have any contact after this morning's events with the prime minister or foreign minister? [Al-Husayni] I did not speak with the prime minister or the foreign minister. I tried but failed, but I talked with others in the government. [Zissowitz] What did they tell you? [Al-Husayni] I want to transfer the conversation to Mr. Ziyad Abu-Zayyad. [Zissowitz] I asked Mr. al-Husayni whether you had any contact with Israel's top political echelon, the prime minister, foreign minister, or those participating in the talks? [Abu-Zayyad] We are in touch with cabinet ministers, whom I do not want to name, Knesset members, officials in the Civil Administration, and the coordinator of government activities in the territories. We demanded information and an investigation, and we are following events with deep concern. [Zissowitz] Do you think these events will influence the talks with Israel in any way? [Abu-Zayyad] Personally, I hope not although it is a crime and a great tragedy. I hope it will not harm the process because the peace talks are a strategic aim for both the Israelis and the Palestinians. We must not allow an incident, no matter how painful and dastardly, to stop the talks. [Zissowitz] When you hear a unanimous denunciation by the left and right, does this convince you of its sincerity? [Abu-Zayyad] I have always said that there is no denunciation that can bring a dead man back to life. Therefore it does not help. What can help is to immediately remove the arms from the settlers and to ban them from carrying arms, for the Army to be in control of the situation. It is responsible for the safety of the Jewish and Palestinian populations. [Zissowitz] There were denunciations not only by people supporting the peace process, but a unanimous denunciation among those fervently opposed to the process, which is unusual. [Abu-Zayyad] I am not looking for lip service from anybody and the words do not always reflect what the heart feels and desires, therefore I cannot depend on words.
