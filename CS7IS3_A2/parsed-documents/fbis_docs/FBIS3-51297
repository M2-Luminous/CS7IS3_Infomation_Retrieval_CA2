"The most important decision to contribute to the reestablishment of peace has been made today. It is a risky moment, because there could be provocations aimed at undermining the peace process," the peace and reconciliation commissioner said in Chiapas. [Passage omitted] Regarding the timeframe for the presidential initiative, Camacho said it is "an amnesty for what has already taken place, and that is the reason for the timeframe" set by Salinas de Gortari. [Passage omitted] During a news conference, Camacho spoke of the first steps and signs of conciliation that he has received without saying he has received direct messages from the spokesmen of the armed group in response to his calls to dialogue and reconciliation. "We are negotiating through facts, with messages of concord in both directions, which is already yielding its first results," he said. The National Congress, which must ratify the presidential proposal, now plays "a leading role for attaining peace, as the nation's general feeling is for reconciliation," the former foreign minister said. He said the amnesty will ease "the return of members of the self- styled Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN] to their communities and the reintegration to their jobs, which required that we advance in the topic of guarantees." To attain the pacification of Chiapas State, it will be necessary to "set the bases for a peace with justice, guide the changes politically," and "favor the construction of channels for the effective and authentic political participation of the different indigenous groups," he added. He reiterated that he believes the armed group "is basically a Mexican and Chiapan movement." The return of the kidnapped former governor of Chiapas State, Absalon Castellanos, would be a conciliatory message from the armed group, Solis said. "The EZLN is an organization that, regardless of methods, of which we disapprove, has shown it has political clarity; therefore, I hope they realize that for their cause it is better that General Castellanos be alive, not dead."
