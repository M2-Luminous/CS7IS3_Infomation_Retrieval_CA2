[Klaus] This is one of the many topics in which--I do not know why--correspondents get the feeling that they could find another chink of disagreement between politicians. I proclaim that, for the economic part of the government,, and also for the state banks and other institutions, this is not a matter-of-fact dispute. We are conducting a detailed study of the requirements for this step and the most suitable time to implement it. There is absolute convertibility without any restrictions in few places--perhaps only in Hong Kong. All other countries have some form of regulation. So, progress from one phase of convertibility to another is simply relative and continuous and has nothing to do with political symbolism. [Krejci] What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a step? [Klaus] It goes without saying that the introduction of full convertibility has certain advantages, but it also has some disadvantages. There are three disadvantages, for which a gradual approach is necessary: First, the axis of our entire economic transformation is secured economically by a firm nominal exchange rate and by maintaining this exchange rate as the Archimedes point of the whole economic system. On the other hand, implementing full convertibility requires that this idea be abandoned and that a flexible exchange rate be introduced. Second, introducing full convertibility means, to a certain extent, losing the autonomous nature of the state's monetary and financial--that is, macroeconomic--policy. This is fine in cases in which a country lags far behind the general liberal tendencies of its neighboring partners, and the world drags it from its inadequate foundation to somewhere else. This, however, does not apply to our country. Our monetary and financial policy is quite deliberate, quite rational, and does not have to be "disciplined" by our neighbors. The situation is rather the reverse. Moreover, the policy of our neighbors may have its own logic, different from that of our country, which has, at the moment, different tasks than standard European states. And, finally, third: Introducing full convertibility indeed means exposing ourselves too much in the sense that we would enter into the realm of rapid movements of speculative capital that flees from one country to another, where it seems that the interest rate conditions are a little better. This is an instability that our transforming economy can do without at the moment. [Krejci] What must be done now in this regard? [Klaus] Other aspects of the concept of convertibility must gradually be liberated. Liberalizing what the citizen may exchange is also, undoubtedly, associated with this. The task is to create an attractive and pleasant environment for foreign investors, who now have the possibility to transfer money back to their own countries. Therefore, I do not see a preponderance of reasons for immediately dealing with full convertibility. Additional analyses indicate that we are talking about a medium to long-term program.
