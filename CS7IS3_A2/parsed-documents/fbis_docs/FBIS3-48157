"The president has advised the prime minister, the honourable Major General (Sitiveni) Rabuka, of his decision," a government statement said Wednesday. Rabuka called for the dissolution of parliament when his budget was defeated November 29 by seven dissident members of government who voted against it in the House of Representatives. Dominance of the ruling Fijian Political Party has been challenged by a breakaway party, the Fijian Association, which is led by former deputy prime minister Josevata Kamikamica. Fiji's 1990 constitution gives indigenous Fijians the right to hold the premiership and a guaranteed 37 seats in the 70-seat lower house. Indian Fijians have 27 seats, other races have five and the Polynesian island of Rotuma has one. Polling is spread over a week to allow for voting in outlying Fijian islands.
