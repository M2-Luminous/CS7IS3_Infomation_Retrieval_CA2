This is not a new incident because there have been similar clashes at the border. What makes this latest incident more important than previous ones is that the group included two Moroccans. These people claim they are to liberate the whole region and that they are connected with the Jihad movement of Afghanistan and of other regions. For the past two to three years we have been trying to solve this issue with the Sudanese Government in a very constructive way. There was no practical action taken to contain or control these activities other than empty promises. Generally speaking, we did not want to speak out. We believed we could solve the problem patiently and constructively because it was not our internal problem but a foreign problem. Since the source of the problem is Sudan, we were trying to solve it in collaboration with the Sudanese Government and other forces in Sudan. This is what we believed. However, while we were trying to solve the problem such incidents continued to occur. The issue remained outstanding. Finally, there was this incident on 16 December. The said people were killed and one of our unit commanders was killed. We do not want any Eritrean killed, particularly at this time when there is no reason for any Eritrean to be killed. We cannot keep a death on our side a secret. We do not regard this incident as a victory. In the past our policy was extreme tolerance, because we did not want the issue to get out of hand, but now it has reached this stage. We do not care about those who were killed in the previous fighting, but because there is no reason for a combatant to be killed now, after independence, because we do not want such incidents to happen again, and because we do not want the matter to be kept secret, we are informing the public about the war which has been declared on Eritrea and its people. [passage omitted] We see no reason for foreigners coming all the way from Morocco, Tunisia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to fight in this country. Moreover, we cannot keep silent when such a war is declared on us, nor can we keep silent before the world. This is because we have managed to reach this stage after a long and protracted war. We are therefore trying our best to solve this problem not only in the interests of our country, but also in the interests of the region. [passage omitted] We know how to play with fire. There are different types of fire. We have enough experience in how to play with fire in the past, and we no longer want to play with fire. Enough is enough. [passage omitted] We will persevere, but this does not mean that our patience is inexhaustible and it does not mean that we will continue with the same policy we have been following. The people know where their duty lies. [passage omitted] [Unidentified reporter] Won't such an incident negatively affect the historical good-neighborly relations with our neighbors, particularly when the attempts are connected with foreign intervention from abroad? [Isayas] The Jihad movement in Eritrea was formed by the Sudanese National Islamic Front. This is clear to all. The front also knows and admits the fact. It is not a secret. [passage omitted]
