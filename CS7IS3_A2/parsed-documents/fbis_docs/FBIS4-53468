Also, it wants all departments to shape up and cope better with the increasingly competitive economic environment. Between May 13-15, the Ministry of Finance held a seminar on its five-year plan. It was chaired by Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin, and attended by most senior officials. Until recently, the plan which is to cover the years 1993-1997 had been just a broad framework. The seminar was to refine the plan, transforming policy goals into policies and concrete measures. Speaking at the seminar, Tharin stated the role of the Ministry of Finance. He said it must strive for the country's macroeconomic stability given that international economic conditions are changing rapidly. It should also try to bring about more equitable regional income distribution, but that shouldn't adversely affect the overall economy. Thus, in its latest five-year plan, the ministry targets economic growth of 8.2 per cent a year in 1997. The ceiling for inflation and current account deficit (to GDP) is set at 5 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. "The growth rate that we set is not too high compared to current economic conditions. This is because we need to maintain macroeconomic stability , otherwise inflation could be too high causing the current account deficit to deteriorate further," said Suwan Phasuksawat, the Fiscal Policy Office's (FPO) deputy secretary general. Suwan said the policy instrument that the ministry will use is the govemment's budget, especially the expenditure side. It has to be consistent with prevailing economic conditions, and for the year 1995 it will have to be a balanced budget. He also said, "Public investment will become a major tool for the government to absorb the impact of externally induced economic volatility. It will decrease when the economic growth is too strong, but it will help activate the economy when it slows down." Dr Somchai Ruchuphan, FPO secretary-general, said the ministry will seek to maintain the value of the baht so that it remains credible as it is increasingly used in Indochina. "We seek to stabilize the baht because it is used widely [in] Burma as well as in Indochina. In 1997, the baht could be a currency for the region and in the near future foreign corporations would certainly issue baht-denominated bonds. We have to lay down necessary rules and look for measures to help keep the baht from excessively fluctuating," Somchai said. He said the government's further financial liberalization is contingent upon an assessment of the past impact. On revenue, three departments are involved. And their role from now on will be changed, Somchai said. The Excise Department will have to enhance its operational efficiency as it has to collect taxes on consumption of gasoline, some electronic items, liquor, cigarettes and automobiles. The revenue from these tax items tends to rise along with the pace of economic growth. The Revenue Department is expected to have a higher proportion of total government revenue as the base for value-added tax has expanded along with the economy trade and investment. And the department already has a policy to improve efficiency in tax collection. The revenue of the Customs Department is expected to fall due to international economic obligations. But the department may have to collect tax from a larger amount of merchandise as the tariff rate will fall. Treasury Department Secretary General Niphat Phukkanasut said the department would shift its attention to property development. It would adopt the private business concept and would propose that government agencies pay rental fees for the use of land which belongs to the Treasury Department. In the seminar, Tharin said the ministry would help local government to have at least twice the current revenue. This will come from fees on land transfer, estimated to be at least Bt10 billion a year. "Local government which sees active trading in land will also have higher revenue," Tharin said. To privatize education, Tharin said he would propose to the Cabinet some tax, incentives, including allowing schools to rent land from the Treasury Department at concessional rates.
