He headed a delegation of deputies sent by the upper chamber of Russian parliament to North Caucasus. After familiarizing himself with the situation in the zone under state of emergency, Vassily Tarasenko came to the conclusion that the content of the conflict is mostly connected with issues of ownership and power". Therefore, according to him, "the main thing for Russia now is not to give each side a little more power but establish necessary state power, for instance, in the form of a protectorate transferring to it all financial levers, judicial system and armed forces". Presidents of the republics will remain, chairman of the committee says, but practically a representative of the center will bear all responsibility for the state of affairs. However, if this representative exceeds his powers or violates the all-Russian interests he will be immediately held responsible before the center. During their stay in the zone of the conflict, the deputies associated with leaders of both republics, clergy, national movements, well-known representatives of intelligentsia, ordinary people and military men, and got convinced that all of them agree in one thing that "Russian presence is imperative there". Otherwise, "there will be fight in which innocent people will die as he who starts fighting, as a rule, does not participate in it".
