FR941227-0-00082 FR941227-0-00015 Three comments expressed concern that the implementing guidance was not provided to the public during the pilot program. A number of individuals requested, and were provided, the Coast Guard's NOV guidance during the pilot program. A copy of current implementing guidance is available by writing to: Marine Environmental Protection Division (G&hyph;MEP), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., room 3406, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001. Three comments felt that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) should have been published instead of an interim final rule (IFR). The changes to 33 CFR 1.07 are procedural and provide a benefit to the public. Thus, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3) a NPRM was not necessary. An IFR was published to provide a regulatory basis to conduct the pilot program. Comments were encouraged and a six month comment period was established. All comments were considered in implementing this final rule. The NOV procedure is optional and use of the procedure provides a benefit to the public. The IFR, however, requested comments both on the procedure and on its implementation. Those comments were considered before issuing this Final Rule, however no comments resulted in substantial change to the IFR. One comment expressed concern that Coast Guard personnel would be over-zealous in their prosecution of civil penalty cases against small business. The NOV option has safeguards built in to protect from such an occurrence. The criteria for using an NOV is based on the size of a spill and the violation history of the party to whom it may be issued. Issuing officers may not deviate from this criteria. One comment encouraged the Coast Guard to proceed with a final rule but make sure that all rights of a party are preserved and that ``no response'' should not be interpreted as acceptance of a penalty. As previously discussed, ``no response'' will result in processing of a violation through ordinary procedures as if a NOV had never been issued. One comment asked that the NOV be provided to an officer of the company that is being cited rather than an employee who may not pass it to the appropriate official. The comment also suggested that 60 days is a more reasonable time to respond. Since the purpose of the NOV option is to provide immediate notification of a settlement offer, it is impractical to always deliver the NOV to a company officer. Further, the NOV may be against an individual, not a company. Every effort is made to ensure that the correct responsible party is identified. As to the length of time to pay an NOV, the Coast Guard agrees that 30 days was too short a period. As a result of the pilot program the Coast Guard had already decided to lengthen the time a party has to respond to an NOV. During the pilot program the number of NOVs paid within 30 days was approximately 65%, while payment before 45 days exceeded 85%. Therefore, the deadline for payment of a penalty in a NOV in order to avoid submission of the case to the Hearing Officer established in ยง1.07&hyph;11(b)(4) has been changed from 30 to 45 days. Regulatory Evaluation No comments were received on the draft regulatory evaluation. This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It is not significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects there to be minimal economic impact from this procedural rule and a full Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. The total annual cost to the public from civil penalties is not increased by this rule. Both the public and the government should realize savings from the reduction in administrative processing costs through eliminating the need for review by the District Commander and action by the Hearing Officer in those cases in which the penalty specified in a NOV is paid within the allowed time by the party.
