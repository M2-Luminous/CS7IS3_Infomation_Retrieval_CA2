Indications are that the smallest coalition party of today is trying to transcend its own shadow: The organization that has always been a loyal follower of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is increasingly underscoring its independence and its people's party character. "Everyone has a bitter taste in his mouth, not as a result of envy, but because of the apparent difference between law and morality," KDNP chairman Laszlo Surjan said in his opening campaign speech on 13 February in Szeged. He demanded that legal order be based more on morality; these remarks pertained to the sales transaction involving the headquarters building between the MDF and Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats]. The unusually sharp statement by the chairman of today's smallest coalition party, the minister of public welfare in both the Antall and the Boross cabinets, indicates that the KDNP believes that the party's four-year subordination in governance expires in 1994. They hope that the elections in May will redistribute--favorably, from KDNP's standpoint--the roles to be played among the parties: i.e., that the KDNP remains a ruling party and that its weight is going to be definitive in the new coalition. Doubtless, the KDNP is the only ruling party whose election prospects have improved, as compared to the situation four years ago. Most recent public opinion polls indicate that the KDNP's popularity among voters regarded as certain to vote varies between 4 and 5 percent (HETI VILAGGAZDASAG, 5 March 1994), i.e., it barely surpasses the threshold limit applicable to parties to be seated in parliament, the fact is that of the same people questioned, the fewest number reject the KDNP from among all the ruling parties. This year the KDNP's chances are also better than they were in 1990, because they have, by now, made up for the lag caused by their late start in 1990. The KDNP was formed on 2 April 1989 (or, to be more accurate, it was reorganized, because the KDNP regards itself as the successor to Barankovics's Democratic People's Party, which, officially, never ceased to exist); it ran in the 1990 elections with 3,200 members, and with no press of its own. (In those days, the MDF had 21,000 dues-paying members, and the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] had 15,000.) One of the reasons for the delay in reorganizing the KDNP was that the "veterans," including then-party chairman Sandor Keresztes, the present ambassador to the Vatican, did not believe for long in the possibility of organizing a party, and pursued political discourse in a cover organization called "Aron Marton Society," or, for that matter, within the MDF. As a result of the delay, the KDNP was unable to establish slates of candidates in five counties, and thus, primarily in the southeastern part of the country, people could not vote for the KDNP even if they wanted to. (Each of the other five parties seated in parliament in 1990 ran 20 slates, but while the KDNP acquired more than 10 percent of the vote in five counties, FIDESZ managed to do the same in only three counties.) The KDNP faces this year's elections with almost 30,000 members, and tries to introduce new, albeit familiar, faces in the course of the campaign, along with Laszlo Surjan, who heads the national slate. Most frequently mentioned are an active and a former minister: Janos Latorcai, present minister of industry and commerce, and Ferenc Rabar, an independent, who served as the first finance minister of the Antall government, until his resignation in late 1990. The KDNP is also endeavoring to make up for its "lag in the media"; ongoing, detailed negotiations pertain to conditions for PEST MEGYEI HIRLAP becoming a newspaper under KDNP influence. The election program was also adjusted, of course. This is indicated by the change in the title of the program: The 1990 title (The Christian Way) was replaced by what has been a chapter title: "We want a society centered around the human being." According to the new program, the KDNP is "a party having the character of a movement, based on the Christian ideal, and with an independent, modern program." This definition was amended by the words "democratic and patriotic people's party" and "an organization independent from the churches." On the other hand, as the title shows, four years ago the KDNP emphasized that "a Christian outlook is the ideological foundation of our party," although even then, they added that "our party is not a `clerical' party." The change in emphasis obviously represents an endorsement of the pragmatic policies Surjan followed for the past four years. The minister of public welfare became a member of the KDNP's top echelon, and then its leader only after the elections, moreover, only after the government was formed, and only after the party leadership of Sandor Keresztes and Emese Ugrin was let go in May 1990. The odd aspect of his party career is that based on confidence in him manifested by Jozsef Antall, Surjan became a minister before he became the leader of the party or a representative, based on confidence expressed by the KDNP membership (in March 1990 he ran third in an individual voting district, and 15th on the party's national slate, and thus he entered parliament in September 1990, inheriting Sandor Keresztes's mandate after his ambassadorial appointment). The top position at the KDNP appears to be stable; Sandor Keresztes, who has been observing the events of the past years from the Vatican, and who is going to return to Hungary for the elections, ranks only fifth on the party's national slate. Keresztes is preceded on the slate by party Chairman Surjan, party Vice Chairman Laszlo Varga, Tibor Fuzessy, representative and minister without portfolio, and by Janos Latorcai, minister of industry and commerce. The secure positions of Surjan and his team is indicated by the fact that radicals within the party, such as Miklos Gaspar, Miklos Hasznos, and Miklos Palos, rank ninth, 10th, and 12th on the KDNP's national slate. Surjan visibly endeavored to tide over the past few years by remaining loyal to the MDF as the "last satellite," while showing his independence everywhere, especially in the form of rhetoric. All this led to spectacular actions from time to time: Most recently Representative Tamas Lukacs criticized the government's privatization practice, and called it "unacceptable to society," but the official KDNP position in this regard spoke only about slowing down and the correction of mistakes. All this mostly served the purpose of allowing the KDNP leadership to once again try to prove to voters that it should not be held responsible for the mistakes made in privatization, because, based on the division of labor in government, the KDNP exercised no authority with respect to privatization. (Undoubtedly, however, the KDNP supported a "well-considered," "well thought out" privatization program in 1990.) Several other old theses, virtually forgotten during the past four years, have gained new emphasis in the new KDNP program. For example, the KDNP returned to the principle of having the president of the Republic chosen in direct elections (the KDNP supported this alternative in the November 1989 popular referendum, but it did not in July 1990, after the party became part of the government); they regard an increased state role in the economy as indispensable, recommend central economic revitalization programs (the stimulation of enterprising, increased investments), and support the idea of establishing a peak economic ministry. A government under more forceful KDNP influence would protect producers with state-imposed restrictions (such as customs duties and quotas), according to the KDNP program. Regarding arable land, the KDNP would not even permit Hungarian-owned corporations domiciled in Hungary to acquire ownership (only Hungarian citizens, local governments, or the state would be entitled to do so), and the maximum limit of privately owned land would be 300 hectares or 6,000 gold crowns, (with no limit on the size or value of leased land). Incidentally, due to events that transpired during the past four years, it was the land program that needed the greatest change, because four years ago the KDNP took the position that lands owned by the state and by cooperatives be given to local governments (and people from whom the land had been taken away, could have reclaimed their land from the local governments). But this concept no longer made sense as a result of the compensation process. Nevertheless, an accounting of the accomplishments, as presented in Laszlo Surjan's opening campaign speech in Szeged, is flattering to the party: The KDNP managed to implement 80 percent of its campaign promises. For example, the party chairman made special mention of the fact that autonomous local governments have come into being, and that laws have been created concerning church property and the minorities. At the same time, however, he also mentioned the failure of "making inflation disappear quickly," and of reducing state expenditures as some of the fiascos. Based on four years of experience in governance, they omitted several theses from their program, which flow from "roots of one's world view," but which nevertheless proved to be unworkable in their original form. For example, they no longer demand the "development of a state power and state organization that corresponds with Christian ideals and the Christian world view"; on the other hand, they demand the limitation of the Constitutional Court's power (e.g., by removing its power to declare a law null and void). An "abortion-free Hungary" continues to be the declared goal of the KDNP, but by now, partly due to disputes that have arisen regarding the abortion law proposed by the KDNP party chairman and minister, they want to accomplish this as a result of educational work molding people's outlook, and they no longer talk about "preventing, without delay," "the organized extinction" of already conceived "Hungarian lives."
