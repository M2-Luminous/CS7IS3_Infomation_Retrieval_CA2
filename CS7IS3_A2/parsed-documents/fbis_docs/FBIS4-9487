Moravcik telephoned Dlouhy after no progress was made on this issue in today's session of Customs Union representatives at the deputy ministerial level, a ministry spokesman announced. Chairman of the Czech Office of Standardization, Measures, and State Testing Michal Tosovsky told CTK last Thursday [21 April] that problems could arise at the border with Slovakia because from May 1 Slovakia was again to recognize only its own food quality certificates. Czech certificates are considered unacceptable by the Slovak customs authorities. The Customs Union decided at its last session to work out an agreement, to be approved by both parliaments, that would allow each country to recognize each other's certificates. On Thursday Slovakia announced, however, that it would be impossible to get an agreement on the issue approved in the Slovak Parliament before the September elections.
