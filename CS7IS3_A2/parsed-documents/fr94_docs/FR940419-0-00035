FR940419-0-00035 FR940419-0-00012 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [WV7&hyph;1&hyph;5573; A&hyph;1&hyph;FRL&hyph;4840&hyph;6] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; West Virginia; Good Engineering Practice for Stack Heights AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of West Virginia. This revision establishes and requires that the degree of emission limitation required for the control of any air pollutant is not affected by that portion of the stack height which exceeds good engineering practice (GEP) or by any other dispersion technique. The revision is consistent with the stack height provisions under EPA's ``Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans_Control Strategy''. The intended effect of this action is to approve a SIP revision consisting of a stack height regulation adopted by the State of West Virginia. The State adopted this regulation to conform to the July 8, 1985 Federal promulgation of a revised stack height regulation. This action is being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action will become effective June 20, 1994, unless notice is received by May 19, 1994 that adverse or critical comments will be received. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Thomas J. Maslany, Director, Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107; Jerry Kurtzweg ANR&hyph;443, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and West Virginia Office of Air Quality, 1558 Washington Street, East, Charleston, West Virginia 25311. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David J. Campbell, Air and Radiation Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107; 215 597&hyph;9781. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 2, 1990, the West Virginia Department of Commerce, Labor, and Environmental Resources submitted a revision to its State implementation plan (SIP) to incorporate a regulation for good engineering practice (GEP) as it applies to stack heights. The revision consists of West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission (WVAPCC) Regulation 20_``Good Engineering Practice as Applies to Stack Heights'' (45CSR20), adopted by the West Virginia Legislature on April 8, 1989 and effective July 14, 1989. The SIP revision is consistent with EPA's revised stack height regulation as published in the July 8, 1985 Federal Register (See 50 FR 27906). Summary of SIP Revision On July 8, 1985, EPA promulgated a revised stack height regulation to ensure that the degree of emission limitation required for the control of any pollutant under an applicable SIP is not affected by that portion of any stack height which exceeds GEP or by any other dispersion technique (See 50 FR 27892). The regulation updated the rule promulgated on February 8, 1982 at 47 FR 5864. On April 2, 1990, the State of West Virginia responded to the July 8, 1985 Federal Register by submitting a SIP revision consisting of WVAPCC Regulation 20_``Good Engineering Practice as Applies to Stack Heights''. This regulation is consistent with EPA's stack height regulation. EPA Evaluation EPA has evaluated West Virginia's SIP revision request and concluded the following: (1) The stack height requirements will not adversely affect West Virginia's ability to enforce the current applicable emission limitations which adequately protect the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS); (2) the stack height requirements are clearly enforceable; and (3) the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 51 have been met. A more detailed evaluation is provided in a Technical Support Document available upon request from the Regional EPA office listed in the ADDRESSES section of this document.
