FR940303-2-00174 FR940303-2-00093 The 0.6 mpg fuel economy improvement for the MY 1993 domestic passenger car fleet may be attributed to mix shifts and technology changes in the following: significant changes in engine design, decrease in average curb weight, and automatic transmissions with lockup torque converters and four forward speeds. The 0.5 mpg increase average fuel economy for the MY 1993 imported passenger car fleet may be attributed to the same reasons as the domestic fleet improvements. The domestic fleet had a dramatic decrease in share of turbocharged and supercharged engines. Diesel engines declined in share after a small increase in MY 1992. Diesel engines were offered only on certain Mercedes Benz models during MY 1993. Passenger car fleet average characteristics have changed significantly since the first year, MY 1978, of fuel economy standards. After substantial initial weight loss from MY 1978 to MY 1982, the average passenger car fleet curb weight decreased from 3,349 to 2,808 pounds; the passenger car fleet average curb weight stabilized at 2,800 to 3,000 pounds. Table II&hyph;4 shows that the MY 1993 passenger car fleet has nearly equal interior volume, higher performance, but over 40 percent fuel economy improvement compared to the MY 1978 fleet (see Figure II&hyph;3).
