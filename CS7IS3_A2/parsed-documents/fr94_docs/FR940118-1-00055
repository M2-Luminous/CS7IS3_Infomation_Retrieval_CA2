FR940118-1-00055 FR940118-1-00008 This proposal requires separate PFD manuals for each hybrid PFD Type which may increase paperwork burdens. However, the Coast Guard has determined that this additional load will be balanced be decreasing the frequency of currently approved collection of information requirements. The current requirements will be reduced by decreasing the number of required inspections and tests. Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking revises established safety standards for hybrid inflatable personal flotation devices (PFD). The authority to regulate concerning PFD's is committed to the Coast Guard by statute. Furthermore, since PFD's are manufactured and used in the national marketplace, safety standards for PFD's should be of national scope to avoid unreasonably burdensome variances. Therefore, if this rule becomes final, the Coast Guard intends it to preempt State action addressing the same subject matter. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. These proposed rules are expected to have no significant effect on the environment. A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and has been placed in the rulemaking docket.
