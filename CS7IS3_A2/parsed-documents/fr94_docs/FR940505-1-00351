FR940505-1-00351 FR940505-1-00012 (ii) The information required under paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) (A) through (D), (e)(3)(ii) (F) and (G), and (e)(3)(iii) of this section for the products marketed after January 1, 1998; and (iii) A written report describing the research and development efforts undertaken to achieve the December 31, 1999 VOC limits. (d) Exemptions. (1) This article shall not apply to aerosol lubricants, mold releases, automotive underbody coating, electrical coatings, cleaners, belt dressings, anti-static sprays, layout fluids and removers, adhesives, maskants, rust converters, dyes or inks. (2) This article shall not apply to any aerosol coating product manufactured in California for shipment and use outside of California. (3) The provisions of this article shall not apply to a manufacturer or distributor who sells, supplies, or offers for sale in California an aerosol coating product that does not comply with the VOC standards specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, as long as the manufacturer or distributor can demonstrate both that the aerosol coating product is intended for shipment and use outside of California, and that the manufacturer or distributor has taken reasonable prudent precautions to assure that the aerosol coating product is not distributed to California. This paragraph (3) does not apply to aerosol coating products that are sold, supplied, or offered for sale by any person to retail outlets in California. (4) The requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section prohibiting the application of aerosol coating products containing volatile organic compounds in excess of the limits specified in the Table of Standards shall not apply to any noncommercial application of aerosol coating products purchased prior to June 30, 1996. (e) Administrative requirements. (1) Most restrictive limit. If anywhere on the container of any aerosol coating product listed in the Table of Standards, or on any sticker or label affixed thereto, or in any sales or advertising literature, any representation is made that the product may be used as, or is suitable for use as a product for which a lower VOC standard is specified, then the lowest applicable VOC standard shall apply. However, notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, if an aerosol coating product is subject to both a general coating limit and a specialty coating limit, as listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the product meets all the criteria of the applicable specialty coating category as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, then the specialty coating limit shall take precedence over the general coating limit. (2) Labeling Requirements. Each manufacturer of an aerosol coating product subject to paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall clearly display the following information on each product manufactured 90 days or more after the effective date of this article: (i) The maximum VOC content of the product as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, expressed as a percentage by weight; (ii) The aerosol coating category as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, or an abbreviation of the coating category; and (iii) The day, month, and year on which the product was manufactured, or a code indicating such date. If a manufacturer uses a code indicating the date of manufacture or an abbreviation of the coating category as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, on any aerosol coating product subject to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an explanation of the code or abbreviation must be filed with USEPA prior to the use of the code or abbreviation. The VOC content displayed may be calculated using product formulation data, or may be determined using the test method specified in paragraph (f) of this section. For cases where a new product subject to paragraph (c)(1) of this section is sold, supplied, or offered for sale more than 90 days after the effective date of this article, the labeling requirements specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall immediately apply. (3) Reporting Requirements. (i) Any manufacturer of an aerosol coating product subject to this section which is sold, supplied, or offered for sale in California must supply the USEPA with the following information within 90 days: the company name, mail address, contact person, and the telephone number of the contact person. The manufacturer must also notify the USEPA within 90 days of any change in the information supplied to the USEPA pursuant to this paragraph. (ii) Upon 90 days written notice, each manufacturer subject to this section shall submit to the USEPA a written report with all or part of the following information for each product they manufacture under their name or another company's name: (A) The brand name of the product; (B) Upon request, a copy of the product label; (C) The owner of the trademark or brand names; (D) The product category as defined in paragraph (b) of this section; (E) The annual California sales in pounds per year and the method used to calculate California annual sales; (F) The percent by weight VOC, water, solids, propellant, and any compounds exempt from the definition of VOC as specified in paragraph (b) of this section; (G) An identification of each product brand name as a ``household'' or ``industrial'' product; and (H) Any other information necessary to determine the emissions from aerosol coating products. (iii) The information requested in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section may be supplied as an average for a group of aerosol coating products within the same coating category when either of the following conditions are met: (A) The products do not vary in VOC content by more than two percent (by weight), and the coatings are based on the same resin type; or (B) The products are color variations of the same product (even if the coatings vary by more than 2 percent in VOC content).
