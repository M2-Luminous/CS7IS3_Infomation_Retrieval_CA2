The MDA who was the first to appear on the political scene has resorted to the experienced method of pressing the authorities after nearly a one-month demands to the government for its resignation. Four years ago the MDA by means of hunger strike forced the then political leadership of the country the Political Bureau of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) to resign. Prior to going on the hunger strike a rally of supporters of the MDA has been held at the square during which the demands for resignation of the government headed by the Premier P. Jasray were reiterated. About 8 thousand people participated in the rally in spite of the fact that the city authorities have not permitted to hold an action on the main square of the country. The democratic forces believe that the present government has failed to cope with the major social and economic problems of the country apart from this there has broke out a scandal the essence of which lies in that the former chief of the counterintelligence service has accused the leaders of the parliament and government of corruption and made public some compromising facts. Four month later P. Jasray had to refer to the court so that to succeed in getting "his dignity and honour violated to be restored".
