Recently, more lethal equipment arrived at the Luanda airport at night coming from Brazil, the DPRK, Russia, Israel, and Argentina. Such an attitude is dangerous to the current atmosphere of expectation in Angola, since the negotiators in Lusaka are about to reach an agreement. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] alerts the international community, particularly the United States to persuade the Futungo regime to abdicate its warmongering thoughts. UNITA also says that the Luanda regime has on various occasions tried to hinder the success of the Lusaka talks. The Luanda regime will be responsible for a possible failure in the process. UNITA believes that there is no possibility of establishing peace through a military solution in Angola, as stated recently by UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi in an interview with AFP journalists.
