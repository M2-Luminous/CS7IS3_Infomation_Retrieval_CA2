Cultural work departments at all levels should pay close attention to this work and do it in a down-to-earth manner. The appealing, edifying, and educational role of art and literature is reflected mainly by literary and artistic works. The practice of the various historical periods in which our party has led the masses in their struggles shows that outstanding literary and artistic works can play a tremendous and irreplaceable role in elevating the ideological realm of the masses, in encouraging them to be united and to struggle, and in promoting social progress. Therefore, producing outstanding literary and artistic works is the central issue in improving cultural work and in enriching socialist art and literature. Different times put different demands on the content of outstanding literary and artistic works. Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech at the National Propaganda and Ideological Work Conference demanded that contemporary literary and artistic creations "augment the main theme" [hong yang zhu xuan lu 1738 2254 0031 2467 1774]. So what is the main theme of our times? The following make up the main theme that drives us to progress and develop: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line; patriotic, collectivist, and socialist ideas and spirit; ideas and spirit that are conducive to reform and opening up, to the modernization drive, and to solidarity among the nationalities, social progress, and the well-being of the people; and all kinds of ideas and spirit that encourage striving for a good life through honest labor. Propaganda departments and cultural work departments at all levels should make great efforts to properly plan and organize the production of literary and artistic works that reflect the main theme. They should stick to the orientation of "serving socialism and serving the people" and the principle of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend," creating a fine environment for the flourishing of literary and artistic creations. They should make meticulous plans for important literary and artistic activities, and for promoting the upgrading of creations. They should strive to produce a number of outstanding films, television programs, works of literature, dramas, songs and dances, operas, and art works that are loved by the masses so as to meet the daily increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the masses, arouse their enthusiasm and working vigor, and promote reform and opening up and the modernization drive. The "five-ones project" (each year, propaganda organs in various localities should produce one good book, one good drama, one outstanding film, one outstanding television drama series, and one or several convincing good articles that bring out original ideas,) implemented in recent years has played a positive promotional role in augmenting the main theme. Literary and artistic works that reflect the main theme also must participate actively in competition in the cultural market. This demands that these works be both outstanding in ideas and content, and excellent in form of expression and artistic manner. Only this can really attract and inspire people. It is necessary to make great efforts to plan and develop news and publications, radio and television broadcasting, literature and art, and social sciences, as well as all cultural undertakings -- including mass community culture, the culture of villages and small towns, enterprise culture, and campus culture -- thus laying a solid foundation for augmenting the main theme. It is necessary to continue to increase input in the sphere of propaganda and culture, and to further improve conditions for the development of propaganda and cultural undertakings. We should support and finance outstanding and elegant literary and artistic works. While augmenting the main theme, we should pay attention to variety. The variety we are mean demands, on the one hand, that the literary and artistic works reflecting the main theme should be varied, interesting, and vivid in topic, form, style, and means of expression, and that they meet the many and multilevel cultural needs of the masses. Every work that educates and edifies the people, and that amuses and gives the enjoyment of beauty should have a place. Cultural work must be deepened continuously in order to meet the needs of a developing socialist market economy. It is necessary to further deepen the structural reform of performing organizations and the reform of other cultural units, and to progress and make breakthroughs in them, and through reform, to bring into play the initiative for creation and performance. It is necessary to promote cultural legislation, to perfect the system of laws and regulations for the cultural market and the rules for market behavior, to continue unswervingly implementing the principle of "paying simultaneous attention to enriching culture and wiping out pornography," to vigorously straighten out various problems in the cultural market, and to wipe out unhealthy things. It is necessary to be good at using such forms as literary and artistic criticism and theoretical criticism to guide public opinion and to promote the healthy development of literary and artistic creation. In the course of promoting the development of the cultural market, propaganda and cultural organs at all levels must handle properly the relationship between the social efficacy and economic returns of literary and artistic works. It is proper and necessary to stress economic returns. If economic returns are good, they can promote the development of the cultural undertaking. However, the value of a spiritual product is reflected more importantly by its social efficacy. Therefore, we surely must foster the idea of considering the situation as a whole, consider questions by placing social efficacy first, and make efforts to achieve the integration of economic returns and social efficacy. The broad masses are earnestly expecting the continuous production of inspiring, outstanding works. With the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, with a good contingent of writers and artists, and with the motivation of the lively and bustling lives of tens of thousands of people amid reform and construction, we believe the time surely will come when literature and art will flourish all the more! The masses are the creators of history -- the masters of reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive. Our propaganda and ideological workers come from among the people and serve the people. They should learn from the people and rely heavily on them. "Arming people with scientific theories, guiding people with correct opinions, shaping people with a lofty spirit, and inspiring people with outstanding works" are important tasks for the propaganda and ideological front. In the final analysis, they represent the interests of the people and reflect their demands. Only by relying on the masses in everything and by respecting the will and the originality of the masses can we complete them well. We should always bear in mind the goal of wholeheartedly serving the people and continuously improving our political quality and professional expertise, and should work conscientiously and struggle hard in order to complete this great and glorious task entrusted to us by the great times!
