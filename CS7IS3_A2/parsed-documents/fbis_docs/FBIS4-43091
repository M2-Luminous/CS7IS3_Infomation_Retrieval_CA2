The prime minister told [television station] Antenna "I know that elections will be held there (Skopje) sometime this fall, but, I believe there is a possibility of closing the issue before the fall. Allow me to keep to myself the reasons for this belief." Papandreou appeared to be attributing particular significance to the upcoming meeting between Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and international mediator Cyrus Vance in New York. The prime minister also appeared optimistic about the development of our country's relations with Albania and Turkey. He said that yesterday Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi asked to meet Papoulias, adding: "There is a possibility--not a certainty, just possibility--that the climate will change." He made it clear that the meeting will be held only when we are "satisfied that the rights of the Greek minority are being respected." Papandreou described the meeting between the Greek and Turkish foreign ministers in Istanbul as positive because, as he said, Papoulias "was given the impression that the artificially shrill tone of the tension may begin be abating." He stressed that Greece wants good relations with Turkey, which "has significant domestic difficulties and wants to divert its people somewhere else." He added that this is why Turkey recently resorted to creating artificial tension in our bilateral relations. Referring to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's suggestion that Greece disarm its planes when they fly over the Aegean, Papandreou noted that Greece is responsible for the Athens FIR [Flight Information Region], which is being violated by Turkish airplanes. He said: "If we were entering Turkey's airspace with aircraft that were equipped for maneuvers or anything else, then Turkey would be justified in speaking about a violation of its own airspace." He stressed that the problem is due to Turkish violations of Greek airspace. The prime minister showed that he does not believe that the United States has a single policy toward Greece, and made a clear distinction between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Christopher. Papandreou reiterated that the government reshuffle will not be extensive, and he congratulated Justice Minister Yeoryios Kouvelakis, Health Minister Dhimitrios Kremastinos, and Konstandinos Laliotis, the Environment, Town Planning, and Public Works minister, for the work they have done, making it clear that they will not be replaced. He avoided commenting on ministers' disputes or statements. He said he does not believe in a collective PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] leadership after him, adding: "I believe a pyramid is unavoidable." He reiterated that the next PASOK prime minister will be elected by the party's congress and that he will take a position himself. He criticized New Democracy [ND] Chairman Miltiadhis Evert because "he supported the drachma with words but actually undermined it by saying that the state would not have enough to pay pensions." He recalled that ND helped Sali Berisha become Albania's president. With Vance The talks between Greece and Skopje, which will be held at foreign ministerial level with Vance's help, may not begin before 16 June. According to relevant statements by the UN spokesman, there may be a short delay in the talks; Vance recently said the talks would resume "around 13 June." Last week, U.S. envoy Matthew Nimetz visited Athens and Skopje, essentially preparing the climate for the New York talks.
