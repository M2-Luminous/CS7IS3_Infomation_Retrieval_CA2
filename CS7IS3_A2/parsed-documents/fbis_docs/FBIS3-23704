The military and diplomats of the Russian Federation are making titanic efforts to persuade Alma-Ata to sign a bilateral agreement for a lease of, preferably, 30 years and to recognize Baykonur as a Russian base, if only de facto. But Kazakhstan authorities prefer a different version, one that is more attractive from their standpoint, one in which the cosmodrome could become a facility of multilateral cooperative efforts in which rich firms from the far-abroad could take part. If that were to come about, it could take jobs away from Russian space generals, who, unlike the specialists of the middle and lower ranks, would have nothing to command. That is why the military are continuing to try to prove to Moscow -- and to the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Andrey Kozyrev, who recently visited Baykonur -- that the lease is the only acceptable version. On the other hand, it's generally acknowledged that it is the Russian military who are maintaining the minimally required conditions for the operation of the extremely complicated assembly and testing complexes, the launch and firing centers, and the municipal and everyday services of the city of Leninsk, which has a population of 65,000. Of the R47 billion allocated for maintaining the cosmodrome in 1993, the lion's share was released from the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense budget. The spending for 1994 has been set at five times more (in absolute figures), but the money promised is having a hard time making it to Baykonur. In a 1992 interstate agreement, Russia assumed responsibility for 94 percent of the expenses for maintaining the complex, and Kazakhstan was obliged to pay the rest. By the will of the fates, the main facility for basing the military-space forces of Russia is on foreign territory. But then it's hard to call Baykonur a facility -- it's more like a small state within a state. There are almost 1,500 kilometers of roads running around the cosmodrome, and nearly 7,000 kilometers of power lines. The fixed assets of Baykonur are valued at nearly R4.5 trillion (at the prices for early 1994). Compared with that, the R56 billion spent on housing and municipal construction in Leninsk doesn't seem a very big amount. Occupying a big chunk of the Kazakh steppe with an area of approximately 50 x 110 km, the cosmodrome also controls huge tracts of land that are used as drop zones and right-of-way zones, and they're not only in Kazakhstan, but also in Russia, Turkmenia, and Uzbekistan. From a juridical standpoint, not to mention from simply a human standpoint, the situation that has come to pass around Baykonur can only be called nonsense. In the city and settlements around it, there are two police forces -- one Russian, one Kazakh -- and two court systems. True, there is still only one prosecutor's office, but because of confusion and the extremely complex living conditions, the staff members have announced a strike. In the words of the deputy chief of the cosmodrome, Maj.-Gen. Viktor Grafinin, the special conditions at the Baykonur facilities for the military-space forces of Russia that, for decades, were painstakingly hidden from "enemy eyes" are now being maintained by officers that are under Kazakhstan's jurisdiction, i.e., they are under the security service of a foreign country. According to Gen. Grafinin, there were 22 launches of space vehicles with military and national-economy missions from Baykonur in 1992. In 1993, there were four. This year, they're still waiting for the first. The space industry is gradually falling into decline. Judging from what civilian and military specialists say, give it three -- at best, five -- years, and the process of decay will become irreversible: equipment will age, and the people will leave. The unique experience and knowledge garnered at the expense of tremendous money and effort will be left unused. In the words of one Baykonur veteran who, over a 20-year period, rose from a worker to director of a large affiliate of NPO Energiya, the money that is being spent to mothball facilities and keep them in working order is fully comparable with the money that could produce an actual launch. In his opinion, three or four successful launches would be fully sufficient for attracting well- to-do clients who want to put their cargoes in orbit and for providing them safety guarantees. Moreover, the clients, in all likelihood, would want to be assured that the expensive equipment transported to the cosmodrome will not, one fine day, become someone else's property. That requires specific agreements between Moscow and Alma-Ata. Kazakhstan's desire to get for Baykonur as much as possible and, hopefully, the "green stuff" is entirely normal. But Alma-Ata still needs to understand that Moscow is not in a position to pay sums that go beyond the bounds of common sense. Recent events around the long-suffering cosmodrome have shown that within the next two months, that issue will be resolved by the highest level, by the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan.
