FBIS4-9682 "drlat062_n_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-062 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 Chile Foreign Ministry Official Views Exports, NAFTA Foreign Ministry Official Views Exports, NAFTA PY3003180794 Santiago Radio Cooperativa Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 30 Mar 94 PY3003180794 Santiago Radio Cooperativa Network Spanish BFN [Text] The Foreign Ministry [International] Economic [Relations] Directorate is seeking to increase exports of services, enhance the NAFTA negotiations, and explore new markets in Asia and other parts of the world. This was reported by attorney Juan Salazar, the International Economic Relations director, who gave a broad description of the Foreign Ministry International Economic Relations Directorate's guidelines. Salazar reported a substantial increase in the sale of Chilean services abroad, specially transportation and software sales, among other lines. As an example, he mentioned that last year our country exported services worth $3.2 billion, which represents 40 percent of our country's exports. Salazar believes this Chilean impetus toward the world requires that entrepreneurs and the private sector conform to the new international requirements. He said it is necessary for executives to be more aggressive and penetrate new markets in other parts of the world like Asia, specially China and Malaysia. He said: [Begin Salazar recording] We have tried to tell them about this new emphasis. For example, we have strongly mentioned Asia. There are new programs that [former International Economic Relations director] Jaime [Lavados Germain] already mentioned like market (?intelligence) and our country's image. There are negotiations that we will have to conduct. We also talked about NAFTA. We talked about countries outside our region, outside Latin America. We talked about services, which is a very important area. Instead of using a meaningless phrase, let's say that this is our second phase. [end recording] To implement these programs, for example, PROCHILE [Institute for Export Promotion] currently has 35 offices which it plans to increase to 200 across our country. Juan Salazar said a new entrepreneurial attitude is required. He said: [Begin Salazar recording] There is a discrete deterioration of the Chilean export process. Some people want to blame this problem on the exchange rate, for example. As international trade increases, I believe Chile will be facing increasing competition. We have to refine both the state instruments and the private sector actions in order to face this competition. [end recording] He said it would even be desirable if PROCHILE were privatized.
