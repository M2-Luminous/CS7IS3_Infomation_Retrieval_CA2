Security Council decisions, was exercising control in the no-fly zone in Bosnia-Herzegovina, delivered bomb strikes on Bosnian Serbs' artillery positions which shelled Gorazde and where, apart from civilians, U.N. and international red cross workers were staying. The U.N. secretary-general's envoy to the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi discussed with Butrus-Ghali the possibility of using aviation to protect U.N. personnel in retaliation to artillery shelling of safe havens, including Gorazde, as envisaged by U.N. Security Council resolutions. "These violations cannot be tolerated. However, neither one must support provocations to which the Muslim side resorts, of which U.N. officials have repeatedly reported. In its statement of April 6, 1994 the U.N. Security Council demanded an end to the provocation from either side. "Unfortunately, Russia was informed about the decision to use aviation retrospectively. We expect full information from the U.N. leadership about what happened. "As a direct and active participant in the Bosnian settlement Russia stands for the prevention of escalation of this conflict and for invigoration on the part of the international community of efforts aimed at showing all sides the road to peace."
