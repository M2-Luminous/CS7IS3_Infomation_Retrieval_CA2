Accompanied by Zhang Guoying, deputy secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, General Li Xilin, commander of the Guangzhou Military Region, and those in charge of the Ground Forces, the Navy, and the Air Force in Guangzhou, inspected the water situation at the Bei Jiang dike this afternoon along the section between Sanshui's Huangtang, Lubao, and Datang and Qingyuan's Shilan. They conveyed greetings to the more than 1,400 officers and men combating floods at the forefront. The whole length of the Bei Jiang dike currently is standing the test of the highest water level on record. The water level throughout the river valley is not expected to drop appreciably over the next few days and the flood peak has entered the Bei Jiang dike area. This, plus the rising water level in the Xi Jiang, means the high water level will last for some time. This will still pose a major threat to the safety of the earthen dike. Moreover, the weather may worsen, and work is under way to strengthen the dangerous section of the dike, but the situation of the dike foundation, which has a high degree of water penetration, is even more grim. Early this morning and in the daytime, the water situation in Bei Jiang was most critical. At 0300, 0800, 1000, 1400, and 1500 today, the water levels at the Bei Jiang dike measured at Qingyuan, Shijiao, Lubao, Datang, and Huangtang stations all were higher than the highest figures ever recorded in the past 50 years. After that, the water level at various sections dropped slightly, but rose again quickly after 1800. By 2200 today, the water levels at the five stations rose again, reaching 16.34, 14.80, 12.46, 13.94, and 11.93 meters, respectively, higher by 10-20 cm than the highest figures ever recorded in the past 50 years. According to Ou Guangyuan, head of the flood-control headquarters at the Bei Jiang dike, the water situation tonight and tomorrow will be very critical because the water level at the Bei Jiang dike will reach the highest point tonight. Afterward, it will drop slowly. The Xi Jiang floods also will reach the highest point tomorrow. The simultaneous rise of water in the two rivers will keep the water level high for 6-8 days. The time between now and 26 June is a tide-flowing period. Having been subject to the high water level pressure for a long time, the Bei Jiang dike will face a test. Until now, there have been no major breaches of the Bei Jiang dike, but owing to the loose soil at the dike's base, there have been leaks and gushes of water in scores of places. Both early this morning and in the daytime today, the most critical situation happened in Shijiao, where there were many leaks along the 16-km dike. There were 17 leaks in a single 3-km section. Some 300 soldiers have been dispatched to the scene to plug holes with sandy soil and stone. In the evening, a serious leak occurred in the Shijiao-Xialingzhou section, to which Ou Guangyuan hastily dispatched 900 soldiers to deal with the emergency. According to statistics from Zhaoqing, Qingyuan, Shaoguan, Foshan, Jiangmen, and the Bei Jiang dike, the number of people taking part in controlling floods and dealing with emergencies has reached 506,000. At 0400 today, the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee and provincial government delivered 100 tonnes of biscuits and 100,000 bottles of mineral water to Yingde to be airdropped by the air force to the 70,000-plus victims who are still trapped by the floods in that area. In dealing with the worst flood in 50 years, Guangdong has received vigorous support and help from the Guangzhou Military Region. The support troops have energetically organized people to inspect dikes, watch the water situation, enforce dikes, repair roads, and plug leaks and holes in dikes. At 1400 today, accompanied by Zhang Guoying, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee; vice governor Ou Guangyuan; and Major General Yu Lusheng, head of the Army flood-control headquarters at the Bei Jiang dike and deputy commander of the provincial military district; General Li Xinlin, commander of the Guangzhou Military Region; along with Lieutenant General Yang Zhengang of the Guangzhou Air Force; Major General Gong Gucheng, chief of staff of the Guangzhou Military Region; political department director Major General Lei Mingqiu; logistics department director Major General Chen Tianlin; Major General Liu Yuanjie, political commissar of the Guangdong Military District; Rear Admiral Zhang Zhensheng, commander of the Guangzhou Naval Base; and Rear Admiral Li Xingguo, political commissar of the Guangzhou Naval Vessels Academy; visited the commanders and fighters of the troops protecting the Bei Jiang dike. General Li said: The 30,000-plus officers and men of the Guangzhou Military Region are standing in readiness for orders to go to the dike at any time to deal with emergencies and combat floods. This afternoon, on behalf of Xie Fei, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, and Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin, Deputy Secretary Zhang Guoying extended greetings to the 5,000-plus officers and men at the forefront of combating floods and dealing with emergencies.
