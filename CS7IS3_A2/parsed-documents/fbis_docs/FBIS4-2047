Based on the opinions discussed at the meeting of the standing committee of the provincial party committee and the executive meeting of the provincial government, I will speak on four issues. 1. A Historical and Fundamental Change Has Taken Shape in Liaoning's Agriculture and Rural Economy Since the beginning of the nineties, party committees and governments at all levels in the province have led the vast number of cadres and people on the agricultural front to thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress, conscientiously carry out the party's series of rural principles and policies, adjust the unitary ideas for economic work, bring into better balance the relationship between urban and rural areas and between industry and agriculture, adhere to the strategic idea of promoting urban areas to lead rural areas and achieving integrated and common development of urban and rural areas, strengthen and extend leadership over rural work, continuously deepen rural reform, and strive to improve production conditions, thus effecting a historical and fundamental change in Liaoning's agricultural and rural economy. This year, in particular, the province has again reaped a good harvest in agriculture, achieved a new breakthrough in township enterprises, and effected a new change in the rural economy. A bumper harvest was won in farming, with grain output totaling 16.96 million tons, up 8.1 percent from last year when a bumper harvest was registered; and the output of oil-bearing crops 204,000 tons, up 15.7 percent. Vegetable output exceeded 10 million tons, the output of fresh and fine vegetables increased greatly, and the greenhouses for growing vegetables exceeded 550,000 mu, up 250,000 mu compared to last year. Fruit output came to 2.1 million tons, up 23.5 percent, and orchards exceeded 10 million mu. Animal husbandry grew steadily. Despite the serious influence of the No. 5 disease of livestock and the decline in the production of the major producers in the country, meat output is expected at 1.295 million tons, up 10.9 percent from the previous year; the year-end number of pigs in stock may reach 11 million heads, the same as in last year, and the number of pigs slaughtered was 10 million heads, up 5.8 percent; the number of the cattle in stock was 1.65 million, and that of the cattle slaughtered was 540,000, up 6.2 and 29.5 percent respectively; the number of sheep in stock was 2.4 million, and that of the sheep slaughtered 1.23 million, both a slight increase; and the output of poultry and eggs was 710,000 tons, up 10.4 percent. Liaoning's output value of animal husbandry is expected at 10.6 billion yuan, exceeding 10 billion for the first time. Aquiculture has made new headway. The output of aquatic products is expected at 1.46 million tons, up 10.4 percent, of which 620,000 tons will come from ocean fishing, up 8.6 percent. Prawn breeding was seriously affected by disasters. Despite this, sea water cultivated aquatic products reached 730,000 tons, up 11.1 percent, and fresh water cultivated aquatic products 110,000 tons, up 14.6 percent. The increase of good-quality varieties has led to substantial increase in output value, which is expected at 7 billion yuan, up 18.6 percent. New progress has been achieved in forestry. Up-to-standard afforestation totaled 2.04 million mu, up 22,000 mu from last year; forests of economic value have developed rapidly to reach 650,000 mu, up 300,000 mu; 160 million trees were planted by people voluntarily, 177,000 mu of saplings were cultivated, and 943,000 cubic meters of timber were produced. Production related to forestry has developed rapidly, with the output value of forestry expected at 1.2 billion yuan this year, up 23.7 percent from last year. Rural infrastructural construction has been expedited. At present, the whole province has developed 1,417 country trade fairs in rural areas with 1,079 comprehensive markets and 392 special markets, expanded the scale of the markets, and promoted the circulation of commodities. During the year, we sent 140 million laborers to participate in the construction of farmland and water conservancy projects, completed 410 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, harnessed rivers and repaired dikes totaling over 2,100 km, increased 2.65 million mu of water and soil conservation areas, developed 780,000 mu of water irrigated land, improved conditions for agricultural production, and raised the comprehensive production capacity; we accelerated the rate of building a network of highways, increased 2,375 kilometers of asphalt road surface, and improved 2,228 km of road beds of highways at and above the county level. Fairly great improvements were seen in telecommunications work, and a new leap forward emerged in township enterprises. It is expected that the total output value of township enterprises may reach 146.4 billion yuan, an increase of 71.1 percent over the previous year; the total output value of township industry may exceed 100 billion yuan, an increase of 65.7 percent; 6.9 billion yuan of export products may be delivered, up 36 percent; the total amount of profits and taxes may reach 10.6 billion yuan, up 47.3 percent; and the total amount of taxes may reach 5.06 billion yuan, up 35.1 percent. It is expected that the whole province will have 19 counties (cities and districts) each with a total output value of township enterprises exceeding 2 billion yuan, an increase of nine counties over the previous year; 360 townships and towns each with a total output value of township enterprises exceeding 100 million yuan, an increase of 95 townships and towns, of which, 10 may exceed 1 billion yuan; and 1,600 villages each with a total output value of township enterprises exceeding 10 million yuan, an increase of 535 villages. The "221" township enterprise project had been realized two years ahead of schedule. County-level financial revenues and the income of peasants have increased. The financial revenues of 65 counties (cities) of 14 cities across the province may reach 3.903 billion yuan, an increase of 28.13 percent over the previous year. Of these, the number of counties each with a financial revenue of over 100 million yuan increased from 6 last year to 13 this year; and the number of counties each with a financial revenue of over 50 million yuan increased from the 23 last year to 30. The average per-capita net income of peasants across the province may reach 1,100 yuan, up 105 yuan over the previous year. Thanks to sustained and rapid development in agriculture and the rural economy during recent years, the whole province has become self-sufficient in the total grain output with an average per-capita amount of over 400 kg, of which, the output of rice and wheat exceeded 120 kg. This year, we delivered 25,000 tons of paddy to the southern provinces for the first time. With the approval of the state, we began to export 300,000 tons of rice to Japan in December. We became self-sufficient in major nonstaple foods with a small surplus. The average per-capita amount of such nonstaple foods as meat, eggs, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables, and fruits was higher than the national average. Liaoning began to deliver pork to Shanhaiguan during the fourth quarter of this year, and 150,000 hogs were delivered; the average per-capita net income of peasants was maintained at above the national average, and the problems of food and clothing have been basically solved. In view of our province's tremendous changes in agriculture and rural economy and recalling the past situations, we heartily felt the pride of our province's major breakthroughs in rural economy under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our province's agriculture was a weak feature for a long time. Agriculture with a weak foundation had to support the large industrial setup in the urban areas, thus giving rise to a pattern of "big industry and small agriculture." In order to guarantee industry and urban supply, the broad masses of peasants have made tremendous contributions and sacrifices, undertaken the grain purchasing task that was higher than the national average by 200 percent, provided meat, eggs, vegetables, milk, and fish to the urban areas at very low prices, and some localities even had to buy hogs at a high price in order to fulfill the assigned purchasing tasks. Even under such circumstances, residents in cities and towns can only lead a life of sharing 2 kg of rice, 1.5 kg of flour, 0.15 kg of oil, and 0.25 kg of meat monthly. Because the people of Liaoning traveled to Shanhaiguan to buy pork, they got the name of "tigers of northeast China." Comrades living in Liaoning have experienced this personally. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, our province reaped bumper grain harvests for four consecutive years from 1990 and set historical records every year. Our province not only ensured self-sufficiency in grain and such main foodstuffs as meat, eggs, vegetables, milk, fish, and fruit and made the dreams of the people of several generations come true but also started to distribute its rice and pork to other places. This could not be imagined in the previous planned economy era. What inspires us more is that town and township enterprises, as new forces, are suddenly coming to the fore with a tendency of developing vigorously. The net increase in the output value of town and township enterprises totaled 100 billion yuan from 1991 to 1993. Simultaneously, the state did not make any investment in town and township enterprises. These enterprises even used a mere 2 billion yuan of bank loans annually. Such development speed could not be expected and understood from the viewpoint of the unitary planned economy. The rapid development in town and township enterprises not only helps slow the province's regression rate in industrial output value ranking in the whole country but also helps noticeably change the long-term situation of unbalance in industrial structure, product mix, enterprise structure, and ownership structure and also affects the province's economic development. According to calculation and analysis by relevant departments, from 1989 to 1993, the proportion of the rural output value in the total social output value rose from 28.9 percent to 36.8 percent, the ratio of the output value of the industries at or above the county and township levels to the province's total industrial output value rose from 75:25 to 69:31, the ratio of the output value of the state-owned and non-state-owned industrial enterprises to the total industrial output value rose from 68:32 to 52:48, and the ratio of the output value realized by large, medium-sized, and small enterprises to the total industrial output value rose from 53:47 to 47:53. The proportion of the export value of town and townshp enterprises in the local foreign exchange earnings from exports rose from 13.9 percent to 28 percent. The proportion of the profits and taxes of the non-state-owned industrial enterprises in the total profits and taxes of the industrial enterprises rose from 25.4 percent to 27.8 percent. Along with the changes in these several structures, not only some old economic patterns have been or are being changed but also the province has upgraded its economic capability for bearing the state macroeconomic regulation and control. In the latter half of 1993, the state strengthened macroeconomic regulation and control. Thus, the increase rate of the state-owned industrial enterprises began to fall after a rise. In a situation where the state-owned industrial enterprises registered a negative increase in output value in the fourth quarter, the province still kept the increase in the industrial output value within 21 percent this year. Of the newly added industrial output value totaling 50.1 billion yuan, the output value realized by state-owned industrial enterprises increased by 5.5 billion yuan, accounting for 11 percent; and that by non-state-owned industrial enterprises increased by 46.6 billion yuan, accounting for 89 percent. Of this, the output value realized by town and township enterprises increased by 38.54 billion yuan, accounting for 76.9 percent of the total increase value. Without big development in non-state-owned sectors of the economy, such as town and township enterprises, the situation in the early 1980's when the national economy was readjusted may emerge again in a situation in which the state-owned enterprises' growth rate fell after a rise and the GNP increase rate suddenly dropped from 8.9 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent in 1981. It may be like the situation in the three years of improving the economic environment and rectifying the economic order when the GNP growth rate was reduced from 11.3 percent in 1988 to 0.3 percent in 1990. Agriculture and the rural economy, as the most vigorous growing points, have played a decisive role in Liaoning's economic development. They have made contributions to Liaoning's rapid economic development. We should fully appraise and greatly praise this. Therefore, it is appropriate and natural for us to say that agriculture and the rural economy have effected a historical breakthrough and a fundamental change. These achievements were a result of the hard work of the cadres and the masses on the agricultural front, but they could not be separated from the great support provided by all trades and professions. Here on behalf of the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee and the Liaoning provincial government, please allow me to extend the most sincere gratitude and high respect to the cadres and peasants who have made tremendous contributions to Liaoning's rural economic development and the comrades from all trades and professions who have shown concern for and supported rural economic development! Witnessing the tremendous change in Liaoning's agriculture and rural economy and studying again volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping have enabled us to understand better the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Since the third plenary session of the 11th party Central Committee, the vast rural areas have eliminated the restrictions imposed by the "two whatevers," changed once and for all the people's commune system of "three-level ownership by the commune, the production brigade, and the production team, with the production team as the basic accounting unit, without change for 30 years," and instituted the household-based output-related contract responsibility system, which, as peasants said, has enabled peasants to "keep all they produce for themselves as long as they turn in sufficient amount to the state and set aside sufficient amount to the collective." As a result, peasants' enthusiasm has been fully boosted, and rural productive forces have been greatly liberated and developed. Meanwhile, in agricultural production, we eliminated the "leftist" stuff, such as "taking grain as the key link and wiping out all others" and eliminating chicken and duck breeding and vegetable planting as the "capitalist tails," and greatly developed diverse production while never slackening efforts in grain production. In this way, we have rationalized rural economic structure. What is more eye-catching is the rising of township enterprises as a new force. In the past decade or so, the output value of the township enterprises of the country has increased from 160 billion yuan to over 2,000 billion yuan. Such a growth rate is a miracle. Although some people frown upon and do not understand such remarkable development, it is indeed a reality that cannot be refuted or negated. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "rural reform has yielded good results in three years," "the true change is in rural areas," and "some changes are unexpected." Speaking on the changes in rural areas with Chinese characteristics, township enterprise development is the most evident characteristic of the endeavor to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. The reason for this is that rural areas, through reform, have established new mechanisms full of vitality, and that such mechanisms have a large capacity for self-development, self-regulation, and self-compensation. Early this year, information from all localities told us that peasants would no long grow grain, and that land would lay wasted. We firmly believed at that time that as long as we conscientiously implemented the party's series of principles and policies, adhered to the household-based output-related contract responsibility system, and gave full play to the role of the new mechanisms of rural areas, such a situation would never occur. Facts have fully proved this. Therefore, the vigor brought by the new mechanisms cannot be estimated with ordinary rules, and the mechanisms have opened up broad prospects for peasants to march toward a fairly comfortable standard of living. Comrade Xiaoping said: "Whether Chinese society is stable and whether China's economy can be developed should be judged, first, by whether rural areas can develop and whether peasants' life can be improved. To attain the 700-percent increase, an important thing is to see whether the 80 percent of our population can attain it. Judging from the current situation, the series of new rural policies have been successful." As has been proven in practice, Comrade Xiaoping's theses are totally correct. We must arm our minds with Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, persistently emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, and consolidate and develop the excellent rural situation. Comrades, why can such noticeable changes take place in our province's agriculture and rural economy in a short span of a few years after we have entered the 1990's? In addition to the correct leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council and the adoption of measures, such as deepening reform, developing science and technology, and increasing input, we also have many work experiences worthy of summarizing. First, we persisted in combining the urban efforts with the rural efforts to seek common development. For a long time, owing to various reasons, our province's priorities were mostly placed in industry in urban areas, failed to sufficiently attend to agriculture and rural economy, lacked a dialectical and united concept in handling the relationship between the urban and the rural areas and between the management of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and the development of township enterprises, always set them against each other, and even placed the development of agriculture simply in a subordinate place of guaranteeing urban supply and serving the urban areas, and believed that township enterprises would scramble for energy, raw materials, and markets with large and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, when the state adopted the macroeconomic regulation and control measures, we always set restrictions on township enterprises in the first place. As a result, we failed to develop the rural economy and successfully run state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. We summarized these experiences and lessons, proceeded from Liaoning's reality, made full use of our province's advantages of having many large and medium-sized cities, state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, a big proportion of raw material industrial units, many colleges, universities and scientific research units, and strong city functions, upheld the road of using the urban areas to bring along the rural areas, large projects to bring along small ones, heavy industry to promote light industry, and combined the efforts of urban areas with the rural areas to seek common development. Thus, we succeeded in effectively promoted a sustained, speedy, and sound development in our province's urban and rural economies as well as in industrial and agricultural production. Practice showed that combining the efforts of the urban areas with that of the rural areas to seek common development is conducive to enabling the rural areas to use the advantages of funds, technology, and trained personnel of the urban areas to transform traditional agriculture, develop township enterprises, and expedite the process of modernization; enabling the urban areas to use the favorable conditions of the rural areas to guarantee the supply of staple and nonstable foods to the urban areas, solve the contradictions of the shortage of raw materials and work sites, break the barriers of urban and rural areas, actively develop urban and rural markets, and realize the goal of optimum distribution of essential production factors and taking advantages of each others' strengths; enabling large industrial enterprises in the urban areas to realize product and technological transfer and spread in the course of transformation and readjustment, concentrate efforts on intensive and precision processing industry, develop high-tech and value-added products, and raise competition ability; enabling rural areas to be influenced by large industrial enterprises in the urban areas, to develop rural industry, break the old pattern of having the urban areas to run industry and rural areas to engage in farming, and accelerate the readjustment of industrial, product and ownership structures and distribution of productive forces; enabling the urban areas to exchange materials with the rural areas, promote cultivation and formation of markets, and accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economic structure; and enabling the urban areas to merge their economy with the rural areas, maintain a close relationship between industry and agriculture, and narrow the difference between the urban and the rural areas. Therefore, we may say that regarding the development of high-yield, fine-quality and highly-efficient farming, township enterprises as well as individual private economies as an important growing point of Liaoning's economic development is an inevitable choice. Liaoning is the first province to implement the system of "placing counties under city administration." It has experiences and gained lessons in combining the efforts of urban areas with that of the rural areas to seek common prosperity. Facts showed that in the condition of developing the socialist market economy, it is a general trend for the urban and rural areas to effect economic infiltration and amalgamation to become an integral whole, and a necessary path for invigorating Liaoning's economy by combining the efforts of the urban and rural areas to seek common prosperity. Second, we persisted in the principle that "two results must supplement each other." The practice in the past few years told us that to accelerate the development of agriculture and the rural economy, we must persist in the principle of never ignoring grain production; positively develop a diversified economy; follow the path of agriculture; promote the overall development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery; and promote coordinated development of the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. We used to grasp agriculture as it stands and to lay undue emphasis on "taking grain as a key link" in the rural work. As a result, the grain output did not increase, the foodstuffs were in short supply, and the peasants were still poor. This historical lesson was extremely profound. Grain is a special commodity linked to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, grain production should increase steadily. However, at present, the comparable results of grain production are reduced and the grain production areas and the peasants do not have high enthusiasm for growing grain. To maintain sustained and stable agricultural development, not only should the government strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control and carry out the policies to protect and support agriculture and the peasants but we should also bring into full play the functions of the new mechanism characterized by self-development, self-accumulation, self- regulation, and self-compensation, that has taken shape through rural reform; and carry out the principle that two results must supplement each other. First, at the time of stabilizing grain production, we should vigorously develop high-yield, high- efficiency, and good-quality agriculture; positively develop a diversified economy; and use the high income from the diversified economy to make up for the deficiency due to the low income from grain production so as to have the internal sectors of the large- scale agriculture supplement one another. Second, we should vigorously develop town and township enterprises, rely on these enterprises to "feed agriculture back," and supplement and develop agriculture with industries. This is the most realistic way for us to develop agriculture under circumstances in which our country is unable to follow the way taken by the western countries where a portion of money is drawn from the high profits realized by the industries to subsidize agriculture. This is just like what Comrade Xiaoping has said: "Conversely, the development of town and township enterprises is very helpful to agriculture and helps promote agricultural development and solve problems of comparatively low results of farm products and dampened enthusiasm of peasants. Over the years, we have persisted in this way and mainly relied on rural forces to develop the rural economy, maintained proper input to agriculture, better solved the contradictions due to the state's insufficient input to agriculture, and ensured sustained, fast, and sound development of agriculture and the rural economy. Third, we persistently protected and mobilized the enthusiasm of both the peasants and the rural grass-roots cadres. This is a principle that we have constantly persisted on when developing agriculture and the rural economy. Over the years, we have repeatedly stressed that the peasants are the main body of agriculture and that their enthusiasm should not be hurt. If their enthusiasm is hurt, the people may have to go without food. Even social and political problems will be created when the situation becomes serious. We also adopted policies to control the situation where the prices of production factors rose at an excessively faster speed, carried out the grain protective prices, implemented various aid-agriculture policies, made up our minds to carry out the measures for reducing the unreasonable burdens on the peasants, and effectively mobilized and protected the enthusiasm of the peasants. Simultaneously, we also stressed the necessity to protect and mobilize the enthusiasm of the rural grass-roots cadres. The rural grass-roots cadres are the links through which the party and the government establish contacts with the broad masses of the peasants. We should rely on the grass-roots cadres to specifically organize forces to implement various rural tasks. If their enthusiasm is dampened, the party's policies and principles and the government's political decrees will become a mere scrap of paper and will be implemented to the letter with difficulties. At the beginning of this year, in the course of implementing the party Central Committee and the State Council's policies on strengthening agriculture and the rural work, some localities shifted the responsibility of adding to the peasants' burdens on to the grass-roots cadres. This is unfair. They are only enforcers. If we set them against the broad masses of the peasants, their enthusiasm will be dampened. In light of this situation, we definitely pointed out at the first plenary session of the eighth provincial government: There is no denying the fact that a few cadres at the grass-roots level have violated laws and discipline and even bullied and oppressed the common people. The overwhelming majority of cadres, however, have been diligent and conscientious in serving the people. Their work is very hard. Without the arduous struggle of the vast numbers of cadres at the grass-roots level and without their faithful practice of the line, principles, and policies laid down since the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the tremendous changes in agriculture and rural economy today could not be explained. We must completely comprehend them. Pertinent departments of the state and provincial, city, or county authorities are responsible for some of the excessively heavy burdens on peasants. Not all of them are caused by cadres at the grass-roots level, and we should not shift all the responsibilities onto cadres. Leaders at all levels should assume responsibilities for the heavy burdens on peasants and should strive to protect and mobilize peasants' enthusiasm. Practice shows that our attention to protecting and mobilizing the initiative of both cadres and the masses has made the government function well and the people enjoy peace and has made cadres and the masses unite with each other to march towards the goal of having the people become relatively well- off. This is an important guarantee for the rapid development of agriculture and the rural economy. We should persist in combining cities with the countryside to effect common development, should make cities and the countryside complement each other, and should mobilize the initiative of both. This is not only a successful experience gained by our province in accelerating the development of agriculture and the rural economy but also the principle we must uphold in the future. We should strive to improve it continuously through new practices. 2. The Position of Agriculture as the Foundation Should Be Strengthened Rather Than Weakened in Establishing a New Socialist Market Economic Structure Agriculture has always been the stabilizing trade of the state and has been the foundation of the entire national economy. The third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee adopted the "Decision on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of the Socialist Market Economic Structure." In establishing the socialist market economic structure, is it necessary to strengthen agriculture and persist in the position of agriculture as the foundation? The answer is yes, of course. Just as Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out repeatedly: "In the process of building the socialist market economic system, we should continue to firmly and unswervingly implement the principle of considering agriculture as the foundation and firmly and unswervingly put agriculture in the most important position in economic work." Comrade Jiang Zemin called on the whole party to "strengthen the position of agriculture as the true foundation internally rather than externally, in deeds rather than words, and wholeheartedly rather than half-heartedly." Premier Li Peng also pointed out at the national rural work conference: "Today, in establishing the socialist market economic structure, the position of agriculture as the foundation cannot waver in the slightest degree, and agriculture should be strengthened rather than weakened." These important instructions of the central leading comrades have clearly pointed out the orientation for us to further strengthen the position of agriculture as the foundation and continue to attend to the rural work under the new situation. We should fully understand that the establishment of socialist market economic structure has not changed the reliance relations between the entire national economy and agriculture. Food is essential to the people, and all the people must have sufficient food to eat. As far as the whole state is concerned, the issue of feeding 1.1 billion population is the most important issue that should never be neglected. As far as the province is concerned, the proportion of industry is relatively great, with a larger urban population, heavier peasants' burdens, so that the issue of feeding the people can no longer be neglected. In this aspect, we paid a big price and had bitter experiences. Today, although the conditions have changed, we are still required to draw a lesson from the bitter experiences. In particular, under the condition of establishing a socialist market economic structure, the degree of reliance on agriculture by the entire society and the national economy has not been weakened but has been strengthened. This has manifest itself in the fact that the domestic and international markets are continuously setting new demands on the quality, variety, and quantity of agricultural products. More importantly, to rapidly tackle the most conspicuous contradiction--the unreasonable structures of industries, products, enterprises, and ownership, we must further strengthen the position of agriculture as the foundation and accelerate the development of agriculture and the rural economy. Of course, following the development of the modernization drive and the adjustment of the industrial composition, the proportion of the secondary and tertiary industries in the GNP will increase, and that of agriculture will decline. This is an unavoidable situation after the improvement of productive forces and social progress. However, this never means that agriculture is no longer important. Besides, the development of secondary and tertiary industries cannot be separated from agriculture; and only when agriculture is developed and peasants become affluent, can they provide a consumer market for the secondary and tertiary industries. We should note all the more that China's broadest market with the greatest potential for development lies in rural areas. When the rural economy does not develop, peasants' income don't improve, and the rural market is not opened up, secondary and tertiary industries will not develop and will even recede. Therefore, the endeavor to establish the new system of the socialist market economy is in unity with the effort to emphasize the fundamental position of agriculture in the national economy, and we should understand them as such. We should fully understand that the fundamental position of agriculture should be strengthened continuously if we are to solve the numerous problems in agricultural development. Although Liaoning achieved historical breakthroughs in agriculture in the past few years, the conditions for agricultural production have yet to be fundamentally changed, the foundation for agriculture is not solid, some localities are still weak in their resistance cabilities against natural disasters, and production fluctuates greatly. Meanwhile, some conspicuous problems remain in the process of advancement. 1) The price difference between industrial and farm products has widened, the comparable interests of agriculture have declined, peasants' income has increased slowly, and their enthusiasm for grain production has been dampened. 2) Agricultural investment is insufficient. This year, merely a small amount of the funds for agricultural capital construction and the special funds for supporting rural production was in place, and large amounts of credit funds were used in non-agricultural trades, thus affecting the construction of basic agricultural facilities and weakening the capacity for sustained agricultural development. 3) The rural production setup was adjusted slowly, the quality and variety of farm products did not meet market demand, and, in particular, processing of farm and sideline products aiming at increasing their value was stagnant, thus affecting the increase of peasants' income. 4) In institutional reform, some localities improperly stopped financial support to agrotechnical dissemination organs or diverted their personnel to other fields of work. As a result, the contingent of agricultural scientific and technical personnel is not stable, and agricultural scientific research and technology dissemination do not meet the needs in developing high-yield, good- quality, and high-efficiency agriculture. 5) Leading comrades of some localities do not attach sufficient importance to agriculture and rural work, nor exercise effective leadership over them. In doing work, they gave more consideration to cities and industry than to rural areas and agriculture and neglected agriculture. Liaoning is a large industrial province, and half of its population lives in cities. How its agriculture is developed has a direct bearing on the entire economic situation. If we do not continue to strengthen the fundamental position of agriculture and adopt effective measures to address the above-mentioned problems, agricultural development and even the regular operation of the entire national economy will be affected. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Agriculture is the foundation, and we must not forget this." We should have a thorough understanding of this, and implement this instruction resolutely. We should fully understand that strengthening the fundamental position of agriculture is an important content of and effective guarantee for Liaoning's "second pioneering program." Carrying out the "second pioneering program" and making the old industrial base regain its vigor and magnificence is a strategic policy decision made by the people across the province after they conscientiously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches given during his south China inspection tour, continuously enhanced understanding of the provincial situation, and learned form the successful experiences of other localities. To regain Liaoning's magnificence, we should not only develop the original advantages of state-owned large and medium-size exercise but, we should also greatly cultivate new growing points of the economy, including developing high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture and township enterprises, in order to form new advantages. The tremendous changes in agriculture and rural economy over the past few years have created conditions for accelerating the whole province's economic development, and laid a foundation for conducting the "second pioneering program," and, in particular, creating a favorable objective environment for invigorating the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. As all people are aware, state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises failed to find a successful path in areas like the implementation of the family-based output-related contracting in the rural areas under the influence of factors of the unitary planned economy and the urban economy, so that 70 percent of the enterprises failed to be invigorated, so that even while some became good or fairly good, they were extremely unstable, and thus became a major and difficult point for our province's economic development and structural reform. Our strenuous efforts are needed to speed up the change of operational mechanisms through deepened reforms and to expand investment strength to expedite technological transformation. This requires not only an exploration process, but also sufficient input of funds. However, for a long time, the state has collected excessive amounts of profits from state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, reducing profits retained by most enterprises to its lowest point. In 1990, the average per-capita profit retention was only 217 yuan, making it difficult for enterprises to maintain even simple production processes, not to mention technological transformation. Therefore, we proposed a series of policies to provide water for raising fish and to allow large and medium-sized enterprises to rest and build up their strength to accelerate readjustment and speed up transformation in an effort to conserve financial resources, and tried our utmost to put them into practice. In 1992 and 1993, we did not correct even a single cent of the profits earned by budgetary industrial enterprises across the province, and allowed enterprises to keep all the profits. In addition to the implementation of the input-output overall contracting system and tax refund, profit retention was as high as some 7 billion yuan. Where can we get the money under the situation in which the financial department must gradually increase its annual rigid expenditure? Thanks to the bid development of township enterprises and other non-state economic sectors, we increased financial revenues in the localities. Otherwise, it is impossible for us to achieve this. Therefore, at the central economic work conference of eight north China and northeast China provinces, cities and region, I briefed General Secretary Jiang Zemin that this is called "not digging a well until one is thirsty." If not, we have no money for conducting technological transformation in state-owned, large and medium-sized enterprises. If we fail to conduct transformation, a considerable number of enterprises may fall. Then, we will commit a historical mistake, be ashamed to face our predecessors and to brief later generations. So, we can say that developing agriculture and rural economy, township enterprises, in particular, in no way contradicts the invigoration of large and medium-sized enterprises. In a situation in which most state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises have not been successfully managed, if we fail to achieve great economic development in rural areas and still depend on begging for food and meat from other places, it will be difficult to maintain social stability, and the entire national economy will suffer one disaster after another. We should not simply pay attention to large and medium-sized enterprises. We must study and consider the overall economic situation of the whole province while correctly handling the relationship between the urban and the rural areas and between industry and agriculture, and trying by all possible means to invigorate large and medium-sized enterprises, we should also actively cultivate such new economic growing points as high- efficiency farming, township enterprises, as well as individual and private economic sectors in an effort to strengthen local financial strength, reduce financial delivery pressure of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, enable the implementation of state- stipulated policies on supporting large and medium-sized enterprises, and create conditions for invigorating them. Therefore, it is impossible to conduct the second pioneering program, rejuvenate the old industrial base, and revitalize Liaoning without agricultural development, invigoration of rural economy, and agricultural support. We should fully understand that to deepen reform and open wider to the outside world, we should stabilize agriculture all the more so as to stabilize society. The third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee drew up the basic framework for China to establish the socialist market economy system. The "decision" it adopted is the program of action for us to deepen reform in various fields. The implementation of the various reform measures and opening wider to the outside world require good external conditions and a stable social environment. This depends on the steady development of agriculture and the effective supply of farm products. Since the beginning of this year, urban and rural markets as well as people's feeling have been comparatively stable despite the rather large increase in price index. This should be attributed to the good agricultural situation, the ample supplies of farm and sideline products, and the thriving urban and rural markets in addition to the increase in people's income and their increased mental guard against price fluctuation. Even a slight slackening of efforts in agriculture and rural work will bring adverse influences on the market, people's lives, social stability, and even the endeavors of deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and establishing the socialist market economy system. Therefore, we must overcome the tendency of neglecting agriculture when the agricultural and rural situation is good. The better the agricultural and rural situation, the more we should remain clear- headed. 3. Carry Out Work in a Down-To-Earth Manner and Facilitate New Progress in Agriculture and Rural Economy Next year will be the year for comprehensive implementation of the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee to expedite the process of establishing the socialist market economy system and also one to continuously maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. What are the targets of Liaoning's rural work and how should we attain the target? This is a question this conference should clarify. Based on the guidelines of the national rural work conference and the actual conditions of the province, the provincial party committee and government decided, after study, that from next year and until the end of their tenure, Liaoning's rural work should aim at substantially increasing peasants' income and county-level revenues. Increasing peasants' income is the core of the current issues on agriculture, rural areas, and peasants. Thanks to rapid agricultural development, peasants' net income increased by 400 yuan in Liaoning from 1988 to 1993, showing an average annual increase of 9.5 percent. Allowing for price rises, however, the actual increase was merely 1.56 percent. If peasants suffer a sluggish increase of income and lack purchasing power, rural markets will not become brisk, it will be difficult to expand the market capacity of industrial products, and peasants' investment in production is bound to decline. As a result, the target to achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living will be difficult to attain. Increasing county- level revenues is a key issue concerning Liaoning's economic development and social progress. Last year, among the 65 counties (cities) and suburban districts in the province, those whose revenues exceeded 100 million yuan numbered merely six, and those whose revenues were less than 20 million yuan numbered 15, including some whose revenues were merely about 10 million or 8 million. Thirty of the 45 counties and county-level cities in the province relied on financial subsidies, which totaled 391 million yuan a year. Without changing such a situation, it will be difficult to develop the county-level economy and achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development of the province. Peasants' net income should be increased to 1,800 yuan, an average annual increase of over 5 percent within this government's tenure, thus achieving a fairly comfortable standard of living ahead of schedule; and one- third of the 65 counties (cities) and suburban districts should increase their revenues to over 100 million yuan, and the rest should double their 1992 revenue figures. This is another grand objective in Liaoning's agricultural development in the new situation to establish the socialist market economy system and is an arduous historical task. Next year is the first year to realize this magnificent goal. It is extremely important to have a good beginning. Major targets for next year's agriculture and rural economy are: Gross grain output should be stabilized at 15 million tonnes or more; total output of meat, eggs, milk, and aquatic products should reach 4.04 million tonnes, up by 10 percent over this year's figure; fruit output should reach 2.3 million tonnes, up by 10 percent; total output value of township and town enterprises should surpass 200 billion yuan, up by 42.9 percent; the net per capita income of peasants should reach 1,250 yuan, 150 yuan more than this year's figure; and financial revenues at the county level should also have a substantial increase. In line with this fighting goal, the general guiding ideology for next year's agriculture and rural economic work is: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should profoundly implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; should energetically develop the high-output, fine-quality, and high- efficient agriculture, with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure as the goal, with markets as the guidance, and with efficiency as the central link, on the premise of never neglecting grain production; and should positively develop secondary and tertiary industries, with township and town enterprises as the mainstay, and accelerate the modernization of agriculture and the industrialization and urbanization of the countryside in an effort to make the rural economy flourish in all fields. We may meet many difficulties in implementing the above-mentioned guiding ideology and in materializing the above-mentioned goal. We maintain, however, that favorable conditions are more than difficulties. First, the development of agriculture and the rural economy has already brought forth a good mechanism, and this kind of mechanism will show an even greater vitality in accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. Second, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have recently adopted another series of major policies and measures that are conducive to developing agriculture and the rural economy, and these policies and measures will surely further mobilize the initiative of the vast numbers of peasants and the cadres at the grass-roots level. Third, the train of thought concerning the development of agriculture and the rural economy has been even clearer. So long as we firmly and unswervingly march forward, we will surely be able to win a new victory in developing agriculture and the rural economy. Fourth, over the past several years, a good foundation has already been laid for the development of agriculture and the rural economy, bumper harvests have been reaped in agriculture for four years running, five trades have been brisk in the vast countryside, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery have developed completely, a historical breakthrough has been made in developing township and town enterprises, the construction of infrastructure has been accelerated in the countryside, financial revenues of counties and townships have increased continuously, and the material condition for accelerating the development of agriculture and the rural economy has been better than that in any other period. Fifth, market prices have good prospects, prices of all grain and foodstuffs have been decontrolled, and, in particular, the state will raise the procuring prices of grain next year. Therefore, peasants' enthusiasm in production will be enhanced further. Sixth, through the endeavor in the past several years, the province has already witnessed a number of good examples that we can learn from and use as a reference. So long as we conscientiously summarize and energetically spread their experiences, we can bring along the extensive development of the rural economy throughout the province. Seventh, natural conditions are better than those in previous years. Reservoirs in the province have stored more water than in the past. Since the beginning of this winter, the province has experienced many successive snowfalls. The land of Liaoning is covered with silver snow, promising a bumper harvest next year. So long as we make full use of these favorable conditions and make great efforts to surmount difficulties, it can be affirmed that our province will have another excellent situation in agriculture and the rural economy next year. For this, we should have full confidence. First, we should take markets as a guidance to vigorously develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture. New demands have been set on agriculture in the course of setting up the socialist market structure. We should conscientiously study the influence over the province's farm and sideline products by the reform measures that will be worked out by the state next year as well as the changes in the domestic and foreign markets' needs for farm and sideline products. Oriented by the macroeconomic policies and market demands and closely in line with the target of increasing economic results and increasing revenues, we should accelerate the readjustment of the cropping, breeding, and farm and sideline product processing industrial structures and vigorously develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture. On the premise of stabilizing grain production, we should positively develop a diversified economy. To ensure "the supply of sufficient food," our province should steadily turn out more than 15 million tons of grain. This target must not be changed. To stabilize grain production, we should mainly follow the way of increasing per unit yield and increasing total output. We should gradually increase the overall grain production capability by strengthening farmland capital construction, developing water irrigated areas, popularizing plastic-film covering techniques, improving soil quality, standardize the farm work with improved varieties, and rising multiple cropping targets. We should widen the field of vision to develop a diversified economy; persist in the overall development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery as well as the overall management of the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries; link science with industry and trade; and follow the path of large-scale agriculture. It is necessary to readjust the farm cropping structure and reform the cropping system. Particularly, the areas in the southern and western parts of the province should fully use the favorable conditions created by this winter's increased snowfalls to appropriately control and reduce paddy rice sown areas, to expand wheat sown areas, and to intercrop wheat and soybeans. By so doing, will we not only reduce water consumption and alleviate the southern areas' strain on water supply but also regulate the province's grain varieties, solve the problems of having surplus rice and insufficient wheat and lacking soybeans, and avoid creating the disasters due to "autumn drought." In this way, the peasants will also increase their income. Next year, the province should ensure 4 million mu of wheat sown areas and strive to reach 4.5 million mu. It is necessary to continuously develop the production of protected areas, garden-based economy, and ecological agriculture. To develop forestry, we should combine long-term efficiency with short-term efficiency and gradually increase the income of forest farmers. According to the market demands and in line with the principle of planting different trees on different types of areas, the areas with a slope of 25 degrees or below should develop economic forests, vigorously develop fresh and dried fruit trees, replace forests by fruit, and unify the social benefits with the environment benefits and the economic efficiency. In particular, we should make unswerving efforts to plant trees along both sides of the mountain slopes of the Shenyang-Dalian Expressway. The areas around cities should plant more coniferous trees and broad leaf trees to make them green and beautiful. It is necessary to quicken the pace of building "Liaoning on the sea." We should fully use such natural resources as having long coastal lines, more beaches, and vast sea areas to vigorously develop the sea breeding industry and to positively and steadily develop the deep-sea fishing industry so as to enhance the export and foreign exchange earning capability. We should strengthen the breeding, popularization, and import of famous, special, new, and high-quality animals and plants; vigorously increase the number of quality farm products; and quicken the development of non-polluted foodstuffs. We should vigorously develop the intensive and precision processing of farm and sideline products and increase their value and economic results. Now, the province's processed farm products account for a small proportion, the quality of farm products is poor, and the storage and fresh maintenance quality is low, and the package is not exquisite. The primary products account for 70 percent of the total farm products exported through foreign trade. Therefore, we should change as soon as possible the situation that only primary farm products are exported. We should introduce foreign advanced techniques to upgrade the intensive and precision processing of farm and sideline products and enhance the ability in competition on the domestic and foreign markets. It is necessary to further develop agriculture with foreign exchange earnings. The foreign trade departments and the enterprises for exporting farm and sideline products should strengthen the contacts with the peasants, provide information and technological service for the peasants, vigorously pioneer foreign markets, and send increasingly more farm products to international markets. We should strengthen the setup of export bases and special plants, share risks and benefits with the peasants, and develop the economy where trade, industry, and agriculture are united as one. Second, we should deepen rural reform and improve the rural operating system. We should continue to stabilize and improve the household-based output-related contract responsibility system. We should encourage peasants to increase investment to improve the productivity of land. The term of land contracts should be extended another 30 years. Public bidding may be adopted in developing the resources of wasteland, and the term of the contract may be extended another 50 years. Within the term of the contract, the contracted land will not be increased or reduced no matter if personnel are increased. Compensated transfer of land use right is permitted. On the premise that the responsibility system with household- based output-related contract as the major form is stabilized and improved, we should popularize the operations adaptable to scaled economy in line with specific local conditions and as long as peasants' desires are fully respected in the localities where the secondary and tertiary industries are fairly developed and labor forces have transferred and enjoy a stable income, especially the southern area of Liaoning where township enterprises are fairly developed. Localities where conditions permit should greatly advocate the system of unified farming and separate management. We should accelerate the reform of the managerial system of state-run farms to meet the needs in establishing the socialist market economy system. In livestock breeding, we should actively popularize large- scale and intensive management and support the development of large grain and livestock growing households. We should greatly develop the cooperative shareholding system. We should make full use of Liaoning's advantage of large amounts of rural savings deposits to guide peasants to increase investment in production, especially in the secondary and tertiary industries, and develop the cooperative shareholding economy. Making use of their transportation, resources, and human power advantages, many localities in our province have accumulated considerable funds through development of the diversified economy. We should actively guide peasants to invest in the secondary and tertiary industries, with township enterprises as the mainstay, to expand production. We should encourage peasants to invest with the land, fruit trees, mountain areas, and forests they have contracted as well as their own labor service, funds, and technology to establish cooperative shareholding farms, orchards, forest farms, and enterprises with integrated trade, industrial, and agricultural management. Third, we should intensify construction of agricultural basic facilities, achieve success in comprehensive agricultural development, and improve the conditions for agricultural production. Intensifying construction of agricultural basic facilities is a matter concerning the sustained development and long-term stability of agriculture, and it should be carried out successfully. We should put construction of agricultural basic facilities in an equally important position as energy, transportation, important raw materials, and other basic industries and should continue to increase investment in it. Water conservation is the basic industry of the national economy, and we should attach adequate importance to it. We should continue harnessing large, medium, and small rivers successfully and accelerate the development of water resources to meet the needs in agricultural development. Intensifying construction of farmland capital construction is an important part of the endeavor to improve the conditions for agricultural production. We should continue the "Dayu Cup" emulation activities in farmland capital construction. At present, we should give particular attention to building the supporting facilities for bridges, culverts, and sluice gate stations to improve their drainage capacity. We should step up the equipment renewal and technical transformation of large- and medium-sized irrigation and drainage stations and the facilities of irrigated areas and develop irrigated areas. Power facilities for agricultural use are old and not safe, which not only waste energy resources but also increase the burden on peasants. We should adopt measures to replace their equipment and technically transform them step by step and manage them well. Developing rural communication and transportation is an important guarantee for enlivening the economy and making peasants prosper. We should continue to step up construction of county and township road networks to build 2,488 km of asphalt roads and transform 1,154 km of roadbeds next year to change the backward transportation of Liaoning's rural areas, especially economically less developed areas. We should speed up the rural postal and telecommunications undertakings and accomplish the "2127" project on schedule. We should continue to improve the ecological environment focusing on tree planting and water and soil conservation. We should make early preparations against drought and floods next year and enhance our capacity for resisting natural disasters. We should do a better job in comprehensive agricultural development. In line with the demand of industrialization, we should engage in serial development of superior industries and leading products, give priority to grasping integrated serial development of seven superior industries and a batch of leading products, including grain (animal feeds), animal husbandry, aquatic products, forestry and timber, dried fruits and medicinal herbs industries, and enable rural economy to become more specialized, commercialized and socialized. Based on comprehensive agricultural development, we should make overall arrangements for all sorts of funds and use them in a concentrated manner in an effort to raise the effect of the use of funds. We should expedite the pace of comprehensive agricultural development in Liaohe delta, and raise its comprehensive production capacity. It is necessary to build high-yield, fine-quality, and highly-efficient farming demonstration zones, give priority to planting fine varieties of crops that reflect the new achievements of agricultural science and technology, and raise the scientific content of agricultural products. We should select the best places for building scientific and technological agricultural development parks and develop new- technology agricultural industries through policy guidance, input of science and technology, the support of funds, and other measures in an effort to stimulate the transformation of traditional farming, and promote regional economic invigoration. We should unceasingly improve the service system closely-related with agriculture, such as popularization of technology, cultivation of fine strains, livestock inoculation, vegetation conservation, meteorology, and farm machinery. Fourth, we should actively implement the strategy of invigorating agriculture through science and education, and invigorate the rural economy. Relying on scientific and technological progress, combining agricultural science with education, and raising the quality of peasants is the fundamental way for invigorating the rural economy. While strengthening basic research, we should place the emphasis of science and technology agricultural work on accelerating the application of scientific and technological achievements. The agricultural scientific research units should be eager to help and meet the needs of agricultural production, and should actively organize scientific research units to tackle difficult problems and serve the development of production in line with the difficult tasks in the course of production and developoment. At present, we should concentrate energy on popularizing high and new technology in the agricultural sector, continue to implement the "123" project, the spark plan, and the good harvest program, and raise the scientific and technical level of the agricultural sector. We should strengthen the building of agricultural technology popularization and service system. The agricultural technology popularization organs in townships and towns are a component of the state agricultural technology popularization organs, shouldering the heavy task of guiding agricultural development and popularizing advanced technology; township agricultural technology popularization personnel have been working on the forefront to implement the strategy of invigorating agriculture with science and education, shouldering the heavy responsibility of directly disseminating agricultural technology to peasants and raising the scientific and technical level of agriculture. Therefore, in the course of organizational reform, we must not simply "transfer them to other places," or make them "disconnect their relations with agricultural organs." In line with the agricultural technology popularization law, all localities should make use of the winter slack season to do a conscientious job in resuming, consolidating, and raising all agricultural stations in townships and towns, and keep this contingent stable. We must not reduce working fund in this aspect but strive to gradually increase it if possible. We should fully mobilize the enthusiasm of agricultural science workers. It is necessary to award agricultural scientific and technical personnel who have made achievements in scientific research and popularization, and give handsome awards to those whose achievement is outstanding. Regarding some agricultural science and technology projects, we should clearly define the method of collecting withholdings and giving awards according to a definite proportion of economic results as soon as the projects begin so as to raise the transparency of the work, guarantee the implementation of the projects, and mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of scientific and technical personnel to the maximum. We should continue to make overall planning for agricultural science and educational work, strengthen technical training for township and village cadres as well as peasants, extensively conduct the "project of issuing green certificates to peasants," raise the ability of township cadres in leading the economy, and enhance the quality of laborers. It is necessary to accelerate the readjustment of rural education, optimize the distribution of schools, reduce the number of above-quota teachers, increase educational input through various channels, and be determined to solve the problem of delaying the payment of wages for teachers prior to the end of this year. Economically developed localities should encourage prosperous peasants to invest in education. Fifth, we should persist in increasing agricultural input through various channels. Peasants are the mainstay of agricultural input. We should continue to give play to the vitality and role created by the "two mutual complementary efficiencies" brought by the implementation of the new mechanism of the family- based output-related contracting system since rural reform, induce and encourage peasants to develop diversified undertakings, develop township enterprises, and increase agricultural input. Governments at all levels should conscientiously implement the stipulation mentioned in the "agricultural law" that the "increase of agricultural investment from the state financial department should be higher than the increase of regular income of the local financial department," and ensure that the financial budgetary funds for supporting agriculture will increase annually. In capital construction investment, we should gradually increase the proportion of investment in agriculture; and in next year's loans, we should ensure that the scale of agricultural loans will be greatly increased over the previous year. The provincial, city and county levels should further perfect and improve the system of establishing agricultural development funds, and the relevant provincial departments should step up efforts to formulate methods for collecting and managing the funds. Meanwhile, we should boldly use foreign capital, raise the level of investment, and carry out developmental agriculture. Sixth, we should continue to develop township enterprises. From the aforementioned analysis of the rural economic situation, we can easily discover that the rapid development of the national economy of the whole province during the past few years should be attributed to the rapid development of township enterprises. Actively developing township enterprises has become a major issue affecting the province's overall economic situation and having a direct bearing on agricultural stability and development. In the past, we summarized the status and role of township enterprises from 10 aspects, such as promoting the prosperity of peasants, accelerating economic structural readjustment, urging large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises to change mechanism, improving the financially difficult situation of counties and townships, and promoting the building of spiritual civilizations, regarded these as a most important growing point of our province's economy, and called on township enterprises to take the lead in jumping to a new stage. Practice has proved that this major move is absolutely correct. We should uphold these major guiding thoughts, continue to implement the principle of "paying attention to the advanced units so as to make improvements and paying attention to those lagging behind so as to promote an even development," and implement the new "221" demonstration project on the basis of completing the "221 project" ahead of schedule. This means that we must devote four to five years to building 20 counties (cities and districts) whose township enterprises each has a total output value of more than 5 billion yuan, of which, 10 should exceed 10 billion yuan; 200 townships and towns whose township enterprises each has a total output value of more than 300 million yuan, of which, 100 townships should exceed 500 million yuan; and 1,000 villages whose township enterprises each has an output value of more than 50 million yuan, of which, 100 should exceed 200 million yuan. Counties, townships, and villages which have been listed as demonstration projects should simultaneously increase the development rate and economic efficiency, and make the development rate, the profits, and tax delivery show an average annual increase of more than 25 percent, 20 percent, and 15 percent, respectively. Areas where township enterprises have a good foundation, and have rapidly developed should exert efforts to readjust the structure, raise the grade, and increase efficiency. 1) We should march toward high and new technology. Comrade Feng Jiazhi from Xiaozhaizi has proposed that it is necessary to shift the production of the existing products of low technical content to other localities, and concentrate efforts on developing products of high technical content as well as high and new-tech products. This orientation is correct. Nowadays, science and technology have progressed and developed with giant strides. Township enterprises must catch up with this situation. 2) We should march toward economies of scale. Actively developing enterprise associations, forming a new advantage of enterprise groups and encouraging and supporting township enterprises with financial strength to county seats or even to cities to merge with, rent or buy medium-sized and small state-owned enterprises, or to buy shares from large state-owned enterprises may help township enterprises not only to open a vast world for development but also to create a new path for state-owned enterprises to change mechanism, so as to form a new pattern under which large enterprises bring along small ones, small enterprises stimulate large ones, and the urban areas and rural areas exert joint efforts to develop themselves. 3) We should march toward the international market, raise the level of township enterprises in creating foreign exchange through exports. According to analyses from relevant departments, our province's increase in foreign exchange through export has not been swift this year. It is lower than Shandong, Jiangsu, and Guangdong Provinces. The disparity is mainly caused by the export of products of township enterprises. So, we must exert strenuous efforts to develop export-oriented township enterprises. 4) We should march toward intensive management and combine township enterprise development with construction of small cities and towns. Relying on small cities and towns to develop concentrations of township enterprises helps to reduce investment of resources, land, and infrastructural facilities; to promote information exchanges, material distribution, shaping of the market, technology dissemination, and pollution control; and to produce polyreaction to increase the competitive edges of products. Meanwhile, it will also help to increase the economic strength of small cities and towns, accelerate their development, and facilitate the progress of the urbanization of rural areas. All localities should make overall plans and reasonable arrangements to develop the concentration of township enterprises and use this to promote the construction of small cities and towns in order to provide even better conditions and environment for the development of township enterprises. Localities where the foundation for township enterprises is poor and the development is slow should pool the efforts of various sectors, adopt even more flexible policies, and create a more relaxed environment to accelerate development. They should emancipate the mind further, remove obstacles, relax policies, and improve service to develop private and individual sectors of the economy in particular. Localities where township enterprise development is sluggish must achieve a notable breakthrough and progress next year. We should deepen the reform of township enterprises. An important reason for the unexpectedly rapid development of township enterprises lies in their mechanism that meets the needs of the market economy. In some township enterprises, however, there are also confused relations in property right and the "regression" of mechanisms. Some towns, townships, and villages ask township enterprises for the money and materials they need. If such a situation continues, township enterprises are bound to collapse! We should resolutely change this situation, never turn township enterprises into the subordinates or private coffers of town and township governments, and never change township enterprises' flexible operating mechanism and turn them into "second state-run" enterprises. We should conscientiously enforce the "regulations" on township enterprises, strictly implement the regulations on the profit distribution of township enterprises, and prohibit indiscriminate transfer of township enterprises assets. We should raise the level of enterprises' accumulation funds to enhance their ability for technical transformation and development and strictly enforce the regulations on subsidizing, supporting, and developing agriculture. 4. Conscientiously Strengthen Leadership Over Agriculture and Rural Work In the new situation in which the socialist market economy system is to be established, agriculture is the production restricted by natural conditions and market risks. Such special production requires that we conscientiously strengthen leadership over agriculture and rural work. We should include agriculture and rural work in our agenda and extend leadership over them. Not only should the localities where agriculture accounts for a large proportion attach importance to agriculture, but also the localities where industry accounts for a large proportion and large industrial cities have more favorable conditions to and should make agriculture and rural economy still better. Not only the leaders in charge of agriculture but also top party and government leaders should pay attention to the rural economy. Not only should we make rural work successful when there are numerous problems in agricultural production, but also we should strengthen rural work when the agricultural situation is good; and, when developing agriculture, not only should we develop grain production, but also we should develop township enterprises, the diversified economy, and the processing of materials to increase their value, on the premise that grain production is stabilized, so as to achieve high yield, good quality, and high efficiency. In short, all localities and all levels should, at all times, conscientiously put agriculture in the fundamental position of the national economy, develop it with unremitting efforts, and never, in the slightest degree, slacken efforts in it. Counties and townships, in particular, must devote major efforts to agricultural production and rural economic work. As I have said, leaders who do not understand rural areas, agriculture, and peasants cannot be regarded as all-round good leaders. We should use this as the criterion to judge the work of a city. We should positively guide and organize the peasants to enter markets. In developing the socialist market economy, the government does not lighten but even enhances its responsibility for leading agriculture. The new situation requires us to quicken the change of functions. The governments should change, in a step-by- step manner, the sets of administrative means and methods by pressing the peasants to engage in planting and harvesting, combating disasters, and providing relief to disastrous areas into the methods of offering market information, economic policies, and economic levers to the peasants and guiding and organizing them to engage in production and management according to market demands so as to eliminate the current contradictions between the decentralized management of the households and large-scale circulation and large- scale markets. So far, the peasants have paid attention to and entered markets. However, they still cannot use the functions of market mechanisms or handle affairs according to the economic law. This year, fruit growers in Dalian city miscalculated the market situation and waited for the right prices to sell the local apples. As a result, lots of Shandong's apples have occupied Dalian's market. We should draw this kind of lessons. According to the thinking that the governments cultivate markets, markets guide production, and production suits markets, we should strengthen the setup of the trade-industrial-agricultural integrated management organizations. We should organize and set up planting-breeding- processing coordinate management entities to form advantageous industries and key products, promote the development of bases with advantageous industries and key products, enable the bases to establish contacts with the peasants, and send the peasants to markets. We should strengthen the setup of grain, vegetable, aquatic product, ginseng specialized markets and farm and sideline product wholesale markets to enliven the circulation of farm products and to promote production. We should strengthen the setup of socialized service systems; provide the peasants with service before, during, and after production; guide decentralized management and the combination of the peasants with market demands; and make farm products and processed farm products become readily marketable. We should support grain production areas and poverty-stricken areas to develop the economy. The problem that the areas with high output of grain are hit by poverty has constantly been prominent. We should fully notice that under the socialist market economic conditions, various kinds of production factors will more easily be distributed to the areas with high efficiency. Therefore, the grain production areas where social benefits are high and their own benefits are low absolutely need the government support. We should vigorously support main grain production areas to develop precision and intensive processing of farm products. The departments concerned should first support them in regard to the arrangement of projects and the collection of funds. The province and cities should appropriately give priorities to the main grain production areas when arranging some key construction and technological transformation projects so as to gradually change their unreasonable industrial structure and low economic results. We should exert efforts to enliven the circulation of main grain production areas, give priority to the distribution and transportation of their grain, and strengthen the construction of the facilities to store up and dry grain in the sun. We should untie the grain "debt chains" in line with the method of adding overdue fines and interests so as to protect and mobilize the enthusiasm of main grain production bases. Over the past years, our province has made great achievements in supporting the poor and the poverty-stricken areas have basically had sufficient food and clothes. Under the new situation of building the socialist market economic system, the problems due to the uneven development of the regional economy still become more serious. These are the problems cropping up in the course of advance. The governments at various levels should pay high attention to this. The faster the economy develops, the more we should support the poor. The governments at various levels should mobilize their internal vitality, upgrade their self-development functions, study and work out support-the-poor measures, and quicken the pace of eliminating poverty and seeking wealth. We should intensify the protection, regulation, and control of agriculture. It is impossible for agricultural production to compete with other production on an equal footing because it has great risks and comparable low profits. Therefore, government support and protection are necessary. 1) The work to reduce the burdens on peasants should not be shaken. Measures for this work have won great popular support and yielded good results and, therefore, should be continued. 2) Resolute efforts should be made to prevent issuance of IOU's during purchases of farm products. We have done a pretty good job this year, and peasants are fairly satisfied. Banks, finance departments, and grain enterprises should please make continued efforts in the supplies of funds for the purchases. 3) Efforts should be made to ensure the payment to cover the price difference in the purchases of chemical fertilizers and diesel oil linked to the grain purchasing contract. 4) We should protect the limited cultivated land, establish the basic farmland protection system as soon as possible, strictly control the use of land for non-agricultural purposes, and adopt effective reclamation and compensation methods to control the use of large amounts of cultivated land. 5) Efforts should be made to carry out agricultural insurance in line with specific conditions and improve the agricultural risk compensation mechanism. In essence, to protect agriculture is to protect the interests of peasants. Governments at all levels should sternly investigate and handle all cases that damage the interests of peasants to protect and boost peasants' production enthusiasm. We should strengthen local governments' capacity to regulate and control agricultural development. A particularly important task for the present is to establish the local grain reserve system as soon as possible and develop a multi-level reserve system participated in by the central and local authorities as well as peasants. We should establish the grain risk foundation. Finance departments at all levels should use the reduced amount of subsidies resulting from lifting of grain price control as the grain risk foundation and development foundation and no other purposes. We should deepen the reform of rural credit cooperatives and establish rural cooperative banks to collect funds and provide better service to rural economic development. We should change work styles, go to the grass-roots level to continuously study and address the new conditions and new problems in rural economic development. Problems of one kind or another are bound to emerge in rural economic development following the establishment of the socialist market economy system and the deepening of rural reform. These problems, plus the old ones, will make new and old contradictions intertwine, increase work amount, and make our work more difficult. This requires that our leading comrades at all levels go to the grass-roots level and the masses to conduct investigation and study, pay attention to the major contradictions in rural economic development, and, in particular, study ways to properly resolve the new conditions and new problems emerging after the execution of a series of reform measures next year. Due to numerous factors, the prices of some staple and nonstaple foods have risen fairly substantially, thus bringing certain difficulties to urban people's life. The provincial government recently held a meeting on this work and sent a cable to lower levels to put forward some specific demands. Leading comrades at all levels should implement it well. In particular, they should adopt effective measures to help disaster- and poverty-stricken areas and loss-making enterprises arrange well the life of their people and workers so that they will spend the two large festivals happily. In line with the requirements of the party Central Committee and the State Council, we should implement to the letter the three tasks for opposing corruption and be determined to investigate and handle the major and serious cases like the ones committed by the Changtu County grain departments to enhance people's confidence in the anticorruption struggle. Leading comrades at all levels should take the lead in maintaining honesty and self-restraint and establish a good image among the masses, particularly during the New Year and Spring Festival periods. Comrades! Liaoning's agriculture and rural economic development have entered a new stage, and the tasks we encounter are both arduous and glorious. Despite the numerous difficulties and contradictions on the road of advancement, we will be able to promote Liaoning's agriculture and rural economy to a new level and make contributions to the "second pioneering program" and to regaining Liaoning's magnificence as long as we earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, further emancipate the mind, deepen reform, uplift spirit, pioneer the way forward, and work in a down-to-earth manner.
