This is already the second visit by the minister to Sevastopol, however, this time his meeting with the Black Sea Fleet Commander Eduard Baltin again failed to take place. Replying to a question from the journalists on whether the statement by President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov, on the beginning of the peninsula's demilitarization at the expense of reducing Ukraine's Armed Forces in the Crimea would cause aggravation of Ukrainian-Russian relations, Vitaliy Radetskyy stated that such decisions are outside Yuriy Meshkov's competence. Only the president and the Supreme Council of Ukraine can take such decisions. Vitaliy Radetskyy told the journalists about the development of the naval forces. The headquarters and the main naval base will be in Sevastopol. The defense minister positively assessed Ukraine's accession to the "Partnership for Peace." He pointed to the erroneous nature of the idea that the Black Sea Fleet was almost the only guarantor of Ukraine's security. "The guarantor of Ukraine's security is its people," pointed out the defense minister. Replying to the journalists' questions, Vitaliy Radetskyy, in particular, stated that in solving the fate of the fleet one should, first and foremost, draw up an inventory of the fleet and carry out its reduction.
