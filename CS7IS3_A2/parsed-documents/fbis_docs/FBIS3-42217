Six other escaped militants are standing trial in absentia on similar charges. As the trial entered its second day Tuesday, the presiding-judge read out the indictment sheet which listed the charges against the 15 defendants. They were all accused of belonging to an illegal group whose target is to overthrow the government by force. Three of them were accused of the attempted murder of Sidqi, by exploding a booby trapped car near his motorcade, and the premeditated killing of a teenage schoolgirl, Shayma' Muhammad 'Abd-al-Halim Jawdah. Four others are accused of inciting the murder attempts while the remaining militants face the lesser charges of illegal possession of weapons and forging official papers. "The nine defendants present denied all the accusations against them," defence lawyer Muntasir al-Zayyat told AL-AHRAM WEEKLY. He said the court also granted the request of the defence lawyers to meet with the defendants -- which they had been denied for nearly two months -- and another request for more time to study the case. Hearings, which first opened last Saturday, were adjourned until 5 February. At Saturday's opening session, one of the defendants said that although the al-Jihad organisation took responsibility for the assassination attempt, "all confessions made by the nine (to police interrogators) were extracted from them by torture." The organisation, in a statement faxed to foreign news organisations, said it was responsible for the attempt shortly after it was carried out on 25 November last. The nine defendants, standing in an iron cage during Saturday's session, seemed in fairly high spirits. They chatted with their relatives before the session started. Four volunteer lawyers were present to defend the accused militants. One of them expressed pessimism about the expected verdicts. Defence lawyer al-Zayyat complained to the court that the accused were being ill-treated and forced to make confessions. He also said the accused were being kept in solitary confinement in cells under poor detention conditions and asked the court to order an inquiry into these conditions. One of the defendants interrupted him to complain that the medical examiner assigned to verify their claims of torture was a woman. "How can we reveal ourselves before a woman?" he asked. Al-Zayyat told the court that military trials will not solve the problem of terrorism but may lead to more violence. At midday, hearings were interrupted by one of the defendants raising his voice to call for the noon prayer. During a subsequent recess, one of the defendants read out a statement by al-Jihad: "We wish to remind our fellow Muslims that they should not help the government with its plot but should boycott the national dialogue ... al-Jihad, led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, is opposed to any dialogue with the government and will pursue its struggle ... We do not have faith in these trials. Judgment is the prerogative of God." Al-Zawahiri, a doctor-turned-Islamist militant leader, is a prominent "Arab-Afghan" who fought with the Afghan mojahedin against Soviet occupation. He is believed to be in Europe at present.
