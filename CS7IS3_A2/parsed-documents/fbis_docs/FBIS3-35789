"A political basis for the forum was laid during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan in October last year. The forum will consider practically the entire range of matters concerning the situation in the Asia-Pacific region and measures to build confidence among the three countries," Colonel-General Andrey Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of Russia's frontier forces, told ITAR-TASS. The general arrived here to participate in the consultations. This forum is being held as an unofficial meeting at which no official agreements will be adopted and no statements issued. The principal purpose of the forum is to enable experts and government representatives of the three countries to exchange views frankly in a confidential atmosphere on the complex problem of ensuring stability and security in the region and map out ways to establish effective three-sided cooperation in this respect, the need for which Washington, Moscow and Tokyo have come to realise. Konstantin Sarkisov, deputy director of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Oriental Studies and member of the Russian delegation, in an ITAR-TASS interview, described the forum as a "sign of the times", pointing out that the time has come to make multilateral efforts to ensure security in the Asia-Pacific region. To Russia, the Tokyo forum is of particular importance, the expert said. His opinion is that the forum may become a regular one and in due course turn into a permanently functioning three-sided commission of representatives of the three countries. On the Russian delegation are also Gennadiy Burbulis, a deputy to the State Duma, Vladimir Zhurbenko, first deputy chief of the General Staff, Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov, Academician Aleksandr Yakovlev, and Vladlen Martynov, director of the Institute for the World Economy and International Relations. The United States and Japan are represented at the forum by a large group of experts and officials, among them Graham Allison, a prominent expert on Russia and U.S. assistant secretary of defence, and Hiroshi Fukuda, Japanese deputy minister of foreign affairs.
