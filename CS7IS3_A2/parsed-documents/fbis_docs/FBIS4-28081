Hata made the remarks at the House of Representatives Budget Committee, answering questions about Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa's scheduled visit this weekend to China and South Korea. "China has great influence over North Korea. It is making various kinds of dialogue efforts and I hope it continues them," Hata said. Kakizawa's visit was arranged for emergency consultations on North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program and potential punitive measures against Pyongyang, according to government sources. Cabinet Legislation Bureau chief Takao Ode said at the same session that if Japan resorts to force following a possible U.N. Security Council resolution on sanctions, the action would violate the war-renouncing Constitution. At a separate session of the lower house Foreign Affairs Committee, Kakizawa reiterated Japan's stance that it does not immediately urge economic sanctions against Pyongyang. The foreign minister said he hopes the United States keeps Japan's reluctance in mind at a Security Council meeting now in session. Kakizawa denied a possibility that Japan, South Korea and the U.S. will impose sanctions outside the framework of the Security Council if China, Pyongyang's last remaining ally, vetoes them. The U.S. has called on other Council members to join in a proposal to slap sanctions on North Korea for downloading some 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods from a nuclear reactor, a move that the U.S. warns could lead to the production of several nuclear bombs.
