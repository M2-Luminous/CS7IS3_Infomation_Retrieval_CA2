The Paraguayan minister launched his call in Washington at the midyear World Bank Development Council meeting, which he addressed on behalf of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. "It is encouraging to find out that the recovery of Anglo-Saxon economies and the signs that mark the beginning of the end to the recession in western Europe will have favorable effects on international markets as far as exports from developing countries are concerned. We are also very pleased and optimistic over the success of the Uruguay Round of the GATT talks, following many years of hard bargaining," Sandoval said. "We are especially pleased over the agreements reached in the agricultural field, although we would like to stress the need to gradually implement measures aimed at opening up markets while at the same time eliminating distortions caused by subsidies that industrial countries usually grant," Sandoval added. Sandoval also asked the World Trade Organization [WTO] "to actively guarantee the commitments that have been undertaken to curb the use of unilateral commercial measures, to help resolve disagreements, and to ensure proper cooperation between the WTO and the institutions created at the Bretton Woods Conference. This will allow better use to be made of the new markets, and will pave the way for more precise coordination between commercial and economic policies." The minister then discussed "the persistent decline in the international prices of our basic products." Because of this situation "our rural population, which is responsible for most of our production, has had to make greater sacrifices and its economic situation has worsened." Sandoval also spoke about the landlocked situation of both Paraguay and Bolivia, an obstacle which further increases the cost of exports from these countries, and urged "multilateral organizations to give priority treatment to technical and financial support for infrastructure projects aimed at improving regional transport."
