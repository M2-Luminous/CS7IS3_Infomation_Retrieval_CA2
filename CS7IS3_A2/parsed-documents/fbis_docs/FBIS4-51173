The meeting marked the taking of the concrete steps and measures to further implement the "one guiding principle and four important tasks" proposed by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the national work conference on propaganda and ideological work. The meeting, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and party's basic line, will conscientiously implement the guidelines laid down at the national work conference on propaganda and ideological work; sum up and exchange experiences gained from conducting education on patriotism across the nation in recent years; study ways to implement the "Outlines for Implementing Education on Patriotism" at primary and secondary schools under the new situation; and carry out the education on patriotism at primary and secondary schools in an extensive, in-depth, and lasting manner. Ding Guangen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, showed great concern for and attached importance to the education on patriotism. He heard briefings on the convening of the on-the-spot meeting and set forth his demands. State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing sent a congratulatory message to the meeting. In the letter, he pointed out that it was extremely important to call the on-the-spot meeting on education of patriotism at the primary and secondary schools, to sum up the rich experiences gained from conducting the education on China's contemporary history, on China's current situation, and on patriotism in recent years, and to institutionalize and persist in the system of conducting education on patriotism in the future. This will have a pragmatic significance to publicizing the major trend of the times and patriotism among the youngsters; to carrying forward China's excellent tradition; to promoting the 64-characters on the great enterprising spirit; to using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm and educate the youngsters; and to training a new generation of people with ideals, morality, culture and discipline for the next century. Last year, the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department; the State Education Commission; the Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television; and the Culture Ministry, after summing up experiences of conducting education through movies and television across the nation, issued a "Circular on Using Good Movies and Television Programs To Conduct Education on Patriotism at the Nation's Primary and Secondary Schools" and launched the activity of showing 100 patriotic and educational movies across the nation. The showing of 100 movies was welcomed by the broad mass of primary and secondary school students, teachers, and parents and obtained excellent social effect. Representatives attending the meeting called for persisting in this successful experience, for organically integrating this successful experience with educational planning, and for fully bringing into play the roles of movies and television as "lively and three-dimensional teaching materials." Liu Bin, vice minister in charge of the State Education Commission, spoke on ways of using education on patriotism to do a good job on moral education at primary and secondary schools. He stressed that education on patriotism is the foundation for doing a good job on building socialist spiritual civilization and that it is necessary to fully implement the policy of stressing the building of socialist spiritual civilization. First, he said, it is necessary to do an even better job in laying a foundation for education on patriotism and optimize the social environment for cultivating the people. Second, in addition to turning the schools into places to conduct education on patriotism, it is necessary to use such means as movies, television, books, magazines, and songs to foster students' patriotism. Third, it is necessary to greatly publicize advanced models' patriotism, so as to give play to the demonstrative and inspirational roles of advanced models. Fourth, it is necessary to establish certain protocols and rules, just like those displayed by the squad at the Tiananmen Square that is responsible for flag- raising ceremony, so as to instill patriotism among youngsters. Liu Yunshang, deputy head of the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department, presided over the meeting. Chen Zhili, deputy secretary of the Shanghai CPC Committee, attended the meeting to greet its opening and comprehensively and systematically briefed the participants on the experience of conducting education on patriotism at primary and secondary schools in Shanghai. The meeting was co-sponsored by the CPC Propaganda Department; the State Education Commission; the Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television; the Culture Ministry; and the Communist Youth League Central Committee. Some 150 representatives and people in charge of relevant departments from 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities attended.
