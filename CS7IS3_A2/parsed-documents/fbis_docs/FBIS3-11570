Ortega Testimony PA2203192494 Managua Sistema Nacional de Television Network in Spanish 0200 GMT 22 Mar 94 PA2203192494 Managua Sistema Nacional de Television Network in Spanish 0200 GMT 22 Mar 94 Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [From the "National" newscast] [Text] The military prosecutor in charge of the case of the murder of Jean Paul Genie today applied a precautionary measure to General Humberto Ortega. Today, Gen. Ortega for the first time presented himself at the Military Prosecutor's Office to testify on the case of the young Genie. The Army chief testified for more than five hours regarding the charges of his alleged responsibility in the Genie killing. The general said that on the day Genie died, 28 October 1990, he was in his residence. He said the Army has been supporting the Investigative Commission as a result of conversations he has had with other high-ranking officers and in response to a request from former Government Minister Carlos Hurtado. During the lengthy questioning, the prosecution asked about the Army chief's movements and the administrative structure of the Army. At the end of the interrogation, Prosecutor Lester Gallo ordered precautionary measures against Gen. Ortega. [Begin recording] [Ortega] In my case, having assumed my own defense, the precautionary measure ordered by the Military Prosecutor's Office is to limit my movements for a lawfully established period of time in my home town, which is Managua. [Raymond Genie, father of Jean Paul Genie] As we see it, house arrest is not important. The magnitude of the sentence must correspond to the magnitude of the crime. These moves are aimed at earning much public attention and at producing international effects to later shun the matter. [end recording]
