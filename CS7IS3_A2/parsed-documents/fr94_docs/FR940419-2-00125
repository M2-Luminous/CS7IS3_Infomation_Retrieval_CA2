FR940419-2-00125 FR940419-2-00070 The CHX's Constitution provides that appointments to the Executive Committee are made by the Vice Chairman of the Board with the approval of the Board of Governors. 15 In December 1992, the Commission approved changes to the CHX's organization and governance, 16 including changes to the Exchange's Executive Committee. Before that rule change, the Executive Committee was comprised of six Governors and the Chairman, Vice Chairman, and President. The rule change removed the Vice Chairman from the Executive Committee and provided instead for seven Governors. In addition, the Chairman was designated as the Committee's Chairman with full voting powers. The President, however, remained an ex-officio member of the Committee without the power to vote. 15 See Article V, Section 4 of the CHX's Constitution. 16 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31633 (December 22, 1992), 57 FR 62402 (December 30, 1992). In approving the 1992 changes to the Exchange's Executive Committee, the Commission emphasized concerns about floor domination of the governance of the Exchange. 17 When appointing the Executive Committee members the CHX's Constitution directs the Vice Chairman to assure the geographic diversity of the Governors appointed to that Committee. 18 Consistent with this directive, the Executive Committee has traditionally consisted of two public Governors, two ``upstairs'' member Governors, and two floor member Governors. 19 The Exchange represented at the time of the 1992 changes that it continued to support such diversity in the Executive Committee and expected its future composition to be consistent with past practices. 20 17 Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires that the rules of an exchange assure a fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and provide that one or more directors represent issuers and investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or a broker-dealer. The Executive Committee wields most of the powers of the full Board between Board meetings. As a result, floor domination of the Executive Committee (like floor domination of the Board) may violate Section 6(b)(3)'s requirement of fair representation. 18 Art. V., Sec. 4 of the CHX's Constitution. 19 The Exchange indicated that the seventh Governor member of the Executive Committee (created by the departure of the Vice Chairman) would be appointed ad hoc, depending on the strengths and weaknesses of individual Board members and the needs of the Exchange.
