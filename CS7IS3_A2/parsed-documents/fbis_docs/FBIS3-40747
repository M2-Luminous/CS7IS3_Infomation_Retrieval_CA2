When the court met this morning, three of the accused--Shanthan, Ravichandran and Suseendran--who had been boycotting the proceedings, were present along with Irumborai who could not come to the court during the last sitting on Nov. 25. Murugan did not turn up at first but appeared after a break in the proceedings. The charges were read out to him when he was alone in the court. He covers his face: Throughout the 30-minute exclusive proceedings, Murugan who had been boycotting the proceedings saying that he did not believe that he would get a fair trial, neither responded to the court staff's query nor accepted the charges against him. He hung his head and covered his face with one hand even as the court staff after reading out each of the charges repeatedly asked him whether he accepted them. Murugan, who did not engage a lawyer for himself, however, received a copy of the court order framing charges against all the 26 accused after signing the acknowledgement. The bearded Murugan, who usually dressed neatly, was clad in a lungi and shirt when he came to the court. He left the court immediately after the staff announced that the proceedings were adjourned to Dec. 9. Though he did not stand up when the court staff called his name, a normal practice followed by all the other accused to hear the charges, Murugan stood up as a mark of respect when the presiding officer, Mr. S.M. Siddickk, entered the court and retired back to his chamber. Earlier, after the charges were read out against the four accused, the judge retired to his chamber even as the prison authorities tried to bring Murugan to the court. After a 30-minute break, Murugan, accompanied by senior prison personnel including the Additional Superintendent of Police, came to the court. Following this, the judge came to the court again after which the court staff read out the charges framed against Murugan. Though the accused remained silent when the court staff asked whether he pleaded guilty, it will be recorded by the judge that the accused did not plead guilty as per Section 228 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure. Murugan has been charged under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act, Section 6 (1-a) of the Wireless and Telegraphy Act, besides the common charges framed against all accused under Section 120 9B Indian Penal Code (punishment for conspiracy) and various Sections of the IPC and provisions of the TADA Act. The other four accused replied in the negative when they were asked whether they pleaded guilty. They were engaged in a conversation for most of the time when the charges against them were read out. Why the 'reluctance': Murugan was reluctant to come to the court as he did not like to reply in one word to the court's query whether he pleaded guilty or not to the charges, Mr. V. Elangovan, defence lawyer, who met the accused this morning to persuade him to attend the court, said. The accused was also advised by another defence lawyer, Mr. T. Ramadoss, who was said to have told him that it was not fair to boycott the proceedings after having appeared in the court once and argued his case. Stage set for trial: With this, the process of reading out the charges to all the 26 accused was completed. The stage is now set for starting the regular trial and examination of witnesses. The judge did not fix any date for the trial, but official sources said it was likely to begin during the second or third week of Jan. Barring Mr. Doraisamy, counsel for 13 accused including Nalini, none of the other defence lawyers is planning to appeal against the trial court order framing charges against the accused. With the pre-trial proceedings coming to an end, further proceedings including cross examination of witnesses would be held in-camera. The two National news agencies, United News of India and Press Trust of India were allowed to cover the pre-trial proceedings under Section 226 (prosecution presenting its case) 227 (defence reply to the case) and 228 (framing of charges) of the code of criminal procedure. No more press coverage?: Though the recent amendment to the TADA Act gives the discretionary power to the designated court judge to conduct the trial in open or in-camera, it is unlikely that the press would be allowed to cover further proceedings in the case. The prosecution was very particular and cautious in not disclosing the identity of the witnesses and the details of their deposition in the interest of both the accused and the case, sources said.
