In response, a competitor from behind the fence, the Institute of Aviation, presented the Kobra design, with a great deal of fanfare. Subsequently, absolutely nothing more was heard about the Kobra, while, for the Skorpion, there were still all kinds of offers, even at the government level. Several ministers had apparently signed something like a "declaration of intent," but, ultimately, (officially at the International Defense Industry Show in Kielce), Henryk Goryszewski himself declared, with a note of sadness in his voice, that "at least for the time being nothing is going to happen with the Skorpion." Everyone knows the problem is money.... Roman Czerwinski, deputy minister of Industry and Trade (as one of the few people in government who really understand aviation), told POLSKA ZBROJNA that additional thought needs to be given to the question of a new Polish "battlefield" aircraft. He also asserted, "As long as I am here, I will not allow the plants to limit themselves to research and development work." There is hope that a team of designers will appear who are detached from their home plants and will take a serious interest in this subject. The money that is reallocated to this will not be eaten up by the factories as a whole. It is possible that this opinion has reached other ears as well. The reason is that the editors recently received two invitations: the first from the Institute of Aviation, and the second from the PZL Okecie. There was again talk of "the need to preserve the Polish defense [industry]" and of "the need for assistance from the government." (We do not question either one.) A large number of urgent warnings and sounds of disappointment (which we understand) were heard. In this entire outpouring, however, we got the feeling that they had their feet more firmly planted on the ground (which is otherwise understandable from people who deal with aviation) rather than floating around up in the clouds. It turns out that neither the Institute nor Okecie has stopped working on its ideas because "right now you have to make proposals rather than just sitting around waiting for offers." "We finance what we can from our own resources," said the director of Okecie, Ryszard Leja. The PZL was recently visited by representatives of a possibly interested party in the United States, saying that there are several engines set aside for the Skorpion. "They are waiting, as are we, for a decision." "We are doing the work on the D-18 power plant (a double-bypass engine with the thrust of about three tons) almost on a charity basis," was what we heard at the Institute of Aviation, where they also claim that they are ready to take part in an actual military aircraft program that would be 70 percent Polish-designed and developed. Right now the best advertisement for the PZL Okecie is Lieutenant Colonel Andrzej Strigl. What he does during demonstrations on the Orlik is a piece of aerobatics in the shape of a large "S." He is convinced that the aircraft is outstanding. "I have been flying it for quite a while now. I have also written an item on training pilots how to fly the Orlik. So that my younger colleagues will be able to feel safe in it, I myself have tested out many unconventional elements." Lt. Col. Strigl currently flies nine types of aircraft, including the latest creation from the Institute of Aviation. He is thus in a position to compare: "These are different aircraft in their classes. Flight students can go from the Orlik to the Iryda, but never the other way around. They may not be top of the line compared to corresponding world designs, but Poland is not that far behind...." However, Andrzej Stigl has not yet flown the Iryda with the 1.5-ton-thrust K-15 engines. To date, the only one to do so has been Ludwik Natkaniec, the Polish aviation legend, who has spent 10,000 hours in the air, mainly in prototypes. "This is the aircraft we have been waiting for," he says after 50 hours of testing the Iryda with Kaszub [engines]. The more he learns about the aircraft, the more it impresses him. Favorably. He had not expected that all of the designers' calculations would turn out to be so accurate. "On paper, these calculations are one-dimensional. It is only in the air that you can really feel what this aircraft is capable of. It is dynamic and easy to operate because its performance has so much in reserve that even high temperatures, heavy loads, and heavy weather do not overwhelm it." Natkaniec has looked "into every nook and cranny." He has verified that the aircraft remains stable at maximum speeds, when diving, when pulling up, and in spins. The tests obviously still have to be run again, but it can already be said that the Iryda has already done extremely well, even in situations that are not provided for by the requirements. It is a safe aircraft. Its takeoff run has been shortened by 40 percent (compared to aircraft equipped with the Iskra power plants). It climbs very quickly (its rate of climb is 40 meters per second). The pilot sitting in the cockpit has a very good field of view. "It is an aircraft that is fun to take through the air. Yes, an old pilot would like to emphasize that strongly." The test pilot from the Institute of Aviation is afraid that the M-93 version, bristling with automated equipment, will not measure up in this regard. "Which does not mean, of course, that it is not necessary to go in that direction...." The Kaszub engines were developed and built entirely in Poland. Domestic Polish materials are also used in it. With one exception: In the first compressor stage, titanium vanes, the forgings for which come from Russia, are employed. This considerably lengthens the service life of the power plant. Docent Martin Kowalski, who oversees the work on the Iryda as regards the use of the K-15 power plant in it, thinks it will easily pass the 600-hour government test that began on 1 October in a test bed. The K-15 has already achieved the other design parameters. And, most important, it has proved itself in the air. Work has now been completed that will make it possible to increase the aircraft's load capacity and check the resistance of the gas-dynamic curve of the power plant under combat conditions, as well as increase the flight range to the absolute minimum limit of flutter resistance. The next stage will be the Iryda M-93, which should be a very strong competitor for the best aircraft in its class worldwide. The Iryda M-93 is the immediate future for the Polish aviation industry and that of the former Central Industrial District, and, consequently, for the Polish Air Force. Its chief designer, Wlodzimierz Gnarowski, says that the new Polish trainer-combat aircraft, which took a long time getting born through the fault not only of the designers (although they obviously had to overcome certain, not insignificant limitations of knowledge and experience), will ultimately be just as we want it to be. The most important thing is that the designers of the Iryda and its manufacturers from Mielec and Rzesow are not telling fairy tales illustrated with wood and plastic mock-ups. The Iryda can already easily reach a speed of 830 kilometers per hour ("We feel we will soon be up to 920 kilometers per hour"). There are real prospects for export, which will improve even more as the avionics of the aircraft are modernized. Unfortunately, with the production base that now exists, we are not in a position to domestically produce for the Iryda highly integrated systems that would meet NATO requirements. The Institute of Aviation and the WSK [Transportation Equipment Plant] of the Polish Aviation Plant Mielec have thus entered into a cooperative venture with the French firm SAGEM [Company for General Electrical and Mechanical Applications], which is disposed to invest its own funds in modernizing the avionics of the Iryda, accepting a minimal return. The French also want to undertake broader cooperation with the Polish electronics industry. Engineer Gnarowski has issued an invitation to a demonstration of the Iryda with the new avionics, which is scheduled to take place in late January or early February. "In my view, this will be the culmination of a multiyear effort on the part of designers and manufacturers whose names are worth mentioning here: Faleski, Rucz, Pogoda, Szelag, Jonski, Zawadzki, Kania, Lipinski, and Kowalski from Warsaw, and Potapowicz, Sek, Kozik, and Wojtkowski from Mielec. We should mention that none of them have yet said the final word...." The Polish aviation industry, which has been hardened on the roller of its survival, wants to keep rolling, undertaking the venture that is associated with this or relying on what it has already learned. It is typical that those who most often speak well of the Iryda are those who have flown it, including people in the military. And they are considerably more enthusiastic than those who just think they know it, including people in the military. At the Institute of Aviation, there is the hope that in the near future the Command of the WLiOP [Air Force and Air Defense Forces] will pick it up unconditionally--equipment decisions uninfluenced by economic pressures. An increase in orders would reinforce a normal path toward coming up with a fully mature design for a Polish "battlefield" aircraft. On the basis of the experience gained with the Iryda and the K-15 and D-18 engines, it is possible (it appears) to consider it entirely realistic to make this transition. And, after all, this is not the only asset. All calculations indicate that every aircraft made by the Poles themselves will be 25-50 percent less expensive than comparable foreign ones. What Poland can do, however, is also indicated by the example of the Transportation Equipment Plant of the Polish Aviation Plant Swidnik. It is unfortunate that, in order to get even Polish decisionmakers to like its Sokol, it first had to gain recognition from overseas specialists. "It is important that Polish aviation design thinking, which was once well respected throughout the world and still is, not be lost even now, despite what some people may think. This also depends on MON [Ministry of National Defense], where a tremendous variety of views and ideas now prevails," Wlodzimierz Gnarowski told us. However, he unfortunately lacks a solid, economically realistic understanding of the military's equipment policy.
