He urged Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid to work to prevent a further deterioration in conditions in Yemen "and, hence, an unfavorable outcome." In a statement to AL-HAYAH 'Abd-al-Majid revealed that there is a "wide gap between the Yemeni president and his deputy." He said that "a considerable part of this dispute is personal. The other part is to do with the union and ways of implementing its mechanisms, especially the Armed Forces, which have not been unified. This is the main reason for the clashes that have occurred there." He said that the existence of huge quantities of arms in Yemen threatens conditions there. He expressed his hope that "the two 'Alis will apply reason and respond to Arab endeavors to safeguard Yemeni unity." 'Abd-al-Majid returned to Alexandria the evening of the day before yesterday after a two-day visit to Libya, during which he met with Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. He also held a series of meetings with a large number of Libyan officials. The meetings dealt with the mechanisms of Arab and Libyan moves to end the Lockerbie problem. 'Abd-al-Majid pointed out that the moves will be conducted through the Security Council member states in order to urge them to accept the League's proposal regarding trying the two suspects at the International Court of Justice in The Hague in accordance with the rules of Scottish law and by Scottish judges. He added that "solving this problem is not easy, but it is not impossible." He pointed out that the League's proposal "offers a legal way out for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 731." This "requires a new Security Council resolution on the acceptance of the Arab proposal by the parties to the Libyan-Western crisis." He pointed out that the League will intensify its moves during the Nonaligned Movement conference to be held in Cairo this month and the African summit meeting to be held in Tunis in June. This move will be parallel with the Libyan move. He said that "Scottish law contains three options with regard to the verdict: guilty, not guilty, or not proven -- which offers an opportunity for a fair trial for the defendants." 'Abd-al-Majid described the U.S. and British rejection of the League's proposal "as an unjustifiable position." He stressed the need to avoid stepping up the sanctions against Libya and to adhere to the Arab solution. AL-HAYAH has learned that 'Abd-al-Majid yesterday began his contacts with the foreign ministers of the Arab seven-man committee entrusted with discussing the Libyan-Western crisis. He briefed them on the results of his talks in Libya. 'Abd-al-Majid renewed his call for eliminating weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East. He urged that an Arab summit on water should be held to tackle the problem of its scarcity. He also renewed his call for setting up an Arab court of justice and amending the Arab League charter.
