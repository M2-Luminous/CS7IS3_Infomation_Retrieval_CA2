The Group also put forward over 20 suggestions regarding the Airport Corporation Bill and will hand them to the HKMAO for reference later. Sir Sze-yuen Chung, convener of the Airport Issue Study Team under the Economic Group, said today after the meeting: Regarding the financial arrangements for the new airport, Lu Ping had clarified several points for them and disclosed that the third proposal put forward by the British side was first handed to the Chinese side in April 1993. The proposal included the government pumping in HK$42.8 billion [Hong Kong dollars]. At the talks that followed, the British side agreed to add HK$2.5 billion more, increasing the total amount to HK$45.3 billion, with the amount of debt coming to approximately HK$40 billion. The Chinese side estimates that according to the financial proposal, the maximum debt can reach HK$45 billion. The three points Lu Ping clarified were: First, some people have misleadingly equated the airport-related franchises and contracts straddling 1997 with the other laws and regulations that do not conflict with the Basic Law and that can apply after 1997. However, laws and regulations are one thing and diplomacy is another. If the franchises and contracts straddling 1997 did not need the consent of the Chinese side, there would have been no need for the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] to include a paragraph mentioning that the British side must negotiate with the Chinese side over the franchises and contracts straddling 1997. This has nothing to do with the Basic Law and is a diplomatic issue. Second, the MOU provides that the government debt must not exceed HK$5 billion. Some people argue that the HK$5 billion is confined merely to the government and does not include that incurred by the Airport Corporation and the airport railway. But Lu Ping pointed out: In negotiating the MOU with Percy Cradock, the then British special envoy, several years ago, the British side did not say that the airport railway was to be constructed by the government or by the Airport Corporation. The two sides also understood that the Airport Corporation was part of the government. The HK$5-billion debt includes the debt for the airport railway and the Airport Corporation. It is only a matter of "filling the right pocket from the left." Third, regarding the 58 to 60 hectares of land along the airport railway, both the Chinese and British sides have agreed that the land should be approved by the Land Committee each year. The Chinese have also agreed to approve all land along the railway before 1997, and the size of the area to be approved depends on the need. Sze-yuen Chung maintained: The Airport Corporation derives its assets from the government and the debt incurred by the Airport Corporation is the debt of the government. If the debt of the Airport Corporation is not included in the HK$5-billion debt, the Hong Kong Government cannot sit and let the creditors take away the land if the Airport Corporation has a debt crisis in the future. Therefore, the debt of the Airport Corporation should also be included in the government's debt. Another group member, Vincent Hong-sui Lo, also held that although the MOU did not deal with the question of debt very clearly, by common sense, the Hong Kong Government cannot but assume responsibility if the future Airport Corporation and railway cannot repay the debt. He said that the two sides already have the MOU on the question of the Airport-related franchises and contracts, and therefore they should negotiate using this means. In addition, the Airport Issue Study Team also studied the Airport Corporation Bill and put forward more than 20 suggestions. The relevant report will be handed to the HKMAO for its reference after being passed by the Economic Group.
