Imam: "Plans To Divide Sindh?"] [Text] Mr. Altaf Hussain, leader of the MQM [Mohajir Quami Movement] , while addressing the convention of the Mohajir Rabita Council (Mehdood Group) directly from London by telephone, asked mohajir [immigrants from India at the time of partition] senior citizens why they established Pakistan. Did they establish it so that their mothers, sister, and daughters could be humiliated in public? Did they establish it so that the government officials would pull the beards of our elders [disrespect them] in public? He accused the Pakistani military and police personnel of committing atrocities on the mohajirs similar to those the Serbs were committing on Bosinian Muslims. He said in his speech that while the British controlled the sub-continent, they did not commit such atrocities on the Muslims as are being committed on mohajirs now. In his opinion, even Hindus during the Hindu-Muslim riots were not involved in such activities as the Pakistani military and police personnel are presently carrying out. The abominations and atrocious acts that Mr. Altaf Hussain recounted one after another in his speech are the forerunner of a major catastrophe that might occur. Perhaps he wants to make the mohajir youth rise against the armed forces. While spewing poison against the armed forces, he showed his skills in public speaking and uttered dirty obscenities against our military. The real chairman of the MQM, Afaq Ahmed, has also expressed his opinion at times and is trying to bring the attention of older refugees and others to the state government's actions against recent refugees to make them "Red Indians" of Pakistan. Various actions such as in Maler district, Liari Development Authority, Manghu Pir, and Qasimabad district were based purely on ethnic consideration in order to distribute the Mohajir vote bank in Sindh in such a way that they cannot win any seats. Professor Ghafur Ahmed, vice chairman of Jamaat-i Islami, said in a statement that a plan to divide Sindh on ethnic basis is being implemented, and the problem of law and order is being neglected. Even mohajir elders have started to openly express their opinion at various occasions that the mohajirs were being pushed against the wall. In this context, mohajir groups are planning strategies to protect their interests. The Sindh government is accused of having a prejudiced mentality behind all of its actions. The establishment of Maler district was declared a mischievous act of a prejudiced bureaucrat by Iqbal Yusuf, general secretary of the PPP [People's Party of Pakistan]. He said that he made this simple administrative act a disputed decision by establishing specific boundaries for this district. Abdullah Shah, chief minister of Sindh, had no part in deciding the boundaries of this district. Many actions such as the establishment of development agencies for Liari and Manghu Pir districts, moving the Karachi Medical and Dental College under the Sindh government's administration, distribution of medical college admission seats by districts, and transfer of some female doctors from Karachi to inner Sindh have provided some ethnic groups the opportunities to criticize the government. They are convinced that all these administrative actions were against the Mohajirs. The state chief minister, Parvez Ali Shah, and other government leaders have expressed the opinion that all these problems can be resolved by talks. Parvez Ali Shah had himself gone to Landhi Center to respond to the appeal for strike issued by MQM. He had talks with the leaders and had agreed on principle to establish a committee to continue these talks. However, we do not know which mysterious hand has stopped the progress of these talks and has put another block in the resolution of the city's problems by widening the chasm between these two groups. Parvez Ali Shah said that the MQM has shown a lack of patience and has closed the door to more negotiations by appealing for another strike. The leaders of the MQM, however, complain that the government has a policy of procrastination. Anyhow, this deadlock must be broken. Although the government has demonstrated goodwill by taking back the transfers of female doctors to inner Sindh and allocating medical college seats according to district residency, the responsibilities of the government are much more than this. It must take the initiative to end the ethnic prejudice. This government knows about it and Chief Minister Abdullah Shah has expressed this opinion while meeting with the Nawaz League, Jamaat-i Islami, and Jumiat-i Ulema Pakistan's [JUP Niazi group] National Assembly members in Karachi. The talks and actions of the PPP state leadership indicate that they also want to take some serious action to resolve these problems. However, it appears that mischief perpetuated by prejudiced individuals prevails. The agents of some forces within the bureaucracy are continuously trying to foil the efforts of the democratic government. If we look at the situation from the national and international perspective we would find that Pakistan is going through a very critical phase. The international forces want to play some new games using the new world order. The goals of these forces are not achieved in a democratic government, and martial law could be imposed on this country again. This was hinted at by Pir Pagara's mysterious prophesy. Therefore, it is important that all patriotic politicians agree on the issue of national security and suggest ways to resolve the problem in Sindh including Karachi. If they unite, the biased forces that hatch conspiracies will be unsuccessful. Despite all their political differences, all of them should keep in mind that confrontations will not help anyone. Even after two world wars, the opposing groups had to resolve their issue at the negotiation tables. Therefore, it would be appropriate and beneficial to take care of the Sindh issue by holding talks and not by fighting. Otherwise, people like Iltaf Hussain will present every government action in a negative light and will be successful in their goals, which perhaps is what the international imperialist powers want.
