As the German Bundesbank writes in its latest monthly report, the decline of the savings quota went hand in hand with a decline in the readiness to incur debts for consumption purposes. With 15 billion German marks [DM] the additional loans taken out in 1993 were one-third less than the previous year. The Bundesbank attributes this to the decline in income and the "more somber economic prospects in western Germany." Concerning the short-term overdraft of current accounts, it noticed that new debts "were only one-quarter of the sums of the previous year." At the end of 1993 private debts for consumption amounted to DM354 billion, which was about 17 percent of the available budget income. Given savings of DM222 billion, the savings quota, which is the share of savings in available income, went down by about one percentage point to approximately 13 percent. As the Bundesbank continues, net capital expenditures in fixed assets as well as the savings of the overall economy went down considerably in 1993 due to the economic crisis. After the deduction of write-offs, capital expenditures in fixed assets amounted to DM255 billion and thus were "almost one-fifth lower than the previous year," the Bundesbank writes. The financing gap in the economy was again closed by foreign investors. "The fact that this was possible despite generally declining interest rates is to be seen as an expression of trust of foreign creditors in the stability of the German mark," it is said. The main reason for the gap between supply and demand on the financial markets was "the borrowing of public budgets, which was high before and continued to increase in 1993." With DM155 billion it exceeded -- due to unification -- the sum of 1992 by almost half and thus amounted to about two-thirds of the overall private formation of monetary capital in Germany. While capital expenditures in fixed assets in western Germany declined by 30 percent to DM161 billion as a result of the recession, the development was reversed in the new laender: The formation of fixed assets rose to an almost equal extent to DM94 billion. Thus, the east German economy "made good progress in all fields" in reconstruction and restructuring, in the view of the Bundesbank. The profit situation of west German companies continued to deteriorate; in eastern Germany manufacturing companies were generally not able to return to profitability in 1993, the Bundesbank continues.
