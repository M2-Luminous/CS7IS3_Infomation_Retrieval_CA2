Berlusconi has said he wants to become prime minister following the landslide election victory Monday [28 March] of the rightwing alliance led by his Forza Italia party. But a key coalition partner, Umberto Bossi of the Northern League, has objected that Berlusconi's vast financial and media holdings made him unsuited to lead a government. Questioned during a television interview late Tuesday about Bossi's remarks, Berlusconi replied, "If I could find someone ready to buy, I could give up one of my television stations." Burlusconi's huge conglomerate, Fininvest, owns three national television networks as well as other media, telecommunications, property and distribution holdings. He also said he was willing to sell other unidentified "companies" in the Fininvest group. When he entered the political campaign last January, Berlusconi handed the presidency of Fininvest over to an associate. The right-wing coalition that won a majority in Italy's latest election comprises Berlusconi's Forza Italy party, the federalist Northern League and the neo-facist party National Alliance.
