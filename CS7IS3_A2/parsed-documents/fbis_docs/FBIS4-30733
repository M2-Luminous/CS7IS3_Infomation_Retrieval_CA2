[Goncz] That the country should have a stable and acceptable government. [Reporter] The people have expressed their view quite radically and -- in both rounds of the elections -- quite massively, in terms of turnout. [Goncz] The people deserve respect and honor for this. [Reporter] However, after this, should the parties not be expected to effect the transition in a similarly radical and speedily manner? Will you ask the party leaders tomorrow to do this? [Goncz] That goes without saying. The campaign, the election is over, now all parties must bear in mind the welfare of the country. [Reporter] When do you plan to convene the National Assembly? [Goncz] The National Assembly must be convened within 30 days of the announcement of the election result, but I sincerely hope that I will be able to convene it as soon as possible. I cannot give a date. [Reporter] Mr. President, when can peace and calm be expected to prevail in the country again? [Goncz] I do not feel that the country is in a state of war. I could hardly have conceived a more peaceful election. So, I believe that the state of calm will be reestablished soon -- the campaign is over. As to when the nation's peace of mind is to prevail, let me say that it will occur if the nation can draw a final account of all the phases of its history prior to 1918 and close that account. However, it might take a generation. [passage omitted]
