Particularly when it comes to major infrastructure projects, D66 sets great store by the protection of the environment and landscape. The Betuwe [train] line must still be built in a ditch and partly underground; the extension of Schiphol [Amsterdam airport] must take environmental factors more closely into account. [passage omitted] At the election conference, D66 formally designated Van Mierlo as its leading candidate Lower House elections. In the fight for the candidacy for the European Parliament, the incumbent MEP [member of the European parliament], J.W. Bertens, defeated his competitor, top European official L.J. Brinkhorst. Bertens gained 350 votes, Brinkhorst 300. On Saturday morning, the party summit announced how D66 would make the extra savings of 2.5 billion guilders, on top of the 10.5 billion called for in its draft program. The extra amount for restructuring will be found by cutting back on agricultural subsidies, civil servants salaries, road building, the WW [unemployment benefits act], family allowances, and the AWW [general widows and orphans act]. [passage omitted] Until 1998, D66 wants the provisional package of 13 billion guilders to [help] create approximately 100,000 jobs, including 6,000 in the area of education, 10,000 in the police force, and 18,000 in the health care sector. According to Van Mierlo, the CDA [the Christian Democratic Appeal] and VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] "are being tremendously gutsy" by increasing their savings much more rapidly for the sake of employment. The CDA intends to save a total of 17 billion, the VVD 20 billion. The PvdA [Labor Party] is proceeding on the basis of partial separation of wages and benefits, which will benefit people covered by the Pensions Act. However, D66 wants those pensioners with substantial supplementary pensions to pay a premium on their state pension, so that, in effect, they will contribute to the maintenance of this provision for their old age. Compared with the other major parties, D66 goes rather far with its increases in energy taxes (raising the price of natural gas for households) and with its reductions on labor taxes. On balance, D66 arrives at an average annual tax reduction of 450 guilders per taxpayer. In his speech, party chief Van Mierlo accused the cabinet of having damaged political credibility and alienating citizens. The examples he cited included the decision on Zestienhoven, and the letter from Minister Bukman on natural gas prices for truck farmers. Van Mierlo said: "The most serious thing, to my mind, is that the cabinet thinks it can get away with this. The prime minister described Bukman's letter as `superfluous and constitutionally erroneous.' This now applies to the entire cabinet."
