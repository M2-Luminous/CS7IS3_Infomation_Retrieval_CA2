An agreement signed by the Banking Association and the Attorney General's Office is designed to cut investigation time by more than half. This agreement will allow authorities to expose current and former corrupt officials who grew rich illegally by taking advantage of their positions. Until now, the release of banking information on customer transactions was banned. [Begin Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta recording] By way of this agreement, they will not only provide us with information in a timely manner, but they also will participate in its analysis to help us understand the flow of assets [evolucion patrimonial] and the origins of an individual's resources. [end recording] From now on, every bank, savings institution, and other financial institution must, as soon as possible, provide all information the Attorney General's Office needs to uncover illegal enrichment. Meanwhile, the financial institutions think this measure is nothing new and that the document is merely a commitment to expedite procedures already in place. [Begin Banking Association President Cesar Gonzalez Munoz recording] I must stress that this is nothing new. Bank secrecy is not being lifted, because this was done years ago in cases involving investigations by the Attorney General's Office. [end recording] In 1993 and so far in 1994, the Attorney General's Office has conducted more than 72 investigations into illegal enrichment cases involving some 5 billion pesos. The subjects of these inquiries are officials working in customs, mayoral and gubernatorial offices, aeronautics, police services, and the Army.
