FR940128-0-00020 FR940128-0-00007 RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD 20 CFR Part 266 RIN 3220&hyph;AA83 Representative Payment AGENCY: Railroad Retirement Board. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) revises part 266 in order to provide more detailed guidelines regarding the selection, payment, responsibilities, and monitoring of representative payees. The title of part 266 is also changed from ``Incompetence'' to ``Representative Payment'' which better describes the contents of part 266. These revisions are being made to improve the administration of the Board's representative payee program. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Secretary to the Board, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas W. Sadler, Assistant General Counsel, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611 (312) 751&hyph;4513; TDD (312) 751&hyph;4701. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (45 U.S.C. 231 et seq. ) provides a system of retirement and disability benefits for railroad employees, their spouses, children, and survivors who meet certain eligibility requirements under that Act. Section 12 of the Act (45 U.S.C. 231k) contains the same provisions as section 19 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, the predecessor of the present Act, regarding the competence of an annuitant and the Board's authority in cases where an annuitant is incompetent. Under these provisions, any claimant or annuitant is presumed to be competent until the Board receives written notice to the contrary. If a claimant or annuitant is incompetent, the Board may make payments to, or conduct transactions with, any legally appointed guardian on behalf of the claimant or annuitant. Furthermore, section 12(a) expressly authorizes the Board to make payments, or conduct transactions, directly with the claimant or annuitant, or with any other person on his or her behalf, even though he or she is an incompetent for whom a guardian is acting. The provisions of section 12 are applicable to benefits claimed or paid under any Act administered in whole or in part by the Board, including any claim for or payment of social security benefits administered by the Board pursuant to section 7(b)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act (45 U.S.C. 231f(b)(2)). There has been growing concern in the Congress to assure that surrogate decision making services, including representative-payee services, are provided in a uniform, high quality manner which maximizes the potential of every individual for self-reliance and independence. Since the Board is currently in the process of a comprehensive review, revision, and amendment of its regulations, part 266 is revised at this time to address concerns that adequate safeguards be provided where payment of an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act is made to a representative payee rather than directly to the annuitant. Thus, the revised part 266 expands, as well as revises, the present regulation. A brief summary of the disposition of the various section of the present part 266 under the proposed regulation is set forth below. The present §266.1 simply sets forth the statutory provisions of section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) (45 U.S.C. 231k), and because of this redundancy, is removed. The present §266.2 has been incorporated into §266.1(b) of the revised regulation. The new §266.1 sets forth an introduction, consisting of an explanation of representative payment and the law and policy used to determine whether to make representative payment. The present §266.3 has been incorporated into §266.3(a) of the revised regulation. The new §266.3 sets forth information which the Board will consider in determining whether to make representative payment. The present §266.4 has been redesignated as §266.12. New §266.4 sets forth what information the Board will use in selecting a representative payee. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the present §266.5 have been redesignated as §266.2, and the term ``beneficiary'' has been removed and the term ``annuitant'' has been added in its place throughout the new part 266. New §266.5 describes the order of preference the Board will generally use in selecting representative payees. The present §266.6 has been incorporated into the new §266.9(a). The new §266.9 sets forth general responsibilities of a representative payee. The present §§266.7, 266.9, 266.10, and 266.11 have been revised and incorporated into a single section, §266.10, which details how a representative payee is to use benefit payments. The present §266.8, ``Conservation and investment of benefit payments,'' has been revised and incorporated into the new §266.11. Sections §§266.6, 266.7, and 266.8 are new. Section 266.6 provides that a representative payee applicant must provide the Board with the information listed in §266.4 and will generally be required to undergo a face-to-face interview with a field representative of the Board. Section §266.7 provides that the representative payee make an accounting to the Board for the use of benefits he or she receives as payee and sets forth what information will satisfy the requirement of an accounting. Section §266.8 provides that an annuitant may challenge the appointment or selection of a representative payee. However, an individual who requests to be made a representative payee for an annuitant has no standing to challenge the Board's refusal to make the appointment.
