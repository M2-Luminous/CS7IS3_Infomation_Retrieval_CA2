It will mark an important event in relations between Vietnam and Singapore. Here is our overview: It is the first Vietnam visit by the existing Singaporean prime minister. It is in response to the Singaporean visit by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in 1993. The visit comes at a time when many changes are taking place in the region and the world. ASEAN countries in particular have achieved positive economic development and are promoting cooperation with Indochinese countries, including Vietnam. Singapore recently has emphasized relations with Vietnam as an important policy. Mr. Lee Kwan Yew, the prestigious former leader of Singapore, has twice visited Vietnam recently. He said Singapore is ready to share with Vietnam experiences in economic development and management. Indeed, Singapore is now Vietnam's biggest trade partner. Two-way trade last year reached $1.4 billion. Singapore ranks sixth among foreign investors in Vietnam, with 64 investment projects capitalized at more than $430 million. Up to now Vietnam and Singapore have signed five agreements in important fields, including investment encouragement and protection, a trade agreement, an airlines agreement, a maritime agreement, and an agreement on environmental control and conservation. The coming official visit to Vietnam by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong will help boost relations to a higher level. Vietnam highly values and respects its friendly and cooperative relations with Singapore and firmly believes that the Vietnam visit by Mr. Goh Chok Tong will be a success and an important mark in relations between Vietnam and Singapore.
