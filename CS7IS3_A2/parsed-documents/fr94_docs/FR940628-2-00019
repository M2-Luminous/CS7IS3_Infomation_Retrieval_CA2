FR940628-2-00019 FR940628-2-00012 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Seattle Regional Support Office; Notice of Solicitation; Bioenergy Technologies AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Intent to Solicit. SUMMARY: The U.S. DOE established regional biomass program to promote the development of effective uses of bioenergy for energy. The legislative authority directs U.S. DOE to ``carry out activities related to technology transfer, industry support, resource assessment, and matching local resources to conversion technologies.'' The US DOE is seeking projects that demonstrate bioenergy technologies which produce energy saving through displacement of non-renewable resources, or that produce energy through the direct combustion of renewable resources. Projects will also be evaluated on their ability to minimize environmental impacts and their ability to improve the economic viability of a specific bioenergy industry or technology. Projects shall be located in the region consisting of the states Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Montana and Idaho. All project sponsors will be required to provide a minimum cost sharing of 1:1. Acceptable demonstration technologies will use one or more of the following biomass fuels: Landfill debris and landfill gas; logging residues; agricultural crops and wastes; biomass farming; urban, forest, and forest products wood wastes; municipal solid waste; animal wastes; and food processing wastes. Bioenergy projects can produce electricity, mechanical power, space heat, and industrial process heat. The U.S. DOE plans to award up to 5 grants of approximately $100,000 for each project. The U.S. DOE allocation for this program in FY 1994/95 is $450,000. DATES: A solicitation will be available on or about July 5, 1994. Request for copies of the solicitation must be in writing to: U.S. Department of Energy, Seattle Support Office, Attn: Lisa Barnett, 800 Fifth Avenue, Suite 3950, Seattle, Washington, 98104. Proposals are due on August 18, 1994. ADDRESSES AND FURTHER INFORMATION: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Seattle Support Office, Seattle, WA 98104, Contact Jeff James, (206) 553&hyph;2079. Issued in Golden, Colorado, on June 20, 1994. John W. Meeker, Chief, Procurement Team, GO. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15655 Filed 6&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
