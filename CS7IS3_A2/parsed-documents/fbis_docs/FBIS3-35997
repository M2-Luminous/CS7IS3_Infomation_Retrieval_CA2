The contract materialized as a result of an international contest for nuclear waste disposal projects that the production association had to organize in view of the relevant governmental bodies' obvious indifference, inaction, and incompetence. The contest reportedly drew participants and tenders from Germany, Britain, France, Canada, the United States, Spain, and [word indistinct]. The Zaporizhye nuclear power plant management chose the project drafted by the Duke engineering and service affiliates of the Duke Power company (?as specially) following the Ukrainian nuclear power industry's technological [word indistinct] and requirements. The project reportedly provides for storing used nuclear fuel cases in armored concrete cylinders. Despite their relative simplicity and cheapness, they are said to be both durable and reliable for storing fissionable materials, nuclear safety experts maintain. Currently, ecological and feasibility studies are under way in these sites. If everything goes well, the first storage facility is expected to be completed by late 1995. Similar storage facilities are being contemplated for construction at other Ukrainian nuclear power plants.
