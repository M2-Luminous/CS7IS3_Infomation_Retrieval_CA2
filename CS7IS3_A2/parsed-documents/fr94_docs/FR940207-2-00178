FR940207-2-00178 FR940207-2-00080 2. The trustees of the Fund, including a majority of the independent trustees, will approve the system of the offering of the various classes of shares. The minutes of the meetings of the trustees regarding deliberations of the trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the multi-class arrangement for any Series will reflect in detail the reasons for the trustees' determinations that the system is in the best interests of that Series and its shareholders. 3. On an ongoing basis, the trustees of the Fund, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the classes of outstanding shares. The trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and Distributor of the Fund will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and Distributor at its own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. 4. The trustees of the Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In such statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 5. Dividends paid with respect to each class of shares of a Series, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that distribution plan fees or Shareholder Services Plan fees and Class Expenses (listed in condition 1) applicable to a class will be borne exclusively by that class. 6. Any Shareholder Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to the applicants, a copy of which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. The Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor, on an ongoing basis, the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and based on that review, will render at least annually a report to the Fund that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Fund (which the Fund agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request to the Fund for such work papers by a senior member of the SEC's Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes of shares. This representation has been concurred with the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 7 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert. 9. The prospectus of the Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another.
