The circular touched on four aspects of enterprises listed in stock exchanges abroad, that is, the limits of and procedure for assessing state-owned land assets, how to handle state-owned land assets, the method and proportion of converting land-use rights into stocks, and registration of changes in land-use rights. According to the stipulations, the work of assessing land assets of all stock-experimenting enterprises established within the territory and authorized to be listed in stock exchanges abroad must be solely organized and conducted by the State Land Administration Bureau. As far as the procedure of assessment is concerned, enterprises or designated stock-holding units of state-owned land assets must first apply for assessment and submit relevant registration certificates on land-use rights use to the authorities, and then enterprises must select one of the assessment organizations recommended by the State Land Administration Bureau to assess their land assets and results of the assessment must be reported to the State Land Administration Bureau for confirmation. The circular provided for how to handle state-owned assets of stock-experimenting enterprises listed in stock exchanges abroad: First, land-use rughts are priced and converted into stocks. Land- use rights obtained by enterprises through purchase are priced and converted into stocks, whereas land assets are converted into legal- person stocks. Second, the State leases land-use rights to stock enterprises and receives appropriate rents. After obtaining land- use rights through purchase, enterprises can lease land-use rights to stock companies. The circular also explicitly provided for the amount and proportion of equity capital converted from the rights of using state-owned land. The amount should not be less than the total of examined and verified land assets divided by multiples of stock premiums, and the proportion should not be less than the proportion of total land assets to total state-owned assets of stock enterprises. The circular also stipulated that reorganized enterprises listed in stock exchanges abroad can only apply to people's government departments responsible for land administration at and above the county level for changes in registration after getting official written replies from the State Land Administration on confirming the conversion of land assets into stocks.
