ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission has adopted a Report and Order to incorporate the liability method of accounting for income taxes into the Uniform System of Accounts for Telecommunications Companies.

EFFECTIVE DATE: August 29, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thaddeus Machcinski, Common Carrier Bureau, Accounting and Audits Division, 202&hyph;634&hyph;1861. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a synopsis of the Commission's Report and Order in CC Docket No. 89&hyph;360, adopted January 31, 1994 and released February 8, 1994. The complete text of this Report and Order is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC, and may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., at (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. Synopsis of Report and Order 1. This Report and Order amends part 32 to incorporate the new accounting procedures for income taxes prescribed in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS&hyph;109) and it also establishes new accounts to properly implement those procedures. 2. This Report and Order adds three new accounts to the Uniform System of Accounts to incorporate the requirements of SFAS&hyph;109 into part 32. The new accounts are Account 1437, Deferred Tax Regulatory Asset; Account 4341, Net Deferred Tax Liability Adjustments; and Account 4361, Deferred Tax Regulatory Liability. These new accounts will reflect the adjustments to existing carrier deferred tax balances that are necessary as a result of adopting SFAS&hyph;109. 3. The type of SFAS&hyph;109 adjustments that will be shown in the above accounts relate to changes in tax rates, recording tax liabilities for items that were previously accounted for under the flow through method, and recording taxes on items that were formerly considered permanent differences by the accounting profession. 4. The Report and Order will be effective six months after it is published in the Federal Register . However, the Report and Order permits carriers to adopt SFAS&hyph;109 for federal accounting purposes on January 1, 1993 if the carriers so desire. 5. Finally, the new accounts that are established in the Report and Order will be excluded from interstate rate base and revenue requirement determinations. This insures that the adoption of SFAS&hyph;109 for federal accounting purposes will not increase or decrease the interstate revenue requirement. Rule Changes 6. Accordingly, it is ordered that, Pursuant to sections 1, 4(i), 201&hyph;205, 218, 220, and 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 151, 154(i)201&hyph;205, 218, 220, 403, part 32 is amended as set forth below. 7.
