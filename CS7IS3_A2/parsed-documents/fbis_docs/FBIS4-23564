Speaking at a late night press conference attended by President Nelson Mandela, Namibian head of state Sam Nujoma and President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, he said the task force would try to interact with those who were disturbing democracy in the mountain kingdom. It would also warn them that if they persisted in their actions, the Frontline States would "go further than just the political act of sending a task force". Military action was "not excluded but for now it has not been decided on". Mr Mandela said the Frontline States had no desire to engage in any action offensive to the international and regional organisations whose opinions it valued. "We must understand this as an attempt to preserve democracy within the parameters of consultation with all parties that are involved. We are committed to methods of peaceful persuasion in addressing problems generally and in particular with regard to Lesotho." President Mugabe said the task force had already met and would leave as soon as its members had "put their thoughts together" under the terms of reference given to them. They would report back as soon as possible. Whatever action was finally taken would be on a joint basis and would not be just the action of an individual Frontline country. President Mugabe said he and his Frontline colleagues on Wednesday discussed a report compiled by a task force appointed earlier this year on the situation in Lesotho and felt "very, very disturbed". The situation there was deteriorating by the day and the government was unable to perform its functions freely because of interference by elements in both the army and the police force. "In view of that worsening situation, we have decided that we will certainly set up another task force which will go back to Lesotho and try to knock some sense into those elements of the forces, whether it is police or army who are interfering with the smooth running of governmental activity and actually causing the lawlessness currently taking place in that country." He regarded this as "stern action". The task force would "enjoin them, urge them, encourage them and actually warn them that if they persist in their actions, we will go further than just the political act of sending a task force. "We would set a very dangerous precedent if, in a region where democracy is the order of the day, and where it is not the order of the day, is being established...we allowed its reversal by forces which are bent on lawlessness, and disorder." President Mugabe said the first task force which represented only Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa, had made recommendations to Lesotho, including restructuring of the army to incorporate guerrillas from the Lesotho Liberation Army. However, sections of the army had prevented the government from implementing the reforms. Representatives of Botswana, Lesotho and Zambia were also present at the press conference.
