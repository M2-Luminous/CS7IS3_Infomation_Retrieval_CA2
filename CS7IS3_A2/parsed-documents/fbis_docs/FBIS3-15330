The director of the 2nd department for Europe at the ministry, Yuriy Fokin, delivered to Laast an oral protest on statements by Estonian officials, and particularly, a speech by Estonian President Lennart Meri in Hamburg on Feb. 25, a representative of the Russian Foreign ministry said in a briefing today. Moscow characterized as "anti-Russian" Meri's calls on the West not to trust Russia who, the Estonian leader said, is continuing on the path of imperialistic policy, as well as Meri's negative assessment of the activity of Russian peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia. The Russian Foreign Ministry says that Meri's statement about the role of the Russian peacekeeping units, in particular, are aimed against stabilization in the region. "The biased character of the speech by Lennart Meri on the whole lends proof to the opinion that the Estonian leadership is using every opportunity to add rigidity to its position in the relations with Russia," the Foreign Ministry representative said. The Russian Foreign Ministry says that such statements by the Estonian head of state, made in a third country, "exceed the limits of generally acknowledged international norms." The Russian Foreign Ministry in the message delivered to the Estonian diplomat "expressed hope that Tallinn would find strength to stop shifting toward confrontation with Moscow." The Russian Foreign Ministry says that responsibility for the possible effects of such drive wholly lies with the Estonian side.
