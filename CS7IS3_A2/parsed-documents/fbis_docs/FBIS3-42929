Andrey Kozyrev's statement last week at a meeting with ambassadors of Russia in states of the CIS and the Baltic evoked a stormy reaction abroad and remains at the center of attention as the "latest word" in the changing Russian foreign policy. This, literally, is what Kozyrev said: "The CIS countries and the Baltic are the area in which Russia's main vital interests are concentrated. The main threats to these interests come from there.... In my view, the framing of the question of the total departure and removal of any military presence of Russia in the states of the near abroad is just as extreme, if not extremist, an approach as the idea of the dispatch of tanks to all the republics and the establishment of some imperial order there...." Despite the subsequent explanations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the refutations of Kozyrev himself, these words were seen everywhere as Russia's intention to maintain the Russian military presence in the Baltic republics and as a consequence of the increased national-patriotic trends in Moscow's policy. It would have been hard to choose a less suitable time for such words. They were heard several days after the departure from Moscow of U.S. President Bill Clinton and a week after the NATO Council session in Brussels, which had adopted the decision to take account of Russian concern at the prospect of an expansion of NATO and to postpone until some time in the future the question of the admittance to the bloc of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. These countries, like Russia also, were offered partnership with NATO in the military-political sphere. If Kozyrev has seen this turn of events and the decisive support which Clinton expressed for Yeltsin in Moscow as carte-blanche for toughening Russian policy in respect to the near abroad, the Baltic countries primarily, this is a flagrant miscalculation. There is no unity on the attitude toward Russia either in NATO or even within the Clinton administration itself. The delicate balance in favor of Russia which has been created in the Western countries could be disturbed at any moment. Particularly now, when the signals emanating from Moscow are being scrutinized in the latter literally with a magnifying glass in an attempt to discern in them possible influence on Russian foreign policy on the part of conservatives and nationalists. Assertions are being heard increasingly loudly in the West that a refusal to admit to NATO Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary under pressure from Moscow is tantamount to appeasement of a potential aggressor, that is, Russia, and that this bodes ill. Had the supporters of such an approach, Warsaw particularly, required new arguments in support of the argument concerning a revival of the threat on the part of Russia, Kozyrev has given them such. Kozyrev has said repeatedly that he is pursuing the president's foreign policy: the president formulates it, the Foreign Ministry merely implements it. It may be assumed, therefore, that Kozyrev was complying with a directive of Yeltsin himself, whose tone in respect to the near abroad, Ukraine particularly, has become noticeably tougher as of late. Nor can it be ruled out that the president was extremely incensed by the recent arrest in Latvia of the head of the group of Russian forces stationed there. Such anger is entirely justified. But should we be paying Riga back in the same coin, playing into the hands of the Lettish nationalists? Especially since Riga apologized profusely to Moscow in this connection. But instead of turning the situation--a potentially winning one for us--to good account, the leader of the Foreign Ministry decided to hew away with an ax, and ax work in politics, as in other spheres also, for that matter, does not produce good results. A different scenario is, for that matter, more likely. Availing himself of his sufficient freedom in determination of our foreign policy positions, Kozyrev deemed it necessary to take account of the new winds that have as of late been blowing over Russia and blowing out of the government some of its members. He decided, it would seem, to forestall events in order to kill three birds with one stone: to create for himself the image of a tougher politician, to shore up thereby his position in the Chernomyrdin cabinet, and to display personal zeal to the president. Kozyrev "developed," as it were, Yeltsin's New Year's statement of Russia's intent to defend more decisively the rights of its compatriots in the near abroad (it elicited in the West a heightened and somewhat unhealthy interest, incidentally), but was extremely unsuccessful in so doing. If the president, wishing to rectify a manifest failing in his policy, decided to say "A," this does not mean that the minister has immediately to blurt out all the other letters of the alphabet. Kozyrev has for some time now given the impression that he wants to neutralize, as it were, the charges of constant concessions to the West and of insufficiently active defense of Russia's national interests by greater toughness in respect to the countries of the near abroad. This calculation is, however, very dangerous. First, because a desire to touch up his hard-to-correct "image" of Westerner and "dove" could prompt the minister to a severity in positions and statements which harms--is already harming--Russia's interests. Kozyrev's own efforts, for example, to secure for Russia a mandate of the United Nations and the CSCE for peacekeeping operations in the CIS. Second, because Kozyrev has already created an entirely different image of Russian diplomacy in the West, and so abrupt a change therein could evoke only wariness. People are already puzzled there: Yesterday Kozyrev was saying one thing, today, another, is Russia really, consequently, returning to an imperial policy? Finally, all this is creating the impression of attempts to wrest the initiative from Zhirinovskiy. But only defeat could await Kozyrev in such a contest. The sole solution here is to counterpose to Zhirinovskiy's aggressive propaganda rhetoric a profoundly considered policy of defense of our interests which produces real results. In a word, Russia's policy in respect to the near abroad undoubtedly does need adjusting, but Kozyrev is hardly the most suitable figure for this. And, finally, the hint heard in his recent television appearances at Zhirinovskiy's "legal" origins--what has he got to do with the Russian people and the defense of their rights?--can evoke nothing but consternation. Vladimir Volfovich will hardly be outdone in the use of such methods. But one's own reputation could be damaged conclusively.
