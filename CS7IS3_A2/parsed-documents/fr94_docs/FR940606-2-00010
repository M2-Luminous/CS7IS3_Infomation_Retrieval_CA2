FR940606-2-00010 FR940606-2-00009 Clearance of Form-EIA&hyph;858, ``Uranium Industry Annual Survey'' AGENCY: Energy Information Administration, DOE. ACTION: Notice of proposed changes to form. SUMMARY: Under its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and reporting burden for respondents (as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Energy Information Administration (EIA) conducts a consultation program to provide the general public and other Federal agencies an opportunity to comment on its continuing and newly proposed survey forms. This program helps to assure that: (a) Data can be reported by respondents in the requested format; (b) burden of reporting is minimized; (c) survey forms are clearly understood; and (d) the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be accurately assessed. Currently, EIA is soliciting comments concerning proposed changes to Form EIA&hyph;858, ``Uranium Industry Annual Survey,'' for the collection of 1994 data. DATES: Written comments must be submitted July 6, 1994. If you anticipate that you will be submitting comments but find it difficult to do so within the period of time allowed by this notice, you should, as soon as possible, advise the EIA contact listed below of your intention to provide comments. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Luther Smith, Energy Information Administration, EI&hyph;522; U.S. Department of Energy; Washington, DC 20585; Phone (202) 254&hyph;5565. Requests for additional information or copies of the form and instructions should be directed to Luther Smith. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background II. Current Actions III. Request for Comments I. Background In order to fulfill its responsibilities under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93&hyph;275) and the Department of Energy (DOE) Organization Act (Public Law 95&hyph;91), the Energy Information Administration is conducting a comprehensive energy data and information program to collect, evaluate, assemble, and analyze periodic data and information on the domestic uranium industry and economic and statistical information related to the adequacy of domestic uranium resources and production capability to meet the Nation's near- and longer-term future needs. The information collected is used by the Energy Information Administration to fulfill its monitoring and data dissemination functions as mandated by the Congress. Data collected on these forms provide a comprehensive statistical characterization of the domestic uranium industry in these areas: (a) Uranium exploration, mining, reserves, uranium concentrate production, and employment related to those activities, and (b) uranium marketing activities, inventory status, imports and exports, enrichment feed deliveries, purchases of enrichment services, and use of unirradiated uranium in new fuel assemblies. Published data from these surveys are used by the Congress, Federal and State agencies, the uranium and electric-utility industries, and the general public. National and State level data are published in the EIA reports ``World Nuclear Capacity and Fuel Cycle Requirements,'' ``Uranium Purchases Report,'' ``Uranium Industry Annual,'' and the ``Annual Energy Review.'' II. Current Actions Summary of Changes In the December 7, 1993, Federal Register notice (58 FR 64399), the EIA proposed that 1994 data on uranium contracts (Item 1, Schedule B, annual Form EIA&hyph;858) would be collected on a new quarterly survey form, Schedule M. Under this proposal also, the collection of 1994 data under Schedule A and under Items 2&hyph;7 of Schedule B, Form EIA&hyph;858, would have been done annually. After review of comments received in response to the Federal Register notice, the EIA has decided not to implement the proposed new Schedule M for 1994. Instead, the technical suggestions for improving the Form EIA&hyph;858 survey provided in the comments will be used, where applicable, to revise the annual Schedule B as described below. For the EIA&hyph;858 survey for 1994, the EIA also has dropped the proposed new criteria that would have expanded the number of data elements that would be releasable. The ``Provisions for Confidentiality'' declaration on the 1994 Form EIA&hyph;858 will remain the same as it was on the 1993 Form EIA&hyph;858. In the December 7, 1993, Federal Register notice, the EIA also proposed to use a one-page survey, Form EIA&hyph;851, to collect quarterly data on uranium concentrate production for 1994. The EIA has decided not to pursue at this time implementation of a formal survey form for the EIA&hyph;851 collection. Instead, the current mode of monthly reporting of uranium concentrate production data through collection of internal company production reports and phone surveys will be continued. The production data collected under the EIA&hyph;851 survey will continue to be treated as confidential. Detailed Description of Changes Form EIA&hyph;858: On the 1994 Form EIA&hyph;858, Schedule B data items have been reordered (compared with the 1993 Form EIA&hyph;858) as described in the following table:
