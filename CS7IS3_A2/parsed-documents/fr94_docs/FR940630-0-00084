FR940630-0-00084 FR940630-0-00035 Questions have been raised by some States as to how the Agency intended to regulate small-size water systems (those serving 3,300 or fewer people) and medium-size water systems (those serving between 3,301 and 50,000 people) that meet the lead and copper action levels during the first two monitoring periods (and therefore are deemed to have optimized corrosion control), but that exceed one of the action levels in a subsequent monitoring period. As discussed below, it was clearly the Agency's intent in promulgating this rule to require these systems (where exceedance of one of the action levels indicates that they may not have optimized corrosion control) to implement the rules' corrosion control treatment requirements as long as they exceed the action level. Section 141.81(b)(1) specifies that small- and medium-size water systems are deemed to have optimized corrosion control once they meet both the lead and copper action levels for two consecutive six-month monitoring periods conducted in accordance with §141.86. Sections 141.81(a)(2) and 141.81(c) specify that such systems may forego (or cease) completion of the corrosion control treatment steps specified in §141.81(e). This language is consistent with EPA's intent, as discussed in the preamble to the final rule (56 FR 26490&hyph;26497), that small- and medium-size water systems not be required to conduct corrosion control studies and install additional treatment as long as they meet both the lead and copper action levels because the action levels reflect optimal corrosion control treatment for these systems. Section 141.81(e)(1) requires that small- and medium-size systems conduct tap sampling for lead and copper until the system becomes eligible for reduced monitoring (because it has met the action levels during the requisite number of monitoring periods) or the system exceeds the action level. If such a system exceeds the action level, it is then required to begin the corrosion control treatment steps within a certain period of time of the exceedance. Thus, under the current rule, a system that meets the action levels during the first two monitoring periods (and any number of subsequent monitoring periods) is triggered into the corrosion control treatment requirements if it at any time exceeds the lead or copper action level. Notwithstanding this provision, some States have apparently been confused by the language in §141.81(c) of the rule, which addresses small and medium-size systems that initially exceed one of the action levels, but subsequently reduce their levels to below the action levels and are therefore deemed to have optimized corrosion control. With regard to these systems, the second sentence of §141.81(c) states: ``If any such water system thereafter exceeds the lead or copper action level during any monitoring period, the system (or the State, as the case may be) shall recommence completion of the applicable treatment steps, beginning with the first treatment step which was not previously completed in its entirety. *␣*␣*'' Some parties have apparently questioned whether the phrase ``any such water system'' (emphasis added) could be read to exclude small- and medium-size water systems meeting §141.81(b)(1) criteria during the initial two six-month monitoring periods from having to begin implementing the corrosion control treatment steps. As evident from the language in §141.81(e) of the rule, this was not EPA's intent. To clarify this point, EPA has added a sentence at the end of §141.81(c) stating: ``The requirement for any small- or medium-size system to implement corrosion control treatment steps in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section (including systems deemed to have optimized corrosion control under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) is triggered whenever any small- or medium-size system exceeds the lead or copper action level.'' Section 141.87 contains the monitoring requirements for water quality parameters. The introductory text in the section states that, ``[a]ll large water systems and all small and medium-size water systems that exceed the lead or copper action level shall monitor water quality parameters in addition to lead and copper in accordance with this section.'' As written, this sentence could be read to mean that only large water systems exceeding the lead or copper action level must collect water quality parameter samples. This interpretation is not consistent with the intent of the final regulation. EPA's intent is clear in the preamble of the final rule (56 FR 26526 bottom of middle column) which contains the same sentence, with a comma after the phrase ``all large systems''. EPA's intent is to require all large water systems to install optimal corrosion control treatment regardless of lead and copper tap water levels. Because the lead and copper action levels are not surrogate measures of optimal corrosion control treatment for large water systems, these systems must collect water quality parameter samples to determine if optimal treatment has been installed, and to establish baseline parameters for continued compliance. The State must evaluate the water quality data submitted by each water system and establish enforceable parameters that the system must maintain to remain in compliance with the rule. EPA is correcting the regulatory language by adding a comma after the phrase, ``all large systems'' so that it is clear that all large systems must conduct water quality parameter monitoring, regardless of whether they exceed the lead or copper action level.
