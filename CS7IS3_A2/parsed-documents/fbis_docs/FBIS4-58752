This conference considers Egypt's Copts a religious minority. How do you feel about that? [Shanudah] We are Egyptians and a part of the Egyptian people. We are not a minority in Egypt. We do not like to consider ourselves a minority and do not like others to call us a minority. The terms minority and majority indicate segregation and discrimination. This does not befit the sons of a single homeland, especially if this homeland is beloved Egypt. If the reason for the use of the terms minority and majority is the difference in religion, the tolerance of religion--any religion--does not permit this discrimination. We are all the descendants of one father, Adam, and one mother, Eve. If the Copts have some problems or demands, these matters can be solved in a spirit of amity in the same homeland without the use of the terms minority and majority. These matters can be solved without psychological sensitivities. The attempts, even if they are well meaning, by some to defend the Copts does not necessarily require them to call us a minority. [Al-Sa'id] Can it be said that under the new world order the attempts to stir up religions chauvinism and deepen the struggle among the parties have increased? Israel exploited this situation when it warned against the so-called Islamic fundamentalism in an attempt to win the sympathy of the West. [Shanudah] I believe that states are motivated by interests and not religion. The proof is that during World War II the allies joined with communist Russia against Hitler. It was a temporary alliance. Each state is motivated by its interests and not by religion. If religion enters into the picture, it is marginal, not basic, and its use is temporary. For example, the United States now supports the Jews although it differs in religion with Israel. The whole issue is one of interests. [Al-Sa'id] But Israel has always concentrated on using religion and on appearing as a religious state. [Shanudah] In Israel proper religion is part of the state's mechanism. Israel is a state with a Jewish religious character. Jews did not cooperate with non-Jews in old times. The religious aspect is a basic one in Israel. Israel has both political and religious aims. [Al-Sa'id] This illustrates Israel's racism and double standards in differentiating between its treatment of the Jewish settlers and the Palestinians. [Shanudah] Naturally, Israel combines religion with racism. Israel's policy contains both elements. The Israelis call themselves "God's people." This expression is religious and has religious connotations. For example, the desire to rebuild the temple is a religious desire. In Israel both racism and religion are permanent fixtures. However, this does not apply to other states. [passage omitted] [Al-Sa'id] What is your opinion of U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement on Jerusalem as the united capital of Israel and that it is not part of the occupied Arab territories? [Shanudah] Israel views Jerusalem as an essential issue. The United States should not have gone to this extent to appease Israel. It should not have made such a statement. The U.S. Administration retracted the statement later. It perhaps realized that it should not have gone this far, that it has hurt all the Arab countries, and that it has disregarded the feelings of the Muslims all over the world. For this reason, Clinton corrected the mistake and said that the issue of Jerusalem will be discussed in the political dialogue. [passage omitted] [Al-Sa'id] While Israel has been trying to deepen Jewish religious chauvinism, it has tried to accuse the neighboring countries of extremism and terrorism. Isn't this considered a kind of ideological conflict? [Shanudah] Israel is the last country in the world that can accuse others of extremism and terrorism because the description applies to it. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident in Hebron is the best proof. Wasn't this an ugly terrorist operation? [passage omitted] Israel has no right to criticize or accuse others while it is involved in terrorism. [Al-Sa'id] Regarding the existence of religious parties in Israel, there are some who think that the issue of whether we need religious parties or not should be raised in the national dialogue that is expected to be held this month. Some also think that a religious party, after it is established, cannot pull the carpet from under the religious extremists. [Shanudah] Who said that the Israeli Government can coexist with the religious parties? [Al-Sa'id] The parties constitute a pressuring factor and the government is afraid of them and seeks to win their support. [Shanudah] The fact that the government seeks to win the support of the religious parties to ensure a majority in parliament does not mean that it welcomes them. On the contrary, if there were no religious parties the votes would go to the ruling party. We must not find controversial things in other states to emulate them. The existence of one religious party in Egypt will open the door to the formation of many other religious parties because there is no single religious ideology. As Christians we do not approve of this. There is no single religious ideology among the Muslims, and this could create conflicts. [Al-Sa'id] This means that there is no reason to raise the issue of religious parties? [Shanudah] In my opinion, if the Islamic trend is allowed to rule, more than one party will surface and these parties will be fighting each other. As it is now, there is a conflict among the various religious groups and each one labels the other atheist. [Al-Sa'id] What about the Christians? [Shanudah] We do not accept the establishment of religious parties. We do not accept the existence of a Christian religious party. It is not in our interest or in the interest of the state. [passage omitted] [Al-Sa'id] How can terrorism and violence be stopped? Shall a terrorist be regarded as a sick person who must be treated and reformed or a renegade who must be fought and eliminated? [Shanudah] First of all, wide-scale enlightenment is an important matter. By enlightenment we mean answering the ideas used by terrorists to convince others to join them. Moderate thought and extremist thought must not run in two parallel lines that never meet. We must study their ideas and answer them. [passage omitted] [Al-Sa'id] Can dialogue be held with blood-thirsty terrorists? [Shanudah] If it is not possible to hold a dialogue with them, then we must hold dialogue with their ideas. We might not be able to hold a dialogue with a certain person because he might be in jail or in hiding. However, we can hold a dialogue with his ideas. This is one point. Another point is that we must eliminate those who support terrorism using their ideas, arms, and training. Some people encourage terrorism with their ideas, others with arms, and others by providing training. We must confront these three kinds of people who mostly come from abroad. [passage omitted] [Al-Sa'id] Can we depend on the security services alone? [Shanudah] The security aspect alone is not enough. Emphasis on it may prolong the battle. An ideological and precautionary approach may preclude new conflicts between the security services and the terrorists. [Al-Sa'id] Is it difficult for someone to argue with extremist thought and closed mentalities that stick to their ideas? [Shanudah] It is not a difficult process. It is possible to get rid of old ideas by discussing new ones. It is possible for a person to believe in ideas, including religious ideas, different from his own ideas by discussing them with others. There are those who believe in certain ideas and then abandon them as a result of religious discussions. I discuss ideas and do not refer to persons. [passage omitted] [Al-Sa'id] In your opinion, what has caused this attack on religion? Who has encouraged attacks on religion at this particular time? [Shanudah] Freedom of thought has been exploited beyond its boundaries. We are in an age in which freedom can be used incorrectly to attack old religious values. [passage omitted] [Al-Sa'id] Can the phenomenon of attacks on religion be a result of negligence by religious scholars? [Shanudah] The phenomenon of attacks on religion is part of a general atmosphere. Just as there are attacks on religion, there are also attacks on law, politicians, family, and principles and ideals.
