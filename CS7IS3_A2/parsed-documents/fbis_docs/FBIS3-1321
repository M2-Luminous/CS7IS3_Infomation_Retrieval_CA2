In reaction to that letter, the UTD and CAR chairmen each accompanied by one aide met the same day at 1530 to put finishing touches to their discussions on the choice of a prime minister. The two parties agreed that the CAR should propose one of its activists to take up the prime ministerial post. Following this agreement the CAR proposed a name that was then accepted by the UTD. The two political parties are now waiting for the head of state's invitation to a meeting in order to convey the name to him. [end recording]
