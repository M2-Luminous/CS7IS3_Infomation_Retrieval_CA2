FR941110-0-00289 FR941110-0-00018 In 1826, Louis Charles Adelbert von Chamisso and D.F.L. Schlectendal described the species Plantago princeps (ale) (Rock 1920a). In 1829, P. queleniana was described by Gaudichaud. An additional species, P. fauriei, was described by H. Leveille (1911) from a specimen collected by Abbe Urbain Jean Faurie from Hanapepe Falls on Kauai. Several varieties and forms of P. princeps have also been described. The currently accepted classification places P. queleniana and P. fauriei in synonymy with P. princeps and recognizes only four varieties: anomala, laxifolia, longibracteata, and princeps (Gaudichaud 1829, Gray 1862, Hillebrand 1888, Mann 1867, Rock 1920a, Wagner et al. 1990, Wawra 1874). Plantago princeps, a member of the plantain family (Plantaginaceae), is a small shrub or robust perennial herb. Its erect or ascending stems are hollow, about 2 to 250 cm (1 to 100 in) long, and often branched with young internodes that are more or less woolly with reddish brown hairs. The oblong to elliptic, thick, leathery leaves are between 6 and 30 cm (2.4 and 12 in) long and up to 5 cm (2 in) wide and are tufted near the ends of stems. The leaves have smooth or minutely toothed margins, a pointed tip, and primary veins that converge at the base of the leaves. Numerous stalkless flowers are densely arranged in a cluster 11 to 28 cm (4.3 to 11 in) long with each cluster on a stalk 10 to 50 cm (4 to 20 in) long. Each flower spreads at an angle of nearly 90 degrees to the axis of the stalk or grows upright. The sepals are somewhat distinct and elliptic in shape. The fruits are capsules that contain three or four tiny black seeds; the surface of the seeds is apparently covered with a sticky membrane. This species differs from other native members of the genus in Hawaii by its large branched stems, flowers at nearly right angles to the axis of the flower cluster, and fruits that break open at a point two-thirds from the base. The four varieties ( anomala, laxiflora, longibracteata, and princeps ) are distinguished by the branching and pubescence of the stems; the size, pubescence, and venation of the leaves; the density of the inflorescence; and the orientation of the flowers (Wagner et al. 1990). The four varieties of Plantago princeps were historically found on five islands, and now occur on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, and Maui. A total of 18 populations containing approximately 300 to 1,200 individuals is currently known. The four varieties are discussed separately below. Historically, Plantago princeps var. anomala was known from Makaleha in the Waianae Mountains on Oahu, and a ridge west of Hanapepe River on Kauai (HHP 1992i1, 1992i4). Currently on Kauai, 4 populations with 45 individuals are known from the south rim and upper reaches of Kalalau Valley on State land (HHP 1992i2; HPCC 1990e, 1990g, 1991g). Historically, Plantago princeps var. laxiflora was known from Waikolu, Olokui, Kamakou, and Pelekunu on the east side of Molokai; in back of Lahaina on West Maui; and Hamakua and Kohala on the island of Hawaii (HHP 1992i6, 1992i8 to 1992i11, 1992i16, 1992i17). Currently on Molokai, Plantago princeps var. laxiflora is known from one population with five individuals at Kawela Gulch on private land (HHP 1992i5). On Maui, it is known from 2 locations in Iao Valley on West Maui, and 4 locations within Haleakala National Park and adjacent Waikamoi Preserve on East Maui on Federal and private land, totalling about 100 plants on that island (HHP 1992i7, 1992i12 to 1992i15, 1992i18; HPCC 1990h to 1990j, 1991h, 1991i).
