Most features devote particular attention to the organizational, technical and financial issues connected with the collapse of the USSR. That is not surprising. Several of the command, control and telemetry complexes, after all, have ended up on the territory of states in the near abroad. But the KIKs are, first and foremost, a collective of highly skilled specialists about whom the general public knows virtually nothing at all. They remain outside the view of reporting from Baykonur, Plesetsk and the Flight Control Station for the Mir orbital station. The journal is beginning the publication of a series of materials on the service of the workers at the command, control and telemetry complexes and their role in supporting the space programs and raising the combat readiness of the armed forces of the Russian Federation with this article by KIK Main Center Chief Colonel Anatoliy Borisovich Zapadinskiy. The Main Center for the Testing and Control of Spacecraft is located near Moscow in the city of Krasnoznamensk (Golitsino-2). The city was closed to journalists until quite recently, and not just to them. Military specialists of the highest qualifications are on duty here around the clock--electronics experts, programmers, ballistics specialists, communications workers and many more, for whom space is the cause of their life. These people are responsible for the state of almost all of the country's orbital stations, manned or unmanned, for military, national-economic or scientific-research purposes. Information flows from twelve command, control and telemetry complexes located across the entire territory of the country to the Main Center, which is a very important part of the Military Space Forces of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, as well as from scientific-research vessels (separate ocean-going floating complexes) through relay satellites. The Flight Control Centers for the separate types of spacecraft are structurally part of it. They plan about 1,000 communications sessions with more than 180 craft in orbit each day. The command and control of spacecraft that are in service is just a part of their tasks. A second, and perhaps no lesser, part is to conduct flight testing of new spacecraft. The specialists of the Main Center perform these functions in collaboration with representatives of more than 150 organizations--NIIs [scientific-research institutes], KBs [design bureaus], NPOs [scientific-production associations] and civilian agencies. A satellite flies over the territory of Russia for about 20 minutes, and the control and telemetry complexes are "receiving them" and "handing them over" to each other successively along the entire track, each of them having its own zone of radio visibility with a certain overlap; the control of the craft thus continuously passes "by relay." And so it goes around the clock. The collectives, supervised by Colonels V. Kovalev, A. Kotenko, V. Artemenko, N. Kolesnikov, I. Lopatin and V. Pestov, are successfully accomplishing the tasks assigned to them under difficult conditions. There are 67 officers with academic degrees of doctor or candidate of sciences currently serving at the Main Center. They are making a large contribution to the scientific-research work of the command and control centers. I would like to note among them S. Ryapolov, O. Pudovkin, O. Yefremov, M. Grekhov and Ya. Abdulov first and foremost. The uninitiated reader could ask, "What do I in particular, and the country in general, need with space science, since it costs enormous amounts of money?" I will try to answer that. When you open up a recent newspaper, turn on the television or reserve a telephone conversation with a different city, you scarcely give any thought to the fact that space telerelay currently supports the transmission of Channel 1 from Ostankino for 97.2 percent of the population and the Russia Channel for 90 percent, 29 cities receive images of newspaper column layouts through satellites, and telephone, telegraph, facsimile and other forms of communications are accomplished by satellite. The economic impact from the use of those means alone is about 1.5 billion rubles a year.[.sup]1[/] Orbital weather stations provide timely warning of dangerous natural phenomena, and markedly improve the accuracy of forecasts. The annual economic impact from their use totals more than 500 million rubles, and the research data on natural resources about 700 million. More figures from the realm of space meteorology: one satellite receives more information in 90 minutes (the average duration of one orbit around the Earth) than 1,500 weather stations around the world. The possibility of forecasting the weather two weeks in advance, according to the estimates of UN experts (and they can scarcely be suspected of bias), could provide an annual economy of about nine billion dollars on a worldwide scale. That figure is 600--700 million rubles a year apropos of our country. Take, by way of example, an area of space science such as researching the natural resources of the Earth from space. This is a gold mine! The high-precision cataloguing of pasturelands and tracts of timber, predictions of spring water runoff and harvest levels of grains, after all, also exist aside from the aforementioned "line items" of income. They have long since learned to count "space" money abroad. They know very well there that the cost of one photograph that encompasses 185 km[.sup]2[/] of the Earth's surface in stereoscopic form costs more than 4,000 dollars. The productivity of one spacecraft is more than 30,000 pictures a year. Less than four billion rubles a year were being allocated for space programs by the former USSR in 1990-91. This is roughly half the spending of the state for tobacco products, and one seventh of that for alcoholic beverages. The sensible voices of specialists from many of the agencies in whose interests the dozens of spacecraft and thousands of KIK specialists are working are most unfortunately not always heard against the background of the shrill declarations of some "people's patrons" who are calling for reductions and cuts in the space programs. They have been cut back as a whole. And what of it? Was there a spurt in some other sector of the national economy? No. Would it not thus be easier at least to preserve what we have, and find a worthy and economically advantageous application for it? We cannot in fact return to the plow and torch, leaving the country without communications, television, navigation, meteorological observations and many others services that often go unnoticed that are offered by space science. Many forget, when talking about the commercialization of space science and its cost recovery, that there is also another aspect that for us, servicemen, is the main one, whatever else may be said on this score. The positive changes in the world have naturally lessened international tensions appreciably. But the dissolution of the NATO alliance did not follow the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, and no substantial changes are taking place in the military doctrines and strategic concepts of the United States and the NATO countries. Each looks after his own, as they say. It is the business of policy makers and diplomats to provide for the security of the state using peaceful means. It is the business of the military to support those efforts. How can space science help? The responsibility of military space science is global high-precision navigation, communications, the command and control of troops, operational all-weather reconnaissance and warnings of nuclear-missile attack, the monitoring of "hot spots" and the course of fulfillment of treaty obligations. We will be candid- -the space assets, in performing the total monitoring of the situation around the world, play a dual role. The national space assets of the great powers, on the one hand, foster a strengthening of strategic stability and confidence-building measures among peoples and, on the other, increase the combat capabilities of the troops by one-and-a-half to two times. The on-board apparatus of the reconnaissance satellites, in orbits of 300 km or more, in fact have resolution that allows them to see objects of just several dozen centimeters. Measurement data from special spacecraft are used to create the digital terrain maps that constitute the foundation of the flight assignments of the newest strategic arms systems. For cruise missiles this signifies the guaranteed hitting of the target with a deviation of no more than ten meters. The operations of the United States in the war with Iraq is an example of this. They have in operational use 17 supporting space systems for military purposes today. These are satellites for imaging, infrared, radio and radar reconnaissance on global and regional scales, the monitoring of outer space and the warning of nuclear-missile attack, communications, combat command and control and navigational, topogeodesic and meteorological support. The U.S. Department of Defense could bring in civilian space assets as well when needed. I would like to emphasize here the substantial difference of our "space system" from the American one. We have no separate military and civilian space science. The spacecraft, regardless of their purpose, are thus prepared and launched from one and the same cosmodromes by one and the same launch vehicles. Ground stations and information-computer complexes belonging to the Ministry of Defense of Russia control them. Why not now split up the zones of responsibility and turn over national- economic and scientific space science to civilian agencies, leaving the military with purely their own tasks? With time, when private companies begin to invest funds in space science, this could become a reality, but now--we will be realistic--there is not one civilian specialist who would go to work and live at a cosmodrome or ground telemetry station for the same money, and under the same conditions, as our officers. Colossal funds will be required in order to create a separate civilian space science. I think that this question will not be considered in the near future. Thanks to the fact that domestic space science is being kept on the backs of servicemen--whose monetary sustenace is less than the wages of a trolley driver--living in God-forsaken places and who do not have normal housing, but do not go on strike nonetheless, it remains with those few that are still working uninterruptedly here. We are constantly called upon to perform tasks associated with maintaining the combat readiness of the armed forces of the Russian Federation. And that is not easy work. Dozens of spacecraft for various purposes are prepared and launched at our cosmodromes every year, and the KIK Main Center is constantly controlling the spacecraft in orbit. The military people work with such far from military spacecraft as the Molniya and Gorizont (communications), Tsikada (navigation), Meteor and Resurs (meteorology and remote sounding of the Earth) and scientific satellites. They support the launch and control of all manned flights. And meanwhile no one removes their main task-- ensuring the security of the Fatherland. The cutbacks in the personnel of space units that were carried out in directive fashion a few years ago have created a situation close to critical. Many officers at the command, control and telemetry complexes put in day-long duty a day later, are brought in for additional work at night and take part in controlling communications sessions for two or three days without a break. The psychophysical burdens are enormous. Operations where each mistake could caused millions in losses to the state are performed during these sessions. It would be convenient here to mention the prospects for the development of the KIK Main Center and questions of the social protections for the people who are serving the Fatherland--to its "greater glory," as they said in the old days. The prospects, strange as it may be, are defined by our problems. The facilities of the space infrastructure are located on the territory of five states of the CIS (Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus and Uzbekistan). Only one of those--Russia--is able to carry out space activity independently. Kazakhstan, where Baykonur is located, does not have any space industry and cannot operate the cosmodrome independently of the other states. There are missile- building plants on the territory of Ukraine, but no cosmodrome. So what is the way out? Operations in the realm of space science must be organized in a new fashion, and coordinated with the space programs of sovereign states and the international space program. Such programs are expediently developed from the perspective of a decade, since the cycle for the creation and series production of space assets is 7--10 years. The necessity of a state program is conditioned by two factors. Some space systems, first of all (meteorological, navigational etc.), could serve a virtually unlimited number of consumers in all parts of the Commonwealth. It would not be expedient to create them for each state separately. Second, the centralized financing of military and international space programs should be preserved, from the economic and technical points of view. An International Aerospace Committee (MAKK) must be formed. It could be entrusted with the functions of general customer of international space projects, as well as being the body that determines the degree of participation of states in shared financing for the creation and operation of space assets for dual purposes. Responsibility for the fulfillment of the international space program should be charged to the Military Space Forces of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, entrusting it with ordering and operating space assets for military and dual purposes. The involvement of space units in realizing the plans of space agencies of the sovereign states and the MAKK could be accomplished on a contract basis, with compensation for the expenditures of military organizations for the creation and operation of the hardware, as well as the maintenance of the service personnel.
