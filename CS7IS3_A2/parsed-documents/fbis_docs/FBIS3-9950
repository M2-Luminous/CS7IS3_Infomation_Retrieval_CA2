Carrying out a more diplomatic than military mission, Camilion met members of the Brazilian civilian and military ministries in Brasilia in an effort to improve the deteriorated relations between the two countries. Sources close to the minister told PAGINA/12: "The Brazilian Government invited Camilion for a visit to try to ease the current bad bilateral relations." But Camilion is very well known in Brazilian political circles because under a similar situation in 1977, when he was ambassador in Brasilia, he had to maneuver with great skill to reduce the reciprocal tension that was threatening to explode into open conflict. The current situation has not reached that extreme but it is really bad. With difficulties in the process of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and problems on economic matters, the foreign policies of the two countries are going in different directions: While Argentina is getting closer to the United States, Brazil opens new fronts of conflicts with Washington every day. This is particularly true on military matters. The Brazilian Armed Forces have expressed their anti-American position and refused to take a step back in their independent arms race development. The Brazilian Armed Forces have charged that the United States is trying to go over Brazilian sovereignty in the Amazon, and have indirectly accused several neighboring countries -- including Argentina -- of allowing the Pentagon military exercises and bases in their territory for that purpose. This situation has worsened the historic military distrust between Argentina and Brazil. Camilion is aware that the situation now involves a triangle: In his meetings with U.S. officials in Washington last year, Camilion was able to personally see the concern of Bill Clinton's administration over the future of Brazil. This is why he said on 24 February that Argentina "will under no circumstance sacrifice its relations with Brazil to strengthen its links with the United States." Argentina and Brazil also agreed that the Argentine purchase of U.S. Skyhawk planes is no reason for conflict. Brazilian diplomatic sources said: "No one believes the rearming effort is against Brazil." Camilion also publicly said: "Argentina is not interested in creating any problems with its neighbors." It is not easy, however, to make progress on the military chapter of Mercosur, as was clearly established at the first Mercosur armed forces seminar, held in Buenos Aires last year, when due to the different positions no common agreement beyond the formal was reached. Camilion admitted: "Integration in that area is not so easy." As an example, Argentina and Brazil are rivals in the bidding for supplying 764 training airplanes to the U.S. Air Force and Navy. Camilion said: "The two countries' airplanes are among the best." Then in a conciliatory manner he suggested that the two countries' military industries could reach a cooperation agreement if one of them gets the contract. The briefing Camilion will give President Carlos Menem today after his return to Buenos Aires on his talks with Itamar Franco will certainly not cover just these issues.
