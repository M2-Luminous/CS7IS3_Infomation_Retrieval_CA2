In accordance with tentative data, several persons, who are yet to be identified in the course of investigation, stole a steel capsule from the equipment, fixed it in a screw-vise in the workshop and tried to pulverize it in the hope that it contained a precious metal. The hermetic seal of the capsule was broken. The offenders threw its fragments into the fire-prevention reservoir filled with water. As a result of the actions, the reservoir and the adjacent premises of the plant were contaminated. After the disappearance of the capsule became known, the territory of the plant was thoroughly examined. Places of radioactive contamination were pinpointed. Their total area amounts to 25 square meters. The territory around the reservoir was covered with concrete. There is no danger of spread of the radioactive contamination. Eleven persons were exposed to various doses of radiation. Three workers were hospitalized in the Kharkiv Radiological Institute. None of those affected was diagnosed as suffering from "radiation disease." A criminal case was initiated.
