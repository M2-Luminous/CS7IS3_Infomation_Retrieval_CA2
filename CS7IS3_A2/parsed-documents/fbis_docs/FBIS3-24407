From the president's message to parliament one could draw the conclusion that the integrationalists were gaining the upper hand in Russia, and the policies of the Burbulis-Gaydar cabinet were becoming a thing of the past. Then came the Gazprom [Gas Industry Concern] demarche (KOMMERSANT wrote about it on 3 March), which put both Ukraine and Belarus in an extraordinarily difficult economic position. Yesterday daily gas deliveries were already cut in half, and today, despite Kiev's statement of its willingness to begin payments as of 5 March, Gazprom is promising to shut the valve altogether. The duality of Russian positions is also reflected in the epic of the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. The Russian government's positions are dualistic in terms of both internal economic policy and the building of an economic union within the CIS framework. The only common feature appears to be the fact that one thing is stated while something entirely different happens in practice. Promises to repay debts to the budget-financed sector, the military-industrial complex and the agroindustrial complex are accompanied by a harsh criticism of the budget, while the Ministry of Finance's version of the budget is based on extremely strict criteria. Contacts with the former fraternal republics appear the same way: Viktor Chernomyrdin holds a semiconspiratorial meeting with his Belarusian colleague, but after it the pace of Belarus's joining the Russian monetary system does not speed up in the least. It turns out that use is being made of the principle: what I say is entirely different from what I do (what I think remains unknown). Yet in relations with the CIS and in domestic policy a unified set of policies needs to be worked out. In light of recent events, one may assume that the gap between actual policy and official declarations will be, at the very least, preserved. This is indirectly confirmed by the sharp increase in the degree of secrecy with which the Russian departments are concealing their plans with regard to relations with the CIS. Russia's Economic Relations With the CIS in 1993 CIS countries Trade in Percentage of Allocation of billions of Russia's total state credits in rubles trade billions of rubles Azerbaijan 348 1.5 0 Armenia 86 0.45 11.7 Belarus 4,171 18.5 38.0 Kazakhstan 3,800 16.9 11.55 Kyrgyzstan 320 1.4 8.0 Moldova 514 2.28 14.5 Tajikistan 131 0.58 21.15 (noncash) + 60 (cash) Turkmenistan 280 1.24 0 Uzbekistan 1,761 7.8 30.0 (including 20 billion cash) Ukraine 11,012 49.0 69.5 Georgia 68 0.35 1.5 In 1992-1993 the Russian government reached a clear understanding of priorities with regard to Russia's interests in the CIS, an understanding which was subsequently called "isolationism." The contribution that 1994 makes to the situation may be the very same strategy in camouflaged political dressing. For all practical purposes, that is the approach that is defended by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry on Economic Cooperation With Member-States of the Commonwealth, and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The industrial lobbies and, in part, the regional lobbies oppose it. After encountering nonpayments, they have been putting pressure not on their partners in the CIS, but primarily on the Russian government, through whose credits to the debtor countries financing is opened up for them, too. It is typical that at the beginning of the year Yuriy Shafranik stated at a meeting of his ministry's collegium that it was more profitable to export oil to the CIS than to Western Europe. The Central Bank is also in solidarity with the industrialists. Gazprom is so far the exception, and the shut-off of deliveries to Ukraine and Belarus could, in theory, prompt the industrialists to toughen their positions vis-a-vis the consumers of their products from the former USSR. Consequently, Russia will be officially defending the ideas of continuing economic integration with an emphasis on the development of supranational structures, while striving to assume key positions on those agencies. On the other hand, in bilateral relations--and they are what determine real relations--Russia will, at the least, hold to its positions of 1993: the preservation of customs duties on energy resources, a rigid arrangement for granting credits and the repayment of them (the indexation of credit amounts through the dollar, the determination of interest rates through the libor [London banks' short-term interest rate], and the requirement of an insurance deposit in hard currency), with the right to write off defaulted debts without requiring acceptance). Possible alternatives to present transportation routes for Russian export cargo that would bypass the Commonwealth countries are also being studied. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Per Capita National Income of Individual CIS Countries (As a Percentage of C-| |IS Average) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |CIS |100 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belarus |125 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |112.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine |95.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan |84.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moldova |77 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Turkmenistan |69 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Uzbekistan |64.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Azerbaijan |62.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kyrgyzstan |59.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenia |50 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tajikistan |30 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
