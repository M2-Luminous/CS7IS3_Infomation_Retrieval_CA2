They would thus be switching to projects for the peaceful use of nuclear power and better protection for Russia's nuclear power stations. Yesterday evening the European Parliament [EP] in Strasbourg unanimously voted for a provisional protocol, thus giving the go-ahead to found such an institute. This was required because the Russian Parliament, the Douma, was not able to ratify the agreement with the European Union, the United States, and Japan as a result of the stormy political events in Moscow. During a debate in Strasbourg yesterday, Dutch MP Jessica Larive (VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]), EP rapporteur on founding the new center in Moscow, referred to an urgent need to stop the brain drain from Russia of nuclear scientists who were all employed under the Soviet system on the production and maintenance of nuclear weapons. So far 500 have left, possibly to suspect countries such as Iraq, Libya and Iran, plus the nuclear power China. Between 1971 and 1993, some 700,000 people lived in the 10 secret nuclear towns. Larive believes most of them are still there. But they no longer enjoy their former privileges such as high wages, free housing and education, and there are problems with food supplies. There is no other employment for the nuclear technicians, as they are bound to secrecy by the Russian Government. The hard core of 500 scientists with knowledge of the Soviet system for chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons can now be employed on peaceful projects in Moscow. The European Union, the United States, and Japan have so far set aside some 126 million guilders for the center. Russia has even made a Moscow building available.
