Did you know that on 5 February, Long Sopheap ordered his henchmen to kill 23 soldiers who refused to enter the battlefields around Anlung Veng. [passage omitted] 2. This barbarous killing shows that the Vietnamese communists, their allies, and Vietnamese communist puppets are very fascist and have always been fascist towards the people, their troops, and the Para soldiers. 3. For this reason, for your own survival and in order to protect your parents, you should turn your guns at and shoot Long Sopheap and his henchmen. You know well that Long Sopheap is not a Cambodian. He is a Vietnamese. He has forcibly recruited many people's sons to fight and die in his place. Moreover, Long Sopheap is very fascist and cruel. He shot dead several hundred of the soldiers of the two-headed government on the battlefields. [passage omitted]
