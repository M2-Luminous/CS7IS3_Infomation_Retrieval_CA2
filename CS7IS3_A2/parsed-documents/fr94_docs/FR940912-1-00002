FR940912-1-00002 FR940912-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 46 [Docket Number FV93&hyph;353] Extend Coverage To Include Fresh and Frozen Fruits and Vegetables That Are Oil-Blanched, Including Frozen French Fried Potato Products; Reopening of Comment Period on Proposed Rule Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Reopening of Comment Period. SUMMARY: This document reopens the period for filing written comments on a proposed rule published on July 12, 1994, that would extend PACA coverage to include fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables that are oil-blanched, including frozen french fried potato products. DATES: Comments must be received by October 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this reopened action. Comments should be addressed to USDA, AMS, F&V Division, PACA Branch, Room 2095&hyph;S. Building, P.O. Box 96456, 14th & Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20090&hyph;6456. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: J.R. Frazier, Assistant Chief, PACA Branch, Room 2095&hyph;So., Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20250, Phone (202) 720&hyph;4180, FAX (202) 690&hyph;4413. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed rule was published in the July 12, 1994 issue of the Federal Register (59 FR 35487). The proposed rule would amend the definition of fresh fruit and vegetables set forth in 7 CFR 46.2(u) of the Regulations issued pursuant to the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (7 U.S.C. 499o). This document extends PACA coverage to include frozen fruits and vegetables that are oil-blanched, especially frozen french fried potato products. Under previous regulations, suppliers of these commodities suffered considerable financial losses because oil-blanched products were excluded from the PACA. Reopening the comment period grants dealers in frozen oil-blanched products the same rights afforded dealers whose frozen product is water blanched. On August 10, 1994, the Agency received a request from the Food Marketing Institute, International Foodservice Distributors Association, National-American Wholesale Grocers Association, National Council of Chain Restaurants, National Grocers Association, and the National Restaurant Association requesting a 90-day extension of the comment period. The request stated they needed additional time to develop their comments. The Department has determined that a 30-day extension of the comment period will provide adequate time for interested persons to respond to this proposed rule. Accordingly, the comment period is reopened to October 12, 1994. Dated: September 6, 1994. Robert C. Keeney, Director, Fruit and Vegetable Division.
