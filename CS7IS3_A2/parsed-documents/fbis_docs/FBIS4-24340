[Begin Lourenco recording] It is not the government which has been hampering peace so far. It is the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Over the past few hours we heard that even the U.S. Administration thinks that the government has satisfied all the mediator's proposals and requests UNITA to follow the government's example. This only confirms that if there is no peace in the country at present, it is because UNITA is not ready for it. [end recording]
