At a press conference Monday [17 January], Landsbergis commented on a meeting of Polish and Lithuanian politicians, scholars and representatives of social organizations, held in Warsaw Saturday. The meeting's participants focused on common political interests of both countries and also discussed the problem of Russian military force in the Kaliningrad region. Lithuanian and Polish politicians must seek the region's demilitarization, Landsbergis said. In his opinion, the struggle against the emerging Russian imperialism could also be a common interest, as well as Lithuania's rapproachement with the Visegrad Treaty (Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic). The opposition leader specified some reports that Poland regrets the absence of an agreement on friendship and cooperation with Lithuania. Landsbergis said the Lithuanian side emphasizes the need to sign a separate declaration on the 1920 occupation of the Vilnius region by Poland together with the main agreement. Landsbergis said Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak expressed hope that the problem will soon be solved. The opposition leader said the Polish side apologized several times for a letter to President Lech Walesa, signed by 72 members of the Polish parliamentary majority. As previously reported, the letter suggests very categorical terms of signing the agreement. Landsbergis said an apology was also made by the chairman of the Polish party in power. "Possibilities to agree do exist, but there are opponents who seek to prevent this."
