FR940406-0-00195 FR940406-0-00015 Data Sources: HUD used the most accurate and current data available to develop the FMR estimates. Three sources of survey data were used as the basis for the base-year estimates. They are: (1) The 1990 Census; (2) the RDD telephone surveys conducted since the Census; and (3) the post-1990 Census American Housing Surveys (AHSs) available up to the time the FMR estimates were prepared. The base-year FMRs were then updated using Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for rents and utilities or the HUD Regional rent change factors developed from RDD surveys. Annual average CPI data are available individually for 95 metropolitan FMR areas. RDD Regional rent change factors are developed annually for the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan parts of each of the 10 HUD Regions (a total of 20 separate factors). The RDD factors are used to update the base year estimates for all FMR areas that do not have their own local CPI survey. The decennial Census provides statistically reliable rent data for use in establishing base-year FMRs. AHSs are conducted by the Bureau of the Census for HUD and have accuracy comparable to the decennial Census. These surveys enable HUD to develop between-census revisions for 44 of the largest metropolitan areas on a revolving schedule of 11 areas annually. The RDD telephone survey technique is based on a sampling procedure that uses computers to select random samples of rental housing, dial and keep track of the telephone numbers and tabulate the responses. RDD surveys are designed to produce FMR estimates that are within two to four percent of the actual 45th percentile rent. Public Comments In response to the proposed FY 1994 FMRs, HUD received over 2,500 comments covering more than 1,100 FMR areas. The first publication on October 1, 1993 included final FMRs (held at the FY 1993 levels) for the areas for which the review of public comments had not been completed. HUD announced in that publication that there would be a second publication of FMRs for those areas and for those with RDD surveys still under review. The final count of FMR areas under consideration was 669, including 40 FMR areas for which both public comments and RDD surveys were submitted. The areas under review are identified in this publication with a ``+'' symbol next to the FMR schedule for the areas that had both comments and RDD surveys; and with an ``*'' next to the FMR schedule for all other areas with comments. HUD carefully evaluated all information submitted with the public comments. Based on this evaluation, the FMRs for 572 areas have been revised. This total includes revised FMRs for: 165 areas that were increased based on the survey data submitted by the commenters; 39 areas that were increased as the result of RDD surveys; and 368 areas that submitted incomplete information but that HUD was able to supplement with available information. The amount of the FMR increase was not always the same as the amount requested by the commenters. For the 165 areas notified with survey data, the increases sometimes differed because commenters requested a return to the FY 1993 FMRs even though their surveys showed something different. In other cases, the survey data had to be re-tabulated and corrected; this resulted in revised FMRs that are sometimes higher and sometimes lower than the requested modifications. The increases approved for the 368 areas, with incomplete but usable data, generally were smaller than those requested by the commenter and generally applied only to the one- and two-bedroom unit sizes. The information submitted for 97 FMR areas was not sufficient to provide a basis for revising the FMRs. Many commenters expressed their concern that owners would have to accept the reduced FMRs and would not renew leases at a lower rent, and families would be forced to move. The Department wants to assure the PHAs administering the program and the families that are currently participating in the Section 8 program that current participants will not be forced to move or have to pay a higher portion of the rent. The rents specified in the housing assistance contract between the owner and the PHA will continue to be paid by the PHA unless the owner requests a rent increase in accordance with the provisions of the housing assistance contract. In such cases, the rent increase will be calculated using the annual adjustment factors and will be approved by the PHA if the new rent does not exceed the amount of rent charged for comparable unassisted units. The amount of rent the family pays will continue to be based on the family's income, and for families in the rental voucher program the applicable payment standard. The new FMRs will be used for new families entering the program or for current participants when they move to a new unit. In addition, PHA officials expressed concern about the impact that the reduced FMRs would have on administrative fees and, therefore, their continuing capacity to administer the program. The calculation of PHA administrative fees for FY 1994 is subject to a recent statutory change. FY 1994 administrative fees are calculated using the FY 1993 FMRs if there was a decrease in the FMRs. However, if the FY 1994 FMRs are higher, the law limited the fee increase to 3.5 percent above the FY 1993 fee. HUD Notice PIH&hyph;93&hyph;66(HA), which was issued on December 16, 1993, contains detailed information on how FY 1994 administrative fees should be calculated. RDD Surveys Both HUD and PHAs used RDD telephone surveys to test the reliability of the proposed FY 1994 FMRs in areas with large decreases proposed in FY 1994 FMRs. Of the 46 HUD RDD surveys completed since the proposed FMRs were published, 21 had results that were higher than the proposed FMRs and 24 had results that were lower or not statistically different. FMRs for eighteen areas were increased based on the results of PHA-funded RDD surveys. PHAs that funded surveys which produced FMR estimates below those proposed opted not to comment, so comparative data are not available. For the areas where RDD survey FMRs are higher than the proposed FMRs, the FMRs published for effect are based on the RDD surveys. The FY 1993 FMRs and the proposed and final FY 1994 FMRs for these areas are as follows: ‚ê£ 1HUD RDD Surveys with increases 1State 1Two-bedroom FMRs 2FY 93 FMR 2Proposed FY94 FMR 2RDD-based FY94 FMR Humboldt Co CA $583 $503 $552 Bannock Co ID 478 345 377 Boise ID 594 440 485 Kootenai Co ID 478 403 501 Peoria IL 552 426 450 Duluth MN 466 382 422 Beaufort Co NC 410 331 363 Baker Co OR 552 336 389 Deschutes Co OR 584 504 543 Eugene OR 608 521 536 Grant Co OR 552 352 400 Malheur Co OR 527 336 389 Odessa-Midland TX 550 402 425 Provo UT 462 388 409 Bellingham WA 619 540 618 Ferry Co WA 424 362 382 Pend Oreille Co WA 424 362 382 Spokane WA 501 432 491 Stevens Co WA 424 358 379 Yakima WA 523 418 503 Walla Walla WA 552 381 407 PHA RDD Surveys with increases Mobile AL 447 338 401 Phoenix AZ 505 502 512 Tucson AZ 490 486 501 Colorado Springs CO 504 472 477 Ft.
