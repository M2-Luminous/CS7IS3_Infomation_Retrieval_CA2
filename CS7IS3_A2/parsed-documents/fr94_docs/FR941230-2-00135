FR941230-2-00135 FR941230-2-00072 The evaluation of all five sites would be supported by this program. The evaluation would consist of both process and impact components. The process evaluation, to begin during the first year, would include an examination of planning procedures and the extent to which the sites' implementation is consistent with the principles of a continuum of care model. The process evaluation would identify the key factors responsible for successful implementation. It would also be important for the evaluation to identify substantial obstacles to successful implementation of a continuum of care model. The selected evaluator would be responsible for developing a cross-site monograph that discusses continuum of care implementation for use by other communities that want to develop a similar system for juveniles. The evaluator would develop a research design for the impact component within the first year. Data collection for the impact component would begin during the second year of the evaluation. The impact component would address the effects of the continuum of care strategy on the clients served. Furthermore, it would address the efficacy of the structure and operation of the continuum of care strategy. OJJDP would award a single cooperative agreement for up to $150,000 for first-year funding of this multiyear evaluation program. Delinquency Prevention_New Programs Congress appropriated $20 million in fiscal year 1995, under Title V of the JJDP Act, for the second year of a new delinquency prevention program that began in 1994. This program also supports OJJDP's Comprehensive Strategy by reducing the onset of delinquency among youths who might otherwise have begun or continued on a pathway to serious, violent, and chronic delinquency. Community planning teams are being established at the local level under this program to conduct risk and resource assessments in order to determine what delinquency prevention programs are needed for that particular jurisdiction. The work of these planning teams should be coordinated with other system planning efforts such as Family Preservation and Support Services, U.S. Attorney Antiviolence Strategies, and providing Graduated Sanctions for Juvenile Offenders. Under Title V, communities submit applications to their State Formula Grants Program agency for funding of local prevention programs that community planning teams have determined are needed to prevent delinquency, based on the community's assessment of its needs and priorities. Communities must provide a matching contribution and are encouraged to establish partnerships with the private sector, especially corporations and foundations. Title V prevention plans include a number of multidisciplinary program approaches beginning with prenatal care and including a continuum of programs from birth to adulthood. Other delinquency prevention programs are set forth below for which communities engaging in comprehensive community planning can apply directly to OJJDP for funding. Family Strengthening and Support_Including Non-English Speaking_$1,000,000 Strengthening and supporting families, including non-English speaking families, is a priority area in the JJDP Act and a key component of the comprehensive approach to delinquency prevention and control envisioned in the proposed Safe Futures: Partnerships to Reduce Youth Violence and Delinquency Program. In support of this priority, OJJDP proposes to provide funding to each of the five communities selected to implement a Safe Futures Program. Funds will be used to initiate or expand needed family-strengthening intervention and treatment programs, including programs for English and non-English-speaking families, that involve juveniles who are parents and are in the juvenile justice system, and that enlist schools and other local entities in family programming. A major family-strengthening research project funded by the OJJDP was recently completed. The grantees, the University of Utah and Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, produced a user's guide, Strengthening America's Families: Promising Parenting and Family Strategies for Delinquency Prevention, and an executive summary that reviews both the current impact of family characteristics on risk for delinquency and the most promising family change interventions. Given the multiple variations of intervention strategies, the project recommends the organization of family-strengthening programs and services according to the family's level of functioning and the child's age. The researchers identified a representative group of 25 programs as particularly promising. Under this program area, OJJDP would support implementation of new or expanded family-strengthening efforts designed to improve parental functioning as part of an overall plan to prevent delinquency or intervene with youth who are in the juvenile justice system. Communities that compete and are selected under the Safe Futures Program will be eligible to receive funding under this program. The family-strengthening component of this initiative would be funded in the five selected communities at up to $200,000 per site.
