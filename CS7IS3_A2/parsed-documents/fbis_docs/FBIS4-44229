Alfredsson: "Colliander Leaving Politics"] [Excerpt] Vivianne Franzen can now lead New Democracy [NYD] unchallenged in the run-up to the election. Harriet Colliander is withdrawing, but she still thinks that she is the right and real party leader and that her party executive is the right and real party executive. Her resignation is the result of the ballot among members that has been held since the extraordinary party congress. The votes were counted on Tuesday [21 June]. It emerged that Vivianne Franzen and her executive have the support of about 80 percent of those who took part in the ballot. Given that this is the situation Harriet Colliander has decided to give up. She is resigning as chairman of the party executive that was elected at the regular party congress in early April and will leave politics. She will not participate in the election campaign and she will not run for the Riksdag this fall. [passage omitted]
