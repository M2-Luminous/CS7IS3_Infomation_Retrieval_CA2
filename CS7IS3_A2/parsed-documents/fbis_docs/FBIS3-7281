Kim, before departing for China after a three-day visit to Tokyo, extended the invitation again to the imperial couple as they bid farewell to Kim and his wife Son Myong-sun at the Akasaka Palace, said Kiyoshi Sumiya, the agency's grand master of ceremonies. Kim told the couple during the 20-minute meeting that he wishes to invite them to visit South Korea at a proper time. During an audience at the imperial palace on Thursday, the president officially invited Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko to visit South Korea to forge a new future-oriented relationship. At that time, the emperor replied the Japanese Government would decide on whether he will go to South Korea. The visit by Japan's monarch, however, is still a sensitive issue in South Korea, which was under Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945. During his stay in Tokyo, Kim urged Japan to work together to solve North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program, which has heightened tension on the Korean peninsula, and stressed the importance of forward-looking bilateral relations.
