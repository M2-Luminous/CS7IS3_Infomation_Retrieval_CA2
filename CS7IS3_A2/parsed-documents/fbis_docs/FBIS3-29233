Washington's hard-line stance against Japan has become clear following the collapse of trade framework talks last week, said an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), who asked for anonymity. The remark came after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on Tuesday announced that Japan was in violation of a 1989 accord on cellular phone trade and unveiled a plan to raise tariffs on Japanese telecommunication products. Bilateral talks are usually held before such a step is actually taken. Japan should work out some measures before the United States takes action, said the official. A source at the Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, said it was possible that Washington would take one punitive step after another against Japan, such as revival of the "Super 301" retaliation clause of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. The source also said Washington may resort to sanctions in a bid to increase sales of U.S.-made microchips in the Japanese market.
