Hosokawa made a surprise announcement of his intention to resign April 8 to take "moral and political responsibility" for a fresh financial scandal and the current stalemate in the Diet. "A new problem has come to light. New suspicions emerged that my political office entrusted a certain person with managing my personal financial means, raking in profits for a few years since 1981," the premier said. "The suspicion is that his management may have involved some illegalities, although the person, who is my old friend, asked for permission to manage my personal money, saying it would definitely be invested in a profitable manner," he said. On April 13, a former publisher of an economic magazine, to whom Hosokawa entrusted the funds, told reporters that Hosokawa lied about the investments in his resignation announcement. Yusei Kuwahata, 60, said at a news conference, "Hosokawa's office made me out to be like a criminal, using me as a tool to make Prime Minister Hosokawa look clean." From around 1981 to 1985, Kuwahata invested Hosokawa's funds and made profits for Hosokawa of 20 to 30 million yen, according to Kuwahata. Kuwahata denied any illegality in his use of the funds in spite of Hosokawa citing "new suspicions" over the legality of his financial deals as one of the reasons for his resignation. He said he did not invest the funds on the black market.
