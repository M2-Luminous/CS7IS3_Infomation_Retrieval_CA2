Until now it had been announced that three Belgians had died. The minister of foreign affairs was answering questions from deputies belonging to the chamber's Foreign Affairs Commission. Over now to Andre Menu: [Menu] Sixteen Belgians have been killed in the tragic events in Rwanda: Ten Belgian UN peacekeepers and six civilians -- three in Gisenyi and three in Kigali. This happened in the first few days. The Belgian peacekeepers were providing protection for the Rwandan prime minister, who was murdered. They were surprised by a large number of Rwandan nationals and executed the next night in a Rwandan camp. That was what Leo Delcroix, the minister of defense, reported this afternoon. But it was Willy Claes who defined the stance adopted by the government, whose main aim is to ensure people's security, to take the least possible number of risks and to organize the evacuation of our nationals. But for Willy Claes the latest tragic events in Rwanda mean that questions have to be raised on the effectiveness of the current mandate of the peacekeeping troops. As is known, the mandate is extremely limited. Belgium's attitude in the future must also depend on guarantees that a real democratization process in the country will succeed, Willy Claes said. There will be a debate in parliament on the future position to be adopted by Belgium. [passage omitted]
