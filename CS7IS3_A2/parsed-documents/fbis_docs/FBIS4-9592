This was confirmed this morning by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic after his talks with General Michael Rose, commander of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Sergio De Mello, head of the United Nations' civilian sector for the former Yugoslavia. Senada Cumorovic reports: [Cumorovic] General Michael Rose briefly said that he talked to Prime Minister Silajdzic today about some details and the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] plans for Gorazde, not specifying what actually these plans were. In a statement for journalists, Dr. Haris Silajdzic was somewhat more specific concerning the topics of and the reasons for today's meeting with Rose and Sergio De Mello. [Begin Silajdzic recording] We are discussing the situation in Gorazde. The aggressor forces have not withdrawn yet from Ljubcici and some other places inside 3 km. On the whole, they have withdrawn but [words indistinct]. This is where the problem is. We also have a report from our forces that some heavy weapons are still inside the 20 km radius [words indistinct] heavy weapons of the aggressor side. We want to be completely clear as to what this means. General Rose has therefore promised that he will today study the photographs taken from the air in order to establish whether the Serbian heavy artillery is still inside the 20 km radius. [end recording] [Cumurovic] In addition to military issues, they also discussed the normalization of life in Gorazde. [Begin Silajdzic recording] We are currently discussing the situation concerning water. The question of water is acute. You know that the civilian population is now receiving water from the springs that are not quite hygienic. We are afraid that some disease does not break out. Therefore, we will work toward the immediate repair of the water system, which, as you know, was destroyed by the aggressor forces before they withdrew. [end recording] [Cumurovic] As regards journalists' question, we will single out the one concerning the continuation of negotiations in this phase of the peace process. Dr. Silajdzic takes the view that restarting the peace process could make sense only if the Serbs honor the ultimatum, because this is a matter of the credibility of the international community. Without that credibility we cannot talk about negotiations [words indistinct] sense, Dr. Silajdzic told journalists. Following the statements for journalists, and General rose's departure, Prime Minister Silajdzic continued talks with Sergio De Mello, head of the civilian sector of the United Nations for the former Yugoslavia.
