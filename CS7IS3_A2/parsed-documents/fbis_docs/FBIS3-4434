The railways are the double-tracking of the Lanzhou-Urumqi Railway, the Northern Xinjiang Railway and Southern Xinjiang Railway. With financial allocations from the central government, and investment from Gansu Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, workers have so far completed 600 km of double-tracking on the Lanzhou-Urumqi line, of which 200 km has already been put into operation. The double-track railway line, with a length of 1,622 km, is expected to be completed and put into use this September, said the officials. The railway line in northern Xinjiang, as an important part of the second Eurasian continental bridge, has entered the final stage of construction and will soon be put into operation. Construction of the railway line in southern Xinjiang, which is designed to transport oil out of the Tarim Basin and to promote the local economy, started late last year. It will take three years to complete building of this railway line, with a length of about 1,000 km. At the same time, nine major highways, which have a total length of over 3,000 km and were jointly invested in by the central government and different localities in northwest China, were completed and put into operation last year. Meanwhile, a border highway linking 14 outlets on the 5,400 km border in northwest China, and 23 highways extending to neighboring countries for transportation of goods and passengers have been completed and put into use. The building or rebuilding of a dozen airports in Xinjiang, which will require a total investment of about two billion yuan from the central government and different localities, have all started. Local officials said the projects will finish construction and become operational over the coming two years. The laying of several optical telecommunication cables in northwest China, with a total length of 3,200 km, has been speeded up. When completed, they will link up with optical fiber cable systems in 13 west Asian and European countries and other optical cable systems in China. A digital hyperfrequency wave transmission line has been put into operation since last year.
