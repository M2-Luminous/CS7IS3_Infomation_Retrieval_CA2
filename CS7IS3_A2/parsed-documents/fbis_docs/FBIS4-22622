Whatever the Demand for Democracy--Such Will Be the Supply"] [Text] [Volkov] Regardless of how much the subject of elections may set our teeth on edge recently, we will have to say something about them, summing up the March results. As predicted, voter activity turned out to be the lowest in recent decades. Although in terms of this indicator we are still probably "ahead of the rest of the planet," social apathy is clearly on the rise in Kazakhstan. But if in developed countries slow activity in the electoral precincts is explained by the lack of confidence in politicians as a class (they say that without them they could figure out their problems), in our country this phenomenon has a different subtext. Here the people are tired of political games and, the main thing, they do not believe in the possibility of stabilizing the situation with the help of new deputies. The passivity of a certain part of the population has indirectly "supported" the executive power, which from the very beginning without beating around the bush has taken to slipping in (there is no other word for it) people it wants or finds helpful. Of course, such a policy could not fail to evoke hostility from certain voters who were already weary of mindlessly obeying the powers that be. [Ustyugov] Here are some characteristic figures obtained as a result of a sociological poll conducted by workers of the Republic Center for Study of Public Opinion. People of Kazakhstan were asked which problems bother them most today. Two-thirds answered: the decline of the standard of living. And only one out of 20 mentioned the lack of democratic freedoms. Whatever the demand for freedom--such is the supply. As a result, we have been given elections that are conducted, as the president put it, according to Kazakhstan's standards of democracy. Who is to blame for the fact that they turned out to be quite unlike the Western ones? There is American democracy, there is the general European standard, there is the Chinese, the Chilean, and there is Kazakhstan's. And ours is probably far from the worst, even if it did baffle CSCE experts. In any case a good half of the deputies (not counting those elected through the state list) were elected, in my view, without any violations or juggling of figures. As for the activity of the electorate, the answer is provided again by the figures from the poll of the Republic Center for Study of Public Opinion. Only 7.5 percent of those questioned are counting on effective activity from the new legislative organ, and the rest think that the members of parliament engage partially in talkathons and partially in lofty abstractions that have nothing directly to do with real life, which is ruled not by laws but by local bureaucrats. I do not know whether the sociologists were interested in the reaction of Kazakhstan residents to a possible turn toward authoritarian power, with complete elimination of the legislative branch, but I do not think they would respond with any special disturbance or misgivings here either: The past four months, during which the president has had additional authority and published edicts instead of signing laws, have shown the "elasticity" of Kazakhstan's democratic standards and the fact that they are not ingrained in the very essence of the political system, social life, and mentality of the citizens. The Fortress of Power and the `Degree' of Loyalty [Volkov] And still, in spite of the back-room games that have weeded out many politicians who were really needed in the Supreme Council, the new parliament will certainly not be in the government's pocket. In the first place, certain deputies have remained from the preceding Supreme Council to join the current one, and the majority of them are extremely opposed to the policy being conducted today by the higher and middle echelons of power. In the second place, no fewer if not more of the new members of parliament also share the aforementioned dislike for the actions of the government. True, a part of the St. Petersburg corps is elected from the state or, more precisely, the president's list. Their position is unenviable. On the one hand, they were elected by the people and, quite naturally, must defend their interests. On the other, the fact that they were nominated by the head of state places on them certain moral (not to mention other) obligations to the president. This kind of duality (one might call it a "split personality") of a considerable number of the people's elect could undoubtedly play a self-destructive role in the new parliament. Add to this the division of the Supreme Council into two chambers (and many observers consider this all but a fait accompli) and it becomes clear that for the first time our deputies will be engaged in "slinging mud" at one another and the government at the same time. I think the former will still win out and the rest of the problems will be classified as internal parliamentary ones. A distinguishing feature of March was the active preparation of certain people for posts in the Supreme Council. Today nobody any longer conceals the fact that Kuanysh Suyltanov should become the leader of one of the chambers of parliament. His conspicuous dismissal from the position of deputy prime minister because of "election to people's deputy" long before the beginning of the work of the first session was to have shown to the least quick-witted that this statesmen had now seriously taken up the cause of building a new parliament. [Ustyugov] The main task of the "script writers" who today are preparing the basis for the first session is to provide for a structure of the legislative organ and a mechanism for its activity that will enable the executive power to function freely. Parliament is to play a constructive-decorative role and nothing more. Above all it will be necessary to undertake a number of organizational measures aimed at holding back, dragging out, and "self-entanglement" of decisions that run counter to government policy. The complicated bicameral structure, the system of relations between the two chambers, and the regulations work to this end. Many a week will probably be devoted to these questions. Otherwise the standoff between the powers would begin almost on the first day of the session. And what good does it do that the amount of the minimum wage and pension in the republic is approaching the value of one U.S. dollar? They will call the prime minister to the podium and vote, say, for increasing the "minimum" to the value of the minimum consumer basket--400 tenge. The citizens will rejoice. Tomorrow they will all be given 10 times more money. The day after tomorrow all the prices will rise 10-fold. Will they summon the prime minister to the podium again? I am not speaking about the republic budget, from which all benefits for war veterans, misplaced residents of the Aral Sea area, Semipalatinsk victims, Chernobyl victims, and those who suffered from the repressions have been eliminated. What kind of parliament would approve such a decision? There is only one way out: Raise the "degree" of parliamentary loyalty, which will make it possible to assign to the president additional authority (in any case in the economic sphere) throughout the entire period of the "transition." Then the government will have its hands tied and the people's deputies will have it easier: There will be no need to waver between the Scylla and Charybdis of schism and disbandment. There Is More Room on Olympus [Volkov] The personnel changes that occurred in March again evoked more questions than answers. The "reassignment" of Tulegen Zhukeyev from the position of state adviser to the vacant post of deputy prime minister with the present leapfrogging in functional duties of members of the government make it impossible to understand whether this was a reinforcement of a "weak section" in the administration of the state or a demotion of some ill-favored person (recall how some of the functions were "taken away" from the former state adviser), or simply a change of the official title of the position held by Mr. Zhukeyev, leaving him in charge of all the sections he had before. The customary curtain of complete secrecy over transfers like this leaves no chance of figuring out the real reasons for the aforementioned actions. Nor does the discharge of Marat Ospanov from the position of the republic's chief tax collector because of his election as a deputy a month before the beginning of the work of the parliament provide an answer to the question of whether this is related to his forthcoming active work in the new Supreme Council or if there are some other factors at work here. It is no accident, probably, that President Sergey Tereshchenko recently said reproachfully that last year the tax services of Kazakhstan collected only 42 percent of the taxes that were due. Such "kindness" to the taxpayers at a time that is so difficult for the state budget cannot but make one wonder. With respect for Mr. Ospanov as a politician I still cannot but ask what actually were the reasons for his desire to be among the people's deputies again and why the republic leaders supported him in this. This question could be asked of several of those who were elected in March. [Ustyugov] I can add only that Zhukeyev's appointment as deputy prime minister, from the standpoint of the Basic Law, reinforces his positions since nothing is said about state advisers in the Constitution. I would not be surprised if the president eliminated the institution of state advisers altogether this year. We Have Too Few Fedorovs but Too Many Zaveryukhas [Volkov] March was also very instructive in the area of our leaders' outside contacts. The tendencies here are such that the Almaty leaders have already come up with a universal "lamentation." Bouncing along the pothole-filled highways of the capital (the impression was that the asphalt would melt along with the last snow), they say: If the president had not travelled abroad so frequently and had traveled on our roads, things would be easier for us. Let us overlook the concreteness of this complaint-request and discuss the principle of its origin. It is very good that both Nursultan Nazarbayev and the country he heads have a positive image abroad. It is even better that considerable amounts of funds in dollars are allotted to this country. But beyond that, as in the Soviet Union in Gorbachev's times, everything practically comes to a standstill. How, why, and where this money is spent--we do not know. A fresh example. Having concluded an agreement with the IMF and having received a guarantee that Kazakhstan would receive a large foreign currency loan, our government stated repeatedly that the money would be spent, among other things, for stabilizing exchange rate of the tenge and curbing inflation. In March we could see quite well how these intentions are being realized when on the eve of the elections the dollar was surging upward and by April Fool's Day it had doubled its tenge value. And that was in one month! If things continue like this it will not be long before it will be possible to have another financial reform in order to reduce the scale of the republic's monetary unit. Such fantasies are nourished by the appearance in circulation of bills worth 200 tenge and the word from the president about his intention to buy from Great Britain special equipment on which our monetary bills are printed. If the former information evokes regret about such a rapid devaluation of the national currency (it is no joke that within four months after the monetary reform they will issue a denomination worth twice as much as the nominal value of the largest monetary bill!), the latter causes misgivings that soon the printing of tenge will turn into an uncontrolled process of issuing money that rapidly loses its value. [Ustyugov] We do not have the appropriate political support for a stricter financial exchange rate in Kazakhstan. The Cabinet of Ministers is a monotonous, uniform monolith, and the struggle of approaches and concepts (if it exists at all) is left to the cadres. It is necessary to reveal (or create?) a multipolarity of government similar to the Russian: We must have our own Fedorovs who are ready to fall in battle against preferential credit and our own Zaveryukhas and Skokovs, who express the interests of the agro-industrial generals. But now one gets the impression that the government expresses only its own interests, which only it can understand, and therefore today it is capable of canceling out what it categorically declared yesterday, and tomorrow it will no less resolutely return to the other side. And all this without conflicts, polemics, or resignations, with concerted, inspired enthusiasm. The result is that the general deterioration of the situation (and it is inevitable this year) is linked by the citizens not to concrete officials representing various ideas and interests but the government and president as a whole. Today the head of state must distance himself from the Cabinet of Ministers--beginning with separation of the staffs and ending with the appointment to the position of prime minister of a really respected strategist. Instead of this, Nazarbayev takes the "fire" himself, signing first populist and economically ideologized and then monetaristic-draconian decisions. There is an ancient truth that the more you take on, the more they ask of you. Appeals to create global conferences and alliances with supernational kopeks sound good on world-scale spaces, but they do not solve our internal problems. Do Not Grieve Over the Exchanges, Lads [Volkov] Kazakhstan is sometimes discussed in terms of a sad principle: Either something good or nothing at all. The decline of the production rates, the shutting down of hundreds of enterprises, and the nonpayments crisis have become typical phenomena. It would not be so bad if behind all this one could see positive tendencies in economic processes. Alas, even the documents the president and prime minister have signed, taking advantage of parliament's absence, give one no confidence that with their implementation our economy will reach any significant heights. Two recent edicts will serve as an example: "On Commodity Exchanges" and "On Measures for Forming Securities." Their adoption clearly shows that the country's leaders today are more interested in the problem of "staking out" as quickly as possible (before the beginning of the work of the Supreme Council) the basic points of their own economic policy than in actually implementing it. There has already been too much discussion of the sad fate of the Kazakhstan stock exchanges, which vanished not only because they were excessively numerous but also because of the fact that they were not included in the government schemes. So many lances, arrows, and other piercing writing implements have been broken over the creation of normal conditions for the formation of the securities market. Since it still does not exist, two legislative acts prepared by the executive power (another paradox of our legal thinking) will come out, and everyone is supposed to think that tomorrow everything will be okay in the corresponding areas of the economy. But in reality little will change as a result of the creation of state organs for questions of markets and securities (and these are the provisions that are the linchpins of these edicts), the more so taking into account the current degree of state influence over the economy. Why do these issues have to be raised again today? Is it really just in order to show that the executive power has its finger on the pulse of the reforms? [Ustyugov] Incidentally, the government commission for developing the concept of the functioning of the securities market in Kazakhstan was created about two years ago and it seems that it has not convened once since then. Russia has adopted hundreds of normative acts aimed at the formation and civilized regulation of this extremely important variable in a market economy. We are just beginning. Well, we can still console ourselves: Better late than never.
