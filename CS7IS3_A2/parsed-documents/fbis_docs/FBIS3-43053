M. Belyakova, A. V. Kornilov, Department of the Regional Geochemistry and Soil Geography, Moscow State University; UDC 502.55(203 574.53)] [Abstract] Metals are released by virtually all of Chimkent's industries: cementmaking, refining, phosphorus processing, asbestos cement construction, thermal electric power generation, etc. The situation is worsened by the city's tendency to develop inversion layers, coupled with low winds and low precipitation levels. The distribution of metals in the lower atmosphere over Chimkent was studied by analyzing the quantity and spatial differentiation of pollution, the daily pattern and dynamics of concentrations of toxins in relation to synoptic-meteorological conditions, and by identifying the sources of pollution. The experimental method of the study is described. Lead was found to be the most hazardous pollutant, with concentrations reaching 25-50 times the maximum permissible concentration during some periods. The lead smelting plant and the coal burning thermal electric plant were found to be key sources of pollutants. Figure 1; table 1; references 6 (Russian).
