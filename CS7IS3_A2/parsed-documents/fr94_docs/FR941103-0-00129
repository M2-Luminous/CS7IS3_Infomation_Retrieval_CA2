FR941103-0-00129 FR941103-0-00017 ADDRESSES: Assistant Director_Refuges and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street NW., MS 670 ARLSQ, Washington, DC 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Duncan L. Brown, Esq. at the above address; Telephone (703) 358&hyph;1744. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 50 CFR part 32 contains provisions governing hunting and fishing on national wildlife refuges. Hunting and fishing are regulated on refuges to (1) ensure compatibility with refuge purposes, (2) properly manage the wildlife resource, (3) protect other refuge values, and (4) ensure refuge user safety. On many refuges, the Service policy of adopting State hunting regulations is adequate in meeting these objectives. On other refuges, it is necessary to supplement State regulations with more restrictive Federal regulations to ensure that the Service meets its management responsibilities, as outlined under the section entitled ``Conformance with Statutory and Regulatory Authorities.'' Refuge-specific hunting and fishing regulations may be issued only after a wildlife refuge is opened to migratory game bird hunting, upland game hunting, big game hunting or sport fishing through publication in the Federal Register . These regulations may list the wildlife species that may be hunted or are subject to sport fishing, seasons, bag limits, methods of hunting or fishing, descriptions of open areas, and other provisions as appropriate. Previously issued refuge-specific regulations for hunting and fishing are contained in 50 CFR part 32. Many of the amendments to these sections are being promulgated to standardize and clarify the existing language of these regulations. Request for Comments A proposed rule was published in the July 20, 1994, issue of the Federal Register (59 FR 37134) and comments from the public were solicited. The only comments received were from the Region 3 Office (Service) to point the omission of ``Kirtland's Warbler Wildlife Management Area'' under the State of Michigan. This unit had been opened to hunting on July 27, 1987, but was inadvertently dropped from the listing of open areas. The administrative change has been made to correct this omission. Statutory Authority The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (NWRSAA) of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16 U.S.C. 460k) govern the administration and public use of national wildlife refuges. Specifically, Section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to permit the use of any area within the Refuge System for any purpose, including but not limited to, hunting, fishing and public recreation, accommodations and access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the major purpose(s) for which the area was established.
