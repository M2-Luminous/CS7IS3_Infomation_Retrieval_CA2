Both the United States and South Korea had expected the North Korea-IAEA talks to proceed smoothly, if not rapidly, because of the hopeful note sounded by the North Korean-U.S. working level-contacts in New York last month. But as the North Korean-IAEA negotiations go nowhere session after session, senior U.S. and South Korean officials are running out of patience and becoming increasingly restless. Reflecting their feelings, perhaps, Washington and Seoul urged Pyongyang in recent days to accept IAEA inspection of its nuclear facilities and warned that time is running out for North Korea. South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday that a decision will be made in two to three weeks by the United States on whether it will hold dialogue with North Korea. Han's remark, made at a public gathering, was seen by many as an indication that the situation has indeed become serious since Han represents the body of opinion that was counseling continued dialogue for a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. The time frame of "two to three weeks" was apparently mentioned with the Feb. 21 IAEA Board of Governors' meeting in mind. The foreign minister must have been aware also of North Korean "dear leader" Kim Chong-il's birthday (Feb. 16) when he made the remark. Han was understood to have hinted that the North Korean nuclear problem has to be brought to the United Nations Security Council unless IAEA inspection is carried out in two to three weeks. Given the time for the IAEA to prepare for inspection, Han appeared to be stressing that North Korea and the IAEA could not keep holding fruitless negotiations for much longer. Many questions are being asked in Vienna, Washington and Seoul as to why the North Korean-IAEA talks were not making any progress, but few clear answers were emerging. Judging by the statements made by responsible officials so far, the main cause for disputes between Pyongyang and the IAEA stems from the fact that the United States and North Korea concluded their working-level contacts without firmly spelling out the type and scope of the IAEA inspection on seven reported North Korean facilities. North Korea is said to be arguing with the IAEA, questioning the connection between the IAEA's demand for an inspection of all seven reported facilities and maintaining continuity for nuclear safeguards. At any rate, no one is sure why North Korea is delaying its agreement with the IAEA as Pyongyang has nothing to gain by its actions. The prevailing opinion among South Korean Government officials is that North Korea is reluctant to agree to the IAEA inspection because of "internal necessity," or because it wants to squeeze more concessions from the United States. Others speculate that North Korea cannot afford to "use up all of its nuclear cards" by accepting IAEA ad hoc and routine inspections before it has managed to obtain a U.S. nod for the establishment of diplomatic ties between Pyongyang and Washington. As for those who advance the theory of "internal necessity," they say North Korea might be taking its time to persuade hardliners, especially the military, to accept outside inspection. By delaying negotiations with the IAEA, they say, Pyongyang probably wants to boast, both at home and abroad, that it did not succumb to foreign pressure and thus was able to obtain U.S. agreements to suspend the Team Spirit military exercise with the South and to hold a third round of high-level talks with Washington for improvement of bilateral relations. Those who argue that North Korea does not want to use its nuclear card believe that Pyongyang is delaying its negotiations with the IAEA in order to wrench from it as many concessions as possible, while leaving unresolved questions for the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. Although South Korean officials watching the developments are running out of patience, they could still be described as being "guardedly optimistic about the outcome of the North Korea-IAEA talks," for they know it is North Korea's style to always push an issue to the brink before making a dramatic turnaround at the last moment.
