Is this concern warranted? [Bekesi] The concern is not unfounded, but it is avoidable. I dare assert this so plainly because we are after the first round of elections, and two parties of the opposition won, both of which are ready to free the economy from an ideological-political domination. If a government coalition composed of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] wants to complete its four-year term, in the present situation of the country it cannot neglect focusing its attention and energy on the economy. One cannot initiate new discussions about the coat of arms and new gestures of retribution and compensation. The crisis must be attended to, the prerequisites for economic growth must be created, the deterioration of the balance must be stopped, and the country must finally be put on a track of modernization. Thus, a socialist-liberal government will be under constraint. In the current situation there is simply no alternative to a pragmatic, ideology-free economic policy. I stress this because I largely agree with Laszlo Csaba that the economic policy of the past year and a half was characterized by distribution. This was an election-year economic policy. The new government must concentrate on creating the prerequisites for income production, and unfortunately, this presupposes a series of decisions which are painful for the entire society. [Varga] Is the establishment of a ministry for economic affairs a necessary prerequisite for preventing the fragmentation and atomization of economic policy? [Bekesi] From the aspect of the issue under discussion I do not consider it crucial. It is more important to create within the government the personal and organizational framework of a unified economic policy. This can happen through the establishment of a ministry, but the coordination is also possible through the person of a deputy prime minister with a strong expertise and sufficient political support, or in the form of an efficiently directed economic cabinet. Of course, a prime minister who is an expert on economic policy can also present a solution. In other words, the main issue is to prevent having several centers of economic policy within the government. [Varga] The country's economic situation would justify having an individual well versed in economic issues at the head of the government. [Bekesi] I agree, but this ought to be discussed during the coalition talks. [Varga] The next source of danger is that the management of the crisis and the protection of jobs puts the protectionist instinct of defense in the foreground. Is this trap unavoidable? [Bekesi] I share Laszlo Csaba's fears, even though in the course of the campaign only parties with extremist, populist agendas were in favor of a protectionist economic policy aiming at an exaggerated protection of the Hungarian market. The MSZP and the SZDSZ excluded protectionist measures from the arsenal of fostering the domestic market. Still, I must add that with the current capability of the Hungarian economy to compete on the international market, it would be suicidal to allow complete freedom to market forces. Incidentally, it is not done in that way anywhere in the world. The frameworks of agreements with the European Union and GATT will provide adequate protection for the Hungarian economy in the critical segments of the market. Namely, the Hungarian Government is entitled to institute measures for the protection of the market up to 10 percent of the country's yearly imports. This possibility must be utilized skillfully. This figure concerns imports to the value of $1-1.2 billion, which is a considerable sum. Thus, in this amount, one may utilize the possibilities afforded by customs, contingents, quotas, and technical specifications. It is a fact that up to now the government did not fully utilize this 10-percent limit of market protection. A new government must do this much and not more. [Varga] In connection with the protection of the nation's land and the peculiar implementation of consumer protection, Laszlo Csaba mentions the dangers inherent in an exaggerated, economically irrational, protection of agriculture. [Bekesi] The strategic purpose of economic policy must be to restore, and establish the competitiveness of, agriculture and food industry. That is to say, the improvement of the position of the agricultural-food industry complex is a stabilizing factor for the economy and is one of the prerequisites for economic growth. I am convinced that within a short time, with relatively little investment, the greatest growth of productivity might be achieved in this branch of the economy. As far as the ownership of land is concerned, in the short run it is unavoidable to exclude foreign capital, but in the long run it would be a mistake. In other words, it is only justified to forbid foreign ownership of land until a market for land and realistic land prices are established. However, within a foreseeable time period the land market will begin to grow, because the estates which were formed are so small that they do not allow competitive farming. In other words, under pressure, we will soon witness the beginning of a concentration process. As a result, realistic market prices for land will be established. At that time, the prohibition of land ownership by foreigners must be abolished. As far as agrarian subsidies are concerned, the 30-40 percent level which has been established in Europe is an unrealistic goal for us. In Hungary the subsidy is currently 7-8 percent. This also plays a role in the huge decline in production. It is without precedent that in our exports we were unable to fulfill the contingent allowed by the European Union. In my opinion, in the course of four years the level of subsidy can be doubled, i.e., it can be increased to 15 percent. This will mean 120 billion forints [Ft] a year, compared to the current Ft60-70 billion. [Varga] Is this a straight subsidy? [Bekesi] Not at all. I am thinking primarily of preferential interest rates for agricultural investments, procurement intervention by the state to restore a minimal level of production security, procurement guarantees, and the introduction of guaranteed procurement prices in the area of basic produce. The latter would not be the market price, rather a minimal price. Thus, one must anticipate the increase of producers' prices. And in the case of some articles--when our export interests require--we must provide subsidies. It is a fact that these measures will create inflationary pressure. [Varga] Laszlo Csaba wrote that a financial system was created, the viability of which depended on the goodwill of the central power and not on its effectiveness on the market. How can this situation be changed? [Bekesi] My answer in one sentence: by privatizing banks as soon as possible, by concurrently increasing their capital. [Varga] Can you already name some measures to be introduced during the new government's "honeymoon"? [Bekesi] The future coalition government should focus its energies on the implementation of two goals: The first one is the creation of the prerequisites for growth, and the second one is an increase in employment. There are, however, two difficult challenges before the realization of these two goals: One is the balance, or rather, the lack of balance, between internal and external finances, and the other one is the danger of hyperinflation. In other words, the aforementioned goals must be realized by maneuvering between these two challenges, while at the same time preserving social harmony. The most urgent task is to stop the dramatic deterioration of the external and internal economic balance. If this does not take place, the country's financial security will be endangered in 1995. Urgent measures must be taken to stop the decrease of exports. To achieve this goal, the principle of neutrality must be exercised in exchange rate policy, i.e., we must avoid reacting too late to a revaluation of the forint; decided steps must be taken to recapture eastern markets; export-oriented projects must be supported within the framework of the tax system. Overspending by the state must be restrained. The increase of the budget deficit in relation to the GDP must be stopped. It is important to have at least as much in domestic savings to finance the debt in order to offset the consolidated deficit. Today, the gap between domestic savings and the deficit is approximately Ft100 billion. In 1995 this will be untenable. If the GDP cannot be increased in 1995, the expenses of the budget must be reduced. A "cut" of Ft50 billion must already be made in the supplementary budget to be prepared in 1994. [Varga] The situation would certainly be alleviated if the privatization of large state-owned firms, such as the Hungarian Telecommunications Enterprise [Matav] and the Hungarian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation [Mol], continued in a more determined fashion. [Bekesi] I agree with you, but this continuation should take place in the framework of a new privatization strategy, namely, a privatization method involving the increase of capital must be implemented. [Varga] You stressed several times, and this time as well, the importance of returning to the eastern markets. How realistic is this return for us? [Bekesi] As a strategy, based on the natural order of the international division of labor, the return is unavoidable. This is hardly disputed by now. What can be disputed is what can be achieved and how, and whether today or tomorrow. On the markets in question there is great demand, but their financial situation is bad. In other words, beyond conventional trade methods we must exploit the possibilities of barter, such as raw materials for food. Furthermore, it is in our strategic interests to participate in the privatization of these countries. We must acquire property; considerable capacities and property can be acquired very cheaply nowadays. For instance, in return for export goods, for as yet not expended Hungarian credit balances, or in the framework of joint ownership. [Varga] Foreign capital was not pleased that the government abolished the system of normative preferences and awarded state preferences in connection with the investment of foreign capital on the basis of individual agreements. Do you think change is warranted? [Bekesi] By all means. The MSZP is determined to restore the system of normative preferences for foreign and Hungarian investors. The retention of the right to make individual decisions by the government would only maintain an atmosphere of suspicion and the possibility of abuse. [Varga] You said in a recent interview that genuine economic measures can only take place in September. Is this acceptable in the current economic situation? [Bekesi] I uphold my opinion that genuine economic measures can take place in September at the earliest. Namely, the new government can be formed at the beginning of July. The announcement of the government's program can occur at the earliest at the end of July; in August, bills can be prepared which the government can submit to parliament in September. On the other hand, urgent decisions cannot be postponed until September. For instance, the Hungarian National Bank [MNB] can make monetary decisions concerning the balance of payments. Adjustments in the exchange rate can take place any time, based on an authorization by the government. A huge amount of state bonds are stored in the safes of the central bank which could be, or should be, used as a means of restricting liquidity. If it is advisable, the central bank can raise the prime rate. Furthermore, after the end of June, the coalition partners can ask the acting government to make justified and urgent economic decisions. For instance, to freeze spending budget reserves, suspend subsidies to decentralized funds beyond the prorated amount, and stop injurious privatization measures, such as the KRP [expansion unknown]. [Varga] Finally, I return to Laszlo Csaba, who pointed out the dangers inherent in the trilateral arbitration mechanism. However, both the MSZP and the SZDSZ intend to construct such a social mechanism. Are you not afraid that this would slow down economic decision-making and diminish the economy's ability to adjust? [Bekesi] In Hungary's current situation, in the given political-economic situation, when crisis management is necessary, when a series of unpopular measures must be instituted, when a policy of savings and investment stimulation must be conducted, and not a policy of distribution, an argumentation of economic rationalism can hardly suffice to convince society of the necessity of these measures. However, social harmony is indispensable for the implementation of such a program. If it cannot be protected, the Polish effect comes into action. Here, under the current circumstances, the prerequisites for preserving social harmony can only be established within the framework of a system of arbitration. It is to be expected that the three partners participating in the arbitration -- the employees, the employers, and the state -- will not put an emphasis on distribution, and will not fight about who should receive a relatively larger slice of the shrinking cake, but rather endeavor to make the cake as large as possible. The state must lead the way in self-restraint, but the other two partners can also be expected to exhibit similar behavior, especially in the first period of the government cycle. Thus, the coalition must from time to time persuade its two social partners. I think in the beginning this will be very difficult, because it requires self-restraint from the participants. I don't deny that I am expecting big discussions and fights, but I am convinced that with a social-liberal coalition, there is a chance for agreement.
