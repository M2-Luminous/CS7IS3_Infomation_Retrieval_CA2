Carter said that he had met with President Clinton last week and that the President told him that he plans to nominate, to the Panamanian Government and the U.S. Senate, Pastor as the new U.S. ambassador to Panama. Civilist sectors in Panama are against Pastor's appointment as the new ambassador. They claim the statesman associated with the U.S. Democratic Party maintained close ties with the former Panamanian military regime that was overthrown by the U.S. invasion on 20 December 1989. Carter added that when he met with President Guillermo Endara last week Endara said he was pleased by Pastor's nomination. If President Clinton's proposal is confirmed, Pastor will occupy the post of U.S. ambassador in Panama left vacant by former Ambassador Deane Hinton in February.
