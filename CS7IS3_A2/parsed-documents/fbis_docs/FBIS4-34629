He said this is a basic priority for success if he wins the elections scheduled for November. These were the initial political remarks by the presidential candidate who represents two important National Party factions (the Herreraist-Wilsonist Sector and the National Proposal) following his resignation as UTE [General Administration of State Electric Power and Telephones] president. The Herreraist-Wilsonist faction candidate wants the National Party to have a single candidate for the post of Montevideo mayor. Among his proposals, Volonte mentioned priorities like managing the country like a large enterprise, keeping the current macroeconomic policy, assigning priority to the Mercosur [Common Market of the South], pushing ahead with area policies, and promoting a broad social agreement similar to the one implemented during his tenure at UTE, which yielded very good results. Dr. Volonte added that he will promote a meeting with other National Party candidates for the presidency of the Republic (Pereyra, Ramirez, and Aguirre). He admitted that Dr. Juan Andres Rodriguez is a "great candidate" who "will honor his nomination" because he is "an exemplary National Party member." It was not easy to talk with Alberto Volonte yesterday. He was surrounded by a great number of friends and officials who worked with him at UTE and who went to his office to express their appreciation for what they consider a "brilliant administration." Volonte quickly replied that he could not have succeeded had it not been by his "team." He said he had great affection for UTE and its people. It is very difficult to leave," he added. Volonte said his campaign began yesterday with a "great meeting with his family," his wife, and his four children." Asked about his personal opinion of an eventual single candidacy for Montevideo's city hall, Volonte said he was "a fervent supporter of the idea" but made it clear that we should give priority to "proposals" in the social area. Volonte added that he did not fear multiple candidacies. Reiterating a constant opinion during his administration, Volonte stressed that Juan Andres Ramirez was "a great candidate" who "will honor his designation" because he is "an exemplary Blanco Party follower." Asked about his opinion on surveys, Volonte stressed the professional work of survey companies and surveyors. He said he took them as a "reference" adding that he did not feel he was a survey "slave" and that he did not worry about surveys or how he fared in them. He emphasized that the greatest survey "will be conducted on the last Sunday in November [election day]." Asked if he would introduce changes in current economic policies, Volonte without hesitation said that he agreed with current macroeconomic policies oriented towards Mercosur. He added that these policies were supported by all political parties -- unlike any previous economic policy. Volonte added he would only to change the emphasis on some aspects, that he would like to emphasize social programs such as education, health, and public security." Reporters questions forced Volonte to compare his administration at UTE with an eventual administration as president of the country. "Countries are large enterprises in today's world. Uruguay is an enterprise full of illusions, an enterprise moved by our entire society. We believe the country can become a great enterprise. I think we can use the experience of a great enterprise like UTE on a national scale." Volonte mentioned the need to promote a great social pact, perhaps with characteristics like the pact promoted by his administration at UTE. "I have no doubt that there must be an agreement between those responsible for production and those in leadership positions. At UTE, we had more than a pact; we had a 24-month agreement that established labor relation rules on the way to improve workers' salaries through productivity. I think the formula can be applied to the entire state apparatus to obtain better salaries, and thus achieve agreement and understanding among all Uruguayans." The former UTE director does not agree with remarks by some political and social quarters that his group lacks the support of a technical apparatus. He said those remarks were incorrect because the "apparatus and the organization are the people. The willingness is derived from the people. Uruguayans have an opinion and can distinguish very well. No one has to be led by the hand to vote.... The presidential candidate said: If elected president on 27 November, he will try first to reach an agreement with his party and then with other political parties. He said he would thus define his cabinet and form a great team. He said he will discuss with other leaders -- those now in government and others -- if they will be part of the team. The team will be formed following an agreement and discussions with other parties," Volonte said. Volonte told EL PAIS that his first steps in the political arena will be to meet with the other National Party candidates, that is, with Senator Carlos Julio Pereyra, Senator Juan A. Ramirez, and Gonzalo Aguirre.
