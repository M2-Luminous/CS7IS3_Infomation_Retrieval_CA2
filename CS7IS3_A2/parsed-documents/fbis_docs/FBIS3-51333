Vargas begins the program by reminding the president that it is traditional for the executive to give every new year a name. Fujimori says he does not think the year should be given the name of a historical figure but that it should reflect the country's goals and objectives. He remarks: "I think that in the short and medium term, our children must be better prepared; therefore, education and sports are the main themes of the year. Although this has not been approved by the Council of Ministers, I would like to go ahead and call it the Year of Education Modernization and Sports. We will continue this campaign to modernize our education system and to sponsor sports. For example, we will build coliseums and stadiums nationwide" Vargas goes on to say that because 1994 will be the year of education modernization, it is understood that the main reforms will be in that field. Vargas notes: "It has been said that the directors of state schools will be rigorously evaluated. Those who are good will remain, those who are not prepared will be dismissed." President Fujimori responds that the evaluations do not mean that the directors will have to take exams but that they will have to show results. Fujimori comments that this evaluation will give the directors stability for five years, but appointments cannot be indefinite as if the directors were judges. Fujimori notes that although the community will be in charge of the school administration, that does not translate into privatization of education because the state will continue to provide funding. Bauer asks when the first school will be turned over to local administration. Fujimori replies that the pilot plan will be implemented in Arequipa, where a chain of eight schools have already been built with 10 more to be completed. "The state will not eliminate subsidies. On the contrary, it will increase these subsidies." Fujimori adds that free education will now be offered in modern buildings rather than in straw huts. Changing the subject, Bauer asks President Fujimori for his assessment of the continued violence following the arrest of Abimael Guzman. Fujimori responds that it is a fact that the level of violence has gone down. "Shining Path no longer has its previous organizational capacity." Fujimori notes that there are still some fanatics whom he intends to capture or eliminate. Bauer asks if there is any truth to rumors that the government is exporting repentant terrorists to other nations with new identities. Fujimori laughs and responds: "Well, concerning trade in terrorists, I would say that we have had imports rather than exports from some developed nations, which in turn have protected those people." Fujimori adds that there have been more cases of repentant terrorist and that these have been presented to the media. Vargas asks if terrorist leaders will receive death sentences now that the new Constitution is in force. Fujimori answers that such sentences must be in line with international treaties and follow certain steps. "In the coming years, I do not think it will be necessary to apply the death sentence because I am sure we will achieve peace in the nation." Commenting on human rights, President Fujimori insists that it is necessary to defend the human rights not only of terrorists but of civilians, the human and social rights Peru's 22 million inhabitants. He concludes that Peru is entitled to live in peace, to give life sentences to terrorists, and to correct its mistakes. In response to a question from Augusto Alvarez concerning the scope of the concerted effort proposed by Democratic Constituent Congress, CCD, President Jaime Yoshiyama, Fujimori says that "consensus comes through proposals. Yoshiyama's proposal purports to resolve the country's problems through truly technical rather than political mechanisms or methodology." Fujimori said the invitation extended by Engineer Yoshiyama to various organizations has been very timely because those organizations will be able to set forth proposals free of partisan and ideological influence and will therefore be more widely accepted by the people. Having been put in contact with several Latin American reporters via satellite, President Fujimori takes a question from Eduardo Lozano of Colombia's Radio Cadena Nacional. Lozano asks President Fujimori what qualities the Peruvian people see in Colombian President Cesar Gaviria to make him worthy of being OAS secretary general, to which Fujimori responds: "I have seen President Cesar Gaviria in action at various international forums, where he has proven himself to be a true statesman with a spirit of integration. He has also displayed the ability to analyze situations and make decisions, an attribute which I believe is necessary for the secretaryship. Moreover, I am a personal friend of President Gaviria, and he has Peru's total support. We are among his promoters." The topic of the interview changes when Elsy Barroeta from Caracas Radio Caracas Television Network asks President Fujimori about the presence in Peru of the Venezuelan coupist military officers and the efforts made by the two governments to achieve the officers' return to Venezuela. Fujimori responds that there have been contacts at the Foreign Ministry level, but Venezuela wants to prosecute these officers, so some of them are unwilling to return under those conditions. Barroeta then asks Fujimori what kind of relations he expects between Peru and Venezuela after Rafael Caldera takes office and what personal relations between he and Caldera will be like. Fujimori says: "I do not have the slightest doubt that we will continue to strengthen the ties between our two countries and that we will continue working to make integration a reality. I have already spoken personally with President Caldera, he said, and I wish him the greatest success in office so Venezuela can progress." Jorge Melo of Radio Quito then asks president Fujimori whether the visit Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen will make to Peru is official and if the border conflict will be included in the agenda. Fujimori responds: "Of course his visit is official, as was my first visit to Quito, of which I have very fond memories. Every time someone mentions Quito to me, I become emotional. However, this visit is to strengthen the friendship between our two countries. Instead of discussing border conflicts, we will discuss integration as we did during my first visit to Ecuador in January 1992." Program host Dennis Vargas then brings up the issue of expectation among Latin Americans, especially in the Andean region, concerning Peru's exact position on integration and the Cartagena Agreement. Why has Peru decided to distance itself from integration until March or April? Fujimori responds with two reasons, the first of which is tariffs. Peru, he says, has a flat [previous word in English] 15-percent tariff on consumer or capital goods, while other countries' tariffs vary from 0 to 30 percent, which undermines Peru's competitiveness. The other reason is subsidies, which have been eliminated in Peru. Vargas insists on the issue, saying that integration is happening through blocs and that Peru is absent from Latin America's first integration bloc, the Cartagena Agreement. He asks President Fujimori: Do you agree with people who say it is impossible to enter the big NAFTA market without being in a group, which even the U.S. Government has admitted? What policy will Peru adopt on NAFTA? President Fujimori answers that at some point Peru will have to rejoin the Cartagena Agreement. He says that for the past three years the country has developed very rapidly in order to be able to join other markets by creating competition through the reduction of protectionist measures. We are working, Fujimori said, for an open economy, which is essential if we are to join any free market. The host concludes Peru's participation in the satellite linkup with a question concerning the struggle against drug trafficking in Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia. He asks President Fujimori what Peru's strategy will be with the new administration in the United States, which consumes almost 80 percent of the drugs produced worldwide, to which Fujimori responds: "I think we must continue communicating on realistic terms, which is what the Peruvian Government has always done, and we must acknowledge that the previous strategy did not work, that it was a true failure, and that effective measures must be adopted before it is too late." Fujimori goes on to explain that Peru produces coca, not heroin, and that the government will implement very drastic measures whereby penal and civil sanctions will be imposed on individuals who produce poppies. These measures will include the seizure of properties and prison sentences, and there will be no lenience whatsoever. Dennis Vargas Marin asks President Fujimori to comment on the situation in Chiapas State, Mexico and whether he believes there is any connection between the Zapatista National Liberation Army, EZLN, and the Shinning Path or other guerrilla groups. Fujimori then says he hopes there is no ideological relationship between the EZLN rebels and terrorist groups, even though it is known that some Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement terrorists have gone to Mexico. Fujimori says he thinks the Chiapas affair is "a rebellion in a poor area headed by -- I suppose -- leftist intellectuals, socialists, who mean to say: You see, the market system does not work. It is something like that. However, I do not believe a rebellion like the one in Chiapas State has the characteristics of a terrorist movement." Augusto Alvarez Rodrich then asks President Fujimori about the lessons learned from the referendum on the constitutional reforms. Fujimori answers that he has received a message. The message is that the people are not against the reform but that they want adjustments to those reforms. Alvarez then asks the president if he believes the referendum results mean that he no longer represents the spirit of renewal that the people want. Fujimori replies that there has indeed been a rebellion of the citizenry and society at the ballot boxes, but that he "still represents the rebellion against the political system that has taken place here in Peru." He adds that the desire for renewal continues, but that the government has not been weakened. He states: "It had been said that the honeymoon was only going to last nine months or a year. Instead, there is popular support. All modesty aside, I think I continue to represent this need for change in the country." Alvarez asks whether the visits to the departments and provinces are part of a strategy to drum up support after the referendum. Fujimori answers that it is only a continuation of his original policy and that he is trying to provide the people with more information on educational and government programs "to disprove the disinformation that the government is privatizing education, eliminating free schooling, and taking land away from the peasants." In response to several short comments and questions from Alvarez, Fujimori compares the country's situation in 1992 to that in 1993 and points out the improvements and advances in the economy, the pacification process, and the privatization process. Regarding the privatization process, he says that State enterprises are now worth 10 times more than what they were worth in 1992. Arturo Salazar Larrain asks whether the situation for Peruvians will improve and if people's budgets are in the red even though the fiscal year has ended with a positive balance. He says that taxes are going up while salaries have stagnated. Salazar adds that it is not fair that the budget for defense is five times greater than the health budget. Fujimori responds by saying that taxes for the poor have gone down. He says that except for one socioeconomic level, everyone is paying a little less. The president cites the elimination of the tax on business assets and says he hopes this measure will bolster economic reactivation. He then adds that the government has also eliminated the minimum income tax. Salazar says the national budget increased enormously between 1991 and 1993. It was $3.617 billion in 1991, $4.885 billion in 1992, to $5.434 billion in 1993. He then asks: How are those resources distributed and where do they come from? President Fujimori answers: "Right now they are coming from people who pay high taxes, and that is precisely what allows us to provide greater social attention. I agree with you that fiscal funds are in the black and the majority of people's pockets are in the red. But that is the part we are still inheriting. We are fixing many things. I ask: Is there an alternative? I wish the economists would give me alternatives. Tell me there was a better alternative to the dealings with the Paris Club. If they would give me the numbers, I could debate it even though I am not an economist. Things are being handled very seriously. Our country was in a crisis with hyperinflation, but we are overcoming the situation." Regarding a comment from Salazar on the difference between the budgets for health and defense, Fujimori goes on to outline the changes in the military budget that will be in accordance with the advances in the pacification, saying that the number of troops and policemen will not be increased. Ismael Leon tries to pin Fujimori down on the poor referendum results by suggesting that he, Fujimori, should not try to explain it by saying that "50 percent of the people have been deceived." Leon says the president should look at it from a different point of view: "There is unemployment, health care problems, school truancy, and in many ways, there is less democracy." Leon says that when Fujimori speaks of "taking resources to the regions," he is speaking in paternalistic terms. Leon asks what has been done with the funds earned from the sale of public enterprises. He says he has a letter from Constituent Assemblyman Dr. Antero Flores Araoz, who was unable to obtain that information from the government. Fujimori asks Dennis Vargas for a 30-minute program to debate each of Leon's points, then he reminds Alvarez of the fact that the media is respected and allowed full freedom. In reply to Leon, Fujimori says that in many provinces he visited, there were widespread misconceptions about what the referendum really meant, including the belief that capital punishment would bring about a bloodbath. The president justifies taking resources to the area and used improvements to the Cuzco airport as an example. He says that a Korean credit has allowed eight tourists flights a day. "Public enterprises have been sold under the best conditions, and I challenge anyone to identify one that has not been properly sold." Fujimori tells Leon to examine the public budget to see where the money has gone. He says: "Look at the social expenditures, go to the poor neighborhoods where the privatization funds have been invested." He adds that there is a list specifying how the funds have been invested. Alvarez goes directly to the point and asks: "Why not admit there is a problem. I do not think the funds are being improperly used." He says that if Fujimori gave a better explanation of how the funds were used, there would be greater acceptance. Fujimori answers by saying that he is surprised that an economist of Alvarez' stature is apparently unaware that all revenues go into a common treasury fund, thus individual government projects cannot be attributed to specific sales of government enterprises. Ismael Leon asks Fujimori what made him change his mind, albeit for the better, on such things as his initial refusal to privatize certain basic public services, including ports, postal services, and telecommunications. Fujimori half jokingly refers to a book called CITIZEN FUJIMORI [Ciudadano Fujimori], which describes him as pragmatic. He admits that he rejected such privatization on 3 June 1990, and by 6 July 1992 he had changed his mind. Fujimori recalls saying that "public enterprises do not work -- probably on Radio Programas -- and that they have incurred a $2.5 billion deficit" despite the fact that "every possible effort was made to prop them up." He adds: "We are looking for democracy. People want privatization, thus the change. We need not be stubborn." Replying to Ismael Leon's question on telecommunication monopolies, Fujimori says that this is sometimes unavoidable in communications and electric enterprises and adds that the telephone system should serve not only Lima and the surrounding area but the entire country. Fujimori adds: "I know that Mr. Genaro Delgado Parker has interests in communications systems, but I do not defend anyone's interest. I want things to be clear." The topic continues with a discussion about the lack of telephone lines, with Lima alone requiring 160,000 new lines and needing large investments. Fujimori adds: "We have 2.6 telephones for every 100 inhabitants. Do you know how we rank among Latin American countries? Next to the last; the last country is Haiti." Fujimori suggests to Dennis Vargas that a technical debate be held on this topic alone. The topic then shifts when Vargas asks Fujimori if there will be a reduction in the Army and if the Army Technical School will close. Fujimori denies that the school will be closed and says defense and education expenditures will remain the same with no reductions except "a minimum reduction in recruitment." Fujimori says there will be training changes for the new recruits and uses the "example that those learning to operate tanks will now know how to operate heavy equipment. Those who drive trucks will leave the service with a certificate for commercial trucks." Fujimori explains that the new Armed Forces for peace should become "a great professional technical training center in addition to instilling patriotism, order, and discipline in many youths who need it." Fujimori adds that he "does not intend to purchase Mirage fighter jets, tanks, or missiles. It is a reduction and rationalization of expenditures." Fujimori explains that expenditures are being cut and made more economical. He notes that Peru "has approximately 100,000 policemen. That is enough. Better yet, it is too many for Peru." The president reports that there will be no more police recruiting. A panelist asks Fujimori about unjustified arrests, and he replies that government attorneys are investigating such cases but that everyone must be patient. He admits: "There are some cases that have yet to be corrected, but sometimes mistakes are made in the struggle against terrorism. I ask you: What country has not make any mistakes? Tell me if no mistakes were made in Vietnam, Algeria, and in many other places." He states: "We cannot let isolated cases make us forget the situation that existed in Peru." Referring to the remodeled Castro Castro Prison, Fujimori says it looks like a five-star hotel: "We are enforcing respect for human rights as much as we can." Asked about communications with Abimael Guzman, Fujimori explains: "Contacts continue. Of course in recent days we have said that there have been attacks and that there should be some control mechanisms. Otherwise the entire process could lead to stagnation. I hope we are successful." One panelist asks Fujimori why he shook hands with Cox Beuzeville and not the other alleged criminals. The Peruvian president explains: "I cannot shake hands with 3,000 terrorists. I greeted him because we happened to meet, and courtesy is always foremost. In the case of Guzman's letter, there have been notable effects. The desertions in Sol de Oro, Ayacucho, occurred because of the information about the surrender of Abimael Guzman. There have been mass desertions like never before. In the past, only one or two isolated Shining Path members deserted. There were always many desertions from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, but the Shining Path desertions began with these letters." Fujimori later explains that he is president of all Peruvians and is therefore uninterested in party organizations. "Parties have not worked out in many Latin American countries, and that is why democracy is being questioned and why some want more Chinese [Fujimori calls himself El Chino, the Chinese] in Latin American countries." A panelist asks: "How can a president feel safe without a political party supporting him. Do you only trust the people and the Army?" Fujimori explains: "I feel safe with results, with the support of the common people, but I defend myself from power groups that try to undermine my position. Democracy is built with the people, by supporting the people. Democracy is not edible. Please visit Pamplona and ask the people there about democracy. Alvarez tells Fujimori that he is going to close the interview with a personal question. He tells Fujimori that he was aggressive throughout the interview and that he has aged. Alvarez then asks: "How have these four years changed you? Tell me!" Fujimori laughs and retorts: "I will answer you. I said earlier that old people are meeting here. If you look at yourself in the mirror, you will find that you also have changed in the past three years, Alvarez, and your criticism has failed quite often. I regret that I was aggressive. I had not realized that. I wanted to engage in a specific debate. When somebody tells me that things are not functioning in the Armed Forces -- I suppose this is where I am aggressive -- I could jump all the way to the roof. If there had not been a television camera here, I could have pounded on...[pauses] not on Dennis but on the table!" Vargas closes the interview by asking: "When will you begin your 1995 campaign, Mr. President, and how long before then do you plan to resign from the presidency so Congress President Jaime Yoshiyama can replace you in the government palace?" Fujimori responds: "I don't know. I haven't thought about it. I don't have an answer now. Invite me to another program."
