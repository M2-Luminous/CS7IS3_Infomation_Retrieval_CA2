As time goes by frustration and despondency grow ever deeper, 'Abbas observed. In remarks published in Manama today, he said the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord must be based on clear guidelines rather than on theory. He blamed the delay in implementing the agreement on all kinds of details raised by Israel. Such tactics, he said, call the final results into question. He indicated that once agreement is reached on the broad outlines, it will be easy to tackle problems on the ground. Asked about Israel's position on the Palestinian state, Abu-Mazin said the Palestinian state is a certainty. He called on Israel to honor the 13 April deadline for Israel's pullout from Gaza and Jericho. Unless the deadline is met, the Palestinian-Israeli agreement is likely to come to nothing, he stressed.
