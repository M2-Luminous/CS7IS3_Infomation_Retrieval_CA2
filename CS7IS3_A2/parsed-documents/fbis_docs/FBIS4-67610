Due to this, urgent measures must be taken to prevent the system from collapsing, Health Minister Tibor Sagat tells the independent NARODNA OBRODA. First of all, supplies of medicaments cannot be halted, says Sagat. The government has provided the National Insurance Fund with a half-a-billion crown "injection," while additional money is expected by the end of April, he adds. Moravcik's cabinet will try again to settle last year's debt of the health facilities. However, previous techniques of comprehensive repayment only demoralized the management, Sagat says. That is why it is necessary to apply a differentiating approach regarding repayment of debts, while Sagat himself he is about to establish the criteria in person in cooperation with the Association of Hospitals, he adds.
