It should, however, be the responsibility of the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] chief of staff "to make sure that there is no disunity in the armed forces," he said. In a press conference in Romblon, the president said: "I do believe that because of the efforts being done by the government and the cooperative response of many of the members of the so-called RAM [Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan -- Nationalist Revolutionary Movement], this disunity need not be considered as a threat to the stability of the country because that is to me, now of much smaller proportions." But, the president said, "It (factionalism) remains a challenge to the leadership of the Armed Forces to overcome, if indeed it exists." The president's statements appear to be a light admonition to General Lisandro Abadia, AFP chief of staff, who said Friday that factionalism still haunts the armed forces as he disclosed that the military rebels are still making the rounds of military camps.
