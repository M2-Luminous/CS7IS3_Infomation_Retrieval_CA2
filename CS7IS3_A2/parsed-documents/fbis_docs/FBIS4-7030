It was co-sponsored by the Alliance of South Koreans in Japan for Democracy and Unification, the South Korean Youth League in Japan and the Democratic Association of South Korean Women in Japan. The resolution adopted at the meeting urges the United States to give up the scheme to resume the "Team Spirit" military exercises and stop deploying Patriot missiles and other weapons of mass destruction in South Korea under the pretext of the "nuclear issue" and hold the third round of talks with North Korea at an early date and resolve all the outstanding problems between the two countries in a peaceful way in a package deal. It demands that the Kim Yong-sam regime renounce the policy of confrontation with the North and dependence on foreign forces and choose the road of national reconciliation and reunification by maintaining independence and that the Japanese Government seek a negotiated solution to the "nuclear issue," instead of following the U.S. war policy.
