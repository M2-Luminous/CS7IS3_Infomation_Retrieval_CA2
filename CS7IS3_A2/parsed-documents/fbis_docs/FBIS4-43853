That is unfortunate for Turkey.... Arguments should not be based on the wealth of the prime minister, who makes important decisions for the country. The people must trust Ciller, who has called on them to make sacrifices. However, the existing realities make that impossible. The Ciller family owns a shopping center with 30 shops in the United States. That center has 24 donums of empty land near it. She also owns a 120-room hotel, an 18-unit apartment building, and a four-bedroom house... Some time ago Ciller described the United States as her "second homeland." If the reports on the property she owns in that country are true, then the people will believe that the United States is her first homeland. How can the people rally around such a leader? Ciller has not channeled her savings into her own country. However, she has urged the citizens to trust her. How can people do so? Will foreign investors not ask her why she has urged them to invest in Turkey when she has made investments in the United States? Will the local investors not ask her why she has urged them to invest in southeastern Turkey when she has made investments in the United States? Disclosing the source of its wealth is not the Ciller family's only obligation. It also has to transfer its assets to Turkey. It has to join its fate with that of the people it rules. Otherwise, it is impossible to be a prime minister .
