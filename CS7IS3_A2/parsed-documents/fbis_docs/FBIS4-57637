The DAS director was taken off guard by three letters from Amnesty International representatives in France, Great Britain, and Switzerland. The letters, which arrived simultaneously, accused the DAS of planning a number of selective murders of UP members and of eliminating and murdering people who have been detained. DAS Director Fernando Britto Ruiz categorically denied this is an institutional policy and added that there is not the slightest chance it could occur. Britto announced that he will sue Amnesty International for making baseless accusations against the DAS. [Begin Britto recording] I don't think an organization of this kind should make baseless accusations. They are obligated to justify their charges and must be held accountable for them. [end recording] Britto said the UP members who Amnesty International said were going to be murdered by the DAS are actually under DAS protection and are in good health.
