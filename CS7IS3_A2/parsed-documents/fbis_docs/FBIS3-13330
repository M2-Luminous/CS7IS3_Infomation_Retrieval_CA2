The implications and inferences of this one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment are many. The waiver, reported to be urged by some sections of the Clinton Administration, and this demonstration of sympathy for Pakistan is fraught with far-reaching implications for the stability and security of the Indian subcontinent. According to one estimate, a waiver now would result in Pakistan acquiring modern weapons and surveillance platforms almost immediately. The more notable include the F-16 fighter aircraft and the P-3C Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft. The Pakistani Air Force already has about 35 F-16's in its inventory, and if the Pressler Amendment was to be waived, the strength of the F-16's would go up three-fold. In like fashion, the induction of the versatile Orion, which is Harpoon-capable, will be extremely destabilizing from India's perspective. In short, Pakistan will be able to receive modern lethal weapons for all its three armed forces by a way of high-tech helicopter gunships, fighter and reconnaissance aircraft, and guided missile frigates. The impact such an induction would have on Indian defense policy and plans needs little reiteration, more so when the recent Indian budget revealed that this year's defense allocation has actually declined by about 10 crore rupees in real term since last year. But more than the conventional weaponry and hardware, what could be rather disturbing if the waiver is pushed through is the interference and impact on the nuclear question and the sponsorship of terrorism. The United States would in effect be endorsing Pakistan's clandestine nuclear weapon program, and India apart, the impact in the rest of the region -- including Iran and Central Asia -- would be significant. Secondly, the United States either deliberately or unwittingly may be turning a blind eye to Pakistan's active role in state-sponsored terrorism -- a fact that was clearly brought to the attention of the global community in the recent deliberations in Geneva. The last but far from the least important inference would be the nature of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship in the post-Cold War period. In according this one-time waiver, which Senator Larry Pressler had been constrained to unequivocally caution against, the Clinton Administration may be signalling a specific military-security role for Pakistan in the larger U.S. gameplan. Such a development, were it to fructify, would indeed have an impact on the political-military contours of the entire region.
