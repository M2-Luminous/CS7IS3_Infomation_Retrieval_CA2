The countries would establish a 12 percent common external tariff, which would become effective in the year 2001, on investment goods, software, and hardware. The agreement between Argentina and Brazil, after frantic bilateral negotiations, would result in the implementation of customs duties on the aforementioned products, something Uruguay and Paraguay would accept during the meetings that will take place in Montevideo this week. The controversy between Argentina and Brazil stemmed from their different stances, both on when the common external tariff should take effect and on the tariff level. Brazil did not want investment goods, software, and hardware included in the customs union for five years and wanted to be protected by a 35 percent tariff. Argentina, on its side, contended that these products had to enter Mercosur countries duty-free and that this provision had to be enforced immediately. The possible agreement would give Mercosur member countries some leeway to negotiate a zero common external tariff until 2001. Furthermore, it would entail an increase in tariffs for agroindustrial machinery, industrial equipment, hardware, and software for Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.
