The U.S. President was the first foreign visitor, and Bonn will be the first destination -- Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has entered the foreign-political scene. Bill Clinton praised Berlusconi's cabinet last week for its "diligence," as a French newspaper wrote. He said he was deeply impressed by the new government's democratic commitment; however, the people had to be judged by their deeds. What attitude will or should Chancellor Helmut Kohl show when Berlusconi comes to Bonn next week -- shortly after the member states of the European Union [EU], which was founded against the furies of the past, have elected their new parliament? Should he drown any reservations by giving him confidence in advance, or should he show a certain critical distance? Bonn does not seem to be happy about the privilege of the first visit from Rome. The Germans with their dual past are certainly in a doubly difficult situation regarding their former partner of the Axis in accursed times. They should not come under suspicion of fraternizing with the fascists, nor should they try to play a patronizing role, for which they are not qualified anyway. Other Europeans have already raised their voices. President Francois Mitterrand said warningly: "Careful, danger!" EU Commission President Jacques Delors called for "concerned vigilance." The European Parliament reminded the Italian president of the basic values, which "after the atrocities of fascism and Nazism marked the founding of the European Community." We have indeed every reason to be vigilant if a neofascist European candidate in Italy talks about "concentration camps" to be set up for homosexuals; if the chairman of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee says that border treaties with neighbors should be revised; if Gianfranco Fini, the chairman of the extreme right-wing Alleanza Nazionale, one of the three coalition parties, calls the dictator Mussolini the greatest statesman of all times, at least of this century. Should we look away, or should we interfere? The EU is more than a loose club of sovereign states -- it sees itself as a community sharing equal values and has bound itself to respect certain human and basic rights. Whenever this human peace code is undermined, interference is necessary. The new democracies in East Europe come from dictatorships, are seeking to join the European Community, and -- with or without postcommunists -- may not have reached the goal in every respect, but the tendency is right. Italy is one of the founding members of the European Community, but if postfascists and ultrarightists assume power, the tendency is not right anymore; there are five [fascist] ministers in Rome and watchdogs in all the other ministries. Bonn should also take Rome at its word now -- regarding its democratic oath and its dangerous talk. The contradiction between both worlds must be cleared once and for all. Trying to win voters by means of extremist slogans at home, and making solemn democratic statements during visits to European capitals -- the Italian Government cannot expect its European partners to accept such a double game. However, in this policy of delimitation, the Europeans must do a real precision job. After all, they do not dissociate themselves from the Italians, but from the neofascists and their political activities. Only 1 percent of the Italians have publicly adopted the heritage of Mussolini; however, 13.5 percent of them voted for the extreme right-wing camp. But compared with these figures, neither the French nor the Germans have any reason to look down their noses. If history were an efficient teacher, there should be no ultrarightists anywhere in Europe. But meanwhile, all Europeans must clearly define the necessary democratic lines, above all, at their own front door. Berlusconi assumed great responsibility when he blurred these lines in the interests of power. Helmut Kohl must remind him of his responsibility.
