FR941202-1-00037 FR941202-1-00005 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 27 CFR Part 9 [Notice No. 802] RIN 1512&hyph;AA07 Cucamonga Valley Viticultural Area (94F&hyph;011P) AGENCY: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) is considering the establishment of a viticultural area located in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, California, to be known as ``Cucamonga Valley.'' This proposal is the result of a petition filed by Gino L. Filippi of J. Filippi Vintage Co. on behalf of himself and other growers and wineries in the area. ATF believes that the establishment of viticultural areas and the subsequent use of viticultural area names as appellations of origin in wine labeling and advertising allows wineries to designate the specific areas where the grapes used to make the wine were grown and enables consumers to better identify the wines they purchase. DATES: Written comments must be received by January 31, 1995. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to: Chief, Wine, Beer and Spirits Regulations Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, P.O. Box 50221, Washington, DC 20091&hyph;0221, Attn: Notice No. 802. Copies of written comments received in response to this notice of proposed rulemaking will be available for public inspection during normal business hours at: ATF Reference Library, Room 6480, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20226. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marjorie D. Ruhf, Wine, Beer and Spirits Regulations Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20226 (202&hyph;927&hyph;8230). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF&hyph;53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR part 4. These regulations allow the establishment of definite American viticultural areas. The regulations also allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be used as an appellation of origin in the labeling and advertising of wine. On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF&hyph;60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR, providing for the listing of approved American viticultural areas. Section 4.25a(e)(1), Title 27, CFR, defines an American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of which have been delineated in subpart C of part 9. Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region as a viticultural area. The petition should include: (a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the area specified in the petition; (b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; (c) Evidence relating to the geographical features (climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area from surrounding areas; (d) A description of the specific boundaries of the viticultural area, based on features which can be found on United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the largest applicable scale; and (e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map(s) with the boundaries prominently marked. Petition ATF has received a petition from Gino L. Filippi of J. Filippi Vintage Co. proposing to establish a viticultural area in San Bernardino County, California, to be known as ``Cucamonga Valley.'' The proposed viticultural area is located in southern California, about 45 miles east of the city of Los Angeles. It contains approximately 109,400 acres. The petitioner states that wine grapes, probably the mission variety, were first planted in the Cucamonga Valley in 1839 or 1840, ``undoubtedly one of the first large plantings of grapes in California.'' According to the petitioner the wine industry in the Cucamonga Valley grew during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, reaching ``its peak in the 1940's and 1950's with over 60 wineries producing from approximately 35,000 acres.'' Today, there are five bonded wineries within the proposed area, and approximately 2,000 acres are planted to wine grapes. The petitioner notes ``the area's great history and heritage of wine growing and winemaking is truly more impressive than the number of acres currently farmed.'' The petition was also signed by Philo Biane of Rancho de Philo Winery, Ren√© Biane of Guasti Plaza, Don Galleano of Galleano Winery, Paul Hofer III of Hofer Ranch, LeAnn Smothers of the City of Rancho Cucamonga, and Jeff Wilson, of Inland Empire West Resource Conservation District. Evidence of Name Evidence that the name of the proposed area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the area specified in the petition includes:
