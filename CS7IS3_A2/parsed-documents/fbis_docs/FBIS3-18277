The three hijackers gave themselves up to the Spanish authorities. After their fright the more than 100 passengers are resting, while they wait for the plane to resume its journey to Algeria. [passage omitted] Concha Flores reports: [Flores] The three hijackers have given themselves up to the Spanish police but they cannot request political asylum because they are the perpetrators of a crime of air piracy. Therefore they are prohibited from being granted political asylum. They are three members of the Algerian police force who decided today to leave their country and come to Spain. For this reason they hijacked the Boeing 727 as it was on an internal flight from Oran to Annaba. The three hijackers are at the moment making statements to the Spanish police and after these statements have been made, the necessary measures will be taken. However, the right to request political asylum is ruled out, as the Alicante Civil Governor, Alfonso Calve, said: [Begin Calve recording] What I said was that international laws and agreements exclude any possibility of political asylum. What is going to happen, as I said, is that following police investigations, they will be referred to the courts and it will be the judge, and the National High Court, should the judge decide that this case be referred to the High Court, who decides the future. [end recording] [Flores] [passage omitted] Further conclusions made public by the Civil Government reveal that they have no connection with Islamic fundamentalist movements. [passage omitted]
