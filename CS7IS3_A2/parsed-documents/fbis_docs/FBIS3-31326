The mortar shell which also wounded 200 other people on February 5 may have been fired by either side, Serb or Moslem, Canadian Colonel Michel Gauthier, who headed the investigation committee, told the press. "Both parties are known to have 120 mm mortars, and the bombs to go along with them," he said. ``The Team has no reason to believe that either party does not have access to this type of ammunition. "There is insufficient physical evidence to prove that one party or the other fired the mortar bomb. The mortar bomb in question could have been fired by either side." The commission, which conducted its inquiry on the spot between February 11 and 13, confirmed that a single bomb caused the explosion, the single bloodiest attack on civilians in the 22-month old Bosnian conflict. The attack prompted the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to issue its ultimatum Wednesday to order air strikes against the Bosnian Serb forces around Sarajevo if they do not neutralize artillery around the capital by midnight Sunday. Bosnia's Moslem-led government immediately blamed the Serbs besieging the capital for the attack, while the Serbs charged that Moslem forces had killed their own people to try to bring new condemnation on the Serbs, largely seen as the aggressors in the war. Gauthier, chief of the engineering section of UNPROFOR, was appointed head of the team comprising French, Pakistani, Russian and Spanish experts, by UN special representative for the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi. The commission of inquiry was agreed on February 10 after Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said he would refuse to take part in peace talks in Geneva unless it was appointed.
