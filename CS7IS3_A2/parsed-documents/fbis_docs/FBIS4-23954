Abacha said at a passing-out ceremony of military students Nigeria "must not continue to wallow in parochial loyalties which have impaired the growth of a genuine and selfless leadership." Abacha, who was paying his first visit to Lagos since the start of Nigeria's latest political crisis, said "every patriotic Nigerian must see as highly reprehensible any unguided acts capable of derailing the government's democratic process." He said his administration could not be blackmailed into abandoning the "noble cause" of establishing the foundation for a lasting democracy in the country. The general added that a constitutional conference, scheduled to open on June 27 in Abuja, was a "Nigerian conference by Nigerians for Nigerians to discuss Nigeria's problems," NAN quoted him as saying. The opposition has dubbed the conference, which will last three months, a "ruse" by the military to hang onto power. Security in Lagos was beefed up Friday for Abacha's visit, with groups of armed policemen stationed at strategic points, NAN said. Police Deputy Inspector General Nuhu Aliyu said security was also tightened following a report that Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of presidential elections in June last year, was going to address a meeting in Mushin, on the outskirts of Lagos, to coincide with Abacha's visit. The West African country has been in a state of crisis since General Ibrahim Babangida, then head of the military junta, annulled the June poll. Abiola escaped a police dragnet last weekend and declared himself president and commander-in-chief of Nigeria's armed forces. Aliyu alleged the millionaire politician had planned to recruit local thugs, known as "area boys" to cause unrest during the general's visit, NAN added.
