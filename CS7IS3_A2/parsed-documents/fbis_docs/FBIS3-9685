Coalition Council Article Five (1) The Coalition Council is being set up to address basic issues concerning the functioning of the coalition, particularly to decide on personnel questions, on the principles of the government's policy statement, and on other matters reserved for the Coalition Council by the coalition partners, and to deal with mutual disputes.

(3) The Coalition Council meets always with representatives of all coalition partners present. Its meetings are held regularly, at least once a week.

Manner of Adopting Decisions Article Six (1) Important issues are dealt with by the Coalition Council in the form of the conclusion of coalition accords. (2) A coalition accord is concluded when the representatives of all of the coalition partners express their consent with it and confirm it by the signature of the chairman or its authorized representatives. (3) A coalition accord is always needed when filling the posts of government members and state secretaries, when dealing with personnel issues in the NRSR, and when filling the posts of chairman and deputy chairman of the Supreme Inspection Office, National Property Fund bodies, and central bodies of state administration. The coalition partners have agreed to respect until the end of the electoral term the principle of proportional representation in these bodies, according to the present strength of the parliamentary clubs.

Following mutual agreement, consultations can also be attended by the contracting parties' experts. (3) While respecting the principle of professional expertise, consultations among coalition partners will be held about filling leading positions in the general and specialized state administration, appointing ambassadors, and filling posts in the central bodies of state administration, as well as when discussing key changes in the posts of district police chiefs. These consultations will be held through the medium of ministers nominated for the entities making up this coalition. The ministers will communicate the position of the partner they represent no later than one day before the government meeting in question. If any entity represented in the coalition disagrees with the proposed changes, the disputed issue must be decided in the form of a coalition accord. Solution to Disputes Article Eight (1) In the event of a situation arising that, in the opinion of any coalition partner, poses a threat to coalition cooperation, this partner's chairman or his authorized deputy will establish contact with the other coalition partners without delay. The coalition partners will try to coordinate their activity and reach consensus on measures that are suited to improve the situation or come to terms with the disputed issue. (2) Objections raised by any coalition partner to the professional qualifications or political competence of officeholders appointed on the basis of a coalition accord are dealt with in the Coalition Council.

With this in mind, representatives of these political entities will be regularly invited to meetings of the Coalition Council. (2) This agreement is binding for the coalition partners as long as the joint coalition government exists. (3) The parliamentary coalition ceases to exist a) on the day of the start of the campaign for elections to the NRSR b) through notice given by even one of the contracting parties, within 10 days after written notice is delivered to the other contracting parties.
