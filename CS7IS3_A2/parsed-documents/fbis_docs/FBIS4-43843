Our special correspondent accompanying the minister, Klara Stejskalova, has telephoned this dispatch to us from Stockholm. [Stejskalova] Minister Baudys had another tete-a-tete meeting with his Swedish counterpart Anders Bjorck shortly before midday. This is what Bjorck said about the outcome of this meeting: [Begin Bjorck recording in English with superimposed Czech translation] I think the signing of the memorandum on mutual understanding, which deepens contacts between us, is the most important outcome of this visit. Sweden's interest in and approach to solving the security situation in Europe is similar to those of the Czech Republic. [end recording] [Stejskalova] Like our Republic, Sweden regards the resolution of relations with Russia, which have been of some concern recently, as the issue of paramount importance at the present time. Naturally, the situation in the former Yugoslavia was also discussed. The two ministers said jointly that they had found a common language. Prior to leaving, the Czech delegation headed by Antonin Baudys will meet Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas.
