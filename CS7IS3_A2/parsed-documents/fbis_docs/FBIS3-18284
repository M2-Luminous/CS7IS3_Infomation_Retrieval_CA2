EU's foreign ministers finally agreed on a joint position on the candidate nations in the following areas: Agriculture and regional policy. It is nothing but a framework program, which does not contain any details. The map must be drawn during the next few weeks. The position expresses understanding in principle for the special problems that prevail in the Nordic regions, it recognizes the need for treating the northern farmers in a way similar to their colleagues in the EU, and it envisions the need for long-range, decreasing national support for the farmers who are affected by the price cuts. "Public opinion in Finland is still very positive to membership, but it is not known how it will be affected by the most recent offer," the minister said threateningly. The Farmers Need 12 Billion The EU's demand for immediate price adjustment is a catastrophe for Finnish agriculture, says the former chairman of MTK [Agricultural Producers' Association]. Since Finnish agricultural prices are twice as high as in the EU, it would result in a budget expenditure of 12 billion markkas to compensate the farmers for their losses, Haavisto explained. "It also would not benefit the consumers, who would only to a limited extent get lower prices on food. The food prices are simply dependent on the value-added tax [VAT] system," Haavisto further said. The EU's position that the farmers in southern Finland should only get one-third of the subsidy was also something completely unacceptable: "We reminded them that we are net contributors to the EU," Haavisto said. Three Weeks' Time On the part of the EU commission one has said that in the final round everything will be dealt with as a single package: Budget, structural funds, and agricultural subsidies, but that is not acceptable to Finland, which says that the agricultural questions are too essential and must be solved separately. Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen states that EU's negotiators must now get clear directives to reduce the gap between the negotiating positions. "We have three weeks to do it. We can manage it if the political will is there. It is not enough to have technical will," he said. The EU was given Finland's positions on structural and regional policy in June and on agricultural policy in September. Not until now, however, did one sit down and negotiate on a political level. Haavisto and Salolainen repeatedly brought up this discrepancy in time. We Are Only Demanding the Same Conditions "We are demanding nothing more than that the EU's rules are applied in a correct manner in Finland. We only demand that our farmers should be treated the same way as EU farmers." Finland also explained in its seven-page-long speech at the negotiating table that Finland will follow the common agricultural policy to the full extent once the country is a member of the EU, that is to say reduce production and area. The Finnish Government's frequent trips around the capitals of Europe in order to explain the difficult situation in the sparsely populated Nordic provinces and of the farmers seem to have fallen on deaf ears, judging by the EU's not very sympathetic attitude toward the Nordic regions, said one journalist: "Not until three weeks from now (when the deadline for the negotiations expires) will we see whether the trips have been successful," replied Pertti Salolainen. The Norwegians were more positive than Finland's negotiators to the same offer. The Norwegian delegation stated that it has received an "opening toward transitional periods" for price reductions. The Swedish negotiators also thought the day had been useful, although no results had been achieved in substance. Sweden is pushing very hard for Objective 1 status, that is to say the one given to the very poorest regions in the EU, for its northernmost regions (Norrbotten). Finland as well is pushing hard to have its regions recognized as Objective 1. The major difference between Objective 1 and Objective 2, and 5b, respectively, is that within the framework for Objective 1 it is possible to provide money for the infrastructure. Further, the Objective 1 funds permit the EU to contribute 75 percent of the investments. Objective 1 funds represent three-fourths of the funding in the total structural fund.
