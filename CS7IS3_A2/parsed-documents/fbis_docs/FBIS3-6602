In an interview with South Korean correspondents posted in Beijing, Hwang said that during the president's visit beginning March 26, South Korea and China will sign a number of agreements to solidify bilateral cooperation -- especially in the economic arena. "The creation of a close cooperative system between South Korea and China would lead ultimately to singularizing the two countries' markets," he said. The ambassador said this would eventually prompt Japan to join the single market, making it a base for a Northeast Asian economic system geared toward non-tariffication in the region. According to Hwang, the Korean-Chinese agreements to be signed include the creation of a joint industrial cooperation committee and memoranda on the promotion of joint ventures in electronic switchboards, airplanes, automobiles and high-definition television. A source said a memorandum of understanding on bilateral cooperation in communications equipment would include provisions governing the joint development of next-generation communications equipment and China's approval of a Korea-developed TDX electronic switchboard model being produced by a Korean firm active in Shandong Province. The memorandum will likely be signed during President Kim's visit by Communications Minister Yun Tong-yun and his Chinese counterpart, Posts and Communications Minister Wu Jichuan. "The approval of the TDX model paves the way for possible adoption of the Korean model in all areas of China," the source said. "Besides, China is expected to formally adopt the TDX switchboards in modernizing telephone facilities in the two Provinces of Shandong and Hunan." In an airplane project, the two countries would jointly develop a prototype of a 100-seat passenger plane for sale to third countries, the source said. A memorandum on automobile cooperation would call for Korean firms' advancement into China via "production of auto parts first and joint development and production of auto models later." Daewoo Motor is already doing business in China through a tie-up with a Chinese firm following the same pattern. Daewoo's joint-venture company produces parts for about 300,000 vehicles a year. By 1998 the firm plans to build an assembly plant capable of turning out about 150,000 units a year. In addition, the two countries are planning to cooperate in such high-tech areas as high-definition television, atomic energy, rockets and satellites, the source said.
