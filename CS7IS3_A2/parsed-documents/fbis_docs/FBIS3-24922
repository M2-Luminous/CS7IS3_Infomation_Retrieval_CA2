These teachers from high schools in the public sector, who had been on strike since 24 November to back demands for better salaries, were hit by the measure after their supervisors reported their "irregular absence." On 23 January, 73 other high school teachers were dismissed for similar reasons. The previous day, the government had issued a recruitment notice to cope with the possible refusal of teachers to resume work.
