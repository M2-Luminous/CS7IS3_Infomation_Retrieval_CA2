Zhogov, R.Kh. Timerov, Moscow Electronic Engineering Institute; UDC 621.382] [Abstract] The inadequacy of the semi-empirical simplified models used to describe the resist relief evolution for simulating submicrometer lithography due to the assumption that the local polymer resist dissolution rate depends only on the mean value of the polymer's molecular mass prompted a new look at the process of selective polymer dissolution. In so doing, resist development is considered as a selective polymer dissolution process, and the diffusion origin of the selective polymer dissolution process, mass transfer in the polymer-gel-liquid solution system with selective dissolution, and nonselective dissolution are examined in detail. The concentration distribution evolution of monodisperse polystyrene in methylethylketone in a film, the development profiles of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in methylisobutylketone (MBIK) and of polystyrene in methylethylketone, and the dependence of the critical groove size in the swelling polystyrene (PST)-methylethylketone (MEK) system on the initial polydispersity degree are plotted; the above description of selective polymer dissolution as an evolution of the spatial molecular and mass distribution (allowing for the dependence of the transport properties of the macromolecules on their size) makes it possible to simulate the process of slightly (PMMA-MIBK) and highly (PST-MEK) swelling polymer resist composition development and shows that the proposed model is suitable for describing the development process with the fullness required by submicrometer lithography. The findings demonstrate that by properly selecting the molecular and mass distribution of the polymer base, one can increase the resist composition resolution.
