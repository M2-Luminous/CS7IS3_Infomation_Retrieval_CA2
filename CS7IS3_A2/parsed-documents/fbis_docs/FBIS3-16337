This was the protest of the editorial staff of the newspaper against the attempts of Labour Democrats to seize the independent newspaper. The editorial staff stated that "radical group of Labour Democrats suggested to the Government stopping the activities of our joint-stock company by seizing its property and shares and throwing us out or making their servants". On Tuesday Labour Democrats also publicized their comments on the action and stated that "the action of the newspaper is not original. In 1991 four main Lithuanian dailies launched similar action in protest against attempts of Landbergis and Vagnorius Government to nationalize them. The journalists' protest was not taken into consideration and the VALSTIECIU LAIKRASTIS was made dependent on supporters of Landsbergis". The statement also said that "Labour Democrats are not going to repeat the methods used by Vagnorius and will try to establish the justice in court."
