The meeting would also include representatives from the three warring sides, according to the proposal put forward here by visiting Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel. Such a meeting would help iron out differences in policy among the consulting countries and, if successful, would pave the way for a summit on the conflict between the five nations, said Kozyrev. Kinkel stressed Russia's participation in peaceful efforts to end the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. He also demanded that Russia exert pressure on the Bosnian serbs. Kozyrev's meeting with Kinkel followed talks earlier this week with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, as well as French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, aimed at finding ways to promote an end to the war in Bosnia.
