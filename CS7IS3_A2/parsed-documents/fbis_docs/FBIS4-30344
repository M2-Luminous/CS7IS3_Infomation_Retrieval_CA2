FBIS4-30344 "dreas123_a_94022" FBIS-EAS-94-123 Daily Report 27 June 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan LDP's Kono on Political Situation, Premiership LDP's Kono on Political Situation, Premiership OW2706055494 OW2706055494 BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese at 0046 GMT on 26 June carries a 22-minute live interview with Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], during its regular "Sunday Discussion" program. The interview, conducted in the NHK Tokyo studio, is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto and guest commentator Naoki Tanaka. Yamamoto begins the interview by asking Kono: "As the largest opposition party, the LDP bears great responsibility for establishing a new administration. How do you intend to tackle this in concrete terms?" Kono replies: "We need to follow an orthodox procedure. I think one of the reasons for the current confusion in the political situation lies in the fact that proper the procedures of parliamentary democracy have not been taken in an orthodox manner. I mean, the regular procedures of constitutional government." Explaining the differences between the presidential system and the parliamentary system of government, Kono reiterates that it is important to follow orthodox procedures based on the parliamentary system of government and parliamentary democracy. Asked whether the largest opposition LDP intends to call for policy talks with the second largest opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), Kono says: "I think the opposition parties are responsible for disentangling the political chaos." Yamamoto then asks: "Do you mean the most desirable thing is to form an LDP-SDPJ-Sakigake (Harbinger) coalition?" Kono replies: "Theoretically, yes." He then notes the need to reach an agreement on polices. Guest commentator Tanaka next asks if Kono feels the responsibility for forming a new administration. Kono says: "I feel a very grave responsibility." Then Kono says the initial reason for the LDP submission of a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet was not because it was a minority administration. In citing the actual reasons, Kono asserts that the Hata administration had injured Japan's credit with foreign nations and the administration was taking a negative attitude toward economic pump-priming measures and political reform. Kono adds: "Now that we have brought down the administration, we -- not only the LDP but also the others who brought it down -- bear a great responsibility. Therefore, we intend to call for talks with various parties. Each coalition party that has lost power has their own opinion. For this reason, we intend to ask each party to talk with us. However, we have to think about which party has the most similar views to ours on the current politics. Policies are important, but, democracy is more important." Noting LDP criticism of the so-called Ozawa-Ichikawa alliance (between Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa), Yamamoto asks if the LDP intends to exclude Shinseito and Komeito from policy talks. Kono says the LDP has no intention of excluding them from the initial stage if they follow democracy. On policy differences between the LDP and the SDPJ, Kono says he has the impression that there are not many differences in policies between the LDP and the SDPJ. When Tanaka points out different views within the LDP, Kono says: "As I was elected party president, I represent LDP views." Asked how he intends to consolidate party unity, Kono says the LDP members have become united over the year since he became party president. Asked about the so-called "conservative-conservative" coalition, Kono questions the term "conservative-conservative" coalition. Tanaka reviews the LDP's past political management, and asks what Kono thinks about the leadership within the LDP. Kono says: "The LDP has been reformed smoothly. The party has drastically changed compared with last year." He adds: "The biggest change is that the there is no more faction-oriented management in the LDP." Asked about Sakigake's idea of putting forward SDPJ Chairman Murayama as candidate for premiership, Kono says it is desirable to think about various options, and notes the need for a transparent procedure for deciding the candidate. Kono adds: "It took much time to establish the Hata administration after Mr. Hosokawa (resigned as prime minister). At present, this is by no means forgivable. We have only three days before the current Diet session ends. And, the summit meeting (in Naples) is near at hand. Although we can extend the Diet session, it is impossible to postpone the summit. I think we have to make a decision in a day or two." When Yamamoto asks whether Kono will be a candidate for prime minister if an LDP headed administration is formed, Kono says it is not time to jump to conclusions. Kono adds that it is very important to reach a policy agreement with other parties on such issues as tax reform and security. Asked about the coalition's stance of watching developments in LDP-SDPJ talks, Kono says: "It is an orthodox attitude. If Mr. Hata's resignation was based on the belief that he could not survive a no-confidence motion, it will be impossible for Mr. Hata to be reelected prime minister again." Yamamoto asks: "Do you mean Mr. Hata will not become prime minister again?" Kono asserts: "I think it is impossible." The interview with Kono ends at 0108 GMT.
