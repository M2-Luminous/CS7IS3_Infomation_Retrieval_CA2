FR940919-2-00176 FR940919-2-00076 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Petition for Modification of a Previously Approved Antitheft Device; BMW AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Grant of petition for modification of a previously approved antitheft device. SUMMARY: In 1986, this agency granted BMW of North America, Inc.'s (BMW) petition for exemption from the parts marking requirements of the vehicle theft prevention standard for the BMW 7 Car line. This notice grants BMW's petition for a modification of the previously approved antitheft device. The agency grants this petition because it has determined, based on substantial evidence, that the modified antitheft device described in BMW's petition to be placed on the car line as standard equipment, is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with parts marking requirements. DATES: The exemption granted by this notice is effective at the beginning of the 1995 model year. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Barbara A. Gray, Office of Market Incentives, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Ms. Gray's telephone number is (202) 366&hyph;1740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In October 1986, NHTSA published in the Federal Register a notice granting the petition from BMW of North America, Inc. (BMW) for an exemption from the parts marking requirements of the vehicle theft prevention standard for the model year (MY) 1988 BMW 7 Car line. (See 51 FR 36333, October 9, 1986). The agency determined that the antitheft device which BMW intended to install on the 7 Car line as standard equipment is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as would compliance with the parts marking requirements of the theft prevention standard. On February 17, 1994, BMW submitted a letter to the agency stating that the MY 1995 7 Car line would include modifications to the antitheft system that is installed as standard equipment. In a letter dated August 12, 1994, the agency informed BMW that the modification to the antitheft system on the 7 Car line appeared to be subject to NHTSA approval pursuant to 49 CFR section 543.9, Terminating or modifying an exemption. The agency had determined that the changes to the previously approved antitheft system were not de minimis, based on BMW's discussions of proposed changes to radio and glove box monitoring, and the addition of a glass breakage sensor. On August 26, 1994, BMW submitted its petition for modification. The petition incorporated by reference certain information, dated May 29, 1986, that BMW already provided to NHTSA in its petition for exemption for the MY 1988 7 Car line. Together, the above information submitted by BMW constitutes a complete petition, as required by 49 CFR section 543.9(d), in that it meets the general requirements contained in section 543.5 and the specific content requirements of section 543.6. In its petition for MY 1988, BMW included a detailed description of the identity, design and location of the components of the antitheft device, including diagrams of components and their location in the vehicle. BMW stated that the system consists of three lines of defense designed to prevent entry, disable the car, and scare away potential thieves. BMW described the antitheft device that was installed as standard equipment as passively activated. BMW stated that, for MY 1995, the antitheft system will be modified in three ways: (1) A remote control device will be added. BMW describes the remote control device as ``an integral component within the vehicle key,'' used to lock/unlock the door(s) and actuate the alarm system. BMW stated that the remote control device is identical to that provided for the antitheft device on the BMW 8 Car line. In a letter to BMW dated October 4, 1993, NHTSA determined that the addition of the remote on the 8 Car line is a de minimis change to the antitheft device. (2) Monitoring circuits for the radio and glove box are removed. In their place, the antitheft device will monitor glass breakage. As under the original exemption, the antitheft device monitors door opening. BMW asserts that the combination of the door and glass monitoring make the occupant compartment impenetrable. If the glass is broken in order to unlock and open a door, the device sounds. Likewise, if a door is opened by a means other than breaking the glass, e.g., through the use of a slim jim, the device sounds when a door is opened. (3) The alarm siren's decibel level is raised from 104 decibels to 112 decibels. BMW stated that, for MY 1995, the antitheft device features a comprehensive security alarm system and an ignition/fuel system disabling device that is activated by locking the door (either driver or passenger) with the metal key. The key can be turned in the front door locks in three positions: off; 45 degrees; and 90 degrees. If the driver holds the key a little past the 90 degree position, any open windows and the sunroof close. When the key is turned 45 degrees and removed, the doors, trunk, and fuel filler door are locked and the alarm system is armed. Additionally, when the key is removed from the driver's or passenger's door lock after having been turned 45 degrees, the ignition and fuel injection systems are deactivated, immobilizing the car.
