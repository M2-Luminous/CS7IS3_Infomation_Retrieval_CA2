[Vranitzky] None of the above is the most important thing. One cannot rule out that one thing or the other might happen occasionally. Occasionally we have found bad meat in our shops even without EU membership. [DER SPIEGEL] We are just quoting a few provocative catchwords used by Austrian EU opponents, who hope to triumph in the referendum on 12 June. [Vranitzky] I believe that these catchwords are characterizing the domestic discussion about the EU rather precisely. When we concluded our negotiations with Brussels on 1 March, the major issues were primarily agriculture, the budget, second homes, and the transit agreement. However, the more political the discussion becomes, the more emotional topics and slogans are coming to the surface. [DER SPIEGEL] "Austria first" your right-wing populist Joerg Haider demands. [Vranitzky] This is precisely where we are now. In the remaining days until the referendum we must draw a clear line between the political goal, which is the issue, and the slogans to create uncertainty and fear. [DER SPIEGEL] Most recent poll results signal a narrow result. Is Europe no longer attractive in Austria? [Vranitzky] I expected the mood to go down after the euphoria at the beginning of March. One cannot constantly be under such high tension. In 1993 we had a pronounced recession. Many people say that European integration is to be blamed for that. Others are worried about the situation in ex-Yugoslavia and say: Look at the EU, it is not even able to make peace. Others still say: In our country the unemployment rate is 5.5 percent, which is not even half as high as the EU average -- why do you now want to push us in there? We need an enormous effort to explain matters and to convince people. [DER SPIEGEL] Some people, not just Haider, also think that your government should have gotten more out of the membership negotiations in Brussels or should have waited for a more favorable time. [Vranitzky] It is simply not true that we have not achieved enough. [Bavarian] Minister President Stoiber recently told me that he does not know at all how he should explain to Bavarian farmers that the Austrians got far more for their farmers in the mountain regions, e.g. regarding EU aid for environmental protection. [DER SPIEGEL] At least, you also got a concession in Brussels that in the future you may continue to use specific Austrian terms for certain foodstuffs. [Vranitzky] We are also rather proud of that, but this is not the only thing. [DER SPIEGEL] Will the referendum be repeated if the vote is negative, as it was in Denmark in 1992? [Vranitzky] I do not believe that the referendum will be negative. However, we would then certainly face a serious situation, both in terms of domestic policy and in terms of European policy. And we would certainly not resign ourselves to the fact that the European issue is dead once and for all. [DER SPIEGEL] For Austria, EU membership is the most important historical event since it regained sovereignty through the State Treaty of 1955. However, is not also a de facto annexation to a greater Germany under different conditions, which would have been horrible for your predecessor Bruno Kreisky? [Vranitzky] I think that it will be precisely the opposite that will happen. Let us look at the economy, at foreign trade.... [DER SPIEGEL] ...two-thirds of which you conduct with the EU anyway. [Vranitzky] Quite so. Now the EU is moving closer together, and anyone who stays outside will be at a disadvantage. What would be the alternative? We would have to come to a bilateral agreement with our strongest trading partner, namely Germany. Thus, we would be all the more dependent. [DER SPIEGEL] Some francophone members of the European Parliament already see Austria as a "vassal" of the Germans. Will the EU become more northern, not to say more Germanic, because of the accession of the four new members? [Vranitzky] Let me tell you a little story: When I visited the French president in summer 1989, that is, before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Mitterrand told me: Well, you are very welcome to us, and I take note of the fact that the third German state will join the EU. [DER SPIEGEL] Did you protest against this classification? [Vranitzky] I told Mitterrand: Dear friend, I do not represent the third German state, but the first and only Austrian state. He quickly said that he did not mean any harm by saying this. One or the other person might feel the same today. But we are all old European states with long common relations. [DER SPIEGEL] Bonn's Foreign Minister Kinkel was particularly supportive of Austria during the membership negotiations -- do you not feel a bit that you owe him something? [Vranitzky] Kinkel supported us just as much as Belgium's Willy Claes, as [EU Commission President] Jacques Delors during the final state, and he cooperated just as much as Spain's Gonzalez. Perhaps one should also respect the different temperaments. Kinkel's temperament is different from that of France's Balladur. [DER SPIEGEL] What will happen to the permanent neutrality of Mozart's country after it joins the EU? You seem to shy away from definite statements in this respect. [Vranitzky] Neutrality has really been strained by too many comparisons, just as Mozart has been. Neutrality is a legal and not a political instrument; probably only Austrians really understand that. [DER SPIEGEL] We are obviously talking about a sacred cow? [Vranitzky] You know, from the end of the 19th century to 1955, this country was constantly shaken, trampled on, and abused, certainly also because of its own actions. The State Treaty in 1955, after 10 years of occupation, and the neutrality that was adopted by the Austrian Parliament finally meant stability. Thus, the term neutrality is a very emotional one for us. [DER SPIEGEL] However, in light of the new geopolitical realities in Europe, this is an increasingly dubious status. Even the neutral countries Sweden and Finland have meanwhile joined the NATO Partnership for Peace. Why does Austria not join, too? [Vranitzky] I think the basic concept of neutrality, which is not to participate in wars, is not a bad principle. By joining the Partnership for Peace, the Swedes and the Finnish did not join a military alliance. This is a platform for information and training, something which we have long been doing with the countries of East Europe. [DER SPIEGEL] How does Austria want to contribute to a common European defense policy? [Vranitzky] The establishment of a common security system is possible for a neutral state just as for any other state. And whether or not we have observer status in the Western European Union, we have said repeatedly: We are open in this respect. [DER SPIEGEL] But joining NATO is not possible? [Vranitzky] No. [DER SPIEGEL] Even though NATO is currently the only institution that effectively guarantees security in Europe? [Vranitzky] For whom? [DER SPIEGEL] For everyone who joins in. [Vranitzky] NATO membership is not a topic for us at the moment, not even in the medium term. However, if NATO rethinks its own future, one will have to examine later on what was the result of this rethinking. [DER SPIEGEL] For 1996, the EU is planning a large government conference to reform the European institutions. What should be reformed? [Vranitzky] There are extensive debates in the EU about the so-called democractic deficit. We have established pluralistic parliamentary systems in our countries. In the long run, the peoples will not be willing to accept a decline in democracy policy at the next higher, the European level. This relationship between the European Parliament, the EU Commission, and the EU Council of Ministers will have to be institutionally clarified. [DER SPIEGEL] You see already now how the British, for instance, are blocking this. This will hardly be different in 1996. [Vranitzky] You are right. I have never said that this will be an easy task. [DER SPIEGEL] In addition, by deciding in favor of enlargement, the EU has, for the time being, decided against a deepening of supranational relations. [Vranitzky] I reject this as regards Austria. The big problems of the future, such as the environment, stability, and peace cannot be solved on the basis of a free trade zone. This means I am a member of the school of the political union. [DER SPIEGEL] In the war in Yugoslavia, West Europe has proved to be disunited and helpless. Would a common foreign policy with majority decisions in the Council make the EU more able to act? [Vranitzky] In some fields the instrument of majority decision would ensure flexibility and efficiency. If one wants to prevent a disaster such as the one in the former Yugoslavia in the future, a common political will and, afterwards, common action are necessary. [DER SPIEGEL] Austria finds itself in a turbulent neighborhood: To the east of you former communists are on their way up again in many places; the civil war in the former Yugoslavia continues; and your Italian neighbors have the neofascists back in the government. Are you worried about the advance of extremism? [Vranitzky] Yes, but I am worried even more about the fact that many of my fellow citizens have noticed this very little so far. [DER SPIEGEL] There we are back with Joerg Haider. [Vranitzky] No, I am thinking of those who close their minds to new things, because they think that everything can continue as it was in the 1970's and 1980's. But the foreign policy framework conditions have changed. So far, we West Europeans have neglected helping the reform states in the East with models of cooperation and further improving their economic framework conditions with investments in infrastructure, technical knowledge, and administration. The lack of social and economic progress has led to many people being disinterested in these developments. But we must not turn away, we must not isolate these peoples -- this would be fundamentally wrong. [DER SPIEGEL] Peace researcher Johan Galtung sees what is happening in East Europe now as economic colonialism by the West, which is creating a second Third World there. [Vranitzky] This threat is very real if we in the West do not pay more attention to it. I still hear what my former colleague Margaret Thatcher used to say, namely that, first of all, those in the East must develop free market economy systems and then, as soon as they have them, we will invest in their countries. I told her that this will not be possible without Western cooperation; no free markets will develop there, unless they are organized black markets. [DER SPIEGEL] Will Austria get involved as an advocate for the acceptance of the reform states in the EU or do you rather see competition developing in this respect? [Vranitzky] One must take the factor of time into consideration. The economic constellations in these countries show that immediate membership of the reform countries is not possible. Transition solutions, however, are certainly useful. [DER SPIEGEL] Austria, which has so far been relatively liberal, has also adopted stricter immigration laws, which are applied consistently, sometimes even brutally. You are closing your borders. Is this advance obedience for joining the fortress West Europe? [Vranitzky] We were forced to adjust our legal situation to the fundamentally changed structure of migration in Central Europe within the shortest possible period. In individual cases, authorities have certainly acted improperly. And as regards dealing with people who come to us from other countries, we, like many other Europeans, are in the middle of a learning process. [DER SPIEGEL] The Austrians are probably right in the European trend with their widespread aversion against foreigners. [Vranitzky] I do not to downplay anything and I cannot deny what you are saying for every single case. However, one has to add that this is really a tough piece of political work that has to be done -- there, where concentrations are permitted or promoted, such as in some schools, where there are already 60 percent are foreigners. This is were policy must become active. [DER SPIEGEL] Is your government again permitting itself to be influenced by Mr. Haider? [Vranitzky] No, Haider is not influencing anything. The 60 percent of foreign children are in these school classes with or without Mr. Haider. [passage omitted]
