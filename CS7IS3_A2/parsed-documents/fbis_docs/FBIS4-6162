Phase shifts (subtle differences in arrival times) occur at the receiving terminal when multiple types of data are transmitted via differing sets of optical fiber cables, but a feature of the new device is that it automatically corrects such conditions. Fujitsu claims the new device can be used on basic transmission modules of large-scale computers and in animated image transmission devices for multimedia systems. The newly developed device converts 20 different types of data from electrical to optial signals and transmits the data at speeds of 156 megabits (1 megabit equals 1 million bits) per second via optical fiber cable. Maximum capacity of the device is the combined processing of large volumes of data at the rate of 3.12 gigabits (1 giga equals 1 billion bits) per second. Further, the receiving terminal can convert all signals to electrical signals that are uniformly timed. One optical fiber cable will be fed with clock signals reflecting the timing for each piece of data and the remaining five optical fiber cables will be used to transmit 20 types of data including 19 different types of data and a standard signal to be used for synchronization. Each optical fiber cable will be used to transmit four types of data in the form of a packet (data sorted into a fixed unit) and a standard signal will be inserted between packets. All signals can be synchronized by applying the standard signal at the receiving terminal. Further, the system was set up so that optical signal lasers were efficiently input into the optical fiber cables and a test was performed which demonstrated the capability to transmit the data for 400 meters without in-transmit amplification. Reportedly, the system is capable of transmitting a distance of one kilometer. Past methods using coaxial cables and electrical signals resulted in disintegration of wave shapes and signal erosion rendering transmission beyond 100 meters impossible. Transmission speeds of 156 megabits per second equal animated image transmission capacities of broad-band integrated digital transmission networks (B-ISDN). Fujitsu intends to commercialize the new device for use in data transmission between large-scale computers and image transmission systems for cable television stations.
