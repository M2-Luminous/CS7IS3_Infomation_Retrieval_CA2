Chernichenko who spoke at the founding congress of the RDCP said that he would above all support its struggle against the insatiable appetites of the military-industrial complex. Pointing to the symbol of the RDCP - Falcone's famous monument to Peter the Great called the bronze horseman, he compared the military-industrial complex to the horseman, "who has grown so fat that it has crushed his horse and stripped it of what was left of its flesh." The state Duma "deceives itself and the country by endorsing an impossibly high military budget which make all reforms 'sluggish," he said. Support for Russia's new political party has also been expressed by representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan and the Moderate Party of Sweden.
