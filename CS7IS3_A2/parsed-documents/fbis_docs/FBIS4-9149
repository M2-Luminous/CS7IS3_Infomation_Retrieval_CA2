It runs along a river that the Slovenes call the Kolpa, and the Croats the Kupa -- the river that marks the border between the two republics born from the ashes of Yugoslavia. The road is used to transport freight that is best kept hidden from prying eyes. Mainly weapons. And even the maps have been modified in order to facilitate this traffic. Thus a bridge has "disappeared," though in fact it still exists, and it is quite possible to cross it, even with heavy vehicles. The bridge joins Slovenia to Croatia at a place called Bosljiva Loka. It is a border crossing, but the fact is marked by only a couple of road signs. The one on the right bank reads, "Republic of Croatia," while the Slovene notice reads, "Warning, state frontier." But in between there is not the slightest trace of any border post. There are no barriers, and it is possible to pass easily from one country to the other without being stopped by police or customs officers. Along the road there are other bridges across the river. On those there are fixed border posts for passport controls. Only over the bridge that has "disappeared" is it possible to cross the border freely. Last Sunday, as tourists crossed on their way to the nearby Osilnica riding school, a Croatian police car parked at the end of the bridge and the policemen in it glanced wearily at their passports. On Sundays and holidays and at night neither the Croats nor the Slovenes carry out checks. This strange fact is explained by looking at the map. Across the bridge, the road runs for some 10 km through Croatian territory. It is almost all surfaced, apart from a stretch of a few kilometers of dirt road, which is nevertheless perfectly passable. After passing through some tiny peasant villages, the road ends at Brodna Kupi. Here there is another bridge joining Croatia and Slovenia -- this one equipped with police, customs officers, barriers, flags, and everything necessary for a border post. Brodna Kupi is the first Croatian town on the road to Delnice and Ogulin, two towns on the Lika front, where Serbs and Croats have waged a bitter struggle. A small turning leads to the road to Bihac in Bosnia. In this area Slovenia and Bosnia are no more than about 100 km apart. The road in question is the shortest route for bringing weapons to the Bosnian Muslims. The inhabitants of the villages around Bosljiva Loka say that there is a fairly steady flow of vehicles, considering the fact that it is a country road. They include covered trucks with no identifying markings. On the Slovene side, near the bridge that "disappeared," there is the area of Kocevska Reka. It covers 76,000 hectares and includes 1,400 km of roads. Under Yugoslavia it was entirely off limits, a military zone. Under the mountains there are outright citadels where the Belgrade government was supposed to take refuge in the event of a war. But Ljubljana always regarded Kocevska Reka as its own: Only the commanding generals were Serbs; all the other officers and men were Slovenes. The Yugoslav Federal Army, whose officers were prevalently Serbs, was forced to accept this unpleasant fact. Muslim Volunteers Come From Fiume [Rijeka] After Ljubljana became independent from Belgrade in summer 1991 part of Kocevska Reka was turned into a nature reserve. This pleased the inhabitants of the village that gave its name to the area; since then they have no longer needed a special permit to leave their homes. Another part remained a military zone. The main difference from Yugoslav times is that the Slovene soldiers serving in the area have changed their uniform from that of the Belgrade army to that of Ljubljana's armed forces. And the inhabitants of the villages remaining within the military zone still suffer restrictions on their freedom of movement. A kind of weapons bazaar has apparently been established in the military bases of Kocevska Reka, from which the Bosnian Croats and Muslims equip themselves. Moreover, the area -- strictly controlled and far from prying eyes -- is apparently also used to train the volunteers on their way to the combat zone. These are mainly people originating from the Middle Eastern Islamic countries, who join the Bosnian Muslims in the name of their common faith. They reach the port of Fiume, where they mix with the Bosnian refugees. The capital of the Quarnero region is some 40 km away from Delnice. A further 12 km away is Brodna Kupi, and the start of the "Jansa road," which leads to Slovenia. The weapons reach Kocevska Reka chiefly along two routes. The first and shortest runs through the port of Capodistria [Koper], where there are a number of warehouses -- which it is inadvisable to approach -- under constant surveillance by armed guards. The second route is from Hungary and brings Soviet-manufactured weapons that used to equip all the armies of the East, including the Yugoslav Federal Army. Germany and Austria Arm Slovenia There is a third route, from Austria and Germany. The Slovene economy has been taken under the protective wing of the Deutsche mark area, and it is no secret to anyone that Ljubljana's armed forces are equipped with Austrian vehicles: It is enough to look at the off-road vehicles and trucks that comprise the military convoys. However, there is no proof that weapons from Vienna or Bonn reach the bazaar at Kocevska Reka. However, behind all this weapons trafficking, there is apparently former Ljubljana Defense Minister Janez Jansa, who was thrown out of the Slovene Government three weeks ago. It is he above all who should be given credit for the rapid Slovene victory over the federal-Serbian troops between the end of June and the beginning of July 1991. Independence cost Ljubljana some 10 days of war and seven lives. There were 46 casualties on the Serbian side -- a trifle, compared to what has happened in Croatia and in the massacres in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Slovenia continued for a while to accumulate weapons, but soon the war shifted far from its borders. Then Ljubljana was able to begin a profitable trade. Its main clients are Croatia and Bosnia. But there are people willing to swear that weapons from Ljubljana have gone to Serbia too. Certainly, Serbian goods, having passed via Hungary, do end up in Slovene stores, and Slovene goods supplement Serbian contraband. A few months ago a couple of Serbian traders introduced themselves to the Slovene concessionaire of a very well known American sports shoe manufacturer; they bought 3,000 pairs, paid for them in cash, loaded them onto a truck, and left for Serbia. Nepalese and Ukrainian soldiers monitor the UN blockade along the Hungarian-Serb borders. Many people maintain that these soldiers, who suffer chronic poverty in their own countries, are not unresponsive to the rustle of dollar bills. In other words, just as shoes get by, so too could rifles. The fact that not everything was clear in relations between Jansa and Belgrade is confirmed also by the Belgrade daily POLITIKA, which has been cited at length by Ljubljana radio. The police of the Serbian-Montenegrin confederation arrested Bazodar Spasic, apparently a senior agent of the UBDA, the former Yugoslav secret service. He was in possession not only of photographs showing a number of Slovene leaders in the company of prostitutes, but also of documentary evidence of contacts between Ljubljana's defense minister and the Serbian secret services. This information comes from a Serbian source and is unconfirmed, but it is somewhat significant if set within the broader context of secret relations between the republics of the former Yugoslavia. Sometimes the arms trafficking mechanism breaks down. This happened, for instance, when 11 containers carrying 120 metric tons of weapons destined for the Bosnian Muslims were seized at Maribor airport. This caused a considerable political scandal in Slovenia, involving Jansa and former Interior Minister Igor Bavcar. According to reports in the Slovene press, the VIS (Ljubljana's secret service) strongly "advised against" checking and monitoring consignments of "humanitarian aid" leaving Maribor airport for Bosnia-Herzegovina. There was an attempt to blame everything on the VIS chief in Maribor, Silvo Komar, and on Bosnia's representative in Slovenia, Hasan Cengic. Former VIS Director Miha Brejc said that he knows absolutely nothing about any arms trafficking. But then he added a remark that directly implicates Jansa and Bavcar: "Is it conceivable that in such important and delicate matters anything could happen without the agreement of the political leadership?" "I Acted in the Interests of the Slovene State" Komar was described by Jansa as the "owner of the 120 tons of weapons." But after a long silence, Komar replied in the weekly MLADINA: "All my actions," he argued, "and those of our service were carried out on the basis of a rigid hierarchical responsibility and on the instructions of the head of the service at the time. I was told that everything that went on was in the interests of the Slovene state. Since the weapons were discovered, I think that Jansa and Brejc know much more about them than I do." When questioned as a witness by the court in Maribor, Jansa, not knowing what to say, accused the investigating magistrate of misdirecting the inquiry and of being ill acquainted with the Slovene laws governing arms exports. Jansa also accused the magistrate of having indirectly helped the Bosnian Hasan Cengic, an arms dealer "against whom the Slovene bodies concerned have issued an international arrest warrant." It may have been a coincidence, but two days before his statement Jansa received a letter from the president of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Alia Izetbegovic said that he was surprised by the arrest warrant issued against Cengic and pointed out that the Slovene Government leaders were fully aware that Cengic was Bosnia's authorized representative and was acting on the Sarajevo government's behalf within the context of Slovene laws. So it was not private trafficking on Cengic's own account, as Jansa maintained. According to the official account, the seizure took place because Ljubljana's Defense Ministry received an anonymous message identifying the location of the secret consignment. According to Croatian sources, however, the Slovenes thus got themselves out of trouble after selling the same consignment of weapons twice -- to the Bosnians and the Croats.
