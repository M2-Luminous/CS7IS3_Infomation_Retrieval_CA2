FR940428-0-00038 FR940428-0-00014 (1) Installation of Stage II Controls and Determination of Regulated Facilities Facilities that dispense more than 10,000 gallons per month must install and operate Stage II controls. For gasoline dispensing facilities that are owned and operated by an ISBMG, the State may establish a cut-point as high as 50,000 gallons per month. Section 324(c) of the Act establishes a definition of a ISBMG as a person engaged in the marketing of gasoline who would be required to pay for the installation and operation of Stage II equipment. There are four exemptions to this definition (i.e., four groups that will not be considered ISBMGs): (1) A refiner; (2) a person who controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a refiner; (3) a person who otherwise is directly or indirectly affiliated with a refiner or a person who controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a refiner (unless the sole affiliation is by means of a supply contract or an agreement or contract to use trademark, trade name, service mark, or other identifying symbol or name owned by such refiner or any such person); or (4) a person who receives less than 50 percent of this annual income from refining or marketing of gasoline. In the General Preamble, USEPA indicated that the suggested method for calculating the gallons per month dispensed by affected facilities is determined by calculating the average volume of product dispensed per month for the 2-year period prior to the adoption of the rule by the State. (See General Preamble, 57 FR at 13514.) The Enforcement Guidance suggests that if sufficient data is not available for a full 2-year period, then the period should be extended to include a total of 24 months of activity, or the actual months of operation during that 2-year period should be used to calculate the facility's average gallons per month. (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 3.2.) (2) Establishment of a Time Schedule for Installation of Stage II Control Equipment Section 182(b)(3)(B) of the Act establishes three standard deadlines for the installation and application of Stage II controls, after adoption by the State of the Stage II requirements. The phase-in schedule given in the Act is the following: (a) 6 months after adoption for all facilities commencing construction after November 15, 1990; (b) 1 year after adoption for all facilities which dispense 100,000 gallons or more of gasoline per month; and (c) 2 years after adoption for all other facilities required to be regulated. For ISBMGs, section 324(a) of the Act provides that the phase in periods may be: (a) 33 percent of the facilities owned by an ISBMG by the end of the first year after the regulations take effect; (b) 66 percent of such facilities by the end of the second year; and (c) 100 percent of such facilities after the third year. (3) System Certification An approved system should be tested and certified so as to meet a minimum requirement of 95 percent emission reduction efficiency. The USEPA believes that this efficiency rate has been demonstrated to be feasible. As stated in the General Preamble, the States may achieve this by utilizing one of the following three alternatives: (a) A method tested and approved by CARB past, current or future recognized testing methods, or (b) an equivalent testing program adopted by the State, conducted by the Program Oversight Agency (POA) or by a third party recognized by the POA, and submitted and approved by USEPA for incorporation in the SIP, or (c) a system approved by CARB. (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 4.2.) (4) Facility Verification of the Proper Installation and Function of Stage II Vapor Control Systems The General Preamble indicates in order for the State Stage II requirements to be enforceable, the State must require the regulated facility to verify proper installation and function of the Stage II equipment. The Enforcement Guidance specifies performing a Liquid Blockage Test which determines if there is an unacceptable low point in the piping, and a Leak Test which measures the vapor tightness of the Stage II system. The Enforcement Guidance also states that a facility should recertify the functions of the Stage II equipment as least every 5 years, or upon major system replacement or facility modification (75 percent or more of the facility's Stage II equipment), whichever occurs first. (See April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13514) General Preamble, and; Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 8.2.) (5) Recordkeeping and Reporting In the Enforcement Guidance, USEPA identifies various records that the State should require facilities to keep and to make available upon request. The USEPA believes that these documents must be available in order to make the Stage II requirement enforceable. These documents include: (a) A license/permit to install and operate the Stage II system; (b) verification of passing functional tests after installation of equipment, this includes the Liquid Blockage Test, Leak Test, and all shutoff/flow prohibiting devise testing; (c) a general station file containing initial station information such as motor vehicle fuel throughput information; (d) an equipment maintenance and compliance file log containing verification that proper maintenance has been conducted in accordance with manufacturer's specifications and requirements; and (e) training certification files. (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 8.0.) (6) Periodic Inspection of Regulated Facility The State POA should conduct a minimum of 1 compliance inspection per facility per year with mandatory follow-up at stations with violations. USEPA believes such inspections are necessary to ensure that facilities are complying with the Stage II requirements. This is necessary not only for enforcement action but to notify sources that are violating the Stage II requirements so they can make the necessary adjustments to come into compliance. The compliance inspection should consist of a visual inspection of the required paperwork and Stage I and II equipment. In addition to the visual inspection, a functional inspection to determine if the facility's Stage II equipment is functioning properly must also be performed. (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 5.2(d).) (7) Regulated Facility Compliance The State is required to ensure regulated facility compliance with program requirements through enforcement mechanisms, and a penalty schedule that establishes appropriate penalties for facilities violating the Stage II requirements. (See Enforcement Guidance, Sec. 5.2(e).)
