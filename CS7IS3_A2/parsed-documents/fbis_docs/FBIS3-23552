There were more bullets than people on the streets of blockaded Stepanakert. Serzh said to me: "We are being shot at like in a shooting gallery. But all this will end soon. We will take Shusha (the city fort, a former health resort on a high hill overlooking Stepanakert--Mikhail Serdyukov)." Shusha seemed to be and was inaccessible. There was incessant firing from there: cannons, "barrages," and when the snipers aimed, it was always for the forehead. Only an out-and-out Suvorov or a totally mad descendant would dare to assault this monster. Serzh is a person without extremes. He just established an army of self-defense forces of Artsakh. He is a philologist. They took Shusha. And a lot more. They moved military operations beyond the boundaries of Nagorno-Karabakh. Serzhik became a national hero. Researchers will also study the phenomenon of this commander. But for the present... For the present, there is a new blockade. Of all Armenia already. An economic blockade, and it is the most merciless. There is no light or gas, and there is little to eat. The army is shattered. The president of the republic invites Serzh Sarkisyan to the post of minister of defense of Armenia. He is surprised, but he leaves his family in Stepanakert and goes to frozen Yerevan. This is where we met. [Serdyukov] I have already been warned: It is the practice in the higher echelons of Armenian authority to use strictly official forms of address: "Mr. President, Mr. Minister." How should I address you? [Sarkisyan] As an old friend. [Serdyukov] Thank you, Serzhik. What kind of songs is the minister of defense singing today? [Sarkisyan] I am still a long way off from a personal performance. But I like to listen to the White Guard's songs. Malinin's, for example. [Serdyukov] He sings sincerely: "Why do we, lieutenant, need foreign land?" If I readdress this question to you--will you be able to answer it? [Sarkisyan] Go ahead and ask: Why did you seize Azerbaijani territory. In autumn of 1992 we were able to stop the Azerbaijani Army and got an opportunity to keep Nagorno-Karabakh. But how was this to be done? After all, Stepanakert was being battered by cannon from the well-known Agdam--point-blank. You even took a picture of a little girl with a broken leg--have you forgotten? [Serdyukov] Can you really forget such a thing? Do you know how she is living now? [Sarkisyan] She is alive. But others died. Azerbaijani Army groups that were concentrated on our borders continued to hit cities and villages. After all, every sector of the republic was fired on from there. And that could have gone on endlessly. It is impossible to compare Azerbaijan's military potential in any way even with that of Armenia, not to mention the NKR [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]. There are not many Karabakh residents. And there was only one solution: Only through bravery and attack could we demoralize the huge Azerbaijani force. We circulated the disinformation that allegedly we were appeased. We said that we expected the next attack of the Azerbaijani Army in the spring of 1993. And we gave assurances: They will not attack us in the winter and, of course, everyone could ease up... [Serdyukov] And did they take the bait? [Sarkisyan] Yes. In January of 1993 the Azerbaijanis began a powerful offensive in the firm conviction that we were not ready to repel them. Within two weeks they were completely exhausted. We launched a counteroffensive. The aim was to straighten out the front. This required going outside the NKR's boundaries. [Serdyukov] You really got outside them very well! You captured up to one-fifth of the entire Republic of Azerbaijan. You were suddenly transformed from defenders of your own land to aggressors. [Sarkisyan] Of course, for Azerbaijan, this is aggression. Although there is a nuance: After all, they do not recognize the NKR as an independent state, and continue to consider the Karabakh people as their subjects. So, what kind of aggression is this? Our people against our people. I will say frankly: We do not need their land. We were simply ensuring the safety of our families. And supplying the army with captured weapons. Furthermore, Karabakh has been completely destroyed and burned down. Three years of war is no joke. But with what does one rebuild? At whose expense? There is nothing in Armenia, and the mice are dying from hunger in empty cornbins. There was only one solution: Get the building materials in Azerbaijan. [Serdyukov] In Azerbaijan they think they are fighting against Armenia. [Sarkisyan] They can be understood. It is embarrassing to admit that, having such a powerful military potential, they cannot achieve victory over tiny Karabakh. Although I know: They clearly realize this among themselves. They do not want to admit publicly in Baku that they are at war with Karabakh. After all, they have been unable up to now to take even one Armenian soldier captive. I met with the minister of defense of Azerbaijan in Tbilisi recently at the initiative of Russian General Reut. He tried to prove to me that regular subunits of the Armenian Army were participating in the war. He showed me the identity papers of a captured soldier with the inscription "Volunteer." A passport with the registration is Yerevan. I explained to him simply, in the Russian language--in the presence of Reut: We have many prisoners, both Russian and Ukrainian, but I am not saying that Karabakh is at war with Russia or with Ukraine. [Serdyukov] Does this mean that you did not succeed in coming closer to an agreement with your Azerbaijani colleague? [Sarkisyan] We did not achieve anything. This meeting was an initiative of the Russian general. His personal initiative. Without any authority from Moscow. As he said: "He has great personal desire for this war to end more quickly." [Serdyukov] But what about you, do you have another desire? [Sarkisyan] God forbid! And the Azerbaijan minister of defense wants the same. [Serdyukov] A paradox: Everyone wants peace, and the carnage continues. [Sarkisyan] The trouble is that an end to the war means different things for us and for them. For Karabakh, the end of the war is recognition of independence. But for Azerbaijan, as their minister of defense put it, "the return of all of the administrative units, including Karabakh as well..." [Serdyukov] But this is a closed circle! With the arrival of Geydar Aliyev, a cautious person, the hope has emerged in you personally that you will finally come to an agreement? [Sarkisyan] When he came to power I did have this kind of hope. Alas, it has now been dispelled. Under Aliyev, Azerbaijan ended up completely militarized. Everything there is now absolutely subordinated to war. The people, the economy. [Serdyukov] Are there really no prospects? [Sarkisyan] I do not see any, and there is already no choice now even for Aliyev. Because many people perished during his time. He has to have at least some kind of justification for this. I am confident that if in a month Azerbaijan loses a million or two million soldiers, but at the same time returns some part of their territory, no one will begin to reproach Aliyev. The sacrifices will be justified. But if he does not succeed in achieving anything, he will be held responsible, as others were. [Serdyukov] What millions are you talking about? What is this, world war? [Sarkisyan] But already today almost twice as many have been killed in Azerbaijan as in the whole war in Afghanistan. According to the most conservative figures, 25,000-26,000! And in Aliyev's opinion, 3,500 persons are in captivity in Karabakh, 800--in Armenia. [Serdyukov] But how many in fact? [Sarkisyan] We do not have that many prisoners. He is confusing them with those who are missing in action. But we even earlier asked to gather up the bodies. However, the Azerbaijanis did not do this. Why? Well, so that the people would have no idea of the extent of their own losses. And they are not gathering up the bodies now. Although Karabakh is ready to grant this opportunity at any time. [Serdyukov] How big are Armenia's losses? [Sarkisyan] One of ours against 12 Azerbaijanis. [Serdyukov] Serzhik, what about a campaign against Baku? While sitting at one time at a Karabakh table I also had occasion to hear this outlook from the mouths of soldiers of the self-defense army. [Sarkisyan] This was a joke, very likely, a drunken one. You understand, Azerbaijan has an objective, and after achieving it, it will conclude the war. Enter Stepanakert--that is all. Period! Karabakh does not have an objective at present. It has one task: to stand at the present line and repel attacks. There is no point now for a Karabakh soldier to reach so that the war will end. We do not need Baku, nor on the whole even one centimeter of land. And the Karabakhs will return all the territory of Azerbaijan without vacillation as soon as they receive guarantees that they will not shoot in the direction of their motherland. [Serdyukov] What kind of guarantees are you talking about? [Sarkisyan] Recognizing the Karabakh Republic. The introduction of peacekeeping forces in the area of conflict. We cannot believe in words anymore. After all, even in the Azerbaijan system Karabakh was autonomous and had some guarantees according to the USSR Constitution. [Serdyukov] I have already been shivering with cold with everybody in Armenia for a week. I met quite a few Yerevan people who curse the war to the hilt. They are convinced that it is precisely Karabakh that brought them to complete impoverishment, chronic freezing, and a life of semistarvation. Do you not consider the possibility of exacerbating Armenian-Karabakh relations? [Sarkisyan] Now is not the time for division. Only unity will save us today. And the leadership of Armenia declared more than once that it agrees to any decisions at which the two belligerents arrive. There would be peace. [Serdyukov] Will it not become boring for you to live in peace and quiet? What will you occupy yourself with, as minister of defense? Or as philologist Serzhik Sarkisyan? [Sarkisyan] I have not thought about this. But I know one thing: The first day of peace will be the happiest day of my life. But as a philologist, perhaps I have lost many professional qualities. [Serdyukov] What is your specialization? [Sarkisyan] The Armenian language and literature. I graduated from the University of Yerevan and returned home--you know how closely I was watched in Karabakh by the Azerbaijani leaders. To them, a person who received his education in Armenia and had some ideas and national habits was considered a social outcast. But I was invited to the city party committee of the Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League], and I became the supervisor of the sports and mass-defense branch. Then I became the secretary. There I really felt the pressure. All "lucrative" positions went only to one's own. They spat on the Armenian language. It was forbidden to write and speak it. But after all, Armenians living in the NKAO [Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast] comprised 70 percent of the total population. [Serdyukov] Peace is as good a time as any for language. But what will you do with the uniform of a military minister? [Sarkisyan] Well, I do not have any kind of uniform. Remember the old camouflage uniform I wore in Karabakh? It is in my wardrobe. This is my entire military dress. [Serdyukov] But what about the gold shoulderboards? After all, the minister has some kind of rank? [Sarkisyan] Captain of the Reserve. But this goes back to peaceful times long ago. What am I supposed to do, confer a rank upon myself? How could I then look into the eyes of the professional military? After the capture of Shusha, while still in Karabakh, they wanted to promote me to general--I refused. I consider myself a civilian to this day. But I became military, even if the minister, out of necessity. On the other hand, when I meet with ministers of defense of other states (they are all marshals), I am not intimidated. I am dressed in civilian clothes, and I converse with them as an equal. Military rank obligates one to something. And then I am not a particular expert in military commands. I show up among the troops in a regular suit. [Serdyukov] But how do you command... without commands? [Sarkisyan] My favorite command is "forward!" Everyone knows this. [Serdyukov] Is this when, pistol in hand, you lead soldiers in an attack? [Sarkisyan] That also has happened. But I was not minister of defense of Armenia at the time. [Serdyukov] Were there many military in your family? [Sarkisyan] Not one. A grandfather was shot in 1937. He was a shepherd. My father was a blacksmith since the age of 13. He has been on pension a long time, but until now he has been in the Stepanakert defense rayon repairing weapons. Mama has worked all her life at the silk combine. In Nagorno-Karabakh. My wife, a music teacher, and two of my daughters are there now. [Serdyukov] Why do you not take them to Yerevan? [Sarkisyan] It is warmer there. And although the bombing has started again, both daughters are going to school. No one will be going to school in Armenia before spring. [Serdyukov] But the territory of Armenia is also being fired on now. We already have the first victims. Is yet another war starting? [Sarkisyan] We could respond to these provocations with power strikes. But, after all, this will really lead to a wide-scale war. I see two reasons here. With these incidents, the Azerbaijanis, thinking that our army is fighting in Karabakh, are allegedly trying to draw off some of our forces. And to show to the whole world that they are fighting Armenia, but not Karabakh. We are avoiding such a war in every possible way. Although I should put our aircraft into the air, and a strike from which they will not recover quickly will be delivered. [Serdyukov] Are the pilots, excuse the stupid question, Russian? [Sarkisyan] You are being insulting. They are all Armenian. [Serdyukov] Incidentally, nothing has been heard for a long time about the pilots who were knocked down in the Stepanakert skies--a Russian and a Ukrainian. I met with one of them, pilot Bilichenko, two years ago in prison. He was convinced he would be shot. [Sarkisyan] Of course, they are criminals. But I think that their life should be spared. But this is not their war, why did they get into it? [Serdyukov] And are the mujahidin fighting in Karabakh now? [Sarkisyan] Afghanistan has not admitted this fact officially. I think they are right. After all, a mujahidin is not a soldier of the Afghan Army. They are ordinary mercenaries. [Serdyukov] Have you succeeded in taking any of them captive? [Sarkisyan] Not for the time being. They fight in the rear. They stand as defensive detachments, and they shoot retreating Azerbaijani soldiers. But there is a captive Turkish officer. I know for a certainty: There are many Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian officers fighting. [Serdyukov] Do you have enough such volunteers on your part? [Sarkisyan] We do not have mujahidin, believe me. [Serdyukov] Tell me, please, is your army helping Karabakh with weapons? [Sarkisyan] We acquired some things for them in third countries, in the West. But this is meager in comparison with what the Azerbaijanis are losing themselves and what the Karabakhs acquire after successful strikes of the NKR defense army. This is on the order of 120 tanks, powerful artillery, and whole depots of infantry weapons and ammunition. Even the Armenian Army does not have such stores of weapons as there are now in Karabakh. [Serdyukov] But where did Azerbaijan get so many weapons? [Sarkisyan] They do not have to go far. A hundred tanks were acquired recently in Ukraine. Also aircraft and ammunition. Incidentally, they do not deny this there. They justify it by the difficult economic situation. In addition, according to the information of prisoners and captured materiel, it can be said that Azerbaijan acquired many new T-72 tanks. Where? It is obvious to us: Russia. For example, in Nikolayev they received BMP-2's [infantry combat vehicle] not so long ago. Ammunition was delivered from Tula. [Serdyukov] Does our Grachev deny all this? [Sarkisyan] Of course. The entire Russian leadership, civilian and military, flatly refuse to admit their military assistance to Azerbaijan. It is just a pity that your country does not take one thing into account: Our enemy is acquiring weapons not only from the countries of the near abroad. In China--assault rifles. In the Czech Republic--machine guns and grenade launchers produced in 1993. All this firepower falls on tiny Karabakh. But how is one to understand this from the human standpoint? [Serdyukov] Well, fine, but did you not have a conversation in this regard with Grachev himself. By telephone, but man-to-man? [Sarkisyan] Our president engages in this. But I think that if there was a conversation with Grachev, it would not have changed very much. The chaos that exists in the arms trade, in my opinion, cannot even be controlled by the minister of defense of Russia. [Serdyukov] If you had the opportunity to talk with our president, what would you say to him? [Sarkisyan] I want to request one thing of Yeltsin and of all Russians: Act in such a way that our Karabakh does not perish. You are powerful. Help us. [Serdyukov] I know that general mobilization was declared in Azerbaijan a long time ago. What is the case in this respect in Armenia? [Sarkisyan] The minister of defense does not need this. For the time being. But it is difficult for me to guess what will occur tomorrow. [Serdyukov] Have you gotten very tired in recent years? Do you have a desire to lie in bed for a few days and at least once to sleep as much as you want? [Sarkisyan] I would not refuse, of course. I do not get more than five hours of sleep a day. But then I think of the boys who are fighting today in the mountains in 40 degrees of frost. For two-three months in the forward area... [Serdyukov] What is your biggest misfortune in life--what is it associated with? [Sarkisyan] I have lost so many friends in recent years. These were fellows who deserved to live. The sadness is not to meet with them anymore on this earth. [Serdyukov] Serzhik, for these years of the war, your chest should be glistening with medals. [Sarkisyan] But there are no combat decorations in Armenia. There are in Karabakh: combat crosses of the first and second degree. Azerbaijan has the title of national hero. They are fine fellows. [Serdyukov] And what cross do you have? [Sarkisyan] Imagine, I have none. [Serdyukov] And if you had some free time, what would you engage in? [Sarkisyan] I would go hunting in our Karabakh forests. There is no more beautiful place on earth. With Robert Kocharyan, my boyhood friend. He shoots very accurately. With a rifle. [Serdyukov] Better than you? [Sarkisyan] We have not competed for a long time. [Serdyukov] Did you have occasion to shoot in the war? [Sarkisyan] Rarely--but it happened. [Serdyukov] Do you get a chance to read books? [Sarkisyan] To my great regret, no. [Serdyukov] And you have probably not seen your family for a long time? [Sarkisyan] I have a real Armenian family. The husband commands in it. I like this most of all. [Serdyukov] Do you really have little to command at work? [Sarkisyan] Too much. [Serdyukov] But what is the matter? [Sarkisyan] The fact that when I turn my ardor to my family, it means the war has ended.
