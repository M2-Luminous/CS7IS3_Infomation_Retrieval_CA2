The passenger use has decreased on all types of transport, with rail transport by 10 percent, air transport by 9.4 percent, and road transport by 2.5 percent. Experts believe that the decline in transport use is caused by price rises on rail and air transport that are ahead of people's ability to pay. In the first quarter railway freight transport has gone down by 22 percent and totalled 36.7 million tonnes. Maritime freight transport has seen a decrease of 4 million tonnes, or 19.7 percent, mainly caused by a decrease of 16 percent of the total number of available vessels. Another reason for the decrease in maritime transport is the fact that there was no imported grain and there was a drop of 47 percent in freight transport to the Far North and areas of equal status. Road transport accounted for 166 million tonnes of freight, which is 122 million tonnes, or 40 percent less than during the same period last year. The volume of freight transported by air was 95,000 tonnes, or 22 percent less than in the first quarter of last year.
