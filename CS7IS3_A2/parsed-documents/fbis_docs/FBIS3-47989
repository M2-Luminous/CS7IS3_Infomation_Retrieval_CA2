This seminar entitled "The Prospect for the North Korean Nuclear Issue and North-South Relations" was sponsored by the party policy committee. In the seminar, lawmaker Pak Sil said that "because there is a possible breakthrough in the settlement of the nuclear issue as a result of North Korea's acceptance of the nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the government must allow businessmen to visit North Korea." He predicted that "because this year is the year in which there is no election in South Korea, in which the Kim Yong-sam government can strengthen its power, and in which North Korea can consolidate the transfer of power from Kim Il-song to his son, it is possible for the North and South to create conditions for the North-South summit talks."
