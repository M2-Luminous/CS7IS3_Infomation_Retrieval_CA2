"The Echo" program correspondent Kjell Albin Abrahamson reports from Ukraine. Abrahamson: Today Yeltsin is governing Russia, but tomorrow Zhirinovskiy may come to power. Today President Clinton is supporting Ukraine, but we know nothing about the next U.S. President. This was said by Ukrainian General (Oleksandr Rul), who will stand as a candidate of the super-nationalist Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists in the parliamentary elections. He now sees nationalism and nuclear weapons as the best guarantee for an independent and sovereign Ukraine. Most political parties here share that view, including the Republican Party -- an offshoot of the dissident movement -- and the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, which want Ukraine to retain some of its nearly 1,800 nuclear warheads. General (Rul) points out: It is us, not you who are in the immediate frontline in the event of a Russian attack.
