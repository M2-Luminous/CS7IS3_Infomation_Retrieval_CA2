In a meeting with Liu Peng, the visiting president of the All-China Youth Federation, Hata was quoted as saying, "Japan must tell the generations of its offspring that such incidents (acts of aggression) occurred." The two met at his official residence. Liu told Hata he was "surprised" at the remark by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, who caused widespread anger by calling the 1937 Nanjing massacre a "fabrication." Nagano resigned Saturday and was replaced by Hiroshi Nakai. "The remark was made by an elderly man and I know that Japanese youth does not have such a perception," Liu was quoted as saying. In an interview with the mass-circulation daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN published May 4, Nagano said the actions of the Imperial Japanese Army was aimed at liberating Asian countries from Western colonialism. Hata told Liu Japan "feels deep repentance" over the Nagano remarks and is determined not to repeat a war of aggression.
