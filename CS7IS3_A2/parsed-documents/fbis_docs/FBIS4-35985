It says that the objectives of these actions are obvious, and will only bolster Lebanon's national unity and its rejection of any concessions regarding the resistance or the peace process. In a comment today, the paper writes on Israel's hostile intentions and actions. It says: All analysts, particularly the international analysts, agree that Israel's aggressions, particularly against the Arab sides participating in the peace process, which adhere to that process, clearly prove that Israel has premeditated intentions to destroy the available opportunity to achieve peace. The newspaper TISHRIN writes on the massacre Israel has perpetrated in the city of Ba'labakk. It stresses that this massacre dealt a great blow to the peace process, and that its timing makes it obvious that it was a stab in the back of the United States' efforts to save the peace process from the stalemate caused by the Israeli rejection of the pillars of a just and comprehensive peace. TISHRIN says: By escalating its aggressive and brutal acts, and declaring a continuous war against Lebanon, Israel is trying to direct its missiles, guns, and bombers to assassinate the peace process this time, after it has failed to derail this process from the set objectives confirmed in documents and pledges. TISHRIN stresses: There is no doubt that the abortion of the peace process by escalating the situation, launching devastating Israeli wars, kidnapping resistance men, and killing innocent people, necessitate that the international community link its words with deeds, pressuring Israel to stop this aggressive, brutal policy, and to respond to the pillars of a just and comprehensive peace. TISHRIN notes: In light of the Israeli attempts and the Israeli occupation forces' brutal actions to torpedo the peace process, the United States, which stressed the need to continue its efforts, and said that its role has not been exhausted, must now, before anyone else, hasten to save this process from the Israeli shelling and to prevent its destruction. This can only be achieved by deterring the Israeli Government and curbing its provocative practices.
