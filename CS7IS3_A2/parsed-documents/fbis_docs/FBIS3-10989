"The Defense Ministry has already denied such accusations. It clearly stated that there will not be unreasonable actions against them or that there will be any persecution," he added. In paid advertisements, CPR members claim that since 10 February, there have been "large military mobilizations" apparently aimed at subjecting them to military control, preventing them from rebuilding the Ixcan Grande Cooperative, and stopping more refugees from returning. Herbruger noted that far from organizing acts to intimidate or affect these people, the government is involved in efforts to protect them. Deputy Foreign Minister Bernardo Arevalo also said the members of the OAS Inter-American Human Rights Commission (CIDH), who recently visited these communities, did not tell the Foreign Ministry about similar complaints. Arevalo said that in the letter requesting permission to visit the CPR's, the CIDH did not mention this as a motive and only limited itself to saying that it wanted to observe the reintegration of refugees into the communities process.
