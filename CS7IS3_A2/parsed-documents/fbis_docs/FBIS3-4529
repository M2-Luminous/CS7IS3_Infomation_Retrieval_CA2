His visit lasted nine days from 23 February to 4 March, which was not long, but he set off an upsurge, that is, a "China fever", in Japan. Zhu Rongji's visit to Japan came at a period of historical transition. As the Cold War is over and the role of economic factors is getting more and more important, Japan is still exploring what kind of development strategy it is going to take. Moreover, in view of the latest situation, Japan is forced to make quick decisions. Trade friction between the United States and Japan is becoming increasingly acute, the United States has decided to impose sanctions on Japan and force the yen to appreciate to deal a blow against Japanese exports. However, the Japanese economy is in a state of recession, and, in the wake of last year's negative growth, the situation this year is grimmer. Japan must blaze a new trail if it wants to extricate itself from the dilemma. The rapid rise of the Chinese economy gives Japan an historical opportunity. Although far-sighted Japanese enterprises identify the bright prospects of China, many people still have doubts and misgivings: Whether or not China can curb inflation to ensure social stability and healthy economic development. Whether or not China's monetary and foreign exchange reform will infringe on foreign business interests. Whether or not a developed China will become a competitor of Japan, thus infringing on Japan's economic interests. Such misgivings were reflected in the Japanese press prior to Zhu Rongji's visit to Japan. During his visit, Zhu Rongji called on Japanese Emperor Akihito and met Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, and key government and public figures. The sides reached a consensus in many respects. Meanwhile, a noticeable characteristic of Zhu Rongji's visit was his extensive contact and profound exchange with figures of Japanese economic circles. When Zhu Rongji visited Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka, Japan's national as well as local economic groups, large financial groups, and major banks displayed unprecedented zeal in welcoming him and discussing with him issues of trade and economic cooperation between the two countries. Such a scene has seldom been seen in Japanese economic circles since Sino-Japanese relations were normalized. When a lecture by Zhu Rongji was jointly organized by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN [JAPAN ECONOMIC NEWS], the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and the Japanese Foreign Ministry, more than 2,700 people, mainly from Japanese economic circles, wanted to attend, but due to the limited space of the prearranged assembly hall, only 900 or so were given such a chance. At the lecture, the atmosphere was friendly and lively, and people constantly responded to Zhu's speech with warm applause. During his visit to Japan, Zhu Rongji met as many as 280 leading figures of large Japanese enterprises, groups, corporations, and banks, and sometimes 12 such meetings a day were arranged, whereas over 1,500 people from Japanese economic circles directly attended Zhu Rongji's lectures or listened to his speeches. Through contacts and informal discussions with figures from the Japanese economic circles, Zhu Rongji briefed them on the situation of China's reform and opening up, measures taken to curb inflation, policies formulated to protect foreign business interests, and so on. Moreover, he helped figures from Japanese economic circles understand that if Japan wants to get over the current economic recession, it must, apart from taking the old method of stimulating demand, lay stress on readjusting its industrial structure, that is, it must shift its focus away from manufacturing industries, turn to industries with higher surplus value, enhance its products' competitive power, and open up to the overseas market. Meanwhile, Japan must focus on the Asian region, particularly on economic cooperation with China, because the Asian region, especially China, is the most vigorous and most rapidly developing place in the present global economy. As proved by the facts over the past two years, such economic cooperation is the most effective means to reinvigorate the Japanese economy. Once he arrived in the Kansai Region of Japan, Zhu Rongji immediately found that although Japan was in an economic recession, Kansai was still the most dynamic economic region in Japan. One of the reasons is that this region's economic and trade activities with China now accounts for 40 percent of its overall external economic activities. With the rapid development of the Chinese economy, Zhu Rongji told Japanese economic circles, last year three records were broken on an unprecedented scale in terms of Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations. First, Sino-Japanese trade volume reached a historical record of $39 billion. Japan became the No. 1 trade partner of China, whereas China became the No. 2 trade partner of Japan for the first time. Second, Japan's technology export trade to China accounted for 28 percent of China's technology imports, which ranked first. Another point is that the rate of realizable funds given by Japanese enterprises to China ranked first. Zhu Rongji stressed that the rapid development of Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations not only benefited China, but also contributed to the revitalization of the Japanese economy. Zhu Rongji told Japanese economic circles on many occasions during his visit that Sino-Japanese trade volume, which amounted to $39 billion, was not large enough and was even very small compared with the potential of Sino-Japanese cooperation. He reckoned that according to the present trend of development, Sino-Japanese trade volume may reach $390 billion within the next decade and China would become the No. 1 trade partner of Japan. Zhu Rongji added that Japan transferred its technology to China mainly through cooperation in production and setting up joint ventures, which would only enhance the competitive power of Japanese products in overseas market. He said that China and Japan, which cooperated with each other in developing the global market, were partners of equality and mutual benefit rather than competitors. These insider's remarks made by Zhu Rongji helped Japanese economic circles dispel their doubts. During Zhu Rongji's stay in Japan, television stations, radio stations, and newspapers from all over Japan vigorously reported news related to his visit and, in particular, focused on reporting how his visit helped promote economic and trade relations between the two countries. A commentary published by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said: "Vice Premier Zhu's convincing explanation and humorous wording helped dispel people's doubts." Keizo Tomiyasu, president of Japan's Shin Goyo Corporation, said after listening to Zhu Rongji's speech: "Last year, our company's trade volume with China was approximately 15 billion yen. This year, the trade volume will double, and in the next two years, we will strive to explore new fields of cooperation." Authoritative figures from Japanese economic circles predicted that within the next five years, investments made by Japanese enterprises in China would outstrip that of ASEAN. The clouds have been dispersed and the blue sky is shown. We can expect that Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations will advance to a new stage of development soon.
