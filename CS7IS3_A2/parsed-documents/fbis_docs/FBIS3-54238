FBIS3-54238 "drnes016_l_94013" FBIS-NES-94-016 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 ISRAEL IDF Reports Provide Casualty Data for 1993 TA2001180194 TA2001180194 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Three reports in Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ and one in Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 20 January carry data presented by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] on the number of incidents and casualties during military activity in 1993. A report from the Knesset by Gid'on Alon and Tzvi Zrahya on page A6 of HA'ARETZ cites a report presented yesterday to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee by Major General Yoram Ya'ir, head of the IDF Personnel Branch. According to the report, "45 IDF soldiers were killed in enemy activity last year; 26 of them were killed in the security zone in south Lebanon and 19 were killed in the territories of Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip." The figures indicate a "significant rise in the number of IDF casualties from enemy activity; 24 soldiers were killed in 1992, and 11 in 1991." Gen. Ya'ir further reports that, compared to 37 fatalities due to accidents in 1992, 17 IDF soldiers were killed in accidents in 1993, according to the following breakdown: seven soldiers were killed in military traffic accidents, five in operational accidents, three in gun and ammunition accidents, one in a labor accident, and one other was electrocuted. "Gen. Ya'ir noted with satisfaction that not a single soldier was killed in training accidents last year (as compared to 10 fatalities in 1992)." The report cites Gen. Ya'ir as saying that "despite the efforts the IDF has made to prevent suicides, 38 soldiers committed suicide last year (31 standing Army, four career soldiers, and three reservists)." Ya'ir notes that in only two of the cases, a direct link was established between the suicide and the soldier's military service. Knesset correspondent Gabi Bron and military correspondent Arye Kiesel write on page 13 of YEDI'OT AHARONOT: "In 1993, there was a dramatic rise in reports of 'near casualty' in IDF accidents: 1,080, as compared to several hundred in 1992." The report further says that "in 1993, there was a dramatic drop in the number of aerial accidents in the IDF, when compared to the dozens of such accidents in the 1970's and 1980's. The damage caused by fatal aerial accidents last year stands at $14 million, as compared with $170 million in damages by the end of the 1970's." Citing data presented by "officers at the Central Command summing up last year's statistics," HA'ARETZ military correspondent Eytan Rabin writes on page A5: "In 1993, there was a rise in the number of armed terror attacks against Israeli targets in the territories. At the same time, there was a 48-percent drop in the total number of terror attacks, as compared to 1992." Rabin says that "the majority of terror attacks in the territories in 1993 was directed against the Jewish settlers, and 15 of the 20 military and civilian fatalities were killed in armed attacks." The report cites the following figures for last year: there were 994 attacks against IDF troops and collaborators, as compared with 1,917 in 1992; 16,253 stone-throwing incidents and riots were registered in 1993, compared with 19,627 in 1992; and in 1993, the IDF arrested 4,410 Palestinian residents. The correspondent adds that, leading last year's armed terror attacks, were fugitives from the various terror organizations. He adds that the security forces managed to foil "a large number of attacks by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. The number of these attacks rose after the closure was imposed on the territories." The report adds that most of the Hamas fugitives were killed in IDF operations or suicide attacks last year. The report adds that "153 incidents in which settlers rioted were registered in 1993. Of them, seven included the use of fire arms, and damage was caused to 34 cars and 10 houses." Eytan Rabin cites another IDF document on page A1 of HA'ARETZ, which says that in 1993, 400 Palestinians were hurt in the West Bank; 64 of them were killed, 50 were seriously injured, and 286 were lightly to moderately injured. "The document indicates that between July and December 1993, eight Palestinian children under 10 years of age were shot by IDF troops, and at least two of them were killed." "An internal Central Command document" adds the following breakdown of Palestinian casualties of IDF fire: "21 aged between 11 and 16; 49 aged between 17 and 22; 30 aged between 23 and 35; and 23 were over 35 years old; at least two were over 80." "IDF data for 1993 indicates that 13 Israeli civilians were killed in shooting incidents in the territories, three were seriously injured, five were moderately wounded, and 19 suffered light injuries."
