FR941116-0-00036 FR941116-0-00006 This same commenter requests that proposed paragraph (b)(5) be revised by changing the phrase ``blue streak findings'' to ``horizontal blue streak findings'' when specifying which findings must be reported to maintenance. The commenter states that this change is necessary in order to differentiate between indications of leakage that has resulted from spills that occurred during servicing and indications of leakage that occurred during flight. Leakage that has occurred during flight would be indicated by horizontal blue streaks. The FAA concurs and has revised the terminology in the final rule accordingly. This commenter also requests that the proposed rule be revised by deleting the terms ``forward and aft'' when referring to ``each lavatory *␣*␣* having an in-line drain valve installed.'' This commenter states that some Model 727 aircraft have been built with an executive mid-cabin lavatory with an in-line drain valve. The FAA concurs and has revised the rule accordingly. The intent of the rule is clear that the related procedures are to be performed on ``each'' lavatory having the subject drain valve, regardless of where the lavatory is located on the airplane. This commenter further points out that the terms ``service panel drain valve,'' ``cap valve,'' and ``drain valve at the service panel'' are used in various places throughout the proposed rule to describe the same valve. The commenter suggests that, in order to be consistent, the rule be revised to call this valve ``the service panel drain valve'' in all pertinent references. The FAA concurs and has revised the final rule accordingly. For similar reasons, the final rule has been revised by changing the term ``ball valve'' to ``in-line drain valve'' in several places. Estimated Cost Figures Several operators state that the estimated cost impact of the rule, as presented in the preamble to the supplemental NPRM, is too low and should be revised to reflect estimates of the costs as submitted by these individual operators. The FAA does not concur that the estimated cost impact figure need to be revised. While it is reasonable to assume that the costs to some operators may be higher than those presented in this preamble, it is also reasonable to assume that the costs to other operators may be considerably lower. Therefore, the estimated cost impact represents an average for the U.S. fleet, based on the best data available to date. The FAA considers the cost impact estimate, as presented, to be sufficiently accurate for the purposes of this rulemaking action. Cost Impact There are approximately 1,752 Boeing Model 727 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet, operated by 153 operators. It is estimated that 1,277 airplanes of U.S. registry and 54 U.S. operators will be affected by this AD. The FAA estimates that it will take approximately 4 work hours per airplane lavatory drain (normally, there are 2 drains per airplane) to accomplish a leak check, at an average labor cost of $55 per work hour. Certain airplanes (i.e., those that have ``donut'' type of drain valve installed) may be required to be leak checked as many as 15 times each year. Certain other airplanes having other valve configurations will be required to be leak checked as few as 3 times each year. Some airplanes that have various combinations drain valves installed will require approximately 2 leak checks of one drain valve and 3 leak checks of the other drain valve each year. Based on these figures, the total annual (recurring) cost impact of the required repetitive leak checks on U.S. operators is estimated to be between $6,600 and $1,320 per airplane per year. The FAA estimates that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane lavatory drain to accomplish a visual inspection of the service panel drain valve cap/door seal and seal mating surfaces, at an average labor cost of $55 per work hour. As with leak checks, certain airplanes will be required to be visually inspected as many as 15 times or as few as 3 times each year. Based on these figures, the total annual (recurring) cost impact of the required repetitive visual inspections on U.S. operators is estimated to be between $825 and $165 per airplane per year. The 1,277 affected airplanes of U.S. registry have, on an average, 3 flush/fill lines per airplane. The FAA estimates that the installation of a level lock cap assembly will require approximately 2 work hours to accomplish, at an average labor cost of $55 per work hour. Required parts are estimated to be $275 per drain installation. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the requirement to install a cap on the flush/fill lines is estimated to be $1,474,935, or an average of $1,155 per airplane. The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the accomplishment of the actions proposed in this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' actions. However, in actual practice, these actions could be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of necessary ``additional'' work hours will be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling should be minimal. In addition to the costs discussed above, for those operators who elect to comply with proposed paragraph (b) of this AD action, the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 40 work hours per operator to incorporate the lavatory drain system leak check procedures into the maintenance programs, at an average labor cost of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed maintenance revision requirement of this AD action on the 54 U.S. operators is estimated to be $118,800, or $2,200 per operator.
