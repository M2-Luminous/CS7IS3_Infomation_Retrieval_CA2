However, not a single principle has been compromised or watered down. The amendments were accepted unanimously. [passage omitted] Article 3, which deals with the party's objectives, says: As a political national front of Afrikanerdom, the party encourages the Afrikaner nation to uphold and adhere to -- in politics and in other spheres of the nation's existence -- the following principles in the Republic of South Africa. On national identity, the right-wing again reaffirms its view: "Since it pleased God to create different peoples and nations: - The national identity of the Afrikaner nation and that of the other nations in South Africa must be preserved; - The Afrikaner nation must be bound to its culture; - The general development of the nation's life must be along Christian-national norms, and - The anti-Christian and antinational pursuit of cultural uniformity, ethnic mixing, and the preparation of a world state must at all times be opposed, so that the Creator will be glorified by a variety of national cultures. The article on population politics has been rewritten as follows: - The HNP's foundation is nationalism. It is based on preference for what is your own, a universal right of persons and groups. - Society in South Africa is not one single community, but a diversity of communities which differ in race, culture, language, and religion. To try to integrate these communities into a single nation by means of a general franchise under a central authority is unacceptable in the light of the right to continued existence and self-determination of the different communities. As condition for the upholding of a peaceful order of organic homogeneousness, and the success of a policy of peaceful neighborliness, opposition to mixing and to the elimination of national boundaries must be maintained through the upholding of separate identities. History -- including that of Africa since the 1960's -- is full of failed attempts to accommodate divergent groups in one parliamentary democracy. History has confirmed that a parliamentary democracy has limited tolerance for racial and religious differences. So, too, does the history of the Soviet Union and the countries of Central Europe in the 90's indicate that cultural, religious, and historical differences are destructive in democratically integrated states. Afrikaners and English speakers: Since the Afrikaner not only makes up the oldest part of the white population, but is also the only white nation born in this country, and since the Afrikaner, due to his homogeneousness is not able to receive any direct reinforcements from outside, the authorities must see to it that the Afrikaans language, culture, and way of life are upheld and promoted at all times, so that the national and cultural identity of Afrikanerdom is preserved untarnished -- an Afrikanerdom which also includes those English speakers and other language groups who identify with the historical roots and the history of the Afrikaner people. Language: The party recognizes Afrikaans as an indigenous language of Africa, as the name indicates, but also a cultural language that distinguishes itself from other indigenous languages. It is the language in which the struggle for freedom against British domination was conducted, and in which great political and economic development took place. It is also the language that has stamped not only thousands of farms and numerous towns and cities in the country, but also the fishes and rivers, trees and mountains, birds and other animals of the country. This gives the Afrikaans language an inalienable, unique right in the country over other languages that are not indigenous. The party concedes that English is an international language, and also that it is the language of a considerable section of South Africa's population, and is therefore regarded as a useful communication medium. The congress used words such as "race" where applicable in its program of principles. Agriculture was specifically singled out for a lot of attention. The existence and welfare of the rural population has to be seen as very important. The preservation and the increase of independent and self-sufficient land owners must be promoted. The stifling of the individual farmer by any person or interest group who is in a position of power and influence by being in control of big capital, must be fought. The HNP's policy on the protection of white land ownership and of the farmer's full control over marketing his own products, as opposed to the capitalist interests which control the "middleman," are also contained in the program. The HNP also says there has to be a policy which positively encourages the birthrate among whites. White births have in the past been discouraged by the state. Significant, too, is the policy to give spiritual and physical aid to the needy. Where such help cannot be provided, the state should intervene. The church must also play a big role in community affairs, as the HNP acknowledges the state's Christian commitments.
