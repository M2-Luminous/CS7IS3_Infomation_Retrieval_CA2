"Our economy should be reformed by ourselves, not by Russia," he declared in a televised statement Monday evening. Nevertheless, Shushkevich conceded that a monetary union with Russia is capable of considerably improving the economic situation in Belarus. According to him, to ensure normal working of the proposed monetary union it is necessary to fix equal prices for fuel and basic raw materials and establish a customs union between Belarus and Russia. With reference to the possibility of his resignation during the current parliamentary session, Shushkevich said he is aware that a group of deputies intended to "raise this issue." He would resign on his own, if he believed that the next speaker will induce legislators to fix a date for early parliamentary elections, Shushkevich said.
