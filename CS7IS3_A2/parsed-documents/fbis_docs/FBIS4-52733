His comment confirms the gathering momentum at the highest levels of government to review the 1966 Thai-US Amity Treaty which exempts Americans from a number of activities normally restricted under the Alien Business Law. The move would be part of Thailand's preparation to undertake commitments under the new General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) due to take effect early next year. GATS outlaws discrimination between trading partners in service industries. The European Union, Japan, Australia and other industrial countries have been urging Thailand to provide them with the same rights Americans enjoy under the Thai-US treaty. Thai officials are only now starting to consider which services should be opened to other nationals and which should continue to be reserved for Thais. Under GATS, the restricted service sectors would also have to be closed to Americans, but Washington is lobbying to keep them open. Dr Suphachai said the treaty has been in effect for a long time. Considering current conditions, it may be obsolete. Therefore, the country should review whether it will continue to grant privileges to each sector of the service industry. Paramount to considerations is whether any decision would affect national security or contravene Thai traditions. The Thai Foreign Affairs Ministry suggested that the treaty not be amended; however, Dr Suphachai said more debate among other government agencies, particularly the Commerce Ministry, should be entertained. Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon said earlier that Thailand should amend the treaty to comply with the GATS rules. Dr Suphachai said the country had approved the amendment of the Announcement of the National Executive Council No. 281, commonly known as the Alien Business Law, which refers to freer foreign investment in the same line with "national treatment" (that is, treating others as if they were Thai nationals. He maintained such rights are already granted to U.S. citizens. The government is planning to liberalize foreign investment, particularly in the automobile industry, said Dr Suphachai. Asked whether a law passed by the parliament should supersede a treaty, Dr Suphachai said that normally a treaty should supersede any law. However, specific laws may present conflicts which should be carefully reviewed.
