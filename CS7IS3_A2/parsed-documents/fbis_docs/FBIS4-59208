In elections yesterday, Hayim Ramon's list received about 47 percent of the votes, compared to Labor's 33 percent, and the Likud's 18 percent. Ramon and Labor are expected to form a coalition in the Histadrut, as we hear in this report from Dani Gur-Arye: [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Hayim Ramon, Meretz, and SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] did in a month what the Likud has been trying to do for 74 years: they knocked the Labor Party out of the Histadrut. Ramon dominated among almost all the voting groups -- people under 30, pensioners, kibbutzim members, and development town residents. In a restrained victory speech, Ramon and Prime Minister Rabin agreed to set aside their differences. Ramon said: I think that on the basis of what the prime minister said, we should definitely continue our cooperation. The prime minister made a statement I think is important, let's set aside for now the formalities. They are less important. Meretz and SHAS members went into a state of euphoria at MAPAM [United Workers Party] headquarters in Tel Aviv when the results were announced. Ramon watched the news from home, joining the celebration after midnight. At Labor headquarters meanwhile, the atmosphere was grim. Histadrut Secretary General Hayim Haberfeld and top party leaders locked themselves in one of the offices when the results were announced, and emerged defeated a half hour later. Once the results set in, even Ramon's harshest critics said they would be willing to join his coalition. This is Economics Minister Shim'on Shetrit: [Shetrit] With regard to coalition, we have made coalitions with the Likud, which is totally opposed to our views in the political and also in social matters, and I don't think that anyone who is sensible could say that he objects to coalitions with any group. [Gur-Arye] Haberfeld will continue acting as secretary general for the time being. Ramon's party members will take up their new positions in August. Until then the two parties will have a tough time negotiating a coalition agreement. When it's all over, Haberfeld will vacate his office for Hayim Ramon, the new secretary general. [end recording] Prime Minister Rabin hinted more than once overnight that the fact that Hayim Ramon, 'Amir Peretz, and Shmu'el Avital remain members of the Labor caucus in the Knesset, provides a loophole through which to bring them back into the party. The three in fact remain Labor Knesset members [MK's] even though they ran in a separate list in the Histadrut elections, and they ardently support the Gaza-Jericho accord between Israel and the PLO, which the Knesset is to debate today and tomorrow. The Knesset took the day off yesterday for the Histadrut elections, but is back in session today in a new political reality. David Ze'ev reports: [Begin Ze'ev recording] The Labor Party is waking up to a difficult morning in its parliamentary life, amid the inner conflict over whether to allow Hayim Ramon, 'Amir Peretz, and Shmu'el Avital to participate in the party's Knesset caucus. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin himself last night pointed out to reporters the awkward situation that while the Labor constitution requires the three to be expelled from the party, they do remain members of the Knesset caucus due to Knesset regulations. Peretz and Avital attended a caucus meeting last week. There were some bitter, sarcastic comments over whether they should be present, though most of the Labor MK's at the meeting seemed to support their bid to continue to be considered members. Either way, the three Labor Histadrut breakaways will all support the government in the Knesset plenum vote over the Gaza-Jericho accord signed last week. The debate over the agreement with the PLO is due to begin this morning, resume tomorrow, and last perhaps until the early hours of Friday morning. For this debate Meretz will be back in the Labor Party's corner, as will SHAS. In the Knesset, Labor and Meretz are still in the same coalition, and SHAS is expected to be on its way back in. But in that coalition there are bitter feelings by Labor leaders towards Meretz. Meretz, which for the most part has compromised in the name of the peace process, has shown it knows how to confront Labor and win. Prime Minister Rabin can take solace only in the fact that whenever the marathon debate ends and the vote takes place, he is likely to prevail. The Knesset speaker's office has announced that the debate will start today, assuming the Prime Minister's Office presents before the Knesset this morning the Hebrew translation of the accord with the PLO. The English version was before the Knesset yesterday. The Knesset speaker's office says many MK's came to get a copy, even though the house was not in session due to the Histadrut elections.
