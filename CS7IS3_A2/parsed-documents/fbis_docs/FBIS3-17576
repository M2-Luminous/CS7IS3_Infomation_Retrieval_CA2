Boris Nikolayevich works every morning. He has bathed in the sea. He has been going for walks. He has made several trips in a helicopter, and toured the port of Tuapse, which must be developed. The court has dried out a bit, and today he played tennis. Inasmuch as the weather has allowed us to, we have relaxed. Even the fact that we have simply changed scenery has had a beneficial effect on us. "How much can you speculate about the president's health? If he has gone to rest in Sochi, does that mean that he must definitely be undergoing treatment? Are there no doctors in Moscow!? How many illnesses have people invented for the president. But would we, his family, really have allowed Boris Nikolayevich to work if he had been seriously ill? Are we enemies of his health? "I would like to tell KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA: Believe me, the president feels absolutely normal, and there is no need to carry on speculating about his health. You must understand that it is easier to tolerate any lie but the one that concerns the health of a person close to you."
