The Renmini should gradually become a convertible currency." This idea was put forward in the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure." It represents an important decision by the CPC Central Committee to resolve key issues in our reform of the foreign exchange control system, after comprehensively and systematically analyzing and summing up the history and present conditions of China's foreign exchange control. It will play an active role in pushing forward the drive to improve and develop foreign exchange control. China has achieved fairly rapid economic growth since the reform and opening up; but the overall economic level is low. To fully utilize limited foreign exchange resources, it is still necessary for the state to exert various degrees of control. The main purpose is to ensure an increase in foreign exchange and its reasonable usage, and to facilitate a basic balance in China's foreign exchange income and expenses as well as international account income and expenses so as to ensure the opening up policy; economic ties and trade with foreign countries; and to create conditions for the final goal of making the Reminbi a convertible currency. China's current foreign exchange control system was established and developed during the course of deepening reform of the economic structure. It has played a fairly active role in promoting China's economic ties and trade with foreign countries. But during the course of building a socialist economic structure, problems existing in the current foreign exchange system began to crop up. Such problems need to be gradually improved through various concrete measures. 1. To change the coexistence of the official rate and market rate of the Renminbi. The official rate is adjusted and announced by the State Administration of Exchange Control in accordance with China's economic development and the condition of its foreign trade in particular, in overall consideration of commodity price levels at home, international income and expenses, and the fluctuation of major foreign currencies on the international financial market. The official rate is mainly applied to part of the foreign exchange income and expenses of the central authorities, part of non-trade foreign exchange income and expenses, as well as the settlement of some international accounts. The market rate is regulated and decided by the demand-and-supply rule of the market. Under normal conditions, the government will not interfere in the fluctuation of the exchange rate. The market rate has played an important role in regulating China's foreign exchange funds. The system affording the coexistence of the renminbi's official and market exchange rates took shape under special historical circumstances, it is an expression of China's price system and distribution system in the distribution of foreign exchange at the present stage, and it is a transient phenomenon appearing during the course of economic reform. As a system governing exchange rates during a special period, this system has played its part in promoting the development of China's economic relations and trade with foreign countries, but it has also some harmful effects. The renminbi's two different exchange rates and the two different ways of settling accounts that this phenomenon has created are neither favorable for the efficient use of the nation's foreign exchange resources nor for reestablishing China's lawful status in GATT. Thus, the mechanisms causing the coexistence of two different exchange rates must be replaced by a well-managed and market-based floating exchange rate system. 2. The current market which regulates foreign exchange must be restructured and a foreign exchange market with uniform standards to follow should be established. China started to regulate foreign exchange in October 1980, and the scope of regulation has been expanding over the past decade or so. From regulating foreign exchange held by Chinese and foreign enterprises, the scope of business has now expanded to regulating foreign exchange held by individuals. The regulated prices are determined by supply and demand in the regulated foreign exchange markets. [sentence as received] There are now more than 100 foreign exchange regulatory centers and 18 foreign exchange open markets. These markets have been playing positive roles in adjusting a foreign exchange surplus or shortage, alleviating problems caused by a foreign exchange shortage, accelerating the circulation of foreign exchange, and making more efficient use of foreign exchange. However, because the regulatory markets in various parts of the country are established according to administrative demarcation, their establishment has given rise to problems which hinder the development of China's foreign exchange markets and which restrict them from demonstrating their functions -- problems such as regional barriers, the inefficient lateral circulation of foreign exchange, unequal and unstable foreign exchange rates, and restricted market development. Thus, establishing a foreign exchange market with uniform standards to follow is an important aspect in restructuring the foreign exchange control system. 3. To attain the goal of having the renminbi be exchangeable for foreign currencies is a long-term development target that China has set for reforming its foreign exchange control system and banking systems, but this reform will take time. The ultimate goal that China has set for reforming its foreign exchange control system and the scientifically conceived plan for the process is to make the renminbi a convertible currency step by step. Attaining this goal is an objective demand set for China to reform its foreign exchange control system so that the nation can open wider to the outside world and establish a socialist market economic system. But the level of China's development shows that we still cannot meet certain basic requirements needed for the renminbi's convertibility, and so we still need time to create the necessary conditions to attain this objective through real reforms. For example, we must reform the current foreign exchange system to improve the mechanisms governing the operation of the foreign exchange market; we must improve the mechanisms for setting the renminbi's exchange rates through establishing a market-based and well-managed system which governs floating exchange rates; and the state must increase its foreign exchange reserves through improving its ability to increase foreign exchange revenues and conserving foreign exchange spending. As China's overall national strength becomes greater, becomes more capable of establishing foreign contacts, and enjoys higher economic status in the world, the process which seeks the renminbi's convertibility also will accelerate.
