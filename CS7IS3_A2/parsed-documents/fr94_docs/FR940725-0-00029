FR940725-0-00029 FR940725-0-00007 (D) Hyperinflationary currency. For purposes of sections 985 through 989, the term hyperinflationary currency means the currency of a country in which there is cumulative inflation during the base period of at least 100 percent as determined by reference to the consumer price index of the country listed in the monthly issues of the ``International Financial Statistics'' or a successor publication of the International Monetary Fund. If a country's currency is not listed in the monthly issues of ``International Financial Statistics,'' a QBU may use any other reasonable method consistently applied for determining the country's consumer price index. Base period means, with respect to any taxable year, the thirty-six calendar months immediately preceding the first day of the current calendar year. For this purpose, the cumulative inflation rate for the base period is based on compounded inflation rates. Thus, if for 1991, 1992, and 1993, a country's annual inflation rates are 29 percent, 25 percent, and 30 percent, respectively, the cumulative inflation rate for the three-year base period is 110 percent [((1.29 × 1.25 × 1.3)^1.0 × 1.10)x100=110%] and the currency of the country for the QBU's 1994 year is considered hyperinflationary. (c) *␣*␣* (6) Effect of changed circumstances. Regardless of any change in circumstances, a QBU may change its functional currency determined under this paragraph (c) only if the QBU complies with §1.985&hyph;4 or the Commissioner's consent is considered to have been granted under §1.985&hyph;2(d)(4) or §1.985&hyph;3(a)(2)(ii). (d) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* (ii) *␣*␣* For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), if a QBU of a foreign corporation has the dollar as its functional currency under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the QBU's activities shall be considered dollar activities of the corporation. * * * * * Par. 6. Section 1.985&hyph;2 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b)(2) to read as follows: §1.985&hyph;2 Election to use the United States dollar as the functional currency of a QBU. (a) Background and scope _(1) In general. This section permits an eligible QBU to elect to use the dollar as its functional currency for taxable years beginning on or before August 24, 1994.

Paragraph (c) of this section describes the time and manner for making the dollar election and paragraph (d) of this section describes the effect of making the election.

(2) Exception. Pursuant to §1.985&hyph;1(b)(2)(ii)(B)( 2 ), the rules of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply with respect to the procedure required to be followed by a noncontrolled section 902 corporation as defined in section 904(d)(2)(E) to elect the dollar as its (or its QBU branch's) functional currency and the application of §1.985&hyph;3.
