Vice Minister Hatakeyama then said, "If the government plans to formulate a new defense program outline, we want to add our position on TMD to it." In this way, he hinted that whether Japan should participate in the plan will be decided, it is hoped, by end of this year because the new defense program outline is scheduled to be formulated this year. The TMD plan seeks to protect its allied members from being attacked by the ballistic missiles of North Korea and other nations which are suspected of developing nuclear weapons by locating their missiles with reconnaissance satellites and the airborne warning and control system (AWACS) and then intercepting them with the theater high-altitude area defense (THAAD) system and improved Patriot missiles. The United States has been calling for Japan's participation in TMD. In this connection, at the Japanese-U.S. Security Consultative Committee talks held on 11 March, DA Director General Kazuo Aichi said that "we are considering defining (Japan's cooperation in developing the TMD) in the new defense program outline," thus indicating a positive view on Japan's possible participation in TMD.
