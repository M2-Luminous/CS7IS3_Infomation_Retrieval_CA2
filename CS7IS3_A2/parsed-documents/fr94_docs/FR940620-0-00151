FR940620-0-00151 FR940620-0-00029 Comment. Several commenters from organizations representing persons with disabilities noted that operating force is more significant to usability than button size, recommending as little as two pounds of force to actuate a crossing control. Response. No data were submitted in support of a lesser operating force nor was information supplied on the availability of controls with lesser requirements. The larger button requirement and lower mounting height now required of crossing controls should facilitate operation by a larger number of persons. No change has been made in this requirement. Comment. The NPRM proposed that the control button be located as close as possible to a public sidewalk curb ramp. Few comments were received on the location of the control button relative to the approach area and public sidewalk curb ramp or level landing serving the street crossing. However, a few commenters suggested that greater specificity was required to ensure usability within standard crossing times. Response. The interim final rule requires that the horizontal distance between the approach space and the control be no more than 10 inches for a parallel approach. This requirement is derived from ADAAG 4.2 (Space Allowance and Reach Ranges). Both forward and parallel approaches are permitted. An appendix note recommends placing the controls out of the path of travel along the public sidewalk. Comment. The NPRM sought comment on the proposed 48 inch maximum mounting height for crossing controls. Most commenters favored a lower height, in some cases as low as 32 inches. Heights of 36 inches and 42 inches were supported by organizations representing persons with mobility impairments. EPVA recommended a 42 inch mounting height, as required for an elevator button in ADAAG 4.10 (Elevators). MUTCD recommends a range between 42 and 48 inches. Commenters noted that controls are mounted on a slip ring and can be easily installed at a lower height. Response. Where it is necessary to operate the control in order to initiate the crossing cycle, it is important that the button be installed within a reach range that serves the greatest number of people. Therefore, the mounting height in the interim final rule has been changed to a maximum of 42 inches. Comment. The NPRM sought comment on specifications for audible crossing signals for persons with vision impairments and vibro-tactile controls for those with vision and hearing impairments. A large number of comments and technical data were received. Commenters with vision impairments cited locations and types of equipment that facilitated unassisted street crossing. Departments of public works and similar State and local government agencies and transportation engineers from private industry submitted reports, recommendations, warrants for installation, studies, and cost data for audible pedestrian signals. Organizations representing persons with vision impairments, mobility instructors, and individuals who are blind supported and opposed audible crossing signals. Some commenters noted that audible signals facilitated safe and independent travel, particularly by those with late-onset vision impairments. Other commenters were concerned that audible signals would mask environmental cues and stigmatize persons who are blind as needing special accommodations in order to travel about on public sidewalks. Response. The interim final rule does not contain technical or scoping provisions for audible or vibro-tactile crossing signals because of a lack of consensus on the need for these devices and the specifications they should be required to meet. However, the material received may be of value to the Board in future rulemaking and technical assistance. Furthermore, emerging wayfinding and broadcast signage technologies may have applications to pedestrian street crossing. Technology that makes pedestrian information audible is being tested in several communities and facilities.
