Commenting on last week's two-day round of talks between the Lithuanian and Russian interstate teams in Vilnius, Brazauskas described as "too long" the break before the latest meeting. The Lithuanian president expressed satisfaction over the results of the latest round of negotiations. The delegations have started taking concrete steps to solve the issue of compensation by Russia for the damage caused to Lithuania by the Soviet Union since 1940, according to Brazauskas. The Lithuanian Ministry of Economics has been obligated to form a working group to figure out the damage and to foresee a legal basis for claiming a compensation. Progress in talks on the debt of the former Russian Vnesheconom Bank to Lithuania "also gives grounds for renewed hope," Brazauskas said. A few years ago the Vnesheconom Bank expropriated Lithuanian people's savings worth over 7 million dollars and almost 150 million dollars belonging to Lithuanian companies. Speaking about unsettled problems, the Lithuanian president mentioned the issue of Russian transit over Lithuanian territory. Talks on the regulations for the transit of Russian passengers and cargo, expected to be finalized by Lithuanian negotiators soon, as well as on a visa regime for Russian citizens are to resume in the near future, according to Brazauskas. "Of course, a lot of problems remain in the fields of energy, fishing and environment. So in the future both our negotiators and the Foreign Ministry will have enough work," said the Lithuanian president. Brazauskas reiterated Lithuania's position that the military potential in the Kalinigrad enclave of Russia should be decreased and the region should be demilitarized eventually. "It is an ideal area for the development of economic relations," said the Lithuanian president.
