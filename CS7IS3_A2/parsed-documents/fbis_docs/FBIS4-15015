This was reported by INTERFAX and ITAR-TASS agencies. Vladimir Borzyk said his decision was made because he disagreed with the populist actions of LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who was inflicting damage not only on the party itself but also on the principles of morality and ethics common to all mankind. At the same time, Vladimir Borzyuk noted that he stll considered himself an adherent of the LDPR Charter, and in his future activity as a deputy outside the faction he would pursue the program with which the LDPR had gone to the elections on 12 December last year and from which, in his opinion, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had deviated.
