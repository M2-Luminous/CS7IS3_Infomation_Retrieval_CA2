Portov] [Text] Vladivostok, 21 Dec -- High-ranking officers of the Russian Pacific Fleet Command have said that the Russian Navy is planning to resume dumping of radioactive liquids into the Sea of Japan in late December or early January. The Russian Government suspended the action after the last dumping, in October, was severely criticized by Japan and other neighboring nations. However, the Pacific Fleet can no longer keep liquid waste stored as it is on tanker ships because it was recently found to have been leaking from an old tanker. According to the officers, the next dumping is likely to be carried out in the Sea of Japan and the waters off the Kamchatka Peninsula. The officers said the Pacific Fleet held a meeting on 5 December in consultation with officials of the Maritime Kray Government and the Russian Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources to discuss the treatment of radioactive waste. The meeting reportedly discussed the possibility of purchasing new waste tankers and of obtaining government financial support for improving disposal facilities. Nevertheless, they reached the conclusion that "resumption of dumping is inevitable" since there was no hope of immediate financial support from the government. Pacific Fleet Commander Guriynov is already back in Vladivostok after his vacation in Moscow last week, and is expected to decide exactly when the next dumping will be made within this week. The officers believed said the most likely date would be late in December or in early January. According to an ITAR-TASS report on 20 December, a chief negotiator of the Russian Pacific Fleet delegation at Danilyan hinted at the resumption of dumping before Japan-Russia negotiations on the radioactive waste problem, saying: "Russia will have to continue dumping radioactive waste into the sea for at least two years, even if Western nations help construction of our nuclear waste disposal facilities. In fact, our dumping in October was found harmless to the environment." The high-ranking officers said Zvezda nuclear submarine dock in Bolshoy-Kamen Bay, which is located halfway between Vladivostok and Nakhodka, currently stores 2,700 cubic meters of radioactive liquids. Of these, 1,000 cubic meters are stored in the nuclear reactor of a submarine under repair, and the remainder are stored in two tankers -- "TNT-5" (900 cubic meters) and "TNT-27" (800 cubic meters). "TNT-5" is a superannuated boat which was built in the 1970's. It has leaked radioactive waste at least 14 times, and is no longer capable of cruising. In fact, "TNT-5" is currently used as nothing more than a floating tank. "TNT-27" is too old to undertake long cruises, and is not considered safe enough to handle the storage of radioactive liquids. The high-ranking officers said the next dumping may be done near Russian territorial waters in the Sea of Japan. When that happens the liquid waste may well be sunk together with its container, the "TNT-5." The officers noted it was usual in Russia for solid and liquid waste to be sunk together with the old tankers holding it. The officers said that, in addition, Russia's biggest submarine base in Kamchatka has 1,500 cubic meters of liquid waste which the Navy will dump into waters off the Kamchatka Peninsula in the near future. Asked about the Japanese Government's reaction to reports of Russian plans to resume dumping nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan, Director Hiroshi Matsuoka of the Science and Technology Agency's Disaster Prevention and Environment Policy Office said: "It will be a big problem if the information is true. However, we cannot comment on the report because it is not an official statement by Russia conveyed by diplomatic channels."
