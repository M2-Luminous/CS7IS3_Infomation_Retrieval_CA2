FR940202-0-00054 FR940202-0-00006 (e) Convertible debt instruments. For purposes of section 1272, an option is ignored if it is an option to convert a debt instrument into the stock of the issuer, into the stock or debt of a related party (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)), or into cash or other property in an amount equal to the approximate value of such stock or debt. (f) Special rules to determine whether a debt instrument is a short-term obligation _(1) Counting of either the issue date or maturity date. For purposes of determining whether a debt instrument is a short-term obligation (i.e., a debt instrument with a fixed maturity date that is not more than 1 year from the date of issue), the term of the debt instrument includes either the issue date or the maturity date, but not both dates. (2) Coordination with paragraph (c) of this section for certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, solely for purposes of determining whether a debt instrument is a short-term obligation under sections 871(g)(1)(B)(i), 881, 1271(a)(3), 1271(a)(4), 1272(a)(2)(C), and 1283(a)(1), the maturity date of a debt instrument is the last possible date that the instrument could be outstanding under the terms of the instrument. (g) Basis adjustment. The basis of a debt instrument in the hands of the holder is increased by the amount of OID included in the holder's gross income and decreased by the amount of any payment from the issuer to the holder under the debt instrument other than a payment of qualified stated interest. See, however, ยง1.1275&hyph;2(f) for rules regarding basis adjustments on a pro rata prepayment. (h) Debt instruments denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Section 1272 and this section apply to a debt instrument that provides for all payments denominated in, or determined by reference to, the functional currency of the taxpayer or qualified business unit of the taxpayer (even if that currency is other than the U.S. dollar). See ยง1.988&hyph;2(b) to determine interest income or expense for debt instruments that provide for payments denominated in, or determined by reference to, a nonfunctional currency. (i) [Reserved] (j) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. Each example assumes that all taxpayers use the calendar year as the taxable year. In addition, each example assumes a 30-day month, 360-day year, and that the initial accrual period begins on the issue date and the final accrual period ends on the day before the stated maturity date. Although, for purposes of simplicity, the yield as stated is rounded to two decimal places, the computations do not reflect any such rounding convention. Example 1. Accrual of OID on zero coupon debt instrument; choice of accrual periods _(i) Facts. On July 1, 1994, A purchases at original issue, for $675,564.17, a debt instrument that matures on July 1, 1999, and provides for a single payment of $1,000,000 at maturity. (ii) Determination of yield. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the yield of the debt instrument is 8 percent, compounded semiannually. (iii) Determination of accrual period. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, accrual periods may be of any length, provided that each accrual period is no longer than 1 year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or final day of an accrual period. The yield to maturity to be used in computing OID accruals in any accrual period, however, must reflect the length of the accrual period chosen. A yield based on compounding b times per year is equivalent to a yield based on compounding c times per year as indicated by the following formula: r=c m (1+i/b) b/c ^1 n In which: i=The yield based on compounding b times per year expressed as a decimal r=The equivalent yield based on compounding c times per year expressed as a decimal b=The number of compounding periods in a year on which i is based (for example, 12, if i is based on monthly compounding) c=The number of compounding periods in a year on which r is based (iv) Determination of OID allocable to each accrual period. Assume that A decides to compute OID on the debt instrument using semiannual accrual periods. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the OID allocable to the first semiannual accrual period is $27,022.56: the product of the issue price ($675,564.17) and the yield properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period (8 percent/2), less qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period ($0). The daily portion of OID for the first semiannual accrual period is $150.13 ($27,022.56/180). (v) Determination of OID if monthly accrual periods are used. Alternatively, assume that A decides to compute OID on the debt instrument using monthly accrual periods. Using the above formula, the yield on the debt instrument reflecting monthly compounding is 7.87 percent, compounded monthly (12 m (1+.08/2) 2/12 ^1 n ). Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the OID allocable to the first monthly accrual period is $4,430.48: the product of the issue price ($675,564.17) and the yield properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period (7.87 percent/12), less qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period ($0). The daily portion of OID for the first monthly accrual period is $147.68 ($4,430.48/30).
