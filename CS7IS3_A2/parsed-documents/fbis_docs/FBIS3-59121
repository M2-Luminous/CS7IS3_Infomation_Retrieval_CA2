In fact there was quite a lot of the old Republican gunslinger in the first official State of the Union address by the self-proclaimed "new kind of Democrat." The call-to-arms for a better America, with or without the assistance of Congress, and the brandishing of his pen as he threatened to veto any healthcare legislation that did not provide universal insurance coverage were borrowed from the Reagan handbook. So too were the acknowledgement of ordinary (and not so ordinary) people in the public galleries and the artful seating at either side of Mrs Hillary Clinton of Jack Smith, head of General Motors, and Lane Kirkland, the trade union leader. Critics might also complain that the 64-minute speech was too long, yet short on new proposals, especially on the revived promise to "end welfare as we know it." Foreigners might lament that its external passage was both perfunctory and predictable and Republicans that the president keeps stealing their clothes. But reservations must be placed in context. The State of the Union address offers all presidents a stage and -- for a Democrat, old or new, welcomed by a Democratic Congress -- an audience guaranteed to applaud often and loudly. And it found Mr Clinton in vintage missionary form on his favourite subject, domestic reform. The country, he concluded in ringing tones, "is growing stronger but it must be stronger still." It was tough for the opposition to muster an effective immediate response. Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, speaking woodenly from his office without the benefit of partisan cheering, could only proclaim that there was no healthcare crisis, and complain about higher taxes. Potentially far more revealing, though still to be approached with a degree of cynicism, was the reaction of Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the firebrand conservative. "There is a potential, if this speech was sincere, for a remarkable coalition that could pass a lot of stuff," especially on crime and welfare. He added approvingly that Mr Clinton was now talking his kind of language. This, indeed, was the political message of the address. Mr Clinton drew his line in the sand, insisted that an improving economy was no excuse for delaying more reform and gave the distinct impression that he did not care from which side of the political aisle he derived support for his crusade. But he warned, too, that the body politic was ultimately accountable to the public -- "those who hold our feet to the fire." Americans, he said, would not heed the siren songs of the special vested interests and the "naysayers who fear we will not be equal to the challenges of our time and who misread our history, our heritage and even today's headlines." There were micro-political messages, too. The president's promise to bring in soon substantive proposals to change the welfare system and explicitly to link this with healthcare reform was a clear nod in the direction of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who chairs the Senate finance committee. The senator, an intellectual, if temperamental, original in this Congress, has become miffed with the administration. He has declared, like Senator Dole, that there is no healthcare crisis and threatened to make trouble for the health proposals if his welfare hobby horse was relegated in priority -- which is precisely what the White House intended at the start of this year. At least he was satisfied with Mr Clinton's commitment on Tuesday night, though as the president went on to expound with much greater passion on the imperative of healthcare reform he can have been left in little doubt where the Clinton heart lies. But this, too, had a political need. The momentum for changes in healthcare, accelerated by the rapturously received presidential address to Congress last September, has slowed over the last two months. Other issues such as Nafta, gun control and Mr Clinton's European trip have intruded while the insurance and medical professions have begun to launch effective propaganda campaigns. It had become incumbent on Mr Clinton to regain the initiative. His ecumenical side was also in evidence in the coda to his address on crime and on the responsibility of individuals to make communities safer. Much of what he said appeals to conservatives -- mandatory sentencing for violent offenders, more police on the streets, the restoration of family values -- but some, specifically the calls for ever tighter gun control, does not. Violent crime is now a perennial political issue. Every president since Lyndon Johnson has attacked it and Congress loves to debate it, though the effect of the efforts of both may be questioned, not least because conservatives and liberals have rarely agreed on the right prescriptions. But at least the Senate last year passed, by 95 votes to four, an omnibus crime bill that now awaits action by the House, while both chambers approved waiting limits for purchasers of handguns. This measure was now the Brady Law, Mr Clinton said with pride as he clapped Mr James Brady, the former presidential press secretary, who from his wheelchair in the galleries proudly waved his walking stick back in return. There is always a risk of overloading Congress, especially in the run-up to midterm elections. It is possible now that fixation with crime will make harder action on health and welfare reform both immensely complicated and controversial, as well as other items on the president's heavy agenda such as worker retraining, campaign finance reform, more controls on lobbyists and the creation of an information superhighway. But, from his Tuesday night pulpit, Mr Clinton was brooking no delay. "Our deepest and most profound problems" could not be left to "petty political fighting." If words were all--and he used them very well--he would be home and dry. But not yesterday, as his doctors ordered him to rest a voice that barely lasted the 64 minutes.
