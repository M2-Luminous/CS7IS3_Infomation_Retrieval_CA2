Otherwise, even reports which are very newsworthy would have to be thrown into the trash heap. Now, under a market economy, how is the situation? "Recently a hinterland publication carried a report: A group of over 20 human snakes from Fujian, carrying service passports bought with money, traveled to the United States by air in an attempt to immigrate into the United States; eventually they were exposed and became illegal immigrants." Some time ago, while presiding over a seminar here in Hong Kong, Fang Hanqi, professor at the Journalism School of the People's University of China and member of the academic discipline evaluation group under the State Council, discussed China's news-reporting industry since the 14th CPC Congress. He pointed out that in the past it had been impossible to see in newspapers such absurd stories as the one mentioned above. Reporting good news but not bad news was a reporting policy of the Chinese media in the past. No matter how big a traffic accident or a natural or human disaster was, it would not be reported in a timely manner by newspapers. However, such an ossified view has now been loosened up. Recently, newspapers inside China even reported the news of a scientific exploration satellite's failure to return to the earth on schedule. In the past, not only was "bad news" kept unreported, but the so-called "secrets" were also kept unreported. At that time the country was closed to a great extent and the scope of secrets to be kept was large. During the Cultural Revolution, ordinary people in such a great country were not even allowed to know when and where a session of the People's Congress, attended by several thousand people, was held. A news report was released only after the session was concluded. Activities at the session were even more a matter of secret. Comparatively, the current situation represents substantial changes, and embodies journalistic values to a greater extent. The System of Newspaper Management Has Changed Substantially The system of newspaper management has also undergone some changes, and the dual-track party-government system has been restored. For a long time in the past, the media were all managed by the propaganda departments of party committees. It was only in 1987 that the Press and Publication Administration, which would regulate nonparty newspapers, was restored. The Press and Publication Administration was in fact established (under the name of the General Press Administration) in the early years of the PRC. For at that time there were also some newspapers which were public-private joint operations, some private newspapers, and some newspapers run by foreigners. As party committees' propaganda departments could not handle matters involving so many newspapers, the General Press Administration under the State Council was thus established. But, in the early 1950s, foreign newspapers disappeared, while private newspapers as well as newspapers which had been public-private joint operations were all turned into public operations, which could then all be managed by party committees' propaganda departments. As a result the General Press Administration was abolished. To some extent the restoration of the Press and Publication Administration reflected the diversification of publications. In addition, Professor Fang argued, news-gathering activities were also governed by plans under a planned economy. If the superior agencies determined that there was a sector, then there would be a corresponding office in a newspaper, which would be exclusively engaged in reporting news about the sector. In the past, news-seeking activities had to be carried out in the designated sectors and in accordance with plans and the spirit. Otherwise, even reports which were very newsworthy would be thrown into the trash heap. This way of doing things also made reporters lazy and stupid. Photographs were handled in the same way. The size of a photograph carried by a newspaper was not determined by its news value, but by the bureaucratic rank of the person in the photograph. Substantial Increases in the Number of Publications and in Advertisement Changes in the quantity, layout, and content of the media are even more obvious. Since the 14th CPC Congress held in October last year, the market economy within China has been getting increasingly lively, and the news-reporting industry has also achieved significant development, resulting in a substantial quantitative increase in the media (see Table 1). The present period is one of the periods in Chinese history where the news-reporting industry is the most prosperous in terms of quantity; there are now more publications than pre-Liberation 1946 when there were over 1,400 publications. Furthermore, the growth in quantity is continuing. According to estimates, next year the aggregate circulation of publications will increase by 15 percent over this year. Currently, the number of newspapers increases by one every two and one-half days, the number of periodicals increases by one every two days, and the number of publishing houses increases by one every nine days. Because of the large advertising demand resulting from the development of the market economy, the volume of advertising business of the media is also increasing substantially, producing an average annual growth rate of over 40 percent (see Table 2). In order to attract more customers, the contents of publications cannot remain so boring and undiversified as previously, and are becoming more diversified and interesting, with each publication showing its characteristics in a creative way. Before the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the media carried few advertisements. For, after the founding of the PRC, publications in China emulated the Soviet Union; as PRAVDA carried no advertisements, publications in China would carry few advertisements. During the "Cultural Revolution," there were mainly four categories only: advertisements about books and periodicals, theater performance advertisements, lost-and-found announcements, and government announcements on land requisition and the cleaning up of graves. As the survival of the media would depend on advertisements, it was inevitable that the contents of a thousand newspapers would be the same. Especially during the Cultural Revolution, in order to avoid making mistakes, local newspapers would telephone RENMIN RIBAO every evening "to compare the layouts" so as to ensure their being identical. Presently, as the media are growing quantitatively, competition becomes inevitable. It can be confidently predicted that such things as contents and reporting methods will also be improved on a daily basis because of the need to attract readers and customers. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1: The Number of Institutions in Each Category of the Media in China i-| |n June 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Media category |Number |Increase over 1978 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Newspapers |Over 1,800 |1,000 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Periodicals |Over 7,000 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Internal publications |Over 2,000 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Radio stations |Over 500 |500 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Television stations |614 |1,920 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cable television stations|Over 500 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Volumes of Advertisement Business of the Media over the Years | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |unit: the renminbi | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1979 |Several million yuan | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1980 |110 million yuan | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1990 |2.5 billion yuan | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |3.51 billion yuan | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |5 billion yuan | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There Is a Fever of Paid News Reporting With the development of the market economy, the new-reporting industry is undergoing reform continuously; but many problems have also emerged. In his speech, Professor Fang Hanqi also gave a detailed briefing on the problems. Recently a doggerel has appeared in China: "First-rate journalists trade in stocks; second-rate journalists solicit advertisement business; third-rate journalists write for other publications; fourth-rate journalists attend meetings; and fifth-rate journalists edit articles." This shows that many journalists are devoted to their second jobs, whereas those who are doing their primary jobs are ridiculed as fifth-rate journalists. In addition, the increase in paid news reporting is also producing ever greater detrimental impact on the spirit of journalists. News space can be sold for "red envelopes"; what follows the words, "a report by this newspaper," is actually an advertisement. After reading it, readers cannot but feel cheated. In his speech, Professor Fang cited many instances: The "richest village," Daqiu Village, bought over a floor-cleaning worker at the Japanese embassy with 70,000 yuan, and arranged, through that worker, for a Japanese reporter to visit Daqiu Village. Recently, after Daqiu Village's problem was exposed, Daqiu Village gave a 50,000-yuan bribe to a government functionary with a rank which was not very high, so as to be informed of the attitude of the agency in charge of the matter with regard to the handling of Daqiu village's problem. This shows that Daqiu Village was willing to spend a great deal of money on news-gathering activities, and many of the reporters who gathered news in Daqiu Village might have also been "paid." Like Other Commodities News Reporting Is Sold for a Price In another instance, when collecting evidence in the home of an enterprise manager who had committed the crime of profiteering, a court discovered that he had given 170,000 yuan in bribes to more than 20 newspapers, which had then written articles to sing his praises. With regard to the recent Great Wall Group fraud case, television stations, central-level newspapers, and local newspapers all carried flattering reports during the process of the Great Wall Group's fund gathering, thereby helping the Great Wall Group establish credit in society. It is difficult say whether some deals were involved here. Some local television stations even openly list prices, explicitly setting the standards for fees to be charged for various news reports. For instance, a news report on the holding of an enterprise meeting, the ordering of goods, or a product show will cost 500 yuan, while a five-minute feature story will cost 5,000 yuan. Even Professor Fang, who tended to speak rather gently, denounced such conduct as: shameless "prostitution." According to Professor Fang, work in two areas has to be done in order to maintain journalists' professional ethics. One is to improve the benefits enjoyed by journalists; the other is to formulate the Press Law, creating a code of professional conduct for journalists. The Press Law began to be formulated in 1980. Successively, the Journalism Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Press and Publication Administration, and Hu Jiwei of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (dismissed after the June 4th Incident) each produced a plan; afterwards comparative study was also carried out. Nevertheless the law has yet to be enacted. In recent years legal disputes involving news reporting have been on the rise. As there is not an effective law to define the related matters, sometimes cases are handled in accordance with criminal law, and more frequently cases are handled in accordance with civil law. The lack of effort to construct the legal system governing the news-reporting industry is now a big problem in the development of journalism. Yu Zuomin Bought a Journalism Prize With Money The third problem is the interference of capital. The interference of some wealthy individuals in the news-reporting industry has adversely affected the taste of the news-reporting industry. Professor Fang cited some examples: Last year a nationwide contest of short news stories was held in Daqiu Village, and the expenses for the contest were paid for mainly by the "village chief," Yu Zuomin. After the judging activity produced results, Yu Zuomin argued that a TIANJIN RIBAO report on Daqiu Village's donations for relief efforts in disaster-stricken regions should be awarded a prize. The judges believed that the report was of ordinary quality, and thus hesitated to some extent. As a consequence a very unhappy look passed over the face of Yu Zuomin who was powerful because of his wealth: "If this news report is not awarded a prize, this check will not be signed either." After repeated discussions, people succumbed to the will of Yu Zuomin, and the news report on Daqiu Village's donations was awarded the third prize. In addition, some newspapers have accepted investments from collective enterprises; some newspapers sold some of their shares; and some newspapers sold rights over advertisement or advertisement spaces, which have then come to be controlled by advertising agencies. Such situations are, in fact, commonplace in capitalist societies, but are doubtless new things in a socialist market economy. Professor Fang, a scholar, pointed out: Because of the interference of capital, sometimes contents are made to accommodate the market, resulting in the carrying of stories such as those of problems in marriages, crime-of-passion murders, and sensational crimes in society as well as pornographic pictures; consequently publications have become more vulgar. Lastly, there are the problems that the volume of information is still too small, that there is a tendency to intentionally avoid negative stories, and that reporting is not timely enough. During the effort to bid for the right to host the Olympics, the people of Beijing felt rather good about themselves. It was exactly because they had only seen their positive side, with reports being mostly positive, that their sense of failure was very profound at the time of defeat.
