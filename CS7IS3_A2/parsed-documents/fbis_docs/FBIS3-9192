Our correspondent Jiri Bohacek reports: [Bohacek] Pavel Hajek, CMCTUA deputy chairman, addressed the rally at noon. The Old Town Square was 75-percent full. Labor and Social Affairs Minister Jindrich Vodicka arrived at that time, but the trade unionist crowd would not allow Vodicka to join them. The speakers asked those present to make room so that Mr. Minister could leave. Minister Vodicka was forced to leave without being allowed to speak or defend himself. According to unconfirmed information, a member of Mr. Minister's entourage was injured. [passage omitted] Distributors of leaflets published by the Association for the Republic appeared among the participants at the rally, but they failed to hand out any of their literature. It seems that the rally has just ended. The gathering sang the anthem and people are leaving.
