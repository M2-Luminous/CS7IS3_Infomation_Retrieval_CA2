This was evident after Vance's meeting with Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, who repeated that the embargo against Skopje will be lifted only when Greece's conditions are accepted. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Athanasios Ellis from New York] Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry director general, and UN mediator Cyrus Vance had a substantive meeting just a short while ago. During the meeting, Zakharakis repeated Athens' position on lifting the measures against Skopje if Greece's three conditions are accepted. Vance, who appears determined to achieve an end to the current stalemate, appears to be trying to achieve some kind of compromise in the framework of which the two sides will proceed simultaneously with goodwill moves. As to such moves, diplomatic circles think that Greece should lift the economic measures and Skopje should declare its intention to abolish the star of Veryina from its flag and change the disputed articles in its Constitution. The international mediator is also trying to get the positions of the two countries to agree on the other point of dispute regarding whether the talks should include the issue of the name, as Skopje demands, or whether we should remain with the confidence-building measures at the current phase, as Athens demands. Following the meeting, Zakharakis said that he will brief the Greek Government and return on Monday. He also stressed that during the meeting with Vance, they discussed all the details of the problem. Zakharakis, who met yesterday with U.S. Special Envoy Matthew Nimetz, also referred to the meeting scheduled between Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Vance during Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's visit to the United States. Consequently, Vance will continue his contacts with the two side on Monday. [end recording]
