The ESC writes: "The Latin American countries are trying to attract direct European investment. Over recent years the EU has been one of the principal sources of direct investment in the region. In some years it has outstripped all others. Direct investment can help to generate employment, to promote technology transfer and to modernize infrastructure, agriculture and industry. It can also contribute to the economic stability of the recipient country. However, the world recession and investment requirements in the EU itself (arising from the internal market) and in other areas (such as Central and East Europe) could lead to a diminishing flow of direct European investment to Latin America. At the same time the wave of privatizations, which attracted major capital flows, has come to an end in a number of Latin American countries. A number of other factors have also been influential, such as the attempted coups d'etat in Venezuela, the presidential crisis in Brazil and the referendum against privatization in Uruguay. Against this backdrop, EU instruments for promoting cooperation investment, such as the Business Corporation Network and the EU-IIP have an important role to play. More could perhaps be done - e.g. through the EU representations in the various countries -to bring these instruments to the notice of potential investors. Member state financial incentives to encourage companies to invest in Latin America are likewise of primary importance. Some Latin American countries have achieved a sufficient level of economic development, stability and economic growth to be eligible for EIB [European Investment Bank] loans and financial support from the member states for a whole range of projects (e.g. improved energy supplies, trade promotion, industrial cooperation, joint ventures and technology transfer). ``This is helping to improve the business climate, build mutual confidence and broaden Latin American market prospects for European products. The Committee urges the Commission to prepare studies on European investment opportunities in Latin America and, in the light of its findings, to draw up proposals for expanding the range of EU instruments for promoting such investment. Similarly, it calls upon the member states to take steps to back direct private and public investment in the region. It is also important for Latin America that a favorable business climate be maintained, that an adequate legal framework be created, notably to combat the expropriation practices which have been used in the past, and that sufficient economic and political stability prevail to try to attract and keep foreign investors in the region and encourage the repatriation of capital which had fled the region in the past. Past mistakes -- which led to the debt crisis and cost the region the `wasted decade' of the 1980's -- must be avoided in the use of public and private funds. It must be remembered that debt is still at a high level and could, in the medium-term, jeopardize the relative stability achieved over the last few years."
