Deryabin urges a debate on the peace treaty and on relations between Finland and Russia in two newspaper interviews. The Russian ambassador was interview by SUOMEN KUVALEHTI on Friday [18 February] and ILTALEHTI on Saturday. In SUOMEN KUVALEHTI Deryabin said that there is no reason to depart from the peace treaty of 1949. He also stressed that the Russian government has no proposals for changes preapared. Deryabin was expressing his own personal view. He also said that Russia is currently looking at Finland's response to the note about the two organizations, IKL [National Patriotic League] and Suur-Suomi [Greater Finland]. It is Deryabin's view that some sort of psychological problem is currently disturbing relations between Finland and Russia. It seems as if people in Finland do not trust Russia. Of the EU [European Union] negotiations Deryabin said that membership could bring with it certain legal problems with regard to Aland's demilitarized status. Aland's position is defined in the Paris agreement. Deryabin does not think that membership will have a negative effect on relations between Finland and Russia. He said that special arrangements for trade between Russia and Finland are possible. But Deryabin does not want to see Finland as a member of NATO. An enlargement of NATO in such a way that Russia is left outside would mean that Russia would be isolated, "with all the consequences this brings with it, including those in the field of domestic politics." For countries which are worried about their security Deryabin proposed some other alternative -- security guarantees from NATO and Russia, for example. In the interview in ILTALEHTI Deryabin stressed that if the Paris peace treaty is changed, Britain should also be consulted. Like the Soviet Union Britain enjoys a special position under the terms of the treaty. When the debate about the note flared up, Deryabin also had discussions with the British ambassador in Helsinki. According to Deryabin, Russia approves the unilateral interpretation of paragraph III of the treaty which Finland made in 1990 according to which Finland may acquire more defense materiel than the peace treaty actually permits. In ILTALEHTI Deryabin justified the note about the two organizations with the argument that "major events often start off as minor events" and referred, for example, to the new right-wing extremist parties that have been founded in Germany and Sweden. In the Paris Treaty of 1947 the popular patriotic IKL movement, civic guard organizations [skyddskaarorganisationerna], and women's voluntary defense services were banned. Deryabin stressed that his questions only relate to the IKL.
