It marks the first occasion on which representatives of the People's Republic of China have taken part officially in South African affairs. The first two observers arrived last week with Tian Zengpei, Beijing's Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs. China made a specific request to the UN that, as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, it had a right to take part in the democratic election process in South Africa. Pretoria and Beijing do not have formal diplomatic relations, but it has been reliably learnt that this is likely to change after the election. At present, the Republic of China (Taiwan) is recognised by Pretoria. Both countries, however, maintain "study centres" in South Africa. The centres are headed by senior career diplomats -- the former ambassador to Tanzania, Sun Guotong, heads the Chinese mission in Pretoria -- and deal with cultural matters and visa requirements. China has purchased property for an embassy in Arcadia, Pretoria, as well as a house in the exclusive Waterkloof suburb as its official residence. China is currently mounting a major diplomatic offensive in southern Africa and has in recent months forged trade and cultural links with South Africa. Various trade fairs have been held in SA and China -- the next is to take place in Pretoria in June -- while top government officials and trade missions have exchanged visits. Last year, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Renier Schoeman went to Beijing to formally open a South African "study centre."
