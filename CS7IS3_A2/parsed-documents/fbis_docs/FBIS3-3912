The CPC Central Committee has incessantly strengthened its leadership over propaganda and ideological work and made tremendous achievements and progress in overcoming the practice of "stressing one aspect to the neglect of others." On guidance for the media, the policy of unity, stability, and boosting morale has been implemented in the last few years. Under the care and direct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and its Propaganda Department, press and publication departments have united and coordinated with each other in forming a joint force and have maintained a high degree of unanimity with the party Central Committee, enabling propaganda and ideological work to create a comparatively good environment of public opinion for reform, opening up, and modernization. All major press units are devoting their efforts to deepen press reform. Radio and television stations have practiced a rolling, 24-hour broadcast system, during which the number of news broadcasts has been increased, the volume of information has been expanded, and the efficiency has been improved. They have provided some new columns including the "oriental era," and have also broadcast some good special reports and news commentaries. Some good creations have also emerged in the fields of literature and art. Take television series as an example. Their quantity and quality are steadily improving. Now there about 5,000 television series each year. The Central Television Studio alone broadcasts 1,800 television series each year and some are fine television series, such as "Tangming Huang," "A Native of Beijing in New York," "Big Tide," and "Zhu Jiang Filled With Sentiments." Despite big economic difficulties, the film business produced a number of fine movies with historical subjects on the occasions of the 40th founding anniversary of the PRC, the 70th founding anniversary of the CPC, and Chairman Mao's centennial. For example, the movie "Chongqing Negotiations" has produced good social effects and economic results. There are also good movies depicting real life. Some days ago, Comrade Li Lanqing spoke highly of the movie "Fenghuang Qin" over the telephone. Several central leaders also said the movie had practical significance. Facts have fully proved that the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core is firm and forceful in implementing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's policy of "doing two types of work simultaneously and laying equal stress on both." Recently, we have received many letters from watchers, including workers, peasants, teachers, intellectuals, and leading cadres. Some of them are still working and others have retired. Judging from these letters, the people welcome and are happy about the practice of doing two types of work simultaneously and giving correct guidance to the media. A grass-roots-level cadre in Yingkou City, Liaoning Province, wrote us a letter saying: "The Central Television Studio has recently broadcast rich and exciting programs on evening parties, documentary films, and feature films. This is very good. I hope your ministry (including provincial and city television studios) will frequently make and broadcast exciting, interesting, and varied entertainment programs the people like to see." "I also ask Minister Ai to inform other central-level leaders that China's press publicity and television guidance are correct, good, and well-received at present. Only by carrying out publicity in this way will a coherent and centripetal force be formed, will the entire party, the entire armed forces, and the entire people unite around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and will they work in unity and advance bravely according to the grand blueprint on building socialism with Chinese characteristics designed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping." After the Central Television Studio broadcast 100 television series on patriotism, primary school teachers in Beijing and some retired cadres wrote enthusiastic letters to us saying: "We are gratified to see recent changes in propaganda work." "Broadcasting 100 television series on patriotism is a wise move. Many of us warmly support this, both parents and students are happy about it." Recently, the Central Radio Station and Television Studio increased fine ethnic songs and dances in their broadcasts, as well as world famous, high-style entertainment programs. This immediately won the masses' approval. A member of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee's Standing Committee wrote a letter saying: "Tonight I watched the Central Television Studio's live coverage of a `New Year's Concert.' Evidently, the mood in literature and art circles is changing for the better and solemn music is beginning to appear again. Hopefully, more entertainment programs like this will be broadcast. In this way, the mood in the entire society will change for the better." Although there has been some improvement in films and television programs, there are also some aspects we must face squarely. The ideological and artistic quality of films and television programs is far from meeting the expectations of the party and the people. In pursuit of economic interests, many television studios and radio stations have complied with some watchers' vulgarity and their programs are full of sex, violence, and sordidness. And there have been too many imported television programs. Some Chinese-made movies and television programs have also adopted a vulgar style imported from abroad and some have even distorted history, disseminated wrong ideas, and are full of fabrications. These facts have proved that in our actual work there is still a need to overcome the habit of "stressing one aspect to the neglect of others." In the field of radio and television, material development is fast, but the quality of movies and television programs cannot meet the masses' demand or the need of socialist spiritual civilization. To further implement General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech and the instructions of the national meeting on propaganda and ideological work, consolidate our achievements, resolve the existing problems, and further carry out the policy of "doing two types of work simultaneously and laying equal stress on both," we must strengthen our leadership and the entire party must take action. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "There is a need to strengthen party leadership over the ideological front. Principal leaders of party committees from central to local levels must take into account the situation, problems, and work in theoretical circles, literature and art circles, as well as the entire ideological front." Radio broadcasts, films, and television programs are a component of the party's ideological front, are the mouthpieces of the party and the government, and are the bridges between the party and the government on the one hand and the people on the other. Radio, film, and television departments are exercising dual leadership with equal- level party committee and government leadership as the main component. We hope that party committees and governments in all localities will continue to strengthen their leadership over radio, film, and television work and enable local radio and television departments and film studios to take propaganda and creation work as their central task and improve the quality of their programs. I have the following five ideas on how to strengthen leadership: 1. The task must be clearly defined and our understanding must be unified. What is the task of radio, film, and television departments? This seems a simple question, but our front must clearly understand it. Comrade Deng Xiaoping set a clear task and demand on the entire propaganda and ideological front, including those engaged in radio, film, and television undertakings: "Our publication, television, and all other publicity workers must pay attention to this problem. There are communist ideals and beliefs in these people's minds. Our next generation and the subsequent generation must be educated in such a manner that they have lofty communist ideals. Our young people must be prevented from falling captive to the decadent capitalist ideology. This will absolutely not do." He explicitly pointed out that "warriors on the ideological front should be engineers of the human soul, hold high the banner of Marxism and socialism, educate and guide the people in correctly treating history, understanding practice, and having firm faith in socialism and party leadership, and encourage the people to work harder, make progress, have ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, and heroically strive for the materialization of our great and magnificent cause of socialist modernization." In press work on our front, we must uphold party spirit and provided correct guidance for the media. We have a comparatively unanimous understanding of this. But our understanding of literature and art is a little confused. Some comrades only stress that films and television plays are art and they themselves are artists; they do not agree that films and television programs have educational functions, still less they agree with the concept of a "main theme." Some commentaries even put forward specious slogans, such as "nonpoliticization," "nonheroization," "nontypification," and "nonutilitarianization." Some comrades say that film and television should mainly be for entertainment purposes. We should comprehensively, not one-sidedly, apprehend this issue. Films and television programs are for entertainment and enjoyment, but are also for improving the people's understanding and educating them. We should not stress one of their functions to the neglect of the others. These functions are complementary to each other and inseparable from each other. Radio, film, and television workers are propagandists of the party. In particular, they should not forget their heavy responsibility for providing ideological education and should, like Premier Zhou said, "take pleasure in educating people." They should bring the main theme into prominence and stick to diversification. They should sing in praise of the main theme -- patriotism, collectivism, and socialism -- and make their programs rich, healthy, and civilized so as to meet the increasing and diverse cultural and entertainment needs of the people to the maximum. Last year four departments and commissions, including the CPC Central Committee's Propaganda Department, selected 100 films and television programs on patriotism for public showing once a week. This was warmly welcomed by the people and provided us with much enlightenment. It completely conformed with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions: "Chinese history must be used to educate young people," and "it is necessary to understand some Chinese history, this is a spiritual impetus for China's development." In music and songs, we will also sort out and select fine works in different historical periods in a planned way for reservation purposes. They will be broadcast one after another and popularized among the people, with the aim of combining popularization and improvement. Efforts will be made to gradually substitute high-style, superior Chinese and foreign music and plays for negative, decadent, and unhealthy entertainment programs and to replace vulgar art with elegant art. In accordance with Central Committee and State Council leading comrades' instructions, we recently broadcast the advanced deeds of a number of middle-aged and young scientists, teachers, and personnel who returned from overseas studies. They have good morality and are highly professional and selflessly dedicated to the motherland's four modernizations. This has produced good results. In the future, we will conduct more interviews so that advanced people and heroes on all fronts will appear on television to display the heroic style and features of our era, set a good example for others to follow, and encourage healthy trends. 2. Corrosion by decadent ideas from abroad must be resolutely resisted and the bourgeois life-style must not be allowed to spread unchecked in China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping made overall remarks on what attitude should be taken toward Western bourgeois culture: "We should learn from the advanced science and technology of developed capitalist countries, their operational and managerial methods, as well as their knowledge and culture which are beneficial to us. Closing ourselves to foreign countries and refusing to make progress are stupid. But regarding things in the cultural field, Marxism must be used to analyze, appraise, and criticize their ideological contents and ways of manifestation." These remarks are suitable for our work concerning radio, film, and television productions. We must make efforts to follow these. Radio, film, and television equipment and technology are introduced from advanced countries. We have agreements on cooperation and exchanges with more than 100 countries and regions in the world and many of our television programs are introduced from outside the country. This is necessary. The problem is that the programs introduced from outside the country are not analyzed or appraised. Comrade Deng Xiaoping criticized this situation by saying that even films and video and audio tapes which are regarded as being of a low taste, vulgar, and harmful by Western countries are imported to China. For some time some lowly popular music, rock-and-roll music, and even disguised beauty pageants were rampant in radio broadcasts and television programs. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has advised us time and again: "The implementation of an open policy will inevitably bring about some bad things affecting our people. If there is any risk to mention, this is the biggest risk." "Historical experience suggests that it will not do without opening up to the world...opening up to the world will certainly bring about some negative factors." We must maintain high vigilance against the decadent ideology and culture from outside the country. In the media field, a large quantity of Western, Hong Kong, and Taiwan films, laser discs, and audio and video products are flooding into China through all kinds of legal and illegal channels (most are illegal), seriously affecting Chinese-made films and occupying most video showing centers in urban and rural areas. Most of these films and video and audio products are of a low style and have done much damage to young people's minds. What is equally noteworthy, some people outside the country use money and prizes as bait to reduce others into making films which denigrate Chinese history, disseminate China's dark side, and negate socialism. Some people have even come to China to hold all sorts of "charity performances" disguised as "beauty pageants." They use a great deal of money and prizes to recklessly propagate high consumption, pleasure seeking, a corrupt life-style, and a negative and decadent ideology and culture. These activities have produced a great deal of serious consequences. For the sake of socialist spiritual civilization and to provide better education for the next generation, we must firmly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions: "We are firmly pursuing a policy of opening up to the outside world and are expanding our exchanges with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. At the same time, we should remain sober-minded, resolutely resist the corrosion of decadent ideas from abroad, and absolutely not allow the bourgeois lifestyle to spread in China." 3. The relations between economic returns and social benefit should be correctly handled and the wrong practice of "gearing all efforts toward money-making" must be resolutely opposed. In an article "The Party's Urgent Task on the Organizational and Ideological Fronts," Comrade Deng Xiaoping sharply criticized the manifestation of "gearing all efforts toward money-making" in the cultural field. He pointed out: "This `gearing all efforts toward money-making' -- a tendency of commercializing spiritual production -- has also found expression in other aspects of spiritual production. Some people have simply become businessmen who put profit-making first." Through practice, we deeply feel that "gearing all efforts toward money-making" is an important factor causing the practice of "stressing one point to the neglect of others." For example, what attitude should we take on satellite television programs from outside the country? Out of consideration for the country's fundamental interests and for the sake of strengthening socialist spiritual civilization, we should exercise strict management. This is very explicit, but we have encountered many difficulties. An important reason is that some people think that there is a large market for manufacturing and selling ground antennas, therefore they favor "lifting control." In the final analysis, the rampant import of films has been caused by "gearing all efforts toward money-making." Some Chinese-made films have also imitated imported films to meet the vulgar taste of some people, thus causing an unhealthy cycle and seriously damaging our spiritual civilization. Through practice, we deeply feel that, although spiritual products also bear a commercial nature and the law of value should be respected, it is all the more necessary to exercise macrocontrol and regulation over spiritual products than material products. We should not blindly allow the market to regulate the prices of spiritual products. The quality of some high-budget television series in the market is not good, and this is a clear example. It is the same with films. Films with good box office are not necessarily good in quality, because rich people do not necessarily have a great ability to appreciate good films. Those who can appraise the quality of films are not necessarily those who have a lot of money. In the final analysis, this boils down to what Premier Zhou has said, namely, it is the people who are the most authoritative judges. In a word, we must resolutely carry out Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions: "Ideological, cultural, educational, and health departments should take social effects as their only criterion for judging all their activities, and enterprises affiliated with these departments should also take social effects as their supreme criterion." 4. We hope all localities will provide support and assurance in terms of policy and principle so as to promote our cause. We hope to introduce some policies to support and encourage radio, film, and television businesses. For example, following the increase in revenue, our investment should also be increased to provide financial support. All local party committees and governments are required to do a good job in relaying the first-channel programs from central, provincial, and city radio and television broadcasts. Many comrades said that reception of Central Television Studio programs is hardly available from localities outside Beijing, particularly from the grass-roots level. The CPC Central Committee's Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television have jointly issued a circular asking localities to make a success of relaying central programs. We suggest "sending charcoal in snowy weather" in improving radio and television understanding. We should expand our broadcast coverage and should not carry out duplicate construction or blindly pursue many programs. It is necessary to further resolve the difficulties of rural, mountainous, and ethnic areas in receiving radio and television programs. All localities should take radio, film, and television undertakings seriously. 5. We should build our contingent with unremitting efforts and improve its quality. The core of strengthening our contingent is strengthening party building. In particular, the entire party must be armed with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In the meantime, we should also conduct a profound struggle against corruption for a clean administration and firmly stop the practice of "compensatory press reports." Now initial results have been achieved in stopping the practice of "compensatory press reports." But there are still some prominent problems: A small number of famous actors and program presenters like to ask for "appearance charges," and others are in the habit of demanding pay and commission in soliciting sponsorships to evade personal income tax. We will continue to resolutely rectify malpractices in our undertakings, improve professional ethics, energetically propagate the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, hard struggle, and selfless dedication, and strive to cultivate a fine image and reputation in our socialist radio, film, and television undertakings. We are engaged in the production of spiritual products, and therefore we should remain in a lofty ideological realm. In short, in this new situation, our field undertakes a heavy task and there are also many problems and difficulties. But we firmly believe that under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and the State Council, with the common efforts of all localities and departments, we will uphold the policy of doing two types of work simultaneously and laying equal stress on both, proceed with our work in a down-to-earth manner, do our jobs solidly, scale new heights in radio, film, and television undertakings, achieve new progress, and make contributions to strengthening socialist spiritual civilization and expediting reform, opening up, and modernization.
