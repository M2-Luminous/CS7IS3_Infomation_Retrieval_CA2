Tanaka told a news conference the survey, known as Tankan, was a "big plus factor" for the domestic economy and the agency hopes the government's stimulus measures will lead to full-fledged recovery. He cited sluggish capital investment plans by medium and small enterprises as a minus factor which can be traced to growing investment overseas by manufacturers. Tanaka said the central bank report was one of the factors for judging domestic economic trends and that the agency will take all such factors into account in making its own assessment of the economy.
