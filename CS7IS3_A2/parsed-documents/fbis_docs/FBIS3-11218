Baena said: "Issues such as the gap between those having too much and those having nothing and the lack of equal opportunities must be addressed to consolidate democracy." He said: "I have noticed that there is growing awareness of this problem among governments, which appear to have the political will to address it in an orderly fashion." Commenting on Cuba's readmission to the OAS, Baena said the issue "is generally discussed in the hallways" of the OAS. Baena noted that there are two positions on the subject: On the one hand, there are those contending that "the time has come to review the situation," while on the other there are governments, such as that of the United States, that "contend that first there must be internal changes in Cuba before reconsidering its readmission." Baena said he is in favor of revising the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty (TIAR), which was unsuccessfully invoked by Argentina to obtain U.S. help during the Malvinas War. Baena, who is a Brazilian diplomat, added: "Just as the OAS amended its charter three times during the past 10 years, it is necessary to revise the TIAR, which was signed under very different circumstances than those prevailing today. We must give new answers for new circumstances."
