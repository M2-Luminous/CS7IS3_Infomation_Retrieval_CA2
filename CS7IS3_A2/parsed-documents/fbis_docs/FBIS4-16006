FBIS4-16006 "drsov071_p_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 CAUCASUS Armenia Further Details, Fighting Updated Further Details, Fighting Updated LD1204150394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1300 GMT 12 Apr 94 LD1204150394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Two Azeri aircrafts after violating Armenian air space late on Monday dropped bombs on the border towns of Goris and Kapan, a Defence Ministry spokesman in Yerevan told Interfax. Reports speak of destruction but no casualties, he said. Armenian defences were unable to thwart the attack because the two planes flew at a low altitude making it difficult to detect them. Two days ago, Azerbaijan carried out a bombing raid on several areas in Nagorno-Karabakh and its administrative center Stepanakert; one woman and two children were killed and nine other people injured, most of them women and children. However, Baku denies this. The Armenian villages of Movses and Aigepar in the Taush region and Armenian positions outside Aigeovit and Vazashen villages came under intensive artillery fire from Azeri troops in the past twenty-four hours, the press office of the Armenian Defence Ministry said. There were civilian casualties, it informed. It also said Armenian forces foiled an Azeri advance outside the Aigeovit village in the Idjevan Region on Monday. There were casualties on both sides. For its part, the Azeri Defence Ministry reports that Karabakh forces which received reinforcements from Armenia had tried to launch an offensive in the northern part of the frontline outside the village of Gyulistan in the Geranboi (formerly Shaumian) region. Baku says that about 2,000 Karabakh troops and dozens of tanks were involved. Azeri government troops have so far succeeded in containing the Armenian advance, it said. In a separate development, Armenian forces launched an offensive on the eastern Azeri villages of Talysh, Madagiz and Levonarkh in the Ter-Ter Region. Several people were killed or injured after Armenian troops mounted rocket fire on the administrative center Ter-Ter whose population is 20,000. More fighting is reported elsewhere on the front including the Agdam Region. Several population centers in the Tauz Region came under cross border rocket and artillery fire from Armenia leading to civilian casualties, the Azeri Defence Ministry said.
