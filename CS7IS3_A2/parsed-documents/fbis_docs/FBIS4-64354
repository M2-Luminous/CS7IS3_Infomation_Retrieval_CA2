The exercise entitled Resolute Response [preceding name in English] is under the command of Iberlant [Iberian Atlantic Command] in Oeiras near Lisbon. The future of Iberlant is somewhat uncertain. Cid Saldanha reports: [Begin recording] [Saldanha] About 4,000 NATO marines landed in the Bay of Cadiz today for one stage in the exercise Resolute Response, which involves 90 ships, 250 planes, and more than 35,000 staff. [passage omitted] For Admiral Carmo Duro, commander in chief of Iberlant, this exercise demonstrates the importance of this Iberian command in the Atlantic, but as Renascenca has learned, the future of Iberlant is somewhat uncertain. Everything is still being studied, but it is highly likely that the Oeiras headquarters will be transferred to the NATO European command, SACEUR [Supreme Allied Commander, Europe]. [Duro] Last year it appeared that Iberlant would not disappear as a headquarters under someone else's control. I believe this national objective must be preserved. It was public knowledge last year that the objective was to increase Iberlant's area and put it under the European command. [Saldanha] In addition to this possibility, it is almost certain that the Iberlant command will no longer be the exclusive responsibility of the Navy and it will rotate among the other branches. Another possibility is the simple extinction of Iberlant as a major subordinate NATO command [preceding two words in English] in the Atlantic. [Duro] If it is decided to end within NATO with the [word indistinct] of the Atlantic, then this headquarter's role will be different. If there is a rotation between the three branches of the Armed Forces here, I believe it will be to command Portuguese forces, almost exclusively. [Saldanha] In this case there would be a reduction of Portugal's influence in NATO. It is the old war between Atlantic and European commands -- in other words, the tug-of-war between Washington and Brussels with Portugal on the Atlantic border. [end recording]
