He referred to the numerous opportunities provided for that criminal gang to cease fire and end the shedding of Yemeni blood. The latest of these opportunities, he said, was the one provided for the fifth time to that gang this morning. Yet, he added, the gang continues its violations and its aggression against our Armed Forces, which observed the cease-fire decision and complied with the Security Council's resolution. The brother president explained that by repeatedly violating the cease-fire, that gang is trying to bring in international observers and to internationalize the Yemeni crisis, pointing out that some states hostile to Yemen's unity are flagrantly interfering in Yemen's domestic affairs and encouraging the secessionist rebels to prolong the current conflict, in the implementation of plans to disrupt Yemeni unity. He said our Yemeni people absolutely reject any interference in their internal affairs and will firmly confront it, as well as all plans hostile to their unity and their democratic course. President Salih then expressed his confidence that the permanent member states of the UN Security Council will take a firm and clear position toward these acts of interference in Yemen's domestic affairs, based on their support for Yemen's unity and its democratic pluralism. He said unity and democracy are the basis for stability in Yemen, stressing that they will never be relinquished because they are the true basis for a new Yemen--a basis which will realize the aspirations of our Yemeni people and which is in harmony with the trends of the new world order. He reaffirmed our country's commitment to Security Council Resolution No. 924, as well as its decision to provide every possible support to make the fact-finding mission of brother Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, successful. For their part, the ambassadors reaffirmed their countries' support for unity and democracy in our country, as well as their readiness to support every effort for a cease-fire and to implement the Security Council's resolution regarding the Republic of Yemen. The meeting was attended by brother Yahya Husayn al-'Arashi, minister of civil service and administrative reform. Today, as well, the brother chairman of the Presidential Council received the ambassadors of the Arab Maghreb Union member states to our country and discussed with them issues pertaining to relations between our country and the Arab Maghreb Union member states. They also reviewed developments in our country in light of the secessionist rebel gang's criminal acts against the homeland and the people, after it triggered war and infighting among the sons of the one Yemeni homeland. The brother president explained to the brother ambassadors that the secessionist rebel gang is continuing to violate the cease-fire decision. It is flagrantly challenging the national consensus and international will, although that criminal gang has been given many chances to end the bloodshed in Yemen. But, he said, it continues its aggression on our country while it invites other parties' hostility to Yemen in order to enable the enemies of the homeland to interfere in Yemen's internal affairs as part of a secessionist, criminal plan to disrupt the Yemeni homeland. The brother president then expressed his appreciation of the principled, firm pan-Arab positions of the Arab Maghreb Union member states and their support for their brothers in Yemen and for the march of Yemen's unity and democracy, which constitute a basis for stability in Yemen and the region and which will entrench higher pan-Arab goals. He expressed his confidence that these positions will continue for the benefit of Yemen and the Arab nation. The meeting was attended by Yahya Husayn al-'Arashi, minister of civil service and administrative reform.
