And, at the same time, he warned of dire consequences for any KANU leader that will be seen to be cooperating with any officials from the FORD-Kenya party. The president explained that when KANU accepted to cooperate with FORD-Kenya, it was because he knew the political policies of the late FORD-Kenya leader Jaramogi Oginga Odinga well, and Odinga too understood President Moi's policies. However, the president added that recent events and remarks by some FORD-Kenya officials have completely disqualified them from that cooperation. President Moi was speaking at the Kericho Show Ground when he officially opened this year's Kericho Agricultural Show. The president further said that for the past two years he had been eagerly watching the outbusts and actions of some officials from FORD-Kenya and had come to the conclusion that those leaders had lost a sense of direction. He said KANU stood for peace and stability and cannot, therefore, enter into any cooperation with the party that excels in abuses. President Moi, who is also the president of the ruling party KANU, said he was definitely annoyed by the insults directed at him but restrained himself because of his great love for the children of this country. He, however, added that tolerance has a limit. [passage omitted].
