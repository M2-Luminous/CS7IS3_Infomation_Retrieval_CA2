Thus, Mr. Baburyan considers the mass media statements on the agreement on the Karabakh troops withdrawal within the period of 20 days, as groundless ones. Mass media reported on the fact that the agreement was as if achieved as a result of the recent meeting of Babken Ararktsyan, a Chairman of the Armenian Parliament, and Rasul Guliyev, a Chairman of the Azerbaijani Milli Majlis. According to the information the Karabakh side possesses, Mr. Chairman said, there were discussed ways of the Armenian-Azerbaijani relations. No concrete treaty was concluded.
