Gaydar: because only 50 percent of the 1990 economic potential remained intact there. It is necessary to change priorities and period keep key sectors of industry under government jurisdiction during the transition," --thinks the chairman of the economics committee of the Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Leytland. Our correspondent speaks with him. [Badov] In everyday terms the evaluation of the crisis differs depending on the position of the person doing the evaluating--who has been burned and who has kept warm. In this sense, as far as I know, your view of the economic barometer is "three dimensional"--as an industrialist in the post of president of the Siberian Highway Corporation, a banker as the representative of the board of the Narkombank, and as a politician who heads up the economics committee of the Democratic Party of Russia. [Leytland] No matter which side you look from, there is nothing to make you feel better. The "Chicago model" turned out to be utter quack medicine for our sick economy and it must be replaced before it is too late. [Badov] Many see the defeat of the Gaydar bloc as a sign of public rejection of the monetarist model of reform. Since Gaydar's resignation, those who took his rhetoric at face value are grieving over the notion that Russia is about to be knocked off the bright path of economic liberalism. And right at a time when the most unfavorable, "shock" part of the reform is behind us. But the economic program of the Democratic Party of Russia, in which you along with Glazyev and Bogomolov also had a hand, not only denies the correctness of the path chosen by Gaydar and his followers in government but also raises doubts about whether these reforms were actually liberal in nature: "Today instead of a market with free competition, a semi-feudal market is being formed." Is this not a polemical exaggeration? [Leytland] I do not see any exaggeration. During the course of what was called liberal reform the mechanisms the suppress competition became even stronger. While in terms of degree of "liberalization" of the economy we outdid developed capitalist countries. What kind of paradox is this? But the dirty trick is that this present "free will"--freedom from state regulation--has been absurdly "augmented" with freedom from responsibility for the means and results of economic activity. And the first victims of these economic machinations were the consumers and small enterprises. An oligarchy is appearing which is suppressing competition and advancing the interests of society, which include the demand for efficiency. Incentives for productive activity are simply disappearing. [Badov] The old bureaucratic command system tied the hands of people with entrepreneurial inclinations but it was unable to close its eyes to their self-will. The imperative for economic growth held sway over bureaucrats from the Gosplan [State Planning Commission] and also local party bosses. One gets the impression that the present authorities have no such imperative. [Leytland] Perhaps not. Two years of life according to a monetarist calendar have led to a degradation of the economy that it would have been difficult to imagine. We industrialists and entrepreneurs, who in words have been given our "freedom," have ended up in traps stronger than those of the nomenklatura-- financial and doctrinaire ones, but with the opposite sign. Remember the discussions of Bukharin and Larin from 1918 and their furious attack on "bourgeois" commodity production. It is as though this historical scene has returned again: There is the same restraint and "righteousness," but with a switching of the poles. And the same indifference to the price they pay to get what they want. They have thrown the works of the Putilovs and Ryabushkins on the bonfire--the potential of the second largest economy in the world. We had ruined everything with our reforms when the national economy began to go on the auction block and the best capital and resources were being used to pay for debts and forfeitures. Does the fact that foreign investors have actually invested a paltry $180 million in Tyumen oil and gas not tell you anything? In my times as leader of the trust in Samotlor we assimilated comparable sums with a large trust in one season. Foreign investors are bypassing Russia. It is not only political instability that is to blame for this. It is simply that they see that our economy is failing and more and more appreciably oligarchic tendencies are coming forth to control it. Western entrepreneurs and bankers are surprised at how "democratic" we are. They give us to understand in an open exchange of opinions that this is good, that the Russians have finally recognized the advantages of a market economy, but in our enthusiasm for renouncing communism, why should we let the economy slide downhill? Not one of the former socialist countries has had such pathetic results. Go through the Western supermarkets. They are crammed with high-quality clothing from the Chinese provinces, Singapore, and even Bangladesh, where people live in shacks like during Kipling's times. But you will not see Russian goods of export quality next to them on the shelf: They simply are not produced. There is a true sign that Russia does not have healthy business activity. Light industry has dropped the production of more than half of its goods. And the most rapid turnover of capital is here. Instead of this the stores and shops throughout Russia are filled with discarded imported goods of mediocre quality. And the burgeoning network of shops will soon begin to fail because of the decline of consumer demand. But all that is trivial compared to the closing of mines, shops, and institutes.... Only 57 percent of our 1990 economic potential has remained intact. And the decline of production has accelerated sharply in recent times. Essentially we are experiencing not the costs of reform but economic disaster. True, there are still enthusiasts whose heads have not been cleared even by the cold breeze of the elections to the Duma, and they are calling for making the policy more radical. They are inciting the government to "accelerate" the reforms even more. As in the tragic plot from the "Golden Calf," these radicals are prepared to saw even more weights in two. "But what if suddenly the weights are not made of gold?" The people who were about to accept the radicals' promises on faith are worried. But in response they hear the sacramental: "Saw, Shura, saw." The pragmatic wing in the government were hanging onto the coattails of the "monetarists" even before. Let us just recall the practical and businesslike steps of Chernomyrdin and Soskovets and the demarches of Lobov and Zaveryukha. Realists and pragmatists have long been aware that the dough being mixed by the "monetarists" will never rise.... Thanks to the pragmatists in all stages the economy is still functioning somehow and the infrastructures are still whole. The government has undertaken a number of protectionist measures to protect the national producer. But it is too early to get our hopes up. In terms of many indicators, the crisis, I repeat, has entered a destructive phase. [Badov] Let us sum up a certain outcome from the Russian version of "shock therapy." Is it true, as inveterate optimists assert, that the critical phase of the crisis of the economy is behind us and the forces of market self-regulation will rectify the situation themselves? [Leytland] In January 1992 the "government of intellectuals" ventured to refrain from state regulation of economic processes, concentrating on macroeconomic policy. So that the market could start to function and money would become the "commodity of commodities," a simple gentlemen's "collection" was proposed--achieving a deficit-free budget, stiffening credit policy, and restricting the money supply. The result was the opposite of what was expected: There was sharp decline of production, high inflation, a growing threat of collapse of the state sector, and ineffectiveness of the weak private sector. There was an increased tendency toward deindustrialization of the national economy with a real prospect of turning Russia into a cheap market for raw material and work force for highly developed countries. [Badov] But there are also signs that the course is being adjusted. [Leytland] The failure of the policy of macro-stabilization forced the government to take the reigns but, in the big picture, the course that was selected has not changed: from liberalization of prices--to demonopolization. Still it seems to me that we must take the opposite path, that is, to liberalization through the creation of competition. The real condition of the economy, the extreme level of its monopolization, and the "difficult" structure as well as the lack of an effective competitive environment make it necessary to change economic priorities. The potential base for the new economic policy would be the consumer sector defining and not backward development of it--only it is capable of restoring material incentives for labor and accumulation, which will move the investment process off the mark. Next I want to say something that will cause general indignation among the radicals: During the transition period we must keep the key sectors of industry, the most important ones for the survival of the entire economy, under state control, consistently creating along with this a nonmonopolized, nonstate sector. [Badov] Do you really consider it possible to put up with monopolies for a certain amount of time? [Leytland] The monopolies have not gone anywhere. The problem is that all at once, in one fell swoop, we gained a decaying market where the monopolists, left uncurbed by the state, grabbed us by the throat, establishing arbitrary prices and decontrolling production volumes. A change in the form of ownership is frequently not accompanied by the elimination of monopolies. In order to escape the vicious circle it is necessary to use the as yet unforfeited ability of the monopolized sector to stabilize and maintain the level of industrial production. Further, through state regulation it is necessary to change price ratios in the economy in favor of the nonmonopolized sector. Such a system of shifting relative prices will make it possible to stimulate rapid development of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship and to set the mechanism of competition in motion. It is necessary to restore the national market as well. The most important thing for Russia is still a market within the boundaries of the CIS countries. I consider the deepening tendency toward isolation of national markets to be unpromising and dangerous. [Badov] And what about inflation? [Leytland] There is no miraculous means of curbing inflation as long as the factors encouraging it are in play. I would include among them the government's eagerness to raise prices of energy sources and raw material to the world level while the exchange rate of the ruble is declining and monopolized large sectors of the economy are uncontrolled, and money is being printed in "waves." The only real ways of fighting inflation are at the micro level. Such a deep and steady depression throughout the entire front of the economy as we have today cannot be surmounted with ordinary market methods. I think that in very short periods of time the industrialists, trade unions, and government should conclude a General Agreement on Wages, Prices, Profit, and Capital Investments. After this, officially regulated prices can be legally documented as maximum prices. There is an urgent need for indexation of the assets of the enterprises. We need an official monthly price indexation based on the balance of the industrial and product "baskets," with priority for agricultural products. Finally, we must take steps to abolish the value added tax in both construction and agriculture. [Badov] So you do not share the favorite idea of the monetarists about a "deficit-free budget at any price...." [Leytland] A budget with a zero deficit under conditions where only half of the pre-perestroyka national income is left and you cannot knock very much off state expenses is a utopia. The main measures in the area of finance and credit should be aimed at surmounting the crisis and stimulating production and business activity, which will produce added national income and hence more for the budget. The resignation of the "architect of the reform," Gaydar, seems to have marked the end of past illusions and seductions. We have all emerged from a situation where freedom of entrepreneurship was suppressed and denied. To use the apt comparison of our great compatriot and Nobel prize winner Vasiliy Leontyev, we were trying "to teach penguins to fly" just like that. Neither "penguins" nor "storm petrels" will replace the pragmatists if we really do not want to create an efficient economy where everyone pays his own bills.
