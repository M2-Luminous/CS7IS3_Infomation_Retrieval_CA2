Once renowned for sloppy work practices, an over-unionised workforce, lacklustre merchandise and low productivity, Britain is today leading a field of overweight European economies towards recovery. And bringing up the rear is Germany, the one-time home of the economic miracle. Nothing, it seems, lasts forever. These changes are borne out by a survey of 100,000 companies in eight European countries undertaken by the European Chambers of Commerce. The report finds that Britain's economic recovery paints the most optimistic picture for the future while Germany's is one of the gloomiest. The findings mirror THE EUROPEAN's own 1994 forecasts, published earlier this month. Described as the largest economic survey in the world, this new report says 1994 will be a turning point. However, the degree of improvement will not be sufficient to reverse the key problem of rising unemployment or to encourage entrepreneurs to raise investment. West German entrepreneurs are highly sceptical about future propspects with one-third predicting that developments for their company will be unfavourable. Recovery -- not expected until late this year will be "a long and difficult process." As a consequence recovery in eastern Germany is being hampered, although 35 percent of entrepreneurs count on favourable development for their company, albeit from a low baseline. British entrepreneurs are at the other end of the spectrum. "The UK has experienced a steady climb out of recession since the beginning of 1991," says the report. "The withdrawal of sterling from the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in September 1992 improved their competitive position further." Nearly 60 percent of UK companies expect beneficial developments in 1994. Despite a slowing of exports, the UK picture is now one of a gradual return to growth. Although European recovery is largely unsynchronised, improvements in the UK economy may augur well for other member states. However, this premise should be treated with caution because structural, monetary and social circumstances differ between countries. In Ireland, changeable interest and currency levels created serious difficulties for firms. In Italy, devaluation of the lira in September 1992 engendered cautious optimism among exporters. In the Netherlands, last year was perceived as a disappointing year with prospects for this year gloomy. "In 1993, turnover fell, investment decreased and the number of jobs fell for the first time since 1982," says the survey. Although Greece's economic climate was poor in 1993, companies reported an increase in turnover and investment. Spain was also hard hit but the outlook for this year is brighter as exports increase and business experiences a modest recovery. Completion of the single European market in January last year has not proved a landmark for companies because steps towards greater integration had already been introduced. The study says a strengthening market will boost the economy in the medium term. Despite progress, many companies complain about barriers which still exist in the areas of customs procedure, statistical declaration and standards.
