The round of Latvian-Russian interstate talks, scheduled for March 14, can turn out to be the last meeting on troop withdrawal, speakers said. The delegations are expected to sign an interstate treaty according to which Russia withdraws its troops from Latvia by Aug. 31 but Latvia allows it control the Skrunda radar for five and a half years. The Popular Front has sent the government several resolutions urging to not to agree with Russia on such conditions. The front's stance is shared by all nationally-oriented political organizations, said its Deputy Chairman Juris Kokins. Kokins described the rally as the last means that his organization uses to attain quicker dismantling of the radar station. In the opinion of the front's specialists, Russia needs the radar not as a technical installation but as a military base where it could keep its troops and what could be used for various political purposes, Kokins said. The existence of a like military base on the Latvian soil is unacceptable to the international public opinion. In accordance with U.N. resolutions, Russia must get its troops out of Latvia speedily, orderly and completely. Kokins conceded that the rally could serve to raise the front's political prestige what is important in view of the coming local government elections. The front, however, does not cherish great hopes for successful performance in the election, Kokins said. The rally was attended by around 1,000 people holding slogans, like "Russia -- the World's Greatest Racketeer -- Wants to Abduct Latvia" and "Skrunda is Occupation Military Base."
