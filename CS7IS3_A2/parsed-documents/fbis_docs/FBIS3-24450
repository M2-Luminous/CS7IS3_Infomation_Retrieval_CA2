Food prices rose at a higher rate (by 2.5-4 percent) in the Northwestern and Volga regions and Kaliningrad Oblast; in the cities of the Far East prices remained practically unchanged. Consumer market indices of prices for consumer goods and services were as follows (as a percentage of the preceding date): 02/22 02/28 03/05 Average daily price rise March February Consumer goods 101.9 101.5 101.7 0.34 0.34 and services including: foodstuffs 101.6 101.2 101.5 0.31 0.32 nonfood items 102.4 101.9 101.5 0.31 0.34 for-fee 101.7 101.7 104.8 0.94 0.48 services for the population Since the beginning of the year prices for goods and services have increased by 35.7 percent, including for foodstuffs--by 34.4 percent, nonfood items--by 25.6 percent, and for-fee services for the population--2.1-fold. Foodstuffs. Over the first five days of March prices in organized and unorganized trade rose at practically the same rate--1.5 percent and 1.9 percent. Price changes by main categories of food products over the period 28 February to 5 March are shown below: As % of the preceding observation date Total including: in organized in nonorganized trade trade All food products 101.5 101.5 101.9 including: Meat and meat 101.3 101.4 101.0 products Fish and fish 102.3 102.3 100.6 products Milk and milk 102.9 103.1 101.8 products Eggs 101.1 101.2 99.6 Sugar 100.3 100.3 100.0 Bread and bakery 106.4 106.4 products Cereals and 102.5 102.5 102.3 macaroni items Vodka 97.2 97.1 100.4 Potatoes and 104.2 104.2 104.2 vegetables [Text] In organized trade over the first days of March prices went up by 5-9 percent for basic varieties of bread and bakery products and some varieties of fruit and vegetables. Milk and milk products prices increased by 3-4 percent. Prices for butter, vegetable oil, meat products, eggs, and sugar remained practically unchanged. Prices for oranges and vodka decreased by 1-3 percent. In nonorganized trade the greatest price increases were registered with respect to fresh cabbage--by 9.5 percent, milk--by 5 percent, potatoes, beets, and carrots--by 2-3 percent. The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs rose over the week by 2.4 percent and as of 5 March amounted to 42,300 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured a factor of 3.7. Moscow is in 35th place of 132 monitored cities (R46,000 on a monthly basis). Nonfood items. Over the period 28 February to 5 March prices for medicines increased by 2.3 percent; those for fabrics, sewn items, and knitwear rose by 1.5-1.7 percent, and for footwear--by 0.6 percent. For-fee services for the population. Service fees rose by 4.8 percent over the period under review. Rents in municipal housing went up by 25 percent, and hot water supply rates--by almost 20 percent. The cost of some varieties of consumer services, urban bus fares, and the cost of keeping a child in a preschool facility went up by 5-8 percent. Cost of Raw and Manufactured Input Materials The Russian State Committee on Statistics has summarized the current data on the level and dynamics of average prices of purchasing 170 categories of basic raw and manufactured input materials obtained from a selected sample of enterprises in industry and construction. The average price includes, in addition to production cost, transportation and selling expenses, taxes and excise taxes. Prices for raw and manufactured input materials purchased by enterprises increased in February of this year by 13 percent as compared to January, including those purchased from suppliers within Russia--by 12 percent, from CIS countries--by 22 percent, and from foreign countries--by 16 percent (wholesale prices for industrial output increased by 16 percent in February of this year as compared to January 1994). Over two months of the current year, prices for raw and manufactured input materials purchased by industrial users increased by 34 percent (industrial producers' wholesale prices--by 37 percent). The cost of construction materials increased at a greater rate. Over the month prices for materials purchased by construction contractor organizations rose by 26 percent, and since the beginning of the year--by 51 percent. Wholesale prices of construction materials producers increased by 16 percent and 40 percent, respectively. Purchase price dynamics by main categories of raw and manufactured input materials are characterized by the following data: as % of the preceding month February 1994 as % of December 1993 January 1994 February 1994 Electric power 118 109 129 Heat 118 128 151 Fuel 125 113 142 Raw and manufactured 113 113 127 materials for heavy industry for light and 106 115 122 food-processing industry Construction 120 126 151 materials, parts, and prefabricated components Purchase prices for fuel rose over the month by 13 percent, including for oil--by 19 percent, natural gas--by 14 percent, boiler oil and diesel fuel--by 15-18 percent. Oil refining industry enterprises purchased oil in February on average at R80,000 per tonne (production cost--R52,000). The price of natural gas used in electric power generation amounted on average to R32,000 per thousand cubic meters (production price--R3,200); the average price of coal used in power generation--R19,000, and coal for coking--R50,000 per tonnes, with a production price on average across Russia of R13,000. Purchase prices for raw and manufactured input materials differ depending on the supplier. For instance, it was cheaper for Russian producers to purchase conversion pig iron, iron ore, certain varieties of rolled metal, flax fiber, and granulated sugar from CIS member countries suppliers than on the domestic market. At the same time, coal and some varieties of synthetic thread and fiber were purchased from suppliers in near abroad countries at higher prices. Purchase prices differed considerably by region. For instance, the purchase price of lumber for Ivanovo Oblast enterprises amounted to R76 million per 1,000 cubic meters of solid wood, and in Rostov Oblast--R92 million. Food-processing enterprises in Krasnodar Kray purchased vegetable oil at R735,000, and in Sverdlovsk Oblast--R1,496,000 per tonne. Cement prices ranged from R96,000 in Amur Oblast to R19,000 per tonne in Smolensk Oblast (with an average for Russia price of R37,000). In the Central region the highest level of purchase prices for basic construction materials was registered in Moscow and Moscow Oblast. Higher freight rates (by 15 percent in February as compared to January of this year) led to increased transportation expenses for enterprises in industry and construction. Last month freight expenses at surveyed industrial enterprises and construction contractor organizations amounted on average to 12 percent of the cost of purchased raw and manufactured input materials. Transportation expenses comprise more than one-quarter of the purchase price of commercial timber; apatite concentrate--more than 40 percent; road metal and sand--about 50 percent; cement, asphalt-concrete mix, asbestos-cement sheets, and construction brick--more than 15 percent. Industrial Production In January-February of this year Russian industry produced almost R34 trillion worth of output in current prices, including R18 trillion worth in February. As compared to last January-February, the physical volume of production declined by 23.6 percent, including by 23.1 percent in January and 24.1 percent in February. The volume of average daily production (as a percentage of the preceding month, without taking into account seasonal factors) amounted to: February--105 percent; January--89 percent; December 1993--103.7 percent; and November--97 percent. In January-February 1994, of the 406 most important categories of products counted in periodic reports, the production volume of 37 items increased as compared to January-February of 1993, and of 362 items--declined. In the fuel and power generation sectors, the volume of electric power generation declined by 4 percent in January-February of this year as compared to January-February of last year. Over two months of this year, oil production amounted to 50.5 million tonnes, including gas condensate, which is 13 percent less than in January-February of 1993; 50.3 million tonnes of coal (8 percent less), and 109 billion cubic meters of gas (the same level as over the same two months last year). In ferrous metallurgy in January-February of this year the lag as compared to the corresponding period of last year amounted to: with respect to pig iron output--20 percent; steel--26 percent; production of finished rolled metal--22 percent; and that of steel pipe--48 percent. In January of this year the output of half of the monitored items in machine-building amounted to 50 percent or less of that for the corresponding period of last year (metal-cutting machine tools, drop forge machines, bulldozers, freight railcars, tractors, trucks, grain and fodder harvesting combines, and others). In the chemical and petrochemical industry, production of most varieties of the most important categories of output continued to fall in February. Over the two months as a whole, production of synthetic ammonia declined by 26 percent, sulfuric acid--by 30 percent, calcinated soda--by 53 percent, mineral fertilizer--by 29 percent, chemical thread and fiber--by 49 percent, and automotive tires--by 41 percent. Production of pipeline pipe and components made of thermoplastics, as well as fiberglass and items made of it, declined by more than one half, and of chemical insecticides and pesticides--by two-thirds. Output of tires for agricultural vehicles amounted to less than one-third of last year's. In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry average daily output of wood-chip panels, window and door frames, and garden homes increased in February as compared to January. At the same time, the output of commercial timber fell in January-February of this year by more than one-third as compared to the corresponding period of last year, of lumber--by 30 percent, laminated plywood--by 22 percent, mine props and wooden transportation containers--by more than one-half, and prefabricated homes made of wood--by three-quarters. In the pulp and paper industry, production of paper and cardboard declined as compared to January-February of last year by 22 percent and 39 percent. The output of newsprint was 20 percent greater than last year. In the construction materials industry in January-February of this year, as compared to the same period of last year, production of cement declined by 35 percent, soft roofing and insulation materials--by 43 percent, brick--by 24 percent, and window glass--by 33 percent. Output of preassembled ferroconcrete, wall materials, linoleum, porous fillers, and decorative ceramic tile dropped by 22-29 percent, asbestos-cement pipes and couplers, high-grade asbestos, and mineral cotton--by 43-62 percent, and of roof slate--by 72 percent. Production of consumer goods in January-February 1994 declined as compared to the analogous period last year by 27 percent, including that of nonfood items--by 31 percent, and foodstuffs--by 17 percent. In light industry there was a decline in output of hosiery and knitwear--by 27 percent, footwear--by 54 percent, woolen fabrics--by 53 percent, silk fabrics by--61 percent, and linen fabrics and sack cloth--by 45 percent. Production of cotton fabrics increased by 22 percent. In January-February of this year, as compared to the same period of last year, there was a considerable decline in production of most garment industry items: coats and short coats--by two-thirds; jackets, raincoats, suits, slacks, and skirts--by almost one-half; and shirts and dresses--by 22-28 percent. Shortage of working capital and difficulties in selling output because of high prices remain the main causes of production decline. In the production of complex home appliances, over the elapsed period of the year there was a decline in the production of: refrigerators and freezers--by 2 percent, washing machines--by 42 percent, tape recorders--by 56 percent, television sets--by 17 percent, and porcelain, stoneware, and majolica tableware--by 22 percent. Compared to the corresponding period of last year, the output of two- and three-chamber refrigerators and freezers increased in January-February of this year. Among the most important food items whose output increased in January-February 1994 as compared to the corresponding period of last year are high-fat cheeses and feta cheese, mayonnaise, and canned tomato products. Production of canned milk products and vegetable oil remained practically at last year's level. With respect to most foodstuffs, the volume of production declined as compared to January-February 1993: meat--by 26 percent, whole-milk products--by 17 percent, butter--by 31 percent, flour--by 17 percent, and cereals--by 34 percent. Considerably less macaroni items, lump sugar, starch, and food concentrates (37-50 percent), confectionery items, and baker's yeast (15-20 percent) was produced than last year. Output of bread and bakery production declined by 13 percent. Production of vodka and other hard liquor amounted to only one-half of that over January-February of 1993; in February it amounted to 44 percent. Since the beginning of the year, production of manufactured feed concentrate dropped by more than one-quarter, and output of protein and vitamin feed additives amounted to only 14 percent of last year's volume. Enterprise and production stoppages. In February of this year 4,300 enterprises in Russia experienced lengthy complete or partial stoppages of production; the loss of work time amounted to 22 million man-days, or 18 percent of scheduled clocked time of these enterprises (in February, 2,400 enterprises experienced shortages; 6 million man-days were lost, or 8.6 percent of scheduled clocked time of these enterprises). At enterprises experiencing shortages, 22 percent of the labor force was sent on additional unpaid or partially paid leave in February at the administration's initiative (8 percent in February 1993). Over the elapsed month, 28 enterprises in the fuel industry were on strike; as a result, 60,000 man-days of work time were lost. The Consumer Market According to preliminary data, in January-February of this year R27 trillion[.sup]*[/] worth of consumer goods and services was sold to the Russian Federation population through all sales channels, which is eight times more than in January-February of last year in current prices, but 3 percent less in comparable prices. In February 1994 their physical volume was 6 percent less than last February. Retail turnover, including public catering, at officially counted enterprises amounted to R12.5 trillion over two months of the current year, which comprises 52 percent of the total turnover (a sevenfold increase in current prices as compared to the corresponding period of last year, and a 5.7 percent decline in comparable prices). Its physical volume in February of this year was 6.2 percent below that of February 1993. The share of the private sector (including consumer cooperatives) accounts for 56 percent of retail turnover (40 percent in January-February 1993), the state sector--35 percent (58 percent), and other nonstate forms of ownership--9 percent (2 percent). The coefficient of the retail trade network's saturation with consumer goods in February of this year remained unchanged as compared to January of this year (86 percent)[.sup]**[/], and increased by 23 percent[.sup]***[/] as compared to February of last year. Officially counted enterprises in January-February of this year sold to the population R6.8 trillion worth of foodstuffs, which is 7.6 times more in current prices than over the same period of last year and a 9.7-percent decrease in comparable prices. In February of this year the physical volume of retail turnover in foodstuffs declined as compared to last year's February by 10.6 percent. In January of this year 9-17 percent less meat and poultry, canned meat, and vegetable oil was sold than last year, and 24-30 percent less canned fish, eggs, and sugar. Slower sales of foodstuffs resulted in higher retail trade inventories. For instance, butter inventories increased from 19 days of trading as of 1 January of this year to 23 days as of 1 March; eggs--from seven to 10; sugar--from 53 to 61; confectionery items--from 21 to 27; and tea--from 58 to 62. The coefficient of retail trade saturation with foodstuffs measured 82 percent in February of this year and increased as compared to February 1993 by 28 percent, including with respect to meat products, butter, vegetable oil, and bread products--by 8-18 percent, sugar--by 21 percent, and milk products--by 35 percent. With the formation of the consumer market and the emergence of new sales channels, part of the population switched to buying foodstuffs at farmers markets. For instance, while the sale of basic foodstuffs at retail trade enterprises declined, sales of meat and milk products, vegetable oil, and potatoes at farmers markets increased by 17-35 percent, and of eggs--2.8-fold. In January-February 1994 the population purchased (at officially counted enterprises) R5.7 trillion worth of nonfood consumer goods (a 6.7-fold increase in current prices and a 1-percent decline in comparable prices). In the environment of shrinking production, already existing elements of market relations are exerting a positive influence on the state of the market. While in the past domestic industry and state procurement were the only sources of goods coming in to the market, now a considerable share of nonfood goods inflow comes through various commercial and middleman structures, trade enterprises' independent purchases, and other channels. This contributes to consumer market saturation, and creates favorable conditions for alternative choices in purchases and meeting the demand of different groups of buyers. Evidence of the process of market saturation with nonfood items is increased trade inventories of these goods. For instance, trade inventories of woolen fabrics increased from 40 days of trade as of 1 February of last year to 64 days as of 1 February of this year; silk fabrics--from 38 to 53 days; clothing and underwear--from 55 to 81 days; knitwear--from 47 to 80 days; footwear--from 47 to 71 days; and radio receivers--from 25 to 51 days. In January-February of this year R2.6 trillion worth of for-fee services were rendered to the population through all channels of realization--an 11-fold increase in current prices and a 42-percent decline in comparable prices (in February of this year as compared to February 1993--42.3 percent). Over two months the volume of for-fee services provided by officially counted enterprises amounted to R1.6 trillion (61 percent of the total volume), which is 10 times more than last year in current prices and 48.5 percent less in comparable prices. Foreign Economic Relations With Far Abroad Countries In January-February 1994, Russia's foreign trade turnover (without CIS countries) amounted to $8.1 billion and declined as compared to January-February 1993 in current prices by 7.2 percent. Russia's exports amounted to $5.5 billion and increased by 1.2 percent; imports amounted to $2.6 billion and declined by 21 percent. In January-February of this year Russia had a $2.9-billion positive foreign trade balance ($2.1 billion positive trade balance in January-February 1993). Monetary Income of the Population The monetary income earned by the population in January-February this year amounted to R32.4 trillion and increased as compared to the corresponding period of 1993 by 9.2-fold. In February this year the volume of monetary income of the population amounted to R18.3 trillion, which is 1.3 times more than in January of this year. This increase is mainly due to the difference in wages raised on 1 December 1993 and 1 January 1994 for certain categories of the budget-financed sphere and administrative organs and paid out during this month, as well as an increase in the amount of compensation added to pensions. As a result, there was considerable monetary emission in February of this year--R1.6 trillion, while in January of this year R313.5 billion was taken out of circulation. In the structure of expenditure of income, purchases of foreign currency and securities account for an increasingly greater share, with a simultaneous decline in the population's expenditures on goods and services. February 1993 January 1994 February 1994 as % of the as % of the total total trillion as % of rubles the total Monetary income 100.0 100.0 18.3 100.0 Monetary expenditures: purchases of goods 73.7 72.9 12.4 67.8 and services compulsory 8.9 8.4 1.6 8.7 payments and contributions increase of 5.2 6.4 1.2 6.9 savings in deposits and securities including: in securities 0.04 0.1 0.03 0.02 purchases of 1.6 13.1 1.9 10.3 foreign currency Increase (+), 10.6 -0.8 1.2 6.3 decrease (-) of cash in the hands of the population With respect to saving money in the bank, the population increasingly prefers commercial banks, which offer higher interest rates on deposits as compared to the State Savings Bank. For instance, in February this year the population deposited in commercial banks about R800 billion, and in the State Savings Bank--R444.7 billion; in February 1993--R15.5 and R89.3 billion, respectively. In February this year as compared to the corresponding month in 1993, the population's disposable income (income less compulsory payments and contributions) increased 9.1-fold, while prices for goods and services increased approximately eightfold. The real disposable income of the population over this month was 13 percent higher than a year ago (in January--7 percent). City and Local Transportation Services for the Population The current difficulties and problems in the public transportation operations, which stem first and foremost from great wear and tear on the rolling stock, and the haphazard system of subsidies to public transportation enterprises are resulting in declining quality in passenger service, especially in cities; in particular, this is manifest in cutbacks in planned and actually performed route runs. For instance, in Pskov 14 percent fewer runs were planned for February this year than February last year, and in reality 16 percent fewer were performed; Makhachkala--22 percent and 12 percent, respectively; Ivanovo--7 percent and 5 percent; Orenburg and Chelyabinsk--4 percent and 8 percent; Krasnoyarsk--7 percent and 19 percent; Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk--5 percent and 14 percent; and Blagoveshchensk both with respect to the plan and in reality--10 percent. During February of this year 1.7 million (11 percent) of planned trips by city ground passenger transportation were not made in republic capital cities and kray and oblast centers in the Russian Federation, and in some of them--between 14 percent and 33 percent. The figures for individual cities are presented below: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Scheduled trips not made by urban transportation | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |thousands |() Tr;1;3> Cities where 3| | | |02000070040r more of scheduled | | | |trips were not made | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Astrakhan |27.1 |33 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy|20.5 |31 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cities where 20to 282000070040f scheduled trips were not made | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk |7.0 |28 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vladikavkaz |27.6 |26 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Smolensk |19.4 |22 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Krasnoyarsk |62.1 |21 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moscow |614.6 |20 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Makhachkala |9.2 |20 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Orenburg |41.2 |20 Tr;1;3> Cities where 14| | | |to 172000070040f scheduled tr-| | | |ips were not made | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tula |44.4 |17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kaluga |23.5 |17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tver |19.5 |17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Elista |5.8 |17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cheboksary |25.1 |16 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lipetsk |35.1 |14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ivanovo |26.1 |14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kursk |25.4 |14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Khabarovsk |15.6 |14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The most unsatisfactory suburban bus services in February this year were registered in the following cities: Makhachkala (32 percent, or 700, scheduled runs not performed); Orenburg (24 percent, 3,800); Rostov (28 percent, 4,500); Novosibirsk (19 percent, 2,900); Volgograd (16 percent, 2,900); Astrakhan (15 percent, 700); Ulan-Ude (14 percent, 800), Kaliningrad (14 percent, 3,000); Maykop (14 percent, 2,100). During February of this year 28 runs on local commuter electric trains (5 percent of the number scheduled) were canceled in Kursk; in Volgograd--161 runs (5 percent); and in St. Petersburg--215 runs (2 percent). Deliveries to Regions of the Far North As of 1 March of this year half as much cargo had been shipped to regions of the Far North and equivalent areas as was shipped by the same date last year. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |January-February 1994 |As a 2000070040f January-Februa-| | | |ry 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total cargo shipped, tho-|437.0 |45 | |usand tonnes | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |dry cargo |300.2 |52 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |liquid cargo |136.8 |35 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As compared to last year, the greatest decline occurred in cargo deliveries by sea to the following ports: Dudinka (73 percent), Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy (72 percent), Magadan (59 percent), to the ports of Sakhalin (31 percent). Less liquid cargo than of the same date last year was delivered to the following ports: Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy (70 percent), Magadan (58 percent), and the ports of Sakhalin (66 percent).
