He insists that he is not a politician but a businessman, insists on his being allowed to work, and insists that "I never grant interviews," because the economy or the war "are very important matters to be summarized and then interpreted well." He has governed under the pressure from the lobby of the Croats of Herzegovina, and, despite his successes, he wants everything to be over soon so that he can return to the world of business. [Villapadierna] Does the communist system still weigh heavily, with the streets full of people at 1100? [Valentic] People are not only on the streets instead of working; we also have the highest percentage of pensioners in Europe. The change with respect to communism is that we make sure of our resources before spending them; previously, they used to spend and then look for somebody to pay. In situations of severe inflation of around 10,000 percent per year, everybody can be businessmen, but the burden falls on the people who are increasingly poor. It is always easier to make the currency rise artificially on the black market and thereby meet your losses than dismiss 20 percent of the workers, buy new technology, and be competitive. This process will take around 10 years; bear in mind that Germany has been investing in its eastern part for four years, and they have not resolved more than 20 percent [sentence as published]. [Villapadierna] How much are you spending on arms and on receiving refugees? [Valentic] We have 600,000 refugees -- that is, 15 percent of our population -- in the free part of Croatia, since the other 25 percent remains occupied; even this part has also been largely ruined. Tourism, which was our economic mainstay (between 3 billion and 4 billion [currency unspecified]), has also been destroyed, as has the energy system. We have had to raise 6 billion German marks [DM] in foreign debt, because Belgrade took all the Yugoslav reserves. I will not conceal the expenditure from you, although it is before parliament. Out of a budget of DM5.2 billion, around 35 percent is for defense, which is not excessive for being at war, and 20 percent is taken up by caring for the hundreds of thousands of refugees. Just imagine: If these resources were earmarked for restructuring the economy, Croatia would be reborn in two years. [Villapadierna] When can the former Yugoslavia's property held by Belgrade be shared out? [Valentic] Some far-off day; Yugoslavia will not join the normal economic systems, and Serbia, for its part, will do all that it can to delay settlements. Slovenia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina are involved, and some day Serbia will have to give in. We know very well each republic's share of the social product; Croatia's was 27 percent. The problem is that the Serbs will spend everything; they are spending even the part which is frozen. [Villapadierna] With the Bosnian federation, have you not handed the plan's destruction to Karadzic on a platter? It is sufficient for the Serbs to say that they accept, only for the Croats then to withdraw, and it will all be over. [Valentic] You are right to say that the Serbs have the decisive say. A federation with them or without them will not be the same thing. To be honest, the problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the most complex and crucial of the present-day world, but, indisputably, there is always a solution in politics; normally, it is the least bad. [Villapadierna] Will Bosnia be divided? [Valentic] This war is drawing to a close. At last, four forces -- the United States, Russia, the Islamic world, and the European Union -- are coming together for this to end. To be specific, there are two options: One is for the Serbs to agree to join the Bosnian federation; the other is for them to say "no," and in that event the Muslims and Croats would federate in order then to confederate with Croatia. There are many nuances, but there is only one thing clear: We will effect no kind of integration reminiscent of the former Yugoslavia, nor does any of the powers believe so now. [Villapadierna] When will Croatia join the Council of Europe? [Valentic] There are some terms which Croatia has had to fulfill: I believe that we have done so and that some criticisms are unfair; a country which is emerging from communism and at the same time is at war cannot resolve everything in two years. Despite the war, I believe that we have made considerable progress in the freedom of the press, as in other areas of the law; we have all the attributes for joining the Council of Europe. [Villapadierna] Your monetary policy has ended the depreciation and inflation, but everybody believes that it is an artificial situation. [Valentic] Monetary policy is conducted by the Bank of Croatia, although this forms part of a whole economic strategy. Over the past few months we have had a zero inflation rate. There is a coherent combination of wages, financial policy, and the restructuring of the entire communist economy. We have eliminated the price disparities inherited from communism and introduced the tax system which is standard in the West; this has increased the state budget by around 50 percent, and the latter has seen its deficit fall by DM1 billion. We have launched the restructuring of the economy, privatization has been accelerated, small stockholders have begun to receive their dividends, taxes have been cut, the average wage has risen from DM100-200 to around DM400 at present... When I opted for free convertibility, everybody deemed me a madman, but I knew the makeup of our exports and opted for opening up.
