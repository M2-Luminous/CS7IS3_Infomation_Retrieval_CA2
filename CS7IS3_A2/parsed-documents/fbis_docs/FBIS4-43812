[Schulte] We know from experience that a beginning economic growth does not immediately create more jobs. In my view we will not return to the classic form of full employment in the near future. At the same time, we know that almost every community, every city is putting off a number of projects because they simply do not have the funds. These investments must be made now. We call on the political and business community to shift the money that is spent on unemployment and the resulting problems to a temporary employment policy with state orders. One must also think twice about spending billions of German marks in Hermes export guarantees instead of providing more money for badly needed public orders. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] What are the tasks that you have in mind? [Schulte] Nursing sick people, kindergartens. We are speaking of the traffic collapse or of traffic chaos. Everybody wants to modernize the infrastructure and further extend the networks, but we are not making any progress. In the cities and communities the water supply and sewage systems must be renewed. The money is there. It only has to be shifted to the right place. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] What comes to your mind when you hear the slogan of limits to growth? [Schulte] I think that we will have to change our way of thinking. Industrial production will no longer grow in the FRG. Industrial developments will reach their limits. Employment will, thus, necessarily have to shift toward the sector of public services. I am not only referring to services people can claim and cannot do without, but also services in other areas near the economy. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] What is the trade unions' contribution to reducing mass unemployment? [Schulte] The wage agreements intended to secure jobs are a contribution that must not be underestimated. The effects of shorter working hours had been disputed for a long time. So it is a success that such models have, at least temporarily, stopped the increase in unemployment. Moreover we demand that those shoulders that can carry more must do so. The funds must then be used specifically, for example for investment programs in eastern Germany. If we manage to reduce by half the number of unemployed by the year 2000, which is a challenge for all of Europe, then this is a great objective. At the same time, we must answer the question how we will deal until then with the people who have no jobs and no chances ever to get one again. We must build job bridges... [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] ....to the second labor market? [Schulte] I am not speaking of the second labor market. The question of a second labor market, that is to say one of inferior value, is not what comes to my mind first. After all, this leads to an inner detachment from one's employment and also from the trade unions. This is why I reject this term. We will have to find promising forms of employment that stand on a solid financial basis. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Can you imagine a strategy of shorter working hours and redistribution of work that goes beyond the Volkswagen scheme? [Schulte] No. I think that the schemes of shorter working hours in this classic form, for example the shorter working week at Volkswagen, have, at least for the time being, reached their limit. However, one will have to try out other schemes, also part-time work. Most companies have not given a moment's thought to how they could sensibly introduce part-time work. Yet, even part-time work will only solve one part of the problem. Employees will not accept it if they are forced to, but only when it fits the personal plans for their lives. Moreover, one has to find regulations to prevent people from suffering disadvantages later in life. Still, it might lead to more possibilities for flexibility. [FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU] Your vision of work mainly refers to gainful employment. Yet there is a lot of work necessary in society that has to be done privately or without pay. Would it not be interesting to link these two spheres and rethink the structures of our society? [Schulte] There is enough work. Whether it can be paid depends on the readiness to provide money for it. Some 15-20 years ago, we set ourselves the objective to use some time of one's working life for education. Today this issue is no longer on the agenda, because people do not even use the available possibilities. If we really want to focus on work again then we must pay more attention again to such points.
