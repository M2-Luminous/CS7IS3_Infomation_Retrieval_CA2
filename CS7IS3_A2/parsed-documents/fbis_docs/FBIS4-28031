This was made possible by a P1.3 billion increase in revenue collections and a savings of P11.7 billion from actual expenses during the period. Statistics from the Bureau of Treasury showed that as of 30 April 1994, actual collections reached P113.8 billion or P1.3 billion more than the P112.5 billion in programmed revenues for the first quarter. Collections by the Bureau of Customs were P1.8 billion higher than the P25.2 billion it expected to generate. Other revenue agencies also increased their take by P1.8 billion to P13.5 billion from the programmed P11.7 billion. But the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) failed to realize its target revenues of P68.2 billion for the first quarter of the year, generating only P66.5 billion, or a P1.7 billion shortfall. The Bureau of Treasury also fell last 16 May following the approval of the expanded VAT [value-added tax]. The national government deficit according to the new budget proposal will be P16.4 billion, compared to the P49.2 billion estimate made last December. Under the new program, the national government is even expected to have a P15.5 billion surplus but would have to resort to borrowings to absorb the P31.9 billion liabilities of the old Central Bank. The December estimates had the national government in the red by P22.7 billion to finance operations and would have to raise P26.5 billion more for the rehabilitation of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the Philippines] (BSP). The government deficit is expected to reach P30.6 billion by year's end, with P4.7 billion from daily operations and P25.9 billion to save the BSP. Three adjustments in the fiscal program were made in reducing the proposed budget. -- Reduction of the debt amortization estimates to consider the rollover of P36.3 billion in FRTNs [floating rate treasury notes] and Treasury bills which were previously assumed to be redeemed in 1995. -- Scaling down of the budgetary support to government corporations in consonance with the policy of reducing assistance of GOCCs [government owned or controlled corporations] by 10 percent in 1995. -- Absorption into the Internal Revenue Allotment of the provisions for the Magna Carta of Public Health Workers devolved to local government units. The biggest cut was for debt appropriation, followed by the special purpose funds, subsidy to government corporations, funds for flagship projects, department/agencies budget and support for local government units. In the December estimate, the government was to appropriate P155.1 billion for debt servicing but this was reduced to P109.4 billion. This year's budget for servicing is P117.8 billion. The compensation adjustment fund, initially earmarked at P25 billion so government could dramatically increase wages of civil servants, was slashed by P3 billion in the new proposal. Despite the cut, appropriations for salary increases were still at least 300 percent higher than the P9.3 billion allotted for 1994. Enriquez said only five departments -- Science and Technology, Tourism, Energy, Budget and Management, and HUDCC (Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council) -- submitted budget proposals within the ceilings approved by the president and the Cabinet. Of the total budget proposals, P30.6 billion were in excess of the prescribed ceiling. Preliminary results of the technical budget hearings showed that the education department would still be given the biggest slice of the budget with an appropriation of P41.7 billion, P5.1 billion less than the agency's proposal of P46.8 billion. Public works and highways was allotted P23.7 billion (P5.8 billion less; national defense P23.1 billion (P2.4 billion less); and, interior and local governments P14.7 billion (P1.8 billion less). Enriquez told the president that proposals in excess of ceilings which were already approved by the Cabinet had made the preparation of the budget more difficult. "Unless the departments voluntarily reduce their proposals, DBM [Department of Budget and Management], in consultation with the president, will have to assert its authority to maintain the approved budget program," he said. "Agencies who submitted proposals grossly in excess of the ceilings cannot expect favorable action on their requests," he added.
