Its successful establishment has filled another blank in China's high- technology field. It has been learned that during its trial operation, the station connected for various mobile consumers nearly 200,000 domestic phone (including fax) calls and telexes, and nearly 100,000 international calls. The maritime signal satellite ground station is a link between the satellite and the ground via telecommunications systems. The Beijing Maritime Signal Satellite Ground Station can provide telecommunications links between mobile telecommunications systems users in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and users of stationary equipment on land, and supply reliable and mobile satellite telecommunications services to users at sea and on land. The construction project of the maritime signal satellite ground station was completed in two phases. The first phase's station type-A can provide telecommunications links between mobile telecommunications systems users at sea and on land whereby they can exchange phone calls, telexes, facsimiles, and data. At present, most of China's oceangoing vessels have been equiped with terminal facilities. Once certain buttons are pressed during a shipwreck, distress signals will be transmitted directly via the Beijing Maritime Signal Satellite Ground Station to China's maritime search and rescue centers. Such a connection has provided a safe and reliable guarantee for vessels in distress. Mobile terminal systems on land can provide mobile users with convenient services for remote border areas, news coverage, and geological exploration. The second phase's station type-C, smaller in size than station type-A, can provide global telecommunications services relaying messages and data, including weather reports and stock quotations. It also has stronger signals. It is favorably termed as a "mobile office." The Beijing Maritime Signal Satellite Ground Station was built by the Ministry of Communications with loans from the Norwegian Government. According to Wang Jialin [3769 1367 7792], deputy director of the Beijing Maritime Signal Satellite Ground Station, the station has plans to develop future digital systems types-B and M.
