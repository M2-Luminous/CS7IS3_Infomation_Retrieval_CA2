Shcherbakov: "The Debt is Being Repaid, But Clearly in Devalued Form; 2.3 Trillion Rubles Allocated to the Agricultural Sector by the Government -- A Late Payment For Products Delivered Last Year"] [Text] Last week on 3 February at a closed session the Government of the Russian Federation examined the draft resolution, "Economic Conditions for the Operation of the Agroindustrial Complex in 1994," at a closed session. According to this draft, it is planned to allocate 14 trillion rubles from the budget to support agriculture. The resolution as a whole was approved, but under the condition that finishing touches be put on it and that certain figures and details be made more precise. Judging by everything, the figures, which are nothing but financial resources being directed into the APK [Agroindustrial complex], will be correction in the direction of a decrease. This decision reminded me of a recent reaction by some mass media to a regional meeting in Orel, where a program for the development of the regions in Central Russia was being discussed. At that time, specific steps taken by the government to effect the economic, social and spiritual rebirth of the age-old Russian central regions were termed "political demonstrations," "attempts to win authority by means of handing out financial benefits to territories and the agricultural sector" by some newspapers. At that time, A. Zaveryukha, deputy prime minister of the RF Government, held a press conference for Russian and foreign journalists. He was forced to clarify, patiently and on a popular level, the absurdities of the newspapers' disinformation, as for example that concerning 2.3 trillion rubles that were soon to be directed into the agrarian sector. What money is this? However, government and non-government consumers do owe a debt for products, including grain, acquired from village goods producers. Moreover, this debt was incurred in August to September, and it can be termed preferential with complete justification. Add to it how much the ruble has been devalued during the last 4-5 months. Is the suggestion being made that we should not repay our debt to the peasant because we must stabilize the budget? A similar situation is developing with regard to the delay in signing the government document that is important for the entire agricultural sector. Sowing operations are right around the corner. How will kolkhozes, sovkhozes, farmers, joint-stock societies, partnerships and cooperatives implement sowing operations if all they have in their accounts is the debts owed to them by the government and not a single penny cash? As we know, oil producers, machine builders and chemical workers do not sell their products for credit. Moreover, they demand a 100 percent prepayment. We have untuned machinery standing idle in enterprises, and mineral fertilizer storehouses remain empty although the enterprises that sell these products stop production due to overstocking. According to data from the agrochemical service, in many regions of the country enterprises have acquired only 2-3 kilograms of mineral fertilizer of the amount needed per hectare of plowland. This situation is threatening not only in terms of a considerable underproduction from fields and farms this year, but also, and this is especially important, in terms of a catastrophic fall in land fertility. As we know, fertility cannot be restored in just 1-2 years. And the expenditures that will be required will not be comparable to today's so-called preferential credit. An especially alarming situation has developed in supplying enterprises, regardless of form of ownership, with fuel and lubricating materials and seed. This spring there will be a significantly larger demand for these than last year. Last fall because of the complicated weather conditions and again because of the absence of money it was not possible to plow up late fall fields or sow winter crops on many millions of hectares. Judging by everything, in government not everyone is concerned with current conditions within the country's agroindustrial complex, especially since the course that has been set involves self-sufficiency in food products. Here we cannot do simply with declarations and assurances about devotion to reforms. Specific actions are needed, particularly in protecting domestic production.
