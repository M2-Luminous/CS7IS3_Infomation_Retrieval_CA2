Moreover, it remains yet to be seen whether these sentences can repair the tattered image of President Alberto Fujimori whose loss of popularity is reflected in the poll conducted by Apoyo, Inc. published in this same issue. As we said last Sunday, as long as this loss of popularity does not increase that of other politicians, in theory, it can be recovered. But it is also a fact that the ups and downs of popularity can also result in waves of increases and losses that will become uncontrollable. This was the case of the growing popularity gained by Fujimori's candidacy that, toward the end of the 1990 electoral campaign, at a given point became devastating. The same happened with Alan Garcia when he tried to place the banking sector under state control and his popularity dropped month after month, after having reached the highest level of popularity ever reached by a Peruvian leader. It is true that in both cases there was a political polarization that does not exist nowadays. In both cases, Mario Vargas Llosa's strong personality played a key role in this political polarization. Vargas Llosa was responsible for Garcia's loss of popularity. Vargas Llosa himself also witnessed how an unknown candidate deprived him of an electoral victory of which he was certain. Now Fujimori does not have a rival who could capture the support he is losing as is revealed by the very poll that shows his loss of popularity. Not even the promoted and respected image of [Javier] Perez de Cuellar attracts a significant portion of the support the chief of state is losing. Undoubtedly, some believe that Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont would be the person -- from every viewpoint -- to gain from an eventual polarization with Fujimori. So far, however, this polarization has not materialized. Maybe because Belmot is still not regarded as a firm presidential candidate for the elections which are only one year ahead of us. If Belmont were to officially launch his candidacy, the race with Fujimori to gain the peoples' support would be well worth witnessing.
