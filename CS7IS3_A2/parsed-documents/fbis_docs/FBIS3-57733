It circulated a statement which said that the Ukrainian Defence Ministry and the Ukrainian Navy had been put before the accomplished fact. No one had informed them in advance about the planned exercise. The statement pointed out as well that prior to the official announcement of the beginning of the exercise coastal guard units of the Black Sea Fleet had been put on a high combat alert and an exercise had been held on loading the hardware on landing boats. Such actions on the eve of presidential elections in the Crimea may heighten tension in the region and create conditions for all kinds of provocations which, of course, is impermissible. Since during the transitional period the Black Sea Fleet belongs simultaneously to the two countries, Ukraine and Russia, the mutual informing of the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy of the exercises, training, as well as the movement of personnel and armaments connected with them, is in line with the fraternal atmosphere, good neighbourly relations and the consolidation of trust and mutual understanding, the statement said.
