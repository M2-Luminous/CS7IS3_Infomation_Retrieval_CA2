The U.S. paper WORKERS' WORLD April 7 said South Korea has been packed with various types of U.S. weapons since the U.S. occupied it. If the Korean peninsula is a powder keg today, it is because the U.S. has deployed its troops and nuclear weapons in South Korea and constantly reinforced them for the purpose of threat to North Korea, the paper added. The Nepalese paper NEPAL POST April 8 said the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused by the United States and the situation is being aggravated by it. The nuclear activities of the DPRK are for the development of the independent economy and science and technology of the country, the paper said, and added: So there is no ground to argue about them. It is an illegal act and an interference in Korea's internal affairs for the United Nations to discuss a "resolution" or "sanctions" against the DPRK over the faked "nuclear issue." The Swedish paper PROLETAREN April 7 charged that it is a concrete act of aggression and a wanton violation of the Korean armistice agreement for the United States to describe North Korea's peaceful research into nuclear energy as a "threat" and reinforce the military strength in South Korea. The U.N. Security Council must immediately deal with this crime of the United States, the paper demanded. The Irish paper EDITORIAL April 2 said it is foolish of the United States to try to force Korea to "surrender" by imposing "sanctions" on it. The paper urged the United States to immediately stop the illegal and unfair acts of wantonly violating the sovereignty of another country.
