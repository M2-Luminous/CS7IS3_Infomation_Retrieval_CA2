FR940819-2-00105 FR940819-2-00066 Microsoft Prohibited From Limiting OEM Sales of Competing Operating System Products: Section IV (B) bars Microsoft from entering into license agreements that prohibit or restrict an OEM from licensing, selling, or distributing competing operating system products. In addition, Section IV (E) prohibits Microsoft from expressly or impliedly conditioning its licenses of operating systems on the licensing, purchase, use or distribution not only of other covered products, but also any other Microsoft product, or non-Microsoft product. Without these provisions Microsoft could force OEMs to purchase covered products and thus accomplish anticompetitive effects similar to those achieved through its unlawful licensing practices, or attempt to extend or protect its monopoly in any covered product by conditioning its licensing, purchase or use of other products. Microsoft Limited to Per Copy and Per System Licenses: Sections IV (D) and IV (G) require Microsoft to use either ``per copy'' or ``per system'' licenses. Per copy licenses, if used in conjunction with pro-competitive volume discounts, pose few competitive concerns. Per system licenses, if not carefully fenced in, could be used by Microsoft to accomplish anticompetitive ends similar to ``per processor'' licenses. However, if an OEM easily can designate models not subject to a per system license, it can use non-Microsoft operating systems on those models without incurring a royalty obligation to Microsoft. If an OEM need not pay a royalty to Microsoft for anything but the number of copies of the Microsoft operating system that it actually uses, that OEM will not be deterred from licensing, purchasing or using competing operating system products. Restriction on Per System Licenses: The Final Judgment also places restrictions on the use of per system licenses to ensure that they are not used in an exclusionary manner. In particular, Section IV (G) specifies that per system licenses must allow the licensee to create ``new systems'' that can be sold without incurring a royalty obligation to Microsoft if they do not utilize a Microsoft product. Under Section IV (G), an OEM need only designate a new model name or number to create a ``new system.'' Microsoft may not require the OEM even to notify Microsoft of the creation of a new system; nor may Microsoft impose requirements relating to the marketing or advertising of a new system, or penalize an OEM for creating a new system. Section IV (G)(4) requires Microsoft to notify within 30 days following entry of this Final Judgment all existing OEM licensees under per system licenses and all OEM licensees with per processor licenses who choose to let them to be converted to per system licenses (a provision discussed below) of their rights to create new systems that will not be subject to any existing per system license. This notice provision ensures that existing licensees promptly know of their rights to avoid royalty payments under per system contracts if they choose to create new systems. Microsoft Prohibited From Using Lump Sum Pricing: Section IV (H) also serves a prophylactic function, prohibiting the use of lump sum pricing in license agreements for covered products. As defined in Section II (F), lump sum pricing is any royalty payment that does not vary with the number of copies of the covered product (under per copy licenses) or the number of personal computer systems (under per system licenses) that are licensed, sold, or distributed by the OEM. This restriction, like the prohibitions on minimum commitments and requirements contracts, restricts conduct that could be used by Microsoft to achieve effects comparable to the effects of the conduct challenged by the government, and for that reason is enjoined. 6 6 If a license agreement established a minimum commitment greater than the OEM's requirements for operating systems (an agreement that would be prohibited under this decree), the minimum commitment would constitute, in effect, a lump sum payment. Regardless of the number of copies distributed by the OEM, its royalty payment to Microsoft would not vary. A lump sum pricing arrangement imposed by a monopolist that allowed unlimited use of the licensed product for a single fee calibrated to the anticipated total operating system needs of a particular OEM would also produce a similar economic effect as a requirements contract or a per processor license: the OEM would owe the same royalty to Microsoft whether it chose to use a Microsoft operating system on all of the PCs it sold, or only on some of the PCs it sold, and would, in effect, ``pay twice'' if it chose to purchase a non-Microsoft operating system for some of its PCs. Neither Section IV (H) nor any other provision of the proposed Final Judgment prohibits the use of royalty rates, including rates embodying volume discounts, agreed upon in advance with respect to each individual OEM, each specific version or language of a covered products, and each designated personal computer system model. Nothing in the Final Judgment, however, in any way sanctions Microsoft structuring any volume discount whose purpose or effect is to impose de facto requirements contracts or exclusive arrangements on the OEM. As discussed below in connection with alternatives to the proposed Final Judgment, given Microsoft's monopoly power in operating systems, such practices can violate the antitrust laws. Transition Rules In the Stipulation consenting to the entry of the proposed Final Judgment, Microsoft agreed to abide by the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment immediately upon the filing of the Complaint, i.e. , as of July 15, 1994. Among other things, the transition provisions described herein will require Microsoft to abide by the foregoing limitations and prohibitions when entering into any license agreements with OEMs after July 15, 1994. Certain additional provisions of the proposed Final Judgment also apply to existing license agreements that are inconsistent with the proposed Final Judgment's requirements for new license agreements. Under Section IV (I), existing OEM licensees may terminate or negotiate with Microsoft to amend their agreements to make them consistent with the requirements of the Final Judgment. Section IV (J) provides that if an OEM chooses not to exercise either of these options, Microsoft must abide by the following rules. First, under Section IV (J)(1), a per processor license must be treated as a ``per system'' license' OEM models that contain the microprocessor(s) specified in such a per processor license will be considered to be covered by the ``per system'' license unless the OEM opts in writing to exclude such model from coverage. As already noted, OEMs may freely sell PCs with non-Microsoft operating systems, and avoid any obligation to pay royalties to Microsoft under a per system license, simply by designating such PCs as a new system with a separate model number or name. Second, under Section IV (J)(2), Microsoft may not enforce any minimum commitment in an existing license agreement.
