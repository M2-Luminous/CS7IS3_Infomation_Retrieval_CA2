The sources said that Tajik opposition forces based in the Afghan provinces of Kunduz and Takhar are planning a series of attacks on Russian border outposts and Tajik border villages. There is also information indicating their intention to mine one of the sections of the Tajik-Afghan border patrolled by the Pyanj border troop unit. Mobile terrorist groups have been concentrated near the Imam Sahib Province, and weapons and military machinery are being brought in. The sources claimed they had proof that the go-ahead to proceed with acts of terrorism was given by the government in exile led by Tajik national Sa'id Abdullo Nuri. The acts will be carried out by field commanders from the so-called Kumsangir-Pyanj resistance front. The sources said all these activities are taking place in the districts controlled by the Afghan military whose leaders have repeatedly confirmed their readiness to help stabilise the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and prevent provocations.
