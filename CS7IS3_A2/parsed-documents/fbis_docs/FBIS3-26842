These procedures are drawn up in accordance with the "Provisions of the State Council on the Work Hours of Workers and Staff Members." Article 2. These procedures shall apply to workers and staff members in all organs, mass organizations, enterprises, and institutions (including enterprises under various single-mode or forms of mixed economic ownership such as state-owned, collectively owned, privately run, individually run, foreign-funded, and Chinese-foreign joint-funded enterprises, as well as mines, factories; construction, communications and transportation, logging, farming, and commercial organizations; service entities; scientific research and design, and cultural and sports organizations; and medical and public health services, institutes of higher learning, middle and elementary schools, and kindergartens) on the PRC's territory. Article 3. While ensuring the completion of their production tasks and work without increasing personnel and spending, a system of work hours consisting of eight hours each day for a weekly average of 44 work hours shall be implemented among workers and staff members. Article 4. All units shall implement the provisions step by step with plans and strengthen their management. They shall not let the implementation of the 44-hour work week affect their economic performance, nor shall they reduce the salaries of their workers and staff members. Article 5. The work hours of workers and staff members working under extraordinary conditions or those whose circumstances are special may be further shortened appropriately in accordance with relevant provisions of the State Council or its principal labor and personnel departments. To shorten the work hours of workers and staff members of enterprises and institutions directly under the central authorities, principal departments shall verify the need to do so and shall submit reports to the State Council's labor and personnel ministries for approval. For workers and staff members of local enterprises and institutions, local principal departments shall verify the need and shall submit reports to local labor and personnel departments for approval to shorten the work hours. Article 6. When it is found unsuitable to adopt a fixed work-hour system for workers and staff members because of restrictions in the nature of work and duties, an irregular work-hour system may be implemented with the approval of the relevant State Council labor and personnel departments. Article 7. No units shall extend the work hours of workers and staff members under normal situations aside from the following: (1) Work in production, transportation, or operations that must be continued during statutory festivals and public holidays; (2) Instances of equipment repair and maintenance that must be carried out during statutory festivals and public holidays when production is stopped; (3) Emergency repairs that must be carried out because of sudden breakdowns in production equipment, communications and transportation facilities, and public utilities; (4) Emergency relief work that must be carried out because of severe natural or other disasters that seriously threaten the people's safety and health as well as state property; (5) Emergency production tasks for the national defense or other emergency production tasks allocated by superiors that must be completed along with state programs, as well as emergency tasks of commercial and marketing enterprises in purchasing, transportation, and agricultural and sideline products processing to be undertaken during peak seasons. Article 8. The powers for verifying and approving the extended work hours of workers and staff members under the aforementioned situations shall be studied and determined by provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal people's governments as well as by various State Council principal departments. Article 9. Enterprise units shall implement the 44-hour average work-week system. They may exchange the two half-day rest days of two fortnights for a rest day according to the specific situation. Article 10. State organs, enterprise units, and mass organizations shall from the effective date of the provisions on 1 March 1994 uniformly designate the Saturday and Sunday of the first week and the Sunday of the second week as rest days nationwide. The cycle shall continue and shall not be restricted by months and years. Personnel may be placed on duty on rest days according to the needs of their work. Article 11. Individual professions and enterprises that truly have difficulty in implementing the 44-hour work-week system from 1 March 1994 may appropriately defer doing so, but not later than 1 May 1994. Article 12. Labor and personnel departments at all levels shall supervise the implementation of the provisions. They shall accordingly penalize units and individuals who violate the provisions by forcing workers and staff members to work extended hours. Article 13. Based on these procedures, provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal people's governments may draw up rules of implementation. Article 14. The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Personnel shall be responsible for interpreting these provisions within the scope of their respective duties. Article 15. These procedures shall take effect on 1 March 1994.
