The weekly TRABAJADORES in today's edition makes a special appeal to the workers of the country, urging them to strive for economic efficiency in meetings which, according to the newspaper "must not be formal gatherings but genuine collective gatherings." We appeal to the workers, especially to the worker class, to come with their sleeves rolled up, to search for measures which today, in the harsh conditions of the special period, will determine in each work center the need to improve order, discipline, attention to the worker, more efficient use of scarce resources, and increased production and quality, the paper states. Considering it the most important task of the Cuban worker movement, the editorial urges the leaders of the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) and its members to commit themselves to the success of the process which -- it insists -- must serve to take action on essential aspects of our economy and society.
