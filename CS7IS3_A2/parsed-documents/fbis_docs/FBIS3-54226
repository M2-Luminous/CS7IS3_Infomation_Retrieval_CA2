This crisis has affected the relationship between Fadlallah and Lebanese Hizballah, which is supported by Iran. The wing opposed to Fadlallah has succeeded in causing organized "confusion" among its followers and supporters, both in the southern suburb and Beirut. It seems that they have for some time time been preparing a "bill of indictment" against Fadlallah, pending Tehran's "verdict." The indictment includes the following: -- His public assertion of the weakness of the historic Shiite story about the misdeed of Fatimah al-Zahra', daughter of the prophet (peace be upon him) and wife of 'Ali Bin-Abu-Talib, to Caliph 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab. -- His opposition to the possible takeover of the supreme authority position by 'Ali Khamene'i, guide of the Islamic revolution, when the current authority Mohammad 'Ali Araki dies. It is said that a video was sent to Tehran, showing Fadlallah attacking Khamene'i. The first accusation is considered a violation of the common Shiite belief, and the second has been exploited for political ends in order to place the accused in a direct confrontation with Khamene'i. [passage omitted] The other aspect of this dispute is reflected in the context of talk of the need for the "Shiite scene" in Lebanon to remain separate from the religious leadership in Tehran. Maybe what Ja'farite Mufti in Lebanon Shaykh 'Abd-al-Amir Qabalan said on 10 December 1993, namely that "the Islamic republic [of Iran] is responsible for safeguarding the authority's affairs," is part of the bid to tighten the noose around Fadlallah's movements in Lebanon. Fadlallah rejects this dark and tense picture of his relationship with Tehran. He attributes everything said about his differences with it to "people trying to fish in muddy water." He says that anyone who tries to raise such issues is trying to "foment sedition." He does not rule out that the "intelligence service" could be behind this. Actually both Fadlallah and the Iranian leadership are trying to reunite the scene. Fadlallah may admit the existence of an overt battle that is not in his favor with Iran. While others believe that Tehran cannot abandon its relationship with Fadlallah, who has a "distinctive" position at both the Islamic and Shiite levels. [passage omitted]
