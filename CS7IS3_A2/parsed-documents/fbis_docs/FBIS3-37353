As we know, it points out, elections to neighboring Moldova's parliament are taking place 27 February in which the DMR is not participating. The DMR's nonparticipation essentially signals the Dniester Region's de jure separation from the Republic of Moldova. The Moldovan authorities are making every effort to ensure that the elections do actually take place on DMR territory. Alongside the concentration of Moldovan armed formations on the border with the DMR, an attempt is being made to assail the Dniester Region from inside. It is being made first and foremost by General A. Lebed, commander of the Russian Federation 14th Army, and M. Bergman, commandant of the Tiraspol Garrison, around whom the local neobourgeois forces are grouping. Recently, Lebed more or less openly set out to overthrow the DMR's leadership by force. The general and his closest aide, Bergman, are appealing for a "march with pitchforks" against the organs of power, promising "to provide material assistance for the funerals" of the republic's leadership, as well as other such statements. In its appeal, the republic's parliament requests the United Nations, the CSCE, the world's parliaments, and the CIS countries to urgently send observers to the DMR with a view to "preventing the worsening of the economic blockade and the outbreak of armed conflict."
