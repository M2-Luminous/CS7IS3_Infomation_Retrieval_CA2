FR940621-1-00023 FR940621-1-00007 Records of this fish supported by preserved specimens are rare. Clemmer (1983) listed 23 specimens in museum collections. In their status survey, Burke and Ramsey (1985) captured only five Alabama sturgeons. Williams and Clemmer (1991) located another nine specimens in addition to those examined by Clemmer (1983), making a total of 32 specimens in museum, university, and private collections. Interestingly, since 1953 there has generally been a 7- to 8-year hiatus between representative collections of Alabama sturgeon in museums (Mayden and Kuhajda 1994). Verified localities have primarily been large channels of big rivers in the Mobile River system. However, a couple of Alabama sturgeon records are from oxbow lakes (Williams and Clemmer 1991). When the proposed rule was published (June 15, 1993; 58 FR 33148&hyph;54), the most recent documented evidence of the Alabama sturgeon's continued existence consisted of the capture of five Alabama sturgeons in 1985 (Burke and Ramsey 1985); two were gravid females and one was a juvenile about 2 years old. Biologists from the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR), with the assistance and cooperation of the Corps, have in recent years (1990 and 1992) conducted periodic searches for the Alabama sturgeon, utilizing a variety of sampling gear, without verifying the presence of a single specimen (Tucker and Johnson 1991, 1992). Nevertheless, the gravid females and juvenile Alabama sturgeons captured by Burke and Ramsey (1985) provided sufficient evidence that reproduction was occurring during at least the mid-1980s. Coupled with a high longevity (>20 years), the likelihood of sturgeon surviving to the present appeared quite high at the time of the proposed rule. Since the Burke and Ramsey (1985) status survey, there have been several anecdotal reports by commercial fishermen that two distant sturgeons have been taken from the Mobile River system in portions of the Alabama River upstream of Claiborne Lock and Dam. These reports presumably refer to the Alabama sturgeon and the Gulf sturgeon ( Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi ). The Gulf sturgeon can achieve lengths up to 2 meters (m) (6.6 feet), is generally more robust, and has shorter and deeper caudal peduncles than does the Alabama sturgeon. In addition, Gulf sturgeon are anadromous, migrating as adults up rivers from the Gulf of Mexico to spawn. (The Gulf sturgeon was listed as threatened on September 30, 1991 (56 FR 49658.) The service and the ADCNR conducted an extensive sampling program in 1993 in an effort to locate the Alabama sturgeon in the Mobile River system. On December 2, 1993, a mature male Alabama sturgeon was caught live in a gill net by staff of the Service's Panama City, Florida, Field Office. The capture site was in the free-flowing portion of the Alabama River downstream of Claiborne Lock and Dam, Clarke and Monroe Counties, Alabama. This specimen represents the only verified record of the Alabama sturgeon in nearly a decade. From this chronology of Alabama sturgeon collections, this fish has experienced a tremendous decline in both population size and range in just 100 years. The specific habitat needs of the Alabama sturgeon are largely unknown. Members of the genus Scaphirhynchus are freshwater fish (Bailey and Cross 1954) that do not make seasonal migrations to and from the sea. Shovelnose sturgeons in the Mississippi River system are most common in river channels having strong currents over sand, gravel, and rock substrates (Trautman 1981, Hurley et al. 1987, Curtis 1990) but may occasionally occur over softer sediments (Bailey and Cross 1954). Habitat selection also appears to be dictated by current velocities (Hurley et al. 1987). The shovelnose sturgeon often uses habitats associated with channel-training devices (Hurley and Nickum 1984, Hurley et al. 1987, Curtis 1990), which are water-diversion structures (e.g., training dikes, wing walls, and closing dams) used for directing currents to maintain channels. The association of the shovelnose sturgeon with these habitats may be correlated with higher prey item densities and suitable current velocities (Hurley et al. 1987); high silt loads directly impact many invertebrates that require a relatively stable substrate. The Corps provided funds for the Service to investigate the possibility that the Alabama sturgeon also uses habitats associated with channel-training devices in the Alabama River. However, no conclusions were derived from this study as no Alabama sturgeons were captured (Corps, in litt., 1993). Based upon the limited information available, the Alabama sturgeon appears to prefer relatively stable substrates of gravel and sand in deeper portions of river channels with swift currents (Burke and Ramsey 1985). Limited data collected from a radio-collared Alabama sturgeon suggested that if frequented swift currents in water 7.5 to 12.0 m (25 to 40 feet) deep (Burke and Ramsey 1985).
