The conference was attended by regional party and government leaders, including Zhao Fulin [regional party committee secretary], Cheng Kejie [regional people's government chairman], Liu Mingzu [regional people's congress standing committee chairman], Ding Tingmo, Chen Huiguang [regional Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference committee chairman], Pei Guikang, Li Enchao, Yuan Zhengzhong, Ma Qingsheng, Yang Jichang, Huang Baoyao, Zhang Dunhao, Lu Bin, and He Xianglin. Liu Mingzu, regional party committee deputy secretary, presided over the conference at which regional party committee Secretary Zhao Fulin, Cheng Kejie, regional party committee deputy secretary and people's government chairman, and Yuan Zhengzhong, regional party committee standing committee member and people's government vice chairman, spoke. Secretary Zhao Fulin stated in his speech: Since the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made important arrangements for the on-going anti-corruption struggle in 1993, party committees and governments across the region have made unreserved efforts to fulfill the three anti-corruption tasks laid down by the CPC Central Committee, employed practical and feasible measures, and carried out work in a down-to-earth manner. Thanks to concerted efforts on the part of the broad masses of cadres and people, the region's anti- corruption struggle has scored some initial results. Those areas and units that have energetically carried out the on-going anti-corruption struggle have already achieved gratifying results in the first-stage struggle, thereby dealing a telling blow to all types of negative and corrupt phenomena across the region and basically fulfilling the first-stage tasks set by the central authorities and regional party committee. Speaking of this year's anti-corruption struggle, Secretary Zhao Fulin noted: In order to effectively carry on the anti-corruption struggle this year, we should make redoubled efforts to ensure that all leading cadres at the provincial department section or county level across the region will honestly perform official duties and strictly observe party and government discipline. To this end, all provincial department sections and counties across the region should call meetings before the end of May to carry out self-examination and self-rectification among cadres in a democratic manner. Discipline inspection, supervision, and judicial organs at all levels across the region should also concentrate on investigating and handling major and serious cases, make continued efforts to vigorously investigate and handle law- and discipline-violation cases involving party, government, judicial, administrative, law enforcement, and economic management departments and cadres; make continued efforts to crack corruption cases involving leading cadres, law-enforcement and discipline-enforcement personnel, as well as legal persons, including embezzlement and bribery cases, cases in which cadres seek private gains by abusing power, and cases in which cadres seek unlawful privileges and gains by abusing law- and discipline-enforcement powers; conscientiously investigate and handle law-violation and discipline-violation cases concerning key projects construction, land lease, real estate development, and foreign economic and trade activities; make continued efforts to crack down on those malpractices that have caused strong resentment among the masses; and resolutely put an end to indiscriminate and unreasonable charges and fees. Secretary Zhao Fulin also urged continued efforts to lighten burden on the part of peasants, disengage party and government organs from their own economic entities, resolutely ban party and government organs from doing business and running enterprises, and focus on the following seven aspects of work: 1. Continually conduct democratic activities within party and government organs at all levels. 2. Strengthen mass supervision and mobilize the masses to participate in the on-going anti-corruption struggle. 3. Continually increase transparency of party and government work, ensure mass supervision over party and government work, and carry out democratic appraisal of leaders. 4. Continually implement an organizational supervision system. 5. The discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels across the region should step up supervision and examination and conscientiously implement a series of important policy decisions made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to this end. 6. The people's congresses and their standing committees at all levels across the region should strengthen supervision over law- enforcement organs. 7. Vigorously push ahead with party style and clean government building. Chairman Cheng Kejie stated in his speech: The year 1994 is a crucial year for deepening reforms aimed at building a socialist market economic structure and speeding up economic development. Reform, development, and stability should promote and complement one another. Successfully combating corruption and building a clean government constitute an important guarantee of social stability. The leading cadres at all levels across the region should firmly adhere to such overall interests as grasping each and every excellent opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, maintaining stability, correctly handling relations between reform, development, and stability, never slackening efforts in furthering the on-going anti-corrruption struggle, making the on-going anti-corruption struggle more fruitful, and striving to bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth across the region. Chairman Cheng Kejie called in his speech for conscientiously carrying out the following five types of work: 1. Properly handle problems cropping up in the course of reforms. 2. Monitor and supervise market prices and improve market order. 3. Guarantee sufficient vegetables and non-staple food supplies. 4. Make sound livelihood arrangements for the masses and help people in disaster-stricken areas overcome difficulties. 5. Vigorously step up comprehensive social order management and provide reform, opening up, and economic construction with a sound social environment.
