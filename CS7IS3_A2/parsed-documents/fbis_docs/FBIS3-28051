The rural theses is a program of the socialist rural construction to defend socialism and bring its advantages into full play by actively encouraging and developing collectivism in the rural economy. Collectivism is the life and soul of socialism. The rural theses of the great leader is a program of the socialist rural construction to strengthen and develop socialist collectivism. It indicates the way of arming the farmers with the collectivist idea and high scientific and cultural knowledge, industrializing and modernizing agriculture, overcoming immaturity of cooperative economy in all aspects of ownership and management and raising it up to the level of the state-run economy, the highest stage of development of the socialist economy. It is also a revolutionary program of socialist rural construction to make a victorious advance not only of the rural economy but also of the socialist cause by strengthening the internal force of socialism. The validity and greatness of the rural theses lie in strengthening the guidance of the party and the state over the countryside in every way, patterning the farmers on the working-class and firmly preparing them to be resolute supporters and defenders of socialism, reliable and competent builders of the socialist rural community. The principle and tasks of the rural theses including the idea of pushing ahead with the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, and strengthening the guidance of the party and the state over the countryside make it possible to build up our countryside as an invincible fortress of socialism by creditably carrying on the socialist rural construction and, at the same time, strengthening the motive force of revolution in the countryside. The socialist rural theses is also a great program of the socialist rural construction to help the entire agricultural working people lead a worthy and happy life as full-fledged masters of the countryside. It leads the farmers to extricate themselves from the old shackles of all ideological, technical and cultural fields, hold the position of the full-fledged masters of the countryside and glorify the dignity and honor of the masters. There can neither be hotbed of exploitation nor be a gap between the rich and the poor in our countryside advancing along the road of the rural theses.
