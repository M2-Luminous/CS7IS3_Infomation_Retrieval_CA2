Kyrgyzstan is the site for a field staff of the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations, which runs programmes of measures to prevent natural disasters, forecast them and provide early warning of tremors and avalanches. The town of Uzgen is where a number of prefab houses, purchased in Russia with Russian easy-term credits, have been built to give shelter to victims of natural disasters. Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev estimates that last year Russia's aid helped save over 14,000 of the republic's citizens.
