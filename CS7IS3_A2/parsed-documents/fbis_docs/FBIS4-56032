Such is the opinion of a mining team of the August-80 Free Trade Union in Katowice. For the first time the government coerced the strikers' representatives to accept the fact that strikers would not be paid for the period of the strike. In the team's opinion Solidarity leaders promised the strikers that they would be paid for the period of the strike. Currently, however, they are avoiding responsibility for the effects of the protest.
