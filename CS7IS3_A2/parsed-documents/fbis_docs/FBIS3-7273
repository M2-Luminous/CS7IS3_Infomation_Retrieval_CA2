Considering the role and importance of the Pailin area in the fields of politics, psychology, economics, and foreign affairs, and in a spirit of high responsibility for the destiny of the population in general and of the entire Cambodian people, the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] has decided to make the Pailin area a development zone. With this noble goal, along with preparations to organize various tasks, the RGC has the honor to issue the following official statement. 1. Concerning the army officers and men who are currently still under the Khmer Rouge leadership, the RGC continues to pay attention to their destiny, rights, freedom, and interests, that is, by the royal government issuing successive appeals. Therefore, Khmer Rouge officers and men who have been dispersed in the Pailin area, please hurry and show yourselves to the KRAF and relevant authorities present in the area. You will receive attention and protection for your lives, rights, interests, position, and role -- the same as the royal government has given thousands of former officers and men who have awakened and joined the royal government. 2. Concerning any compatriots who have been threatened and forced by the Khmer Rouge to go with them, the royal government is paying considerable attention to your difficult and arduous life. Please endeavor to solve the problem in line with the royal government's appeal issued on 4 March 1994, namely get in touch with the KRAF in order to free yourselves from the grip of the Khmer Rouge group. The royal government will set up relevant authorities to receive you and organize appropriate living conditions for you by legally granting you land and housing. 3. As for compatriots who have fled to live temporarily on the territory of the Kingdom of Thailand, the RGC will directly get in touch with the representative of the Royal Thai Government to accept you back to the territory of the Cambodian motherland. For those compatriots who want to continue living in the Pailin area or who want to change to other places, the RGC will do all it can to accommodate your wishes. In this respect, the RGC would like to welcome various international organizations, such as the HCR [High Commission for Refugees] and the International Committee of the Red Cross, who have volunteered to provide assistance to the RGC. 4. As for Thai companies and investors who signed business contracts with the Khmer Rouge group in the Pailin area, the RGC would like to solemnly inform them that the RGC will genuinely guarantee their interests by recognizing their rights in the contracts in the event that the owners of these companies (?put forward proposals) to the RGC. The RGC hopes, and is firmly convinced, that the royal government will receive a welcome and wide support and assistance from national and international public opinion for the this noble cause.
