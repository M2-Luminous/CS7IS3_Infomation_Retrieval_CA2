Association employees who reported to work yesterday were not admitted into the building by security. They had their passes seized and were advised to take it easy until 1 March (when the Federation Council winds up its work), explaining that entry was denied them for their own safety. The employees were even barred from making sure their studio, with equipment worth more than 150 million rubles, was quite safe. The Federation Council apparatus does not seem to worry about how dozens of Association members up and down the CIS are going to get programming and how much IART losses will be -- chiefs of the Association cannot get any answer out of it.
