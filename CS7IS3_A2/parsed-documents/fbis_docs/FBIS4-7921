He led a parliamentary delegation on a three-day official visit here, the first by a head of the Turkish Parliament to Bulgaria in 20 years. During his stay, Mr. Cindoruk conferred with National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, President Zhelyu Zhelev (with whom he discussed Dr Zhelev's visit to Turkey this coming June), Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, and MP's of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committees. According to Mr. Cindoruk, the activation of parliamentary contacts already creates prerequisites for a successful promotion of bilateral economic relations as well, following the example of political and military contacts. Mr. Cindoruk will recommend the Turkish Government to concentrate on boosting Turkish-Bulgarian trade, creating an East-West corridor after the restoration of peace in the Balkans and cooperating with Bulgaria in transport and tourism, in third countries included. "We count entirely on your parliament for a solution of the problems of the Bulgarian citizens who identify themselves as ethnic Turks because they are equally represented in it," the chief Turkish legislator told the news conference. He said that Bulgaria is making great strides on the road of democracy. He believes that the two countries' concerted efforts could help remove the question about the rights of Bulgarian Muslims from the agenda of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. "The matter was put on the agenda before 1989, before the start of democratic changes in Bulgaria," Mr. Cindoruk pointed out. He explained again that the commitment of Turkish blue helmets to Bosnia-Herzegovina was not decided by Turkey but by the UN Security Council and recalled that his country has always accepted such invitations, sending peacekeepers to Korea, Somalia and other countries. "At the same time, we are understanding of Bulgaria's sensitivity to this matter. If under the influence of these objections the United Nations changes its decision, we will accept this, too," Mr. Cindoruk stressed. National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov assessed his Turkish counterpart's visit as exceedingly successful. In his view, this visit showed that a number of questions and ideas, which are useful to both countries at these hard times for the Balkans, can be raised and acted on at the parliamentary level.
