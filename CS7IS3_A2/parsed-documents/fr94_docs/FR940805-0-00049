FR940805-0-00049 FR940805-0-00017 Some portions of Oregon's revised program are broader in scope than the federal program, and thus are not federally enforceable. The broader in scope rules are OAR Chapter 340: 100&hyph;011, 101&hyph;033, 102&hyph;044, 102&hyph;070, 104&hyph;075, 105&hyph;013, 105&hyph;014, 105&hyph;040, 105&hyph;041, 105&hyph;051, 111&hyph;020, 111&hyph;030, and 111&hyph;037. Broader information requirements characterize 100&hyph;011, 102&hyph;070, 105&hyph;013, and 105&hyph;014 (in some cases the last two rules may be more stringent depending on the type of information required). State-only siting standards make 105&hyph;040, 105&hyph;041, and 120&hyph;001 broader. Permit conditions are modified under 105&hyph;051. State-only hazardous wastes are added by 101&hyph;033. Small quantity generators must comply with large quantity generator requirements under 102&hyph;044. Non-RCRA permitted recycling facilities are required to comply to provide biennial report information by 104&hyph;075 (in some cases this rule may be more stringent depending on the information required). Oregon's used oil rule adds regulated and prohibited activities to the Federal rule in 111&hyph;020 and 111&hyph;030. Used oil generators are allowed to transport oil in leased vehicles under 111&hyph;037. EPA will administer the enforcement, modification, revocation, reissuance, and termination of portions of joint State/EPA permits for which the State is not yet authorized until such time that the State is granted authorization. Oregon is not seeking authorization to operate on Indian lands. C. Decision I conclude that Oregon's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Oregon is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. Oregon now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of HSWA. Oregon also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under Section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under Sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. Compliance with Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability of certain Federal regulations in favor of Oregon's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
