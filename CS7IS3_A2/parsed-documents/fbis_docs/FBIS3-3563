The situation is favorable as a whole. To fulfill this year's fixed target of the whole province establishing the socialist market economic system, and maintaining sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national economy, a very important issue facing us is that we must continue to handle relations between reform, development and stability well. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "We are carrying out the four modernizations program, reform, and opening up. Stability is a key factor." There is no doubt that continuing to maintain stability is a prerequisite for developing the present favorable situation and guaranteeing the successful completion of various tasks this year. However, after summing up our own experiences, and reviewing the situation in various provinces and cities throughout the country, we realize that to maintain stability, long-term stability in particular, and to speed up development is most fundamental and significant. The present reform has concerned the redistribution of power and benefits. It is also an issue which concerns vital interests of people in various circles. To solve these problems well, we need practical and good policies and methods. Necessary economic strength is also indispensable. For instance, it is absolutely necessary to establish a sound social security system. However, the task can only be eventually accomplished with the continuous increasing of the economic bearing capacity of enterprises and individuals. To completely solve the problem of enterprises running the society, so that fluctuation can be reduce or avoided in the work of establishing a modern enterprise system, it is, under most circumstances, necessary to inject a fairly large amount of funds into the society to enable reform in production relations to coincide with the development of productive forces. With regard to the issue of providing an outlet for the vast rural surplus labor force, furnishing employment in cities, speeding up economic development, improving the economy and people's livelihood in areas inhabited by minority nationalities and impoverished areas, lightening peasant burdens, and doing work to further lessen and eliminate factors which might affect stability and unity, necessary material guarantee is equally indispensable. It is obvious that, in a certain sense, without development it is impossible to maintain stability. In the meantime, it should be thoughtfully noted that the present reform and economic development need a stable social environment. If the society in not stable, reform and development can only be an empty talk. Therefore, we must not use a negative viewpoint of advocating stability for stability's sake to comprehend stability. We must understand that as far as Sichuan, a fairly backward big province, is concerned, its economy must develop faster. It is impossible to always go about things quietly and steadily. With regard to the issue of development, we must on no account be overcautious, or refrain from doing something necessary for fear of a slight risk. On the contrary, we must emancipate our minds and have our hands and feet unfettered. In places where conditions exist, we must do our utmost to promote faster development under the prerequisite of attaching importance to efficiency and quality. In the meantime, in the course of development, we must pay attention to discovering problems and solving them promptly and properly, so that our economy can advance to a new height as quickly as possible. To do so, it is beneficial not only to fulfilling our province's second-step strategic target three years ahead of time, but also to maintaining long-term stability of the whole society. Experiences of developed coastal areas have proved that as long as our economy has been developed, and that we have more goods on hand, we will have the initiative in handling various kinds of conflicts and problems. We can thus maintain stability with assurance. To speed up development, what is most important is to seize on fine opportunities, and deepen reforms. The present international and domestic environment is favorable to us. The state has put the project of speeding up the development in the central and western regions and accelerating resource exploitation in western region on the important agenda. There are preferential policies for us. Some powerful foreign businessmen have treated the Sichuan market favorably. There is good momentum for the development of Sichuan's economy. We must seize on this favorable opportunity which is hard to come by in history, and proceed from Sichuan's practical reality to speed up the pace of reform in accordance with the requirements of making unified plans, giving an overall impetus, making a major breakthrough, and pursuing division of labor with individual responsibility. We must make a big step in establishing and improving the socialist market economic system to further emancipate productive forces fettered by the old system, and further arouse the enthusiasm of millions upon millions of the masses in socialist modernization and construction. This has demanded that party and government leaders at all levels throughout the province must further emancipate their minds, and inspire their enthusiasm to lead people of the whole province to unite as one, struggle hard, explore the way forward, and successfully accomplish tasks set by the central authorities, and the second session of our Eighth Provincial People's Congress as well, to make new contributions to Sichuan's development. If we fail to do so, if we separate stability from reform and development, or even set them against each other, if we hesitate, or take a wait-and-see attitude, we are liable to lose the favorable opportunity, and delay the great cause of reform and opening up. Social stability will eventually be affected. In a word, our comrades must, at all times, never forget that "development is the last word." They must never forget that the aim of deepening reform, expanding opening up, and maintaining stability is to accelerate development. Only by understanding and handling dialectical relations between reform, development and stability in this way can there be a guarantee for our province's more prosperous economy and more thorough social stability.
