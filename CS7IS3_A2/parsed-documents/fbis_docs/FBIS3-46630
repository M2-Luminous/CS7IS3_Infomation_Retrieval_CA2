Such established industries as electric power fear a collapse of the established order. The distribution and beer industries are awaiting the opening of new business opportunities. The situation is likely to have a major impact on the customs brokerage system. Furthermore, interestingly enough, such reactions suggest the future outlook of the various industries. The deregulation is actually a deregulation of the established economic order. Let us examine the reactions of the principal industries. Jonan Electric, a Discounter of Cosmetic Products "We are not selling this product. We have been notified by the Ministry of Welfare not to undersell it. Those who want the product can call the ministry. The number is 3503-1711. Please use the counter telephone." This notice is posted in the cosmetic sales section on the eighth floor of the Jonan Electric Co.'s Shibuya branch. In June this year, Jonan Electric began discount sales of a famous foreign brand of cosmetics which it acquired under parallel import. In the case of cosmetics imported through ordinary channels, they are imported by dealers licensed by the Ministry of Welfare, and are sold with labels attached that indicate the name of the seller and the component materials. The purpose is to protect domestic consumers. However, Jonan Electric feared that the importers could pressure the cosmetics maker, so it removed the labels and began sales. It was a premeditated violation of the rule. Regarding this "violation of the rule," the Ministry of Welfare judged that removal of the labels was a violation of the Drugs, Cosmetics, and Medical Instruments Law, and ordered a halt to the sales through the Tokyo prefectural government. It resulted in the aforementioned posted notice. The Ministry of Welfare's explanation is as follows. "We do not state that it is wrong to conduct discount sales. We do not allow sales of imported cosmetic goods without labeling merely in order to protect the consumers. As proof, we do not say anything about discount sales by Jonan Electric of cosmetics made by Shiseido or Kanebo." President Toshio Miyaji rebuts this, saying, "Even though we try to qualify as an importer, the Ministry of Welfare shuts out new entries. The consumers are knowledgeable about foreign brands of cosmetics, and what we sell are all brands that are being sold in Japan. There is also no problem concerning safety." President Miyaji adds, "The Drugs, Cosmetics, and Medical Instruments Law is nothing but a law that attaches labels to foreign cosmetics, and a large number of Ministry of Welfare bureaucrats are being assigned after retirement to companies that attach the labels." He also emphasizes: "At this stage, a great margin is being added on, and the interests of the consumers are being injured." With public opinion seeking inexpensive cosmetics as the backdrop, Jonan Electric is aiming for resumption of sales. For women, being able to purchase a Chanel lipstick worth 4,000 yen at 1,800 yen is quite attractive. However, acquisition of a permit as an importer is difficult under the present circumstances, and the problem is like to be prolonged. Kawachiya and Daiei Inc. In July this year, the National Tax Administration Agency issued a notice on the revision of the liquor sales license. The content is as follows: 1) The transfer of the business rights of a store under business closure is not permitted. 2) Even in a case where the business rights are being taken over from an established store that has gone out of business, the store floor space cannot be expanded by more than 100 square meters, and the overall space cannot exceed 3,000 square meters. 3) A store cannot move during its first year of business. The new class of discount dealers has acquired liquor sales licenses through capital participation in established liquor stores. Inability to acquire the licenses of stores with closed business is a matter of survival for them. Also, the discount dealers are making broad discounts possible through mass purchase and mass sales. They require mass warehousing for that purpose. If they are restricted to 3,000 square meters including warehouses, business will actually be impossible. The tax agency's notice is merely a joint scheme between the liquor sales union and the wholesale liquor sales union--organizations of the established stores--to shut out the discounters. In fact, the pressure applied by these groups on the bargain stores is beyond imagination. For example, Kawachiya Co. opened a bargain store in the town of Shirane in Yamanashi Prefecture. However, because the makers and wholesalers in Yamanashi Prefecture joined to deny deliveries to Kawachiya, it was forced to ship sake from Tokyo in order to continue business. President Yukio Higuchi maintains a bullish posture when he says: "Regardless of the pressure, we are doing good business," but the transportation costs are not negligible. A person in charge of public relations at Daiei says: "Ever since it was reported that Nakauchi went to see Prime Minister Hosokawa, there has been a rush of reporters covering deregulation." The announcement that "it would be possible to lower prices if the various permits and licenses for the opening of superstores should be abolished" suddenly attracted attention. According to Daiei, an immense amount of labor is spent on food-related permits in opening a store. In the case of superstores, meat, fish, ice cream, and delicacies are sold, and permits must be obtained from the health bureaus of the various prefectures for each store. Moreover, in the case of meat, it is not only sold but also simply cooked, and in addition to licenses for edible meat, licenses for restaurants are necessary. Therefore, applications for about 20 licenses must reportedly be submitted to the health authorities. With the need for so many licenses, the cost and time spent for renewals are enormous. Also, according to the present Food Sanitation Law, every store must have a washroom. It is joked that the superstores are overequipped with washrooms. This also an "unnecessary cost" according to those concerned. The fact that permits and licenses vary according to the region and the officials in charge is also a source of headaches for the superstores. Although it is said to be based on the Food Sanitation Law, the government agency is able to manipulate operations in the name of administrative guidance. It is also a large waste of time to cope with it. If such a wide range of time, effort, and cost are roughly calculated in terms of overall cost, it would come to about 160 million yen for Daiei. In order to meet this cost, about 7.5 billion yen in sales is necessary, calculating in reverse from from Daiei's business profit rate. If the regulatory system is abolished, there would be room to lower prices by the cost amount. According to Daiei's estimates, it will result in a price drop of about 0.4 percent. Although all regulations are not unnecessary, it must be remembered that it is not only Daiei, but also the consumers who are forced to carry such cost burdens. [passage omitted] Customs as a Barrier Based on his experience in personally importing an American car from Australia, Richard Koo of THE ECONOMIST describes his anger toward the customs office as follows. "Bureaucrats say foolish things such as the market will be open if customs duties are abolished. However they do not notice that, amid the rampant regulations that harass us, Japan is isolating itself. It is such an ordeal to even import a single car. How can the promotion of imports be possible?" Let us continue our discussion of Mister Koo. The customs duties for cars was zero, and only a consumption tax was charged. However, the customs-related costs equaled half of the transportation cost from Australia. The greatest problem concerns the complicated documents that must be filed at the customs office and the land transportation bureau. First, explanations regarding the engine number and the chassis number are required. Unless everything can be explained, the documents will not be accepted. Inquiries were made of the dealer in Australia and the main office in the United States, and an explanation was somehow submitted based on conversations with the parties concerned in Japan, but the next hurdle was the petition for a garage certificate. At the police station near his residence, he was asked to show a certificate of his personal seal, which he was not required to submit. When he protested, the official in charge became defiant and told him: "That is why we are asking you." There is absolutely no basis for it, but the petition will not be accepted until he shows it. Long ago, when an airline company purchased an aircraft, it was required to submit a list of its stockholders. However, what relationship is there between a car purchase and a personal seal certificate? Such "harassment" by import regulations has been experienced by numerous domestic importers. In addition to ordinary customs procedures, import procedures include nearly 30 other statutory permits and licenses. For example, if one wishes to import grapefruits, two permits under the Plant Quarantine Law (MAFF) and the Food Sanitation Law (Ministry of Finance) must be acquired before submitting them to customs. The inspection station is distant and, depending on the ability of the inspector to respond, the inspection takes about two days. There is also a check on whether drugs are present, and the inspections are conducted separately. Simplification of the inspections and procedures have been implemented in many forms. However, it is confined to the procedural text, and the burden of the importers remains virtually unchanged. For example, a method has been introduced whereby the respective inspectors will conduct the inspections simultaneously, but virtually no importer has requested it. The actual inspections are left to the discretion of the inspector on duty. For example, the inspection based on the Food Sanitation Law is not necessarily done. If one requests an inspection that might not be conducted, it will mean additional time and cost (the inspection cost is paid by the importer). In the case of a request for consecutive imports of the same product, inspection is omitted under the previous analysis certificate for period of six months. However, when the effective period is up, it will take time to wait in turn for inspection. Therefore, the importer generally conducts voluntary inspection at his own expense. Deregulation has not taken effect at all at the lower reaches. The rigidity of the import procedures has virtually not improved. When importing beef, mistaking the quantity and discrepancy between the number of parts (of the animal) and those listed in the certificate of the exporting country is almost a daily occurrence. However, inspection reportedly cannot be passed unless the discrepant portion is thrown out or a new certificate is acquired. Moreover, it is a problem because only the original certificate is accepted. In effect, in general, a separate request reportedly can be submitted to the authorities for a free pass. If so, why is an inspection needed in the first place? Because lawn turf is imported in the form of seeds, a palette inspection of the seeds is conducted. Even if a single seed of another plant is found, the turf must be destroyed because will be "injurious to Japan's ecosystem." Such regulations are not only drawbacks of the rigidity of vertical administration, but they are also a reflection of the excessive spread of the protection tendency. Of course, there are such commodities as food products that require safety checks at the water's edge, but there is undeniably an aspect of excessive regulation that increases import costs and delays Japan's structural change. A certain major importer says, "The customs office still is a checkpoint where one must beg to be allowed passage." There is a great need for improvement.
