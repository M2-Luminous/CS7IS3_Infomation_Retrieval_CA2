In your opinion, this is merely the way to full membership in NATO. Is that opinion shared by all the coalition partners? [Baudys] I admit that I have not encountered any other opinion among the other partners. [Kouda] Does that not mean, however, taking responsibility -- to a certain extent -- for NATO even in possible situations when it is not in the Czech Republic's interest? [Baudys] When you enter into a marriage with someone, you must know with whom you are entering into it, that is, whether this is a reliable person. Understandably, it does not only mean a number of advantages, but also a number of responsibilities and sui generis certain restrictions. It is impossible to be a fare-dodger on a train. Simply, if you are traveling, you must pay the toll. [Kouda] Many opposition politicians are cautious about joining NATO, many are opposed to it. In this context, they often emphasize the role of the CSCE. Moreover, there is also Russia here with its negative position toward NATO expansion so that a new cordon sanitaire is not created around that power. [Baudys] It is necessary to realize that the CSCE is a forum for negotiation. It is not an executive body that has executive powers and repressive elements. It is completely different from NATO or the Western European Union. Every responsible politician, and especially the defense or foreign minister, must do all he can to ensure that this country functions. We know that situations may arise that could exceed this country's defense capability. It is necessary to look for bodies of collective security. History leads to a certain general integration -- communication and technological -- and NATO is also one of the levels of integration. [Kouda] And what is your view of a power like Russia? [Baudys] Of course, Russia is not only a power, it is a superpower. That is one thing. The other is that each state must seek its own identity, a place where it belongs. This government team, which won the most support in the elections, has come up with a program according to which the Czech Republic is part of European and Western European civilization. It belongs to and acknowledges the values of the European Union; it acknowledges the values that NATO defends. As far as Russia is concerned, it is up to it alone where it stands and what it avows. [Kouda] Would it not be appropriate, however, to confirm this orientation in a referendum? That is, by asking whether citizens want the Czech Republic to join NATO? [Baudys] Several principles are being mixed up here. A referendum is normal in democracies of the kind found in Switzerland, where they are conducted even on a local level about something important. A referendum is a different way of pursuing democracy than is normal in our country. There is a historically well-established method here -- electing political parties. Each party produces a specific program and we as coalition parties have never made a secret of our attitude toward NATO. The voters accepted this, these parties were elected by the majority, this is part of the government's program, and parliament has approved this program. I see no reason to hold a referendum on this. I would ask, if not NATO or the Western European Union, then what? No opposition politician has been able to answer this question yet. No one has been able to propose an alternative that would make any sense. [passage omitted] [Kouda] According to General Nekvasil, there should be 33,000 professional soldiers in the Army. This number has now declined, however, and this situation is being reflected mainly among the posts of squad, platoon, and company commanders. How do you intend to deal with it? [Baudys] The Army's transformation is oriented toward ensuring that it is compatible with other armies from advanced democratic states, mostly NATO members, by means of its ability, structure, and organization. Reducing the size of the Army is one thing, transferring from a division to a brigade system is another, and the method of command and management is something else again. Other things include the personnel issue, the education and training system in the Army, the whole principle of budgeting and planning, democratic management, and creating a comprehensive new and functioning logistical system. These are processes that were started in the middle of last year, processes that take place at a specific time and according to a timetable. In reply to your question: By significantly reducing the number of most senior officers and transferring them to command the lower-level units -- squads, companies, and so on. [Kouda] Do you think that the officers will transfer to these posts? [Baudys] The process will take some time. Of course, it will be difficult for a 50-year-old officer to command a platoon or a company. That is not the purpose. It will lead to natural waste in the Army; people will retire. A number of people no longer want to be in the Army, mainly for financial reasons. Dozens, however, are returning to it again. Filling the lower-level posts could not be done last year, for it was not clear which units would be abolished, whether people would get an apartment, and so on. Consequently, we could not offer them any prospects. Now this is under way, we have a concept, and only now are we recruiting for the Army. [Kouda] The across-the-board screenings have, obviously, not fulfilled their purpose. [Baudys] That was not understood properly. It was constantly pressed upon me that the screenings mean a sweeping purge. We needed to map out the situation, that is, who is who and take action against the most flagrant cases. I had anticipated that we would be able to take action against more of these cases; we simply did not succeed 100 percent, but fundamental changes are in progress. [passage omitted] [Kouda] You have admitted that smallpox cultures were stored in the military hospital in Stresovice. How and when were the cultures destroyed and who bears, or will bear, the responsibility for storing them? [Baudys] Those are problems that have been foisted upon us. So far, no investigation has shown that the Czech Army preserved anything that would be at variance with the law or at variance with international conventions. I had the viral cultures destroyed because it was apparent from the conclusion reached by the inter-departmental commission that there was no need to continue to store them. That entire issue has been unbelievably blown up and overdramatized. [Kouda] As defense minister, you made the decision to destroy the smallpox virus. So, the Czech Army had preserved it for a certain period. [Baudys] That was not at variance with any international convention, however. If I had not given the order for its destruction, nothing would have happened. It is also necessary to say that the issue here involves the variola minor and variola major forms of smallpox. The variola major was destroyed in 1975. What the Czech Army had was variola minor, which is less dangerous than variola major. A number of very dangerous viruses -- which you can purchase for a few dollars in any laboratory, however -- were preserved. The issue was blown out of proportion.
