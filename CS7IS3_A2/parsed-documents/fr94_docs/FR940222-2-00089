ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces that it is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program that was submitted for Bishop International Airport under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;193) (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act'') and 14 CFR Part 150 by Bishop International Airport Authority. This program was submitted subsequent to a determination by the FAA that associated noise exposure maps submitted under 14 CFR Part 150 for Bishop International Airport were in compliance with applicable requirements effective March 1, 1993. The proposed noise compatibility program will be approved or disapproved on or before July 25, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATES: The effective date of the start of the FAA's review of the noise compatibility program is January 26, 1994. The public comment periods ends March 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ernest P. Gubry, Community Planner, Federal Aviation Administration, Detroit Airports District Office, Willow Run Airport, East, 8820 Beck Road, Belleville, Michigan 48111. Comments on the proposed noise compatibility program should also be submitted to the above office. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice announces that the FAA is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program for Bishop International Airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before July 25, 1994. This notice also announces the availability of this program for public review and comment. An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by the FAA to be in compliance with the requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses. The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for Bishop International Airport, effective on January 26, 1994. It was requested that the FAA review this material and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program under section 104(b) of the Act. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before July 25, 1994. The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150, ยง150.33. The primary considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety, create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing no compatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses. Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments, other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable. Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program are available for examination at the following locations: Federal Aviation Administration, Detroit Airports District Office, Willow Run Airport, East, 8820 Beck Road, Belleville, Michigan 48111, Bishop International Airport, G&hyph;3425 W. Bristol Road, Flint, Michigan 48507. Questions may be directed to the individual named above under the heading, FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Issued in Belleville, Michigan, on January 26, 1994. Dean C. Nitz, Manager, Detroit Airports District Office, FAA Great Lakes Region. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3889 Filed 2&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
