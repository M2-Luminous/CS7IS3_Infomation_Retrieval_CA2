Islam Karimov Aspires to the Role of Leonid Brezhnev, Apparently, in the Affairs of Our Southern Neighbor"] [Text] For 10 long years, the word "Afghanistan" was ever present in the newspapers. Journalists of the Lenin school would adduce it with well-paid pride; ordinary people would utter it with condemnation or hatred. Time has passed, and the Amudarya was left astern of the last Soviet tank, and Afghanistan remains merely in the nostalgic songs of burned and legless poets. It has once again become as alien and remote as prior to 1979, when the semi-idiotic slack-jawed old man called on us from the television screen to fulfill our "international duty." But those who think that peace and prosperity have come to reign in Afghanistan following our departure are wrong. Not always is fighting followed by peace, and it happens that one war is replaced by another--as has been the case in Afghanistan also. Jihad--"holy war against the infidel"--has come to be replaced by civil war--a war of all against all. The "international duty" in whose name Afghanistan was in flames for a whole decade dragged out into the open all the conflicts that had built up over centuries in Afghan society, inundated it--illiterate and backward--with piles of weapons, and made it ungovernable. And after the Soviet departure, the fire of war not only did not die out, but flared up with even greater force. According to eyewitnesses, the devastation of recent years has surpassed many times over what was done with our "assistance": Kabul, for example, has already simply died; it does not exist. And considering that it is around this latter that the main struggle is being conducted, it may be assumed that there will shortly be nothing left to fight over. This might seem improbable and blasphemous, but many people in Afghanistan remember with nostalgia the days when the "shuravi" [Russians] were there--in just the same way that the most inveterate democrats in Russia are beginning increasingly with a wistful sigh to recall stagnation. The reason is the same: "There was at least some order then. Now...." But, as reality shows, it is still somewhat early to forget conclusively about Afghanistan. The Afghan knot not only has not been completely untied; it has in places--primarily on the southern flanks of the former USSR--been pulled even tighter. We have tried to pull out one of the threads of this knot. I would like to call the reader's attention to the fact that none of what is discussed below is the fruit of the imagination of NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA journalists. We obtained the information that we are making public via two channels, perfectly reliable, not connected with one another, and sufficiently authenticated, of the former KGB (we will not specify the subdivision) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. We set forth the viewpoint of these specialists, who, for understandable reasons, wished to remain incognito. Were someone to try to make a national-ethnic map of Afghanistan, he would, most likely, get something akin to a patchwork quilt: dozens of tribes and national groups, related, for the most part, to our Central Asian groups, and dozens of independent enclaves, where local "authorities"--of varying caliber, but united by a single aspiration--never to submit to anyone ever--rule. It was precisely the inveterate national-ethnic conflicts--primarily between the Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazara--that were the basis of the antagonism that erupted in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of the Soviet forces. As we all know, the principal "heroes" of this protracted armed confrontation have from the outset been the Tajik Rabbani, the present president of Afghanistan, and the Pashtun Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, who in the years of the Soviet presence were, perhaps, the main figures in the Afghan resistance. But others besides them have been participating in this game also. Specifically, Gen. Rashid Dostum, whose name surfaced in our press only recently in connection with the combat operations that he mounted in Kabul at the start of January. In the game of chess that we wish to investigate, this figure is, perhaps, of greater significance than his distinguished competitors, and we will dwell on him, therefore. Gen. Rashid Dostum is, in his way, a unique personality. Primarily because there have been practically no Uzbek generals in Afghanistan. Uzbeks never fought here, being one of the most peaceful groups of the population. But in the final years of the war, an Uzbek volunteer force, which was headed by Dostum and on which, however odd, Kabul officialdom--Pashtun--came to rely, emerged. The Uzbek militia took part increasingly often in the armed struggle against the mojahedin and subsequently was the main lever that....removed Najibullah himself. Subsequently, Dostum became the uncrowned king of all the enclaves of Afghanistan populated by Uzbeks, this being several northern provinces of the country bordering Uzbekistan and, partially, Tajikistan. Having seized power in the north, he concentrated in his hands a very strong military grouping. He succeeded in uniting under his command colossal forces--practically all the government formations located in this region--with a large quantity of hardware, up to and including aircraft and tanks. In addition, the main weapons stores from the time when arms had been transferred from the territory of the USSR were based in the north. And, finally, the Afghan North means, in addition, the most economically developed zone of the country, where gas is recovered and mineral fertilizer is produced, and where the Afghan granary is located. And Dostum was able to bring all this under his control. It is for this reason, most likely, that the antagonistic groupings of Rabbani and Hikmatyar conducted a constant struggle for him, attempting to win the general over to their side. And at the same time, on the other hand, they were unwilling to recognize him as an independent political force and equal participant in the political process or let him into Kabul. The Pashtuns and Tajiks continued to keep the Uzbeks at the doorstep. This is, generally, typical of the politics of any country: No one wants to admit to the game a new player, to acknowledge for him the same rights even less. It was made known to Dostum, as it were: You are a powerful and robust fellow, just stay up there in the north and do not butt in here. But he wanted more. And this grievance is a reason why General Dostum's artillery has begun to speak in Kabul as of late. The processes occurring in Afghanistan, particularly in the north, long since ceased to be exclusively Afghan. The extensive involvement of Tajikistan here is obvious and not in question. But a tremendous place is occupied here also by Uzbek interests, which is, in fact, the main subject of this article. According to our source from the Russian special services, Islam Karimov and his circle almost immediately began to regard the northern zone of Afghanistan, which is populated by ethnic Uzbeks, as their own patrimony. Not as a piece of Uzbekistan, of course, but, at least, as a zone that lies in the sphere of their "vital interests." "Tashkent," he said, "immediately gambled on Dostum and has in the past 18 months to two years turned him, essentially, into Karimov's puppet. This is written about extremely infrequently even in intelligence material--it is too delicate a subject." Uzbekistan has picked up with enthusiasm the relay baton dropped by the Soviet Union and is attempting to do everything to take its place--in the region of interest to it, at least. Remember the rail bridge across the Amudarya, on one side of which is Uzbek Termez, on the other, the Afghan Khayraton, the headquarters of General Dostum. Earlier the Soviet Union fed almost all of Afghanistan via this artery; now it is being used by the Uzbeks. It is just that the freight traveling along it is intended exclusively for General Dostum. This fact is not paraded anywhere, we were told in confidence in the Foreign Ministry. This is being done in concealed and clandestine manner--so clandestinely that it is assumed that even the Russian General Consulate is unaware of this. What is actually crossing the Uzbek-Afghan border? Weapons, primarily. According to our contact in intelligence, Tashkent is providing fully for Dostum's small arms and ammunition requirements, driving armored equipment across the border.... Not, of course, on the scale and in the flow as was formerly the case from the Soviet Union, but it is more than enough for the northerners. In addition, aside from the weapons, Dostum is receiving from Uzbekistan wheat, sugar, petroleum products--everything without which he could not exist. This is partially being done on a noncompensable basis, partially--as far as the weapons are concerned--for hard currency. The Uzbeks take dollars from their ethnic brothers with pleasure--and the flow of weapons into Afghanistan is constant. Uzbekistan's positions in the camp of General Dostum today are very reminiscent of those that the Soviet Union once had in Kabul. Dostum is surrounded by Uzbek advisers, and constant contact is maintained at the top political leadership level and at the special services level. The Uzbek consul general is the No. 2 after Dostum himself, and he is the point of contact for the general's whole entourage. That is, there is total apical adhesion. On top of everything else, it is based on Tashkent's continuous direct bribery of Dostum and his circle. If just a year ago, even, some general of Dostum's drove around in a Volga, he was considered somebody. There are now in Dostum's retinue approximately 150 brand-new Rajero jeeps. Or, for example, Dostum drives to a meeting with an Uzbek leader somewhere closer to the border. Uzbek combat helicopters fly here--"to guard Comrade Dostum".... According to our contacts in the Foreign Ministry and intelligence, their colleagues coming from Afghanistan tell of literally incredible things--incredible from the viewpoint of any normal state. An Uzbek Government delegation goes to Mazar-e-Sharif to meet with General Dostum, say. It does not inquire about visas, does not register the border crossing--nothing! Helicopters simply fly in and set down, as if at home. And unless Kabul officials are given a "knock on the door" in time, they do not even find out about this--no one asks them about or tells them anything. Yet we are talking about the arrival of an official delegation at the ministerial and deputy ministerial level! What is this--de facto recognition of the existence of some virtually independent Uzbek state on the territory of Afghanistan? Whatever authorities are in place in Kabul, and however they are torn apart among themselves, it has been difficult for them, of course, to put up with such humiliation. This is why they have been attempting to lay hold of Dostum. For six months, longer, perhaps, Rabbani and his circle have been attempting to besiege Dostum if only somewhat and put him in his place. He was "rapped on the knuckles" when he attempted to expand the sphere of his influence and has sometimes even been forced out of the zones that he has traditionally controlled. Thus as a result of one such action, on 14 November Dostum lost his base of Sherkhan on the border with Tajikistan. "Speaking in confidence," a well-informed employee of Russia's Foreign Ministry notified us, "the Uzbeks even started to complain to us about this: Comrade Dostum--our supporter--they say, who is defending Russia's interests as well, is being squeezed by the damn Islamists. Earnestly trying to persuade us that Dostum is a conduit of our interests and a defender of the borders, they asked us to give him weapons (and he wanted a great many). But this trick did not work, fortunately. And 'damn Islamists' had absolutely nothing to do with it--it was an exclusively Afghan showdown: Kabul was putting the squeeze on the Uzbeks, who, from its viewpoint, had somewhat overstepped the mark." NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA experts were unanimous in surmising that the position of Dostum, autonomous and hostile toward all, has been programmed and continues to be programmed, by all accounts, by Karimov. After all, he who pays the piper calls the tune. Were it not for the powerful Uzbek influence, Dostum would, most likely, be behaving somewhat differently, and his relations with the central authorities would be organized more flexibly, at least. But under the pressure of the Uzbeks and relying constantly on their assistance, he has been able to permit himself such a line of behavior. What has happened today? There are two versions in this connection, and they are not mutually exclusive, what is more. First version. The aggrieved, dissatisfied general simply decided to bare his teeth. And he had teeth: Dostum's armed formations were in Kabul, even, controlling several important points. The second version is that it is Tashkent, possibly, which pushed Dostum into this war. Karimov is very unhappy at all the recent events--the results of Rabbani's visit to Dushanbe and the signs of fraternization of the Tajiks--ours and their Afghan counterparts--that have emerged. And so he decided via his protege to emphasize his interests, without, possibly, looking for anything in particular, what is more. "I believe," the intelligence expert told us, "that Karimov is sufficiently smart and understands that Dostum is not in a position to aspire to a seizure of power in Kabul, even technically. But this way he could make his presence felt. The Afghan Uzbeks are very simple people, and pushing them and inciting them to some serious actions is not difficult, therefore. So I do not rule out there having been direct pressure, direct prompting from Tashkent, here. Any assistance, any support was promised, and Dostum was told: Do as much as you can; they are victimizing you and hitting you on both cheeks.... You need to show them. Come on, boy, let us go into action." This is conjecture, of course, but it may be considered correct, because it is difficult to find a logical explanation for this entire business otherwise. One further factor that has to be taken into account when analyzing this mixed-up game of solitaire is the mutual relations and intermingling of interests of Tashkent and Dushanbe. As the Foreign Ministry specialist believes, Tashkent would not want to see the failure of the present Tajik regime, but nor at the same time is it interested in national reconciliation in Tajikistan. It is Karimov, by all accounts, who is pushing President Rakhimov toward the most radical, extreme position in the struggle against his adversaries. In analysts' opinion, he would like a solution of the Tajik problem on his, Uzbek terms, even hoping, perhaps, for the disintegration of Tajikistan and the annexation of some Tajik territories--disputed oblasts with mixed population--to Uzbekistan. On the other hand, Tajikistan cannot today be regarded as a serious rival in the Afghan game. Essentially, Tajikistan itself barely still exists in practice: There is no authority, the government is incredibly weak, the economy is not working, levers of administration are lacking, and there are no effective special services or armed forces. Tajikistan is not currently a working proposition. It is for this reason fully dependent on Russia, and Karimov is constantly reproaching the president of Tajikistan for this dependence, incidentally, failing to understand that the latter simply cannot act otherwise. Uzbekistan itself is already pursuing its own national policy, exaggeratedly national, what is more. It is literally supplanting Russia on the southern flanks, saying, as it were: This is our border, this is our zone of responsibility, these are our interests, there is nothing for you to do here. The same thing is constantly being drilled into the Afghans, Dostum included. This entire situation prompts very serious reflection. Several years ago, when the fratricidal Afghan strife erupted, many people got a headache: Now, they said, Islamic fundamentalism will spill across the border and flow over Soviet territory, engulfing our republics. Life turned out differently. Now, it would seem, the Central Asian republics of the former USSR could be a center of problems. It is from there that the blast waves of hard-core nationalism and separatism will come. And this is being manifested today even in the game that is being played around Afghanistan: The events occurring there are dictated to a tremendous extent by the Central Asia factor. The creation and formation of Central Asian states could prove more frightening than Islamic fundamentalism. They are artificial and never existed on the map within their present borders, in their present form, in their present shapes. Within the framework of the Soviet Union, they were not normal, full-fledged states either: Tied by an umbilical cord to Moscow, they were nursed and fed from there and controlled from there. And now a process of their national-state formation, which simply cannot be painless, is under way. It will certainly be fraught with incredible excesses, which we can partially see today, even. It is perfectly possible that unless other powers, Russia included, succeed in bringing this process under some prudent control, we will acquire an immense zone of regional crisis called Central Asia--a long and painful crisis that could bring about a total recarving of the borders and colossal human and other casualties. This would be a Transcaucasus squared. Signs of this gathering storm are in evidence. Will it be averted? This will depend on many things, on Russia included. In the opinion of Foreign Ministry experts, Russia's eastern policy needs, generally, to be devised from scratch, because the old one has failed, and there is no new one as yet. Nor, furthermore, should it be as rectilinear as yesterday or as amorphous as today. The political course in respect to this region should be as flexible, subtle, and multifaceted as possible. Especially since no one in Afghanistan any longer views Russia as an enemy, and all, including the most odious personalities, are prepared to cooperate with it today.
