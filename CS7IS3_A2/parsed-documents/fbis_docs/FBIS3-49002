"Japan, which is now a major power, has to cooperate with European countries, with the United States, Canada and the other governments which are already deeply involved in restoring peace here in ex-Yugoslavia," Akashi said during a press conference. "If Europeans are in Asia, why shouldn't Asians be in Europe," he said refering to UN peacekeeping troops deployed in Cambodia. Akashi, 62, in his new assignment becomes the special UN representative in the former Yugoslavia and head of the UN Protection Force deployed in the region. He replaces Thorvald Stoltenberg who will retain his position as co-chairman of the Geneva peace talks on the Bosnian conflict. Akashi previously headed the UN force deployed in Cambodia. Akashi later announced that a team of Japanese Government experts would soon arrive in former Yugoslavia to study how Tokyo could "extend its cooperation in order to help restore peace" to the region. He also said he was planning to reorganize some sections of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces], introducing elements which he had personally selected. He said he saw his role as helping to reestablish confidence between the three warring factions.
