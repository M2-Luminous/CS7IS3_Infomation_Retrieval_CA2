FR940720-2-00085 FR940720-2-00068 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications by increasing the minimum reactor coolant system temperature required for criticality from 500 degrees Fahrenheit to 530 degrees Fahrenheit. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The proposed change does not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of accidents previously evaluated. The probability for an accident is independent of the changes being proposed. Reactor criticality at 530 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the nominal no-load T avg of 547 degrees Fahrenheit does not affect any of the accident initiators in the analyses, but does change one of the initial conditions assumed in the Safety Analysis. However, the change in initial conditions from the nominal no-load temperature of 547 degrees Fahrenheit to 530 degrees Fahrenheit does not increase the probability of any of the events considered in the Safety Analysis. The proposed Minimum Temperature for Criticality specification (530 degrees Fahrenheit) will be more restrictive than the current specification which allows reactor criticality at a temperature as low as 500 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the Action Statement will require operator response to place the reactor in a subcritical condition (Mode 3) with 15 minutes should the temperature drop below the limit for greater than a specified amount of time (15 minutes). Likewise, the proposed change does not significantly increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. In the reanalysis of the Zero Power accidents (Rod Withdrawal From Subcritical, Rod Ejection, Main Steamline Break, Boron Dilution During Startup, and Feedwater Malfunction) from an initial condition of 530 degrees Fahrenheit, it was concluded that the results and conclusions in the current Safety Analysis remain valid based on the fact that the current analysis results are conservative and bounding for reactor criticality at 530 degrees Fahrenheit. The LOCA transient analyses are unaffected by the proposed change since they are initiated from the limiting condition of 102 percent. Since the full power T avg value is unchanged by this proposed amendment, the LOCA analyses are unaffected. The proposed change will ensure that plant parameters are within their analyzed ranges prior to reactor criticality and appropriate operator actions are taken should the temperature drop below the temperature limit after reaching criticality. The proposed administrative changes delete requirements which are no longer applicable and will have no affect on the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated in the analyses. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The change does not involve the addition of any new or different type of equipment, nor does it involve the operation of equipment required for safe operation of the facility in a manner different from those addressed in the Final Safety Analysis Report. The proposed change will ensure that plant parameters are within their analyzed ranges prior to reactor criticality. The proposed administrative changes delete requirements which are no longer applicable and will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change does not affect any safety related system or component operation or operability, instrument operation, or safety system setpoints, and does not result in increased severity of any of the accidents considered in the analysis. Operator response to a drop in temperature after reaching criticality for a specified period of time (greater than 15 minutes) will place the reactor in a subcritical condition which is inherently more stable than when critical below the Point of Adding Heat. The proposed administrative changes are being made to clarify Technical Specifications with no change of intent. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In conclusion, based on the previous considerations, Commonwealth Edison Company believes that the activities associated with this Technical Specification amendment request satisfy the Significant Hazards Consideration standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) and, accordingly, a finding that this Technical Specification amendment does not represent a Significant Hazards Consideration is justified. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Waukegan Public Library, 128 N.

Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications by removing the containment recirculation sump level instrumentation. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. This change does not affect the initiators or precursors of any accident previously evaluated. This change will not increase the likelihood that a transient initiating event will occur because transients are initiated by equipment malfunction and/or catastrophic system failure. Since the proposed change does not involve the introduction of new or redesigned plant equipment, failure mechanisms are not impacted. As a result, the probability of occurrence of accidents previously evaluated is not increased. The consequences of accidents previously evaluated are not increased. Removal of [containment recirculation sump level] CRSL instrumentation requirements from Technical Specifications does not affect the ability to mitigate the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. The CRSL instrumentation is used to verify that [residual heat removal] RHR pumps have adequate [net positive suction head] NPSH to operate in the recirculation mode following a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). As stated in the Zion Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR), the changeover from the injection mode to the recirculation mode of emergency core cooling is initiated when the low level alarm on the RWST annunciates. This occurs when the RWST level drops to 13 ’-7 ’ ’ (145,600 gallons). At this point, sufficient water has been delivered to the containment, from the Containment Spray (CS) system and, by Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) injection, through the [reactor coolant system] RCS break, to provide at least one foot of water above the containment floor. One foot of water above the containment floor provides sufficient volume to sustain the required NPSH of the RHR pumps in the recirculation mode of operation. The water level in the Containment Building during the recirculation phase will be approximately 5 feet above the floor elevation (568 ’) based on the volume of the RCS, accumulators, and the minimum required volume of the RWST. Minimum RWST volume of 350,000 gallons is required by Technical Specification 3.8.1.F. In summary, RWST level instrumentation, which satisfies Regulatory Guide 1.97 qualification requirements for a Type A, Category 1 variable, provides the operator with the primary indication of the appropriate time to initiate switchover to the recirculation mode, as well as indication of adequate NPSH for the RHR pumps. Containment Water Level (wide range) instrumentation which is qualified as a Type B variable provides confirmatory indication of water level in containment. The proposed change does not affect the procedures controlling operation of equipment, or systems required to mitigate the accidents considered in the UFSAR. As such, there will be no significant increase in the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposed change does not involve the addition of any new or different types of equipment, nor does it involve the operation of equipment required for safe operation of the facility in a manner different from those addressed in the UFSAR. No safety related equipment or function will be altered as a result of this proposed change. Because no new failure modes are introduced, the proposed amendment does not create a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed in the UFSAR. Also, the methods of recovery from accidents described in the UFSAR are not affected. Based on the above discussion, the proposed amendment does not create a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed in the UFSAR. 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. No design margins are impacted and the newly chosen primary indicator (RWST level) is both consistent with plant emergency procedures and appropriately qualified. The proposed change will not adversely impact the peak clad temperature, amount of fuel damage, or offsite dose projected to occur from the design basis accidents. Thus, the margin of safety is not diminished. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Waukegan Public Library, 128 N.
