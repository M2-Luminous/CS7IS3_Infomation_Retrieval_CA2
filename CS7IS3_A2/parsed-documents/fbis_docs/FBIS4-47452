The metabolism of tetrachloromethane occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocytes was accompanied by the formation of free radicals inducing lipid peroxidation and subsequent development of hepatosis-hepatitis. The rats were injected with normase in 1-ml doses once daily for 3 days. The intensity of free-radical oxidation was determined by the concentration of malonic dialdehyde [MDA] in their liver tissue, brain, and erythrocyte membranes. The data were subjected to standard analysis of variance methods and Student's t-test. As expected, tetrachloromethane induced significant accumulation of MDA in the substrates studied: The induced level in liver homogenate exceeded the starting levels by 116 percent, that in the animals' brain tissue exceeded the starting level by 59 percent, and that in their erythrocytes exceeded the starting levels by 93 percent. The concentration of SH groups in the said tissues decreased by 33, 34, and 38 percent, respectively. Normase was not found to have any direct effect on the mechanism of primary liver injury. It did not change the activity of free-radical oxidation in hepatic tissue; however, it did facilitate normalization of the parameters of lipid peroxidation in the membranes of the study animals' erythrocytes and in their brain tissue.
