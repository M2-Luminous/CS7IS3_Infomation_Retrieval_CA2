Al-'Attas' visit to Cairo is part of a tour he is making of a number of Arab countries. In an arrival statement, al-'Attas said that his visit is part of the consultations with Egypt over the ongoing war in Yemen following the Security Council's resolution in this regard. He added: Sanaa is continuing the war and we are continuing our consultations with the officials in Egypt, the fraternal Arab countries, and the international community to adopt the necessary measures to end this war and begin negotiations and dialogue between the Yemeni north and the south to tackle the various aspects of the situation. He added: We are in need of medical supplies and medicines, because many people are sick and wounded. He noted that many of those are receiving treatment in hospitals in Egypt and other sister countries. Asked about the continued fighting in Yemen, al-'Attas said that the Democratic Republic of Yemen has declared its clear-cut and explicit commitment to the Security Council resolution, but Sanaa, unfortunately, is still procrastinating in this matter, has not made a clear or definite decision, and in the past few days launched attacks against vital installations, oil refineries, and electricity facilities. He pointed out that these inhumane actions will destroy Yemen's infrastructure. Al-'Attas concluded his remarks by saying that he made certain today that both Iraq and Jordan are supplying Sanaa with weapons and spare parts, as he put it.
