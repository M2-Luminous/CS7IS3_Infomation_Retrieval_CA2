The text, which still can be amended, recommends extending the oil and military embargo to all fields of activity, except humanitarian aid. The embargo should also apply to all noncommercial flights from or to Haiti; this actually applies to small aircraft involved in all kinds of trafficking -- mainly drug -- linked with Haiti. France suggests that these measures be enforced on 31 January at 11:59 [time zone not specified].
