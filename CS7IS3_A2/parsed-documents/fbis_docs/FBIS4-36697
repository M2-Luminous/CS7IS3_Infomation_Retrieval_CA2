Several committees have been set up in various offices to follow up this issue. On this subject, Palestinian Authority member Dr. Samir Ghawshah says: [Ghawshah] We are preparing all necessary steps now for leaving for the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. A number of the revolution's cadres are preparing themselves. A large number of security men and policemen who were in Tunisia have left for Gaza and Jericho. We hope that these preparations can be completed as soon as possible and before the end of this month at most. [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, have all buildings used by the PLO leadership in Tunis been handed back to their owners? [Ghawshah] What happened was that certain buildings and certain administrative offices that were used by the security and police forces were decided to be handed over to their owners before 15 June. [Mu'addi] Will all offices of the Palestinian leadership be moved to the self-rule area, or will some offices remain in Tunis? [Ghawshah] Most of these offices will be moved, but some offices will remain, especially the Political Department, which, according to the agreement, will play its role in following up political contacts and foreign relations. [Mu'addi] There are reports saying that 'Arafat's office and his residence will remain at his disposal at present. Does this mean that his permanent place of residence will remain in Tunis? [Ghawshah] I do not think so. On the contrary, his place of residence will be in the Palestinian territories, and mainly between Gaza and Jericho, but this does not counter the fact that brother Yasir 'Arafat has a number of headquarters in a number of Arab countries, one of which will be in Tunis. [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, what about the arrival of Palestinian Authority members in the self-rule area? There are conflicting reports about this subject. [Ghawshah] As I said, we hope that this will take place soon, and that preparations be made as soon as possible so that the Palestinian Authority will carry out its role in all fields, in a manner that serves the causes of our people. [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, what about appointing the rest of the Palestinian Authority members? [Ghawshah] Contacts and consultations are still going on. We hope that the rest of Palestinian Authority members will be appointed when the authority arrives in the homeland.
