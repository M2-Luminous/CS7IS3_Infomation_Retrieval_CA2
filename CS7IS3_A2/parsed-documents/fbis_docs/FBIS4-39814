According to Grachev, the bases in Gyumri and Yerevan will be formed before 1 August. The minister expressed satisfaction with his trip to Yerevan and said that all military problems scheduled for discussion were solved and approved by the leadership of Armenia. Armenian Defence Minister Serzh Sargsyan told ITAR-TASS he was pleased with the results of Minister Grachev's visit, which he described as "a very important and serious visit, the main results of which will be the deployment of Russian military bases in Armenia, the strengthening of the Republic's air defenses and the reinforcement of the Russian troops deployed here." Russian Ambassador to Armenia Vladimir Stupishin said General Grachev's visit to Yerevan was an important political landmark. "It was very important from the viewpoint of strengthening our allied relations with Armenia both in the frame of the treaty of collective security of the Commonwealth of Independent States and on a bilateral basis," he said. In Tbilisi, the Russian defence minister was welcomed by Prime Minister Otar Patsatsiya, Parliament Vice-Speaker Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, members of the Georgian Government and the commander of the Russian troops in the Caucasus, Colonel-General Fedor Reut. A guard of honour was mustered on the tarmac and a military band played the anthems of the two countries. The motorcade then sped from the airport to the building of the Cabinet of Ministers, where a meeting has begun between the Russian defence minister and Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze. The conversation deals with the timetable and a mechanism of introducing CIS peacekeepers, including a Russian contingent to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. On Friday afternoon, Minister Grachev is due to fly to Gudauta for analogous coordination of actions with the Abkhaz side. The Russian defence minister is expected to return to Tbilisi on Friday evening and meet the generals and officers of the Russian troops stationed in the Transcaucasus on Saturday.
