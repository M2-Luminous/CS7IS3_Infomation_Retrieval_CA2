FBIS4-5067 "dreas067_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 North Korea Radio Reports on Speech Radio Reports on Speech SK0604105394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0611 GMT 6 Apr 94 SK0604105394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0611 GMT 6 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Report on the speech by Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK Administration Council and Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) deputy, entitled "On Successfully Fulfilling the Tasks of Socialist Economic Construction in the Period of Adjustment (wanchunggi) Set Forth by the Workers Party of Korea" delivered at the opening of the seventh session of the ninth SPA held at Mansudae Assembly Hall on the morning of 6 April] [Text] [Begin Kan Song-san recording] Comrade deputies: At a time when all the working people are vigorously accelerating the general march of socialism under the wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong], upholding the revolutionary banner of the chuche idea, today we are to discuss the matter of successfully fulfilling the tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment set forth by the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] at this SPA session. The 21st plenary session of the Sixth WPK Central Committee held last December summed up the status of the fulfillment of the Third Seven-Year Plan and set an adjustment period of three years and presented an economic strategy based on the scientific analysis of today's situation and the present state of our country's socialist economic construction. Effecting a turn in socialist economic construction by thoroughly implementing the revolutionary economic strategy set forth by the party is the most important revolutionary task facing us today. Solemnly pledging before the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, president of the DPRK, to fulfill the strategic goal set forth by our party by thoroughly implementing the revolutionary economic strategy at any cost, I am going to present to this SPA session measures to successfully fulfill the tasks in the period of adjustment of socialist economic construction. Comrade deputies: Successfully fulfilling the tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment set forth by the 21st plenary session of the sixth WPK Central Committee is of very important significance in the struggle to strengthen the might of the fatherland of chuche and to further add luster to the popular masses-centered socialism of our own style. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In socialist economic construction, we should set the upcoming three years as a period of adjustment as decided at the 21st plenary session of the sixth party Central Committee and should thoroughly implement the agriculture-first, light-industry-first, and trade-first policies during this period. Along with this, we should give priority to the coal industry, the electric power industry, and railway transport, which are the leading sectors of the national economy, and should continue to develop the metal industry. The task of the period of adjustment of socialist economic construction is to thoroughly implement the agriculture-first policy, the light-industry-first policy, the trade-first policy; to firmly give priority to the coal industry, the electric power industry, and railway transport--which are the leading sectors of the national economy--and to continue developing the metal industry. This is an economic strategy to rebuild [kaejo] the economic structure of the country in conformity with the changed international circumstances and the present demands of our national economy, and to bring about a change in the direction of foreign trade [taewoe muyogeso panghyang chonhwanul halte taehan]. The basic objective of the economic strategy set forth by the party is to rapidly improve the people's livelihood by concentrating efforts on developing agriculture, light-industry, and trade in two to three years to come; to regularize production in all sectors by giving priority to the leading sectors of the national economy; and, thus, to fully enhance the might of the existing economic foundation. That our party has set forth the adjustment period of three years and has determined its economic strategy is a wise step which makes it possible to deepen and develop our socialist construction to a new, high stage while consolidating the successes registered in the fulfillment of the Third Seven-Year Plan. [applause] The party's revolutionary economic strategy is a most just-our-style economic strategy which totally corresponds to the basic interest of our revolution and construction and which precisely reflects the aspiration and desire of our people. The revolutionary economic strategy, which should be implemented during the period of adjustment of socialist economic construction, reflects our party's firm decision and will to epochally upgrade the people's living standard within the near future and to develop our economy into an economy that has strong independence and does not waver under any circumstances and which can survive on its own strength. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is a most just economic construction plan which enables us to drastically enhance the people's living standard in compliance with the demand of socialism. [applause] It is a supreme principle in our party's activities and a consistent policy of the republic's government to constantly upgrade the people's living standard. Thanks to the wise leadership of the party and the leader and to the popular policies of the republic's government, today our people are enjoying a happy life without any worries and anxiety with all conditions of life such as food, clothes, and spending being ensured by the state and society. When the revolutionary economic strategy put forward by our party is embodied, a new turning point will be effected in agriculture, light-industry, and foreign trade; and the long-cherished desire of all people to eat rice with meat soup, wear silk clothes, and live in a tile-roofed house will be brilliantly realized within the near future. At the same time, the people's material and cultural life will become more abundant and plentiful [touk yuntaekhago pungjokhata] according to the nature of socialist society. The revolutionary economic strategy of our party is a just plan which enables us to further strengthen the self-reliance of socialist economy in our country and to firmly consolidate the nation's economic foundation. [applause] Socialism was frustrated in many countries and capitalism was restored in recent years. By taking advantage of this, the maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries to isolate, suffocate, and crush our republic, have been intensified more than ever before. Under such an acute situation and changed international circumstances, it is an important issue related to the future of the socialist cause to strengthen the independence and self-reliance of our economy in every way. Only when we consolidate the foundation of the nation's self-reliant economy and strengthen its independence can we survive with our own strength without wavering under any economic blockade maneuvers of the imperialists. Thus, we can victoriously advance the popular mass-centered socialist cause of our own style. When we effect a new turning point in the development of agriculture, light-industry, and trade by thoroughly carrying to accomplishment the party's revolutionary economic strategy, and when we continually develop the metal industry by giving priority to precedent domains of the national economy, the sectional structure [pubun kujo] of the economy will be further perfected and its self-reliance and might will be remarkably strengthened. Our party's economic strategy is a just policy which enables us to successfully implement the basic line of economic construction in compliance with the prevailing situation and the development of realities. From the outset, developing heavy industry with priority has not been aimed at developing heavy industry itself, but has been aimed at developing light-industry and agriculture rapidly through the attainment of speedy, expanded reproduction. At the same time, state management has been aimed at enhancing the people's living standard systematically. [wollae, chunggongobul usonchoguro palchon sikinungosun, ku chachee mokchogi innungosi anira, hwakttae chaesangsanui nopun sokttorul pojanghayo, kyonggongopkwa nongobul ppalli palchon sikigi wihangosimyo, kugyongun inmin saenghwarul chegyejoguro nopigi wihangosimnida]. Truly, the revolutionary economic strategy which our party put forth firmly ensures a new great upswing in our country's socialist economic construction and promises a more rewarding future for our people's lives. [applause] That our party set aside the period of adjustment for socialist economic construction and put forth a revolutionary economic strategy for this period was another important event in our country's socialist economic construction. At the same time, it was a revolutionary step that enables a firm prospect to be opened to positively cope with the prevailing situation and to attain a new high target of socialist construction. [applause] Our party's revolutionary measure is a banner of struggle that arouses all the people vigorously to a new struggle and heroic exploits, deals a hard blow to the imperialists and reactionaries who vilify and attack socialism, and gives great hope and faith in victory to the world's progressive people who are heading for socialism. [applause] We should successfully carry out the tasks for the period of adjustment of socialist economic construction with a great pride and self-respect in struggling with the revolutionary economic strategy under the leadership of the great leader and great party. The agriculture-first policy is the task of primary importance we should persistently keep up in the period of adjustment. [applause] We should thoroughly implement the agriculture-first policy and bring forth a great upturn in all areas of agricultural production, including the production of grain, meat, eggs, fruits, and vegetables, so that we can smoothly solve the problem of food for the people. In the historic letter to the national agricultural meeting "On the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Problem Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses," the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song clearly elucidated the tasks and methods to realize the industrialization and modernization of agriculture and to drastically increase the overall agricultural production, including grain. We should uphold the great leader's plan and intent and achieve a great upswing in all areas of agricultural production. Above all, we should solidify the successes attained in the irrigation and electrification that have been completed, and let their might be amply displayed. The irrigation facilities and equipment that have been built should be in good maintenance and repair. At the same time, we should actively introduce efficient irrigation methods, such as circular irrigation, vigorously push ahead with the technological modernization project aimed at converting the water-pumping and irrigation system into a multi-waterway watering system, and manage water scientifically and technologically so that our country's great circular irrigation system may be given full play. In conformity with the rapidly increasing machinery and power facilities for farming and the ever-improving standard of farmers' cultural life, we should build more power supply facilities and improve the power supply system so as to satisfactorily fill the rural area's demand for electricity. To further enhance the general mechanization and scientification standard of rural economy is an important task to solidify and modernize agriculture. We should boost the general mechanization and scientification standard of rural economy to free the farmers completely from hard and difficult labor, to continuously increase agricultural production, and to remove the gaps between industry and agriculture and between urban and rural areas. To continuously enhance the general mechanization standard of the rural economy, we should maximize the utility rate of the available farm machines. At the same time, during the period of adjustment, we should increase the production and supply of various farm machines, including the production and supply of 30,000 tractors and over 10,000 trucks, necessary to mechanize the difficult work requiring much manual labor. We should also smoothly solve the fuel problem for the rural economy. In conformity with the enhancement of the general mechanization standard of the rural economy, we should make the paddies and fields into large-scale standardized and mechanized fields. The chemicalization of the rural economy must be raised to a higher level. The fertilizer plants must be all the more well repaired, maintained, and modernized, and their productive capacity must be all the more created to sufficiently supply production conditions including electricity and coal so that various chemical fertilizers can be produced and supplied all the more. Also, micronutrient fertilizer including silica fertilizer, slightly burnt magnesia fertilizer, and boron fertilizer must be supplied in assortments. In addition, bio-fertilizer including the nitrogenous bacterial fertilizer and phosphate (?decomposite) fertilizer, and botanical growth accelerant must be produced more to send them to farms. Along with this, highly effective agricultural chemicals including spray chemicals, insecticide, and disinfectant must be smoothly produced and supplied. In accordance with raising the overall mechanization and chemicalization of the rural economy at a high level, the method of farming and the land cultivation system were developed. Therefore, in the future, work must be carried out so that one farmer can farm over 10-chongbo [1 chongbo = 2.45 acres] fields in accordance with the party's plan and will. Based on achievements accomplished in the modern biological field, the green revolution must be vigorously accelerated in the rural economy sector so that research and introduction can be carried out on high-grade strains of seeds, which are high-yielding, suitable to the climatic and soil conditions of our country, early-ripening, and resistant to storms, cold, moisture, blight, and harmful insects, including the first filial generations of rice and maize which can yield 12-15 tonnes per chongbo. An important reserve in increasing agricultural products lies in increasing the area of cultivated land. We must continue to vigorously push ahead with the tidal land reclamation project, and carry out the work to find new land through a mass movement to increase cultivated land and thoroughly protect it so that not even an inch of land is wasted. Also, cultivated land that is buried and washed away must be restored at the appropriate time. Based on the agricultural technological revolution and the scientific and technological results in agriculture, we must develop the chuche farming method, carry out farm work scientifically and technologically in accordance with it, and in particular, the planned area for sowing and the number of plants per pyong [1 pyong = 3.954 square yards] must be thoroughly supplied to increase the yield per chongbo of fields from an average of over eight tonnes to over 10 tonnes so that the goal of producing 15 million tonnes of grain can be carried out annually in the near future. [end recording] The speaker [pogoja] continued to point out that the area of orchards must be all the more increased and the fertility of soil enhanced so that fruit production during the period of adjustment can be increased by 30 percent. He said that the work in growing vegetables and basic fertilization management must be improved so that per chongbo yield can be increased considerably, and that the stock breeding industry must be further developed to increase meat production by over 30 percent so that the problem of meat can be solved smoothly. The speaker talked about putting great strength in fulfilling the policy that light industry is the best to all the more defend, reinforce, and modernize the light-industry plants during the period of adjustment, so that its potential can be sufficiently manifested to normalize production at a high level. Therefore, textile production must be increased by over 20 percent, shoe production by over 10 percent, and food processing industry must be all the more developed so that the people's dietary life can be all the more abundant and diversified. The speaker said that the consistent policy of our party and the republic's government is to actively investigate and mobilize local raw materials and sources and inner reserves of the plants and enterprises in production of people's consumer goods, so that they can be used effectively. He continued to say that the weight of the production of people's consumer goods through local raw material in the local industrial sector must be at a level over 70 percent, and export bases must be firmly maintained through the mass movement to actively find sources for export so that more foreign currency can be earned [suchul wonchonul chokkuk chajanaeo tomanun oehwarul poltaedaehaeso malhaetta]. The speaker talked about normalizing production at a high level at chemical plants and various plants and enterprises that supply raw material to light industry, so that production of synthetic fiber and synthetic resins including vinalon can be increased by 10 percent respectively during the period of adjustment. He also talked about smoothly producing and supplying various light industrial raw materials including paper, dyes, and basic chemical products. While talking about bringing about a new upsurge in foreign trade in accordance with the changing environment, Premier Kang said that the policy that trade is the best must be highly upheld in all sectors of the people's economy, expand and strengthen export goods production bases, and vigorously carry out the struggle to raise the quality of goods so that exports of goods can be increased decisively. The speaker said without promoting the leading sectors of the people's economy and developing the metal industry, the agriculture-first, light-industry-first, and trade-first policy cannot be implemented. He also said that during the period of adjustment, the production of coal and electricity and the volume of railway cargo transportation should be increased by over 1.3 times respectively, and the metal industry should be developed so that the increasing demand for steel material can be satisfactorily guaranteed. The speaker continued his speech: [Begin Kang recording] Comrade deputies, the tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment set forth by our party are historic and meaningful tasks of our people's struggle to complete the socialist cause. All the people should rise to carry out the rewarding tasks of struggle. [applause] In order to successfully implementing the tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment, we should, above all, properly and flawlessly carry out economic organizational work and economic management. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In order to successfully carry out socialist economic construction, economic guidance and work management should be ceaselessly improved. The question of successfully implementing the tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment depends on whether the State Administration Council [SAC] can fulfill its role or not. We should thoroughly implement the policy of strengthening the system in which the SAC is the center responsible for economic works set forth by the party so that the party's unitary leadership in economic works is firmly established. The SAC should implement the party's economic strategy and policy without fail, taking a position of being wholly responsible for each and every work of the party and the people. The responsible functionaries of the SAC will learn about strong discipline and order to flawlessly organize economic operations and organizational works for implementing economic strategy and the party's policy, promptly solve all the pending problems rising from the economic works in a revolutionary manner, strengthen hold on, guidance to, and control over all areas and units of economic works, including the committees and ministries, and the provincial administrative economic committees, and thoroughly execute the decisions and guidelines of the SAC. Highly displaying the creativity of every unit on the basis of firmly guaranteeing the country's unified guidance is one of the fundamental principles of socialist economic management. We should provide conditions for the committees and ministries, provinces, cities, counties, plants, and enterprises to highly display their creativity and should actively help them. In particular, we should produce more goods demanded in people's daily living by mobilizing local resources and reserves to the maximum in provinces, cities, and counties, and vigorously wage a struggle to secure resources internally instead of being reliant to the center. Improving the planning of works is one of the important demands of socialist economic construction and one of the fundamental conditions of successfully implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy. Economic guidance functionaries should properly coordinate economic balance under the principle of making everything obedient to implementing the economic strategy presented by the party, practically draw up the people's economic plan, and implement daily, monthly, quarterly, and indexical national plans without fail bearing a correct view and attitude that the reform of the people's economy is the party's order and the country's law. We should give priority in unconditionally guaranteeing electricity, coal, raw material, and equipment for agriculture, light industry, and external trade sectors by properly carrying out the material supply work, and should thoroughly guarantee material and equipment demanded by the leading sectors of the people's economy and the metal industry. All domains and units of the people's economy should actively help agriculture, light industry, and external trade sectors and vigorously carry out the people's support movement to these sectors. We should thoroughly implement the duty of the Taean work system, and maximize economic efficiency in production and management by pushing ahead with the management of labor, equipment, and material and by taking good care of economic assets. Under the party committee's collective guidance, we should also scientifically and reasonably manage and operate the economy so that the true superiority of the collective economic management and operation method is further displayed. In economic management, we should properly utilize economic leverages such as cost, price, and profit; correctly implement the independent accounting system; and intensify control by won [Korean monetary unit]. To successfully carry out the tasks for the period of adjustment in socialist economic construction, we should vigorously conduct the struggle to produce more and save more. One who produces more and saves more is the true loyalist and patriot today. All sectors and units should wage a vigorous struggle to produce more and save more as a mass movement, while efficiently carrying out the economy of the country in a position befitting masters, taking good care of the properties of the state and society, and effectively utilizing idle materials and waste materials. By so doing, they should increase production to the maximum degree with the available labor, facilities, and materials. The key to the produce-more and save-more strategy is to innovate technology in all sectors of the people's economy. We should go deep among the producing masses, actively arouse the producers' wisdom and creativity, and see to it that scientists and technicians exert their patriotic enthusiasm and talents so that they can come up with more valuable scientific and technological inventions, technologically innovative ideas, creative ideas, and rationalization ideas, so that they can be used effectively in production. We should set up scientific and technological measures to introduce in the production facilities and processes the technology of plasma and heat radiation and the method of compound (?burning material) and to effectively use low calorie coal, [choyoltan], low-grade coal [poroktan--"bony coal"], and meta-anthracite coal. We should make sure that methane gas and (?grass briquettes) [`choyontan' not `chomuyontan'] coal are used extensively in the provincial and rural areas. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is the strategy of self-reliance and fortitude. Self-reliance and fortitude is the resolute revolutionary spirit with which one is resolved to carry out the revolution and construction to the end with one's own strength. It is the indomitable struggle spirit to adhere to the revolutionary banner in the face of any obstacle and difficulty. As we have advanced up to today under the revolutionary banner of self- reliance and fortitude, so we must in the future as well complete the cause of socialism under this slogan. [applause] Self-reliance and creative (?participation) -- this should be the struggle ethos and work ethos of our functionaries. As we supported the front in the grim days of war by producing hand grenades with bare hands and effected the chollima upsurge from the empty lot after the war upholding the party by increasing steel production under the party's slogan "Let us vigorously accelerate the general onward march of socialism with the revolutionary spirit of self- reliance and fortitude," so we should thoroughly carry out the economic tasks for the period of adjustment. If we create something out of nothing and struggle with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, there will be nothing we cannot accomplish. Our functionaries should precisely fulfill the economic task entrusted to their sectors and units, producing what they need and making available what is short with an attitude and position befitting masters. By so doing, they should powerfully demonstrate once again the indomitable struggle spirit and heroic spirit of our people who advance under the banner of self-reliance. [applause] To successfully carry out the tasks for the period of adjustment under the grave situation where the imperialists and reactionaries are more viciously maneuvering to crush our republic, we should further strengthen the wholehearted unity of the revolutionary ranks. Wholehearted unity is an immortal, glorious tradition of our revolution and a banner of victory. To effect a new upsurge in socialist economic construction upholding the party's revolutionary economic strategy, we should, in the future as well as we have done in the past, vigorously advance under the banner of wholehearted unity. We must push through the grim situation countering it [chunomhan chongserul matppada ttulko nagaya hamyo] with the might of wholehearted unity, and crush [chitpusigo] the enemy's maneuvers with the might of wholehearted unity in order to carry out the tasks for the period of adjustment. All the functionaries and working people should arm themselves firmly with the chuche revolutionary outlook. Uniting more firmly around the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and our party, they must powerfully display the might of wholehearted unity of the chuche revolutionary rank in carrying out the tasks for the period of adjustment. [applause] Invincible is the might of the popular masses who have formed a solid socio-political living organism firmly united around the party center in terms of ideology, volition, morality, and fidelity and cherishing the greatness of the party and the leader as their absolute faith. [applause] We should become true loyalists and dutiful children who resolutely protect and defend the party and the leader in any adversity and invariably and loyally uphold the party's leadership. We should become the resolute advocator and thorough implementor of the party's policy with the firm faith and will as in the slogan "What the party decides, we will do," and the standard-bearers of struggle who unconditionally carry out the tasks for the period of adjustment in socialist economic construction. The economic tasks set for us for the period of adjustment are heavy and enormous, and in the course of implementing them, there can be difficulties and trials. However, as long as we have the tested leadership of the party Central Committee headed by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song, as long as we have the inexhaustible might of the popular masses wholeheartedly united around the party and the leader, and as long as we have the strong socialist economic base of self-reliance with the chuche industry as its backbone, there is no difficulty we cannot overcome, nor any fortress we cannot occupy. [applause] There is no force in the world that can block the way of our people who advance with redoubled courage and in high spirits. Next year, we will be greeting the 50th anniversary of national liberation and the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Workers Party of Korea. We must bring forth decisive progress in carrying out the economic tasks for the period of adjustment by effecting a new great revolutionary upsurge to brighten these significant anniversaries which are historically significant in the struggle of our party and people with high political enthusiasm and heroic exploits. The tasks for the period of adjustment in socialist economic construction are exceedingly rewarding and resplendent, and we are assured of victory. Let us all be firmly united around the party and the leader and wage a general onward march toward the new position to charge at in order to occupy a new higher hill of socialist construction under the banner of the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--with the spirit of chollima to which the speed of the nineties is added. [applause] [end recording]
