Developed from roadside markets and village fairs as early as the 1980s, the official said, the rural and urban farm products markets have played a vital part in promoting commodity trading across the province and the country over the past few years. He attributed 1993's surge in trade fairs and farm-products markets to an increasing investment in market building by the local government. He said that the investment in market construction in 1992 jumped to over one billion yuan, more than double that of a four-year period from 1988 to 1991. And at least 130 million yuan was added in 1993 to the previous year's total. Over the past two years, nearly 800 such new trade centers and markets have been built or rebuilt in the province, ranging from open markets to modern high-rise business centers to multi-function luxury hotels. A medicine trade center, called oriental, covering an area of 12 hectares with an investment of 140 million yuan, is expected to go into operation soon. Within the center, about 500 business buildings and a luxury hotel funded by a Hong Kong investor have been built. By the end of 1993, the number of various kinds of special markets reached 641, with a trade volume totalling 17.95 billion yuan, accounting for 57.7 percent of the amount for all trade centers. In Yongnian County, one vegetable trading center is able to handle 500 million kilograms of vegetables yearly, which are sold to more than 50 cities in 19 provinces and regions throughout the country, and partly to Japan and other Southeast Asian countries. The Lixian County Fur Center has a daily trading capacity of 200,000 fur pelts worth nearly 10 million yuan. In mid-March, a three-day national stock products trading fair was held in Lixian County, with a transaction volume of 1.08 billion yuan. More than 4,000 businessmen around the country and over 60 overseas tradesmen from eight countries and regions throughout the world, including the United States, Japan and Hong Kong, attended the fair.
