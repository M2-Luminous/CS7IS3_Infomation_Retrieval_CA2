FR940620-0-00100 FR940620-0-00029 Comment. In the proposed rule, the Board discussed tradition and the symbolic relationship of elements that pose unique design challenges peculiar to courtrooms. In its comment, the Design Guide Subcommittee of the U.S. Judicial Conference Committee on Space and Facilities (Design Guide Subcommittee) added that there are other factors involved, apart from symbolism, which give rise to the requirements for the distinctive design features of courtrooms: To understand properly courtroom design, and ultimately the design of any structure devoted to court facilities, it is essential to recognize that the judicial process in the United States courts is purposefully adversarial and confrontational. *␣*␣* It is the nature of controlled adversarial conduct used to find the truth that dictates much of courtroom design. The judge's pre-eminent physical position at trial, robed and on a raised bench in an imposing high-ceilinged room, distanced from the other participants, is, indeed, an aspect of symbolism. But these design features also are important types of visual cues which significantly reinforce and enhance the ability of the judge to deal effectively with the often emotional drama played out in federal and State courts. Real life dramas involving the lives, freedom, fortune, and fundamental rights of the litigants. The practical need for the visual identification of the judge's authority requires a deliberate use of space and scale for psychological impact. This psychological element is extremely critical. It is perhaps the major factor in aiding the judge to control the activities of trial participants and spectators in the courtroom. Response. The Board recognizes the symbolic and the psychological elements in the courtroom as well as the fundamental right of all citizens to participate equally in the legal process. The Board believes that accessibility can be incorporated into the design of the courtroom without adversely affecting the spatial, symbolic, or psychological relationship between the participants. Comment. Several organizations representing persons with vision impairments requested that the Board develop guidelines for lighting levels in public spaces. Other organizations representing persons with hearing impairments requested that the Board develop guidelines for acoustics. Response. The Board acknowledges that lighting and acoustics are important issues that affect the accessibility of all facilities, not just those covered in this section, for persons with hearing and vision impairments. Additional information is needed before the Board can consider establishing guidelines in these areas. 11.1␣Judicial, Legislative and Regulatory Facilities This section is a scoping provision which applies all the provisions of ADAAG 4 (Accessible Elements and Spaces: Scope and Technical Requirements) for buildings and facilities to judicial, legislative and regulatory facilities, in addition to the applicable requirements of this section. Comment. Few comments were received regarding this provision. One commenter noted the lack of requirements in section 11 for visible alarms. Another commenter noted the lack of requirements for counters for the filing of deeds, wills or other public documents. Response. This section is a scoping provision which applies all the provisions of ADAAG 4 (Accessible Elements and Spaces: Scope and Technical Requirements) for buildings and facilities to judicial, legislative, and regulatory facilities, in addition to the applicable requirements of this section. All public and common use areas would be subject to the applicable requirements contained in section 4 and examples of public and common use areas are given in appendix note A11.1. Accordingly, the scoping provisions for visible alarms contained in ADAAG 4.1.3(14) and the technical provisions contained in ADAAG 4.28 (Alarms) would apply. Likewise, the scoping and technical provisions for counters referenced in ADAAG 7.2 (Sales and Service Counters, Teller Windows, Information Counters) would apply. 11.2␣Courtrooms, Hearing Rooms, and Chambers ADAAG 11.2.1 requires that where doors or gates, jury boxes, witness stands, fixed seating, speakers' rostrums, raised daises, litigants', court reporters', and bailiffs' stations, and lecterns are provided, each must be accessible and on an accessible route complying with ADAAG 4.3 (Accessible Route). It allows judges' benches and clerks' stations to be either accessible or adaptable. This provision further requires that the accessible route to each element coincide with the circulation path provided for all persons using the elements. Comment. One commenter requested that the guidelines allow a witness with a disability to enter the witness stand from a restricted corridor outside the courtroom. Concern was raised that a jury, watching a witness with a disability wheel up a ramp within the courtroom, would not treat the witness in the same manner as a witness without a disability. Response. Since all witnesses enter the witness stand from the courtroom, it would be inappropriate to require a witness with a disability to access the witness stand from a restricted corridor. No changes were made to this provision. Comment. One commenter requested clarification on the requirement that all elements except judges' benches and clerks' stations be on an accessible route. Response. As stated above, ADAAG 11.2.1 requires that where doors or gates, jury boxes, witness stands, fixed seating, litigants', court reporters', and bailiffs' stations, lecterns, speakers' rostrums and raised daises are provided, each must be accessible and on an accessible route complying with ADAAG 4.3 (Accessible Route). ADAAG 11.2.1(4) allows fixed judges' benches and clerks' stations to be either accessible or adaptable. Language has been added at ADAAG 11.2.1 to clarify that fixed judges' benches, and clerks' stations are not required to be on an accessible route if those elements are designed to be adaptable. If those elements are designed to be adaptable, they are not required to be on an accessible route until they are modified at a later date. For example, in new construction, a judge's bench may be designed with appropriate maneuvering clearances so that a ramp can easily be provided at a later date. Therefore, the judge's bench is not required to be on an accessible route until the ramp is installed. 11.2.1(1)␣Doors or Gates This paragraph requires doors or gates designed to allow passage into the well of the courtroom, the witness stand, the jury box, and the speaker's rostrum and other areas to comply with ADAAG 4.13 (Doors). Few comments were received regarding this provision and no changes were made to this section. 11.2.1(2)␣Jury Boxes and Witness Stands This provision requires all jury boxes and witness stands to be accessible and provide an unobstructed turning space complying with ADAAG 4.2.3 (Wheelchair Turning Space). It further requires controls and operating mechanisms where provided for use by the witness or juror to be mounted at a maximum height of 48 inches and comply with 4.27.3 (Height) and 4.27.4 (Operation). It also contains an exception for alterations where it is technically infeasible to provide a fixed means of vertical access to the witness stand or jury box. Comment. The NPRM sought comment on whether maneuvering space should be required in the jury box, witness stand, judge's bench, clerk's station, speaker's rostrum, raised dais, bailiff's station and court reporter's station and the costs associated with such a requirement. The majority of commenters supported a requirement for maneuvering space in all areas. Included in these was the City of New York who submitted architectural plans designed by the New York Department of General Services showing how they have provided full accessibility in new construction. A few commenters felt the requirement for full maneuvering clearances was excessive. Other commenters supported a requirement for maneuvering space only in public areas (i.e., jury box, witness stand, litigant stations and spectator area) and providing an exception for work stations which would be covered under title I of the ADA. One architecture firm experienced in designing judicial facilities, thought that requiring maneuvering space would expand the well of the courtroom and result in reduced sight and hearing intelligibility of the participants. Response. As further discussed under 11.2.1(4), due to the complexity of courtroom and legislative chamber design and the difficulty of providing an accommodation which may require a structural change, requiring maneuvering clearances will significantly increase the accessibility and usability of the element and, in some cases, facilitate a reasonable accommodation for an employee in the future. The interim final rule contains a requirement for maneuvering clearances complying with ADAAG 4.2.3. The provision requires that the maneuvering space serve each area and allows either a 60 inch diameter turning radius or a 60 inch by 60 inch T-shaped space for a pivoting 180-degree turn. For example, maneuvering space for the witness box may be provided within the witness box or at a landing outside the witness box. Comment. The proposed rule required the wheelchair accessible space in a jury box or witness stand comply with ADAAG 4.33.2 (Size of Wheelchair Locations). One commenter questioned whether the 60 inch depth illustrated for a side approach to a wheelchair accessible space in an assembly area is appropriate to apply to the accessible space in a jury box.
