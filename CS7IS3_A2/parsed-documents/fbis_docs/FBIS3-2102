Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, emphasized at the conference the need to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, face up to challenges, maintain the good development trend of township enterprises, concentrate efforts to upgrade their quality and level to a new height, and make township enterprises, a new force, come to the fore for the second time. Attending the conference were Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and provincial governor; Li Chunting, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and provincial vice governor; Chen Jianguo, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and provincial vice governor; and responsible persons of pertinent provincial departments. Shandong's township enterprises continued to maintain the trend of robust development and created 482.5 billion yuan in output value last year. The industrial output value they created was 359.3 billion yuan, accounting for more than 60 percent of Shandong's total. Jiang Chunyun said: Shandong's township enterprises registered the fastest and best development rate last year. Compared with advanced provinces and municipalities, however, we still lag rather far behind in many aspects. We should remain clear-headed to note that the endeavor to accelerate establishment of the socialist market economy system not only provides a good opportunity and opens up a vast world for township enterprise development but also brings new challenges. All localities should continue to regard township enterprise development as the strategic priority of Shandong's economic development, add impetus to reform, and make township enterprises more vigorous in development. In the reform of township enterprises, we should greatly extend the shareholding system in compliance with the requirement for establishing the socialist market economy system; bring property right relations into better balance; achieve success in the merge and cooperation between the enterprises of different ownerships and trades; promote lease, merge, and auction; and do a good job in the organization and management of enterprise groups. In deepening the reform of township enterprises, we should put it in the most important place to emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and change ideas; embrace as soon as possible the new concepts and new ideas compatible with the socialist market economy; be brave in exploration and active in pioneering; and create a new advantage and new pattern of township enterprises by deepening reform. Jiang Chunyun emphasized: We should further clarify the guiding thought and truly shift the work focus of township enterprises to the improvement of economic efficiency. We should pay close attention to weak links to facilitate township enterprises' development of the export-oriented economy and the tertiary industry. We should further improve the investment climate, attract foreign funds, and develop the three types of foreign-funded enterprises. Geared to the world market, we should broaden our field of vision, make friends with others extensively, and bring in projects and capital from abroad. We should adopt preferential policies and feasible measures to encourage and guide more enterprises to establish plants and offices outside the country and outside the province in order to directly participate in the competition of the world and domestic markets.
