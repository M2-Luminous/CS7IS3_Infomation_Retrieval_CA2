In the course of extensive and open talks, the Serbian president's office reports, views were exchanged regarding the efforts to put an end to the civil war in the area of ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina and find a political solution to the crisis. They stressed that NATO's decision has undoubtedly inflicted political damage on the negotiating process for ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. Agreement was expressed to the effect that there is no alternative to political negotiations as the only sensible path that can lead to a stable peace in this area. In this context it was pointed out that reduced tensions in the Sarajevo area would represent a significant step toward securing a political solution, as this would avert the risk of foreign military intervention and an escalation of warfare with far-reaching consequences for peace and stability in this part of Europe.
