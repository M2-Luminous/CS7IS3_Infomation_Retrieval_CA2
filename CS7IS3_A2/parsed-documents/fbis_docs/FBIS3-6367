"The government cannot but express deep concern and regrets at the results that are due from North Korea's uncooperative actions," Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a statement, referring to the IAEA announcement in Vienna that its inspection activities in North Korea were restricted. The agency further said it could not verify that North Korea had not diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful purposes. "The government urges that the IAEA inspections of unfulfilled parts be carried out immediately without delay," Chang said. "We will watch closely the decision by the IAEA special board of governors meeting." Seoul also called on Pyongyang to be sincere in talks on exchanging envoys, voicing hope that the nuclear issue would be discussed substantively through the exchange. "The government reconfirms (there is) no change in its original stance that the IAEA inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities must conclude successfully and that the inter-Korean special envoy exchange for solution of the nuclear problem must be implemented before the third round of North Korea-U.S. dialogue," Chang said.
