Foundation Secretary-General Chiang Chih-chun said that personal safety is not the only factor to be considered in traveling to the mainland. He said that the public may have no way to file complaints if there is trouble because of the lack of agreement on travel safety and compensation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. He noted that the bureau of tourism and the Taipei Association of Travel Agents have published a list of "high risk" locations in the mainland and travelers should use the list as a reference. The travel agents lifted the self-imposed ban Wednesday [25 May] after losing more than NT [New Taiwan] $700 million (U.S.$26 million), the officials said. The ban was imposed in response to the March 31 robbery and murder of 24 Taiwan tourists in Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province. The association officials said that although the ban, imposed on May 1, was lifted, they did not expect group travel to the mainland to resume for a few months. The association warned travel agencies to avoid high-risk areas such as Qiandao Lake, Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province, Tibet and Jiouzaigou in Sichuan Province.
