No details were immediately available about how the siege of the plane ended, but unconfirmed reports said security forces stormed the plane. The hijackers seized the Airbus 300 earlier in the day and forced it to land here, where they freed all 159 passengers, leaving captive only the captain and co-pilot of the jet. The airline, called Saudia, said the plane was flying from Addis Ababa to Jeddah when it was hijacked. But an official at the control tower of Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta airport said it was flying from Jeddah to Addis Ababa. Airport sources said earlier that the plane was hijacked by three men who were demanding to go to Italy but the airline and the police would not confirm the report. A Saudi embassy official had said one of the three hijackers was a woman and that the trio were demanding the plane be refuelled to fly to London.
