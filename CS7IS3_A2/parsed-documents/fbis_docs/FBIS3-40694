The original draft which had incorporated the clause was dropped after being screened by a few party general secretaries. When the draft was put before the BJP national executive, many members stood up to press for the complete opposition to the proposed GATT treaty. The leaders who were in favour of the party adopting a "middle of the road" attitude over the Dunkel draft found themselves isolated and the majority opinion prevailed. Members argued that the party could not afford to take a wishy-washy attitude over the draft in view of the strong line adopted by other Opposition parties over the issue. A few voices which spoke in favour of advocating a partial opposition to the Dunkel proposals were heavily outnumbered. The final draft which was presented to the Press had been worked out by party general secretaries, Mr Pramod Mahajan, and Mr K.N. Govindacharya and the convenor of the BJP economic cell, Mr Jay Dubashi. The discussion on the Dunkel proposals could not be expanded to include other contentious issues regarding the party's stand on liberalisation, but many in the party who feel that swadeshi should be taken in a big way, welcomed the view of speakers calling for strong reaction to the Dunkel proposals. Leaders who have been known to have differences with swadeshi hawks who believe that foreign capital should be treated with extreme caution were conspicuously silent. The resolution on the Dunkel draft is the only concrete document that the party has adopted. The two other documents are in the nature of poll analysis. The party had previously limited its opposition to the Dunkel draft proposals dealing with agriculture, but has now announced its total rejection of the move to globalise trade and lower tariffs. The senior party leader, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, who addressed the Press today, denied that the party had belatedly woken up to the dangers of the Dunkel draft's proposals. "We have been speaking on the agriculture-related before and now that the government has failed to protect our interests, we have decided to take up the issue," he said. The resolution states that the government's acceptance to the officials-level agreement over the GATT treaty amounted to sacrificing the interests of the country. The day on which the agreement was signed would go down as a "Black Day" in the nation's history. The rich nations have used their economic muscle to ride roughshod over the interests of the poor nations and the proposed treaty would keep the Indian consumer at the receiving end of powerful multinational corporations, the resolution states. The Third World was once again facing the threat of a new type of colonial aggression, it emphasised. The resolution attacks the Union commerce minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, for having stated in Parliament that India had not been able to stand up to the pressures exerted by the US and the European union. While the South Korean Premier had tended in his resignation at being unable to protect the country's commitment not [to] allow rice imports, the P.V. Narasimha Rao government had virtually opened the entire economy. The statement also points out that the prices of food would rise and the buffer stock would be under threat. Giving an example, the resolution states that China has increased its exports manifold and enjoys a trade surplus. However, reports today said that China has accepted all GATT conditions needed for it to rejoin the negotiation process.
