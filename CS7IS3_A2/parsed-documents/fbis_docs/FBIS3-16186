The program sets the party's stance on the development of economy, education, culture, science and human rights but still lacks paragraphs on environmental protection and sports, said party Chairman Juris Bojars. The party endorses a 10-year residence qualification as essential for naturalization until Russia completes the withdrawal of its troops from Latvia and the demographic situation stabilizes. When the two conditions are fulfilled, the residence qualification could be reduced to five years. In economy, the party warns of excessive trading of Latvia's property and industrial potential to foreign entrepreneurs. In foreign politics, it will seek partners among the world's leftist parties.
