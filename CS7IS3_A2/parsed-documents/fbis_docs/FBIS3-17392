Anenkova; place and date not given: "The Lessons of History Are Always Costly"] [Text] [Anenkova] Leonid Ivanovich, you have been nominated candidate for deputy of the Supreme Council from the Communist Party of Crimea, which you head. The attitude toward the Communists among the electorate is, as far as we know, ambiguous: from unreserved solidarity to categorical rejection. Would it not have been safer, knowing the situation, to have run as an independent candidate? [Grach] What have I to hide? Yes, I am one of the few politicians who in the period since the putsch has not changed colors and who has not betrayed his ideals, for which I have endured incredible moral terror unleashed in the news media. Many of my former party associates were afraid even to visit me in the hospital, for fear of sullying their new, "democratic," reputation. More important to me, though, than any portfolios (I could have had as many as I wanted) is my reputation as a person. It was for this reason necessary to negotiate all the anathemas. Life, as the song goes, does not end tomorrow: It will sort everything out itself. The people very quickly sensed for themselves what life was like under the Communists and the sort of troubles they are swallowing under the so-called democrats. On the one hand it is unique, on the other, entirely natural, that at the time of the presidential elections the Communist Party underwent a kind of registration among the people and was reborn, considering all the objective and subjective realities and fabricated stereotypes of its dismal perception--this was a very good result. For this reason, today's recognition by thousands upon thousands of nonparty people is for me extraordinarily valuable and important. When people say that this is not a great number of votes, they sin against objectivity: It is sufficient to recall how the entire machinery of state--from the Supreme Soviet, Council of Ministers, and chairmen of the city and rayon soviets through enterprise managers--together with many political forces were literally bent on destroying me. No candidate was subjected to such pressure as Grach. The party absorbed the first assault in my person and after that test acquired, it should be noted, moral fortitude and stood up straight on its own two feet. Let us not deceive ourselves and admit honestly that the sole actual party that we have today is the Communist Party. It alone has a scientifically substantiated program of the building of a socially just society, experience of state administration, and a reserve of skilled managerial personnel, another school for the training of those we simply do not have. And, most importantly, our party slate includes authoritative, decent, highly professional people. Among these are Yu.I. Bogatikov, people's artist of the USSR; A.M. Kalinin, admiral and former commander of the Black Sea Fleet; A.M. Rasnitsov, hero of the Soviet Union; and many other representatives of various professions, cities and rayons, and nationalities. [Anenkova] What do you see as the solutions to the impasse, and why, in your opinion, have we for so long been wandering around in the dark? [Grach] First let us look at the state of prostration in which we have found ourselves. We have taken the past away from ourselves. We have not created a present. And we are not in a position to imagine the future, even in the form of a vision. Reform presupposes a change in the system of life and activity with the simultaneous reproduction of the actual framework-principle of this life. We are today instead experiencing a typical pseudo-morphosis, that is, a chimera. One of its most important signs is the "mystery" of the rules of the so-called "reform," more precisely, redistribution, of property, which is being undertaken on the sly, under the table. The mechanism of this operation is not being made public deliberately in order that it might be possible to concentrate all the benefits in the hands of the "reformers." According to the laws of the civilized world, if it does, indeed, resolve to divide itself into two classes--rich and healthy on the one hand and poor and sick on the other--three basic conditions are observed. First, national principles of the implementation of the reform--the "rules of the game" by which the new society shall be built--are announced; second, the equality of the "initial" rights of all categories of society in this "game," precluding any advantages, is recognized; and, third, labor efforts and sharpness of intellect ensuring competition are deemed to be the basis for stratification. In our situation, however, the powers that be are beyond competition: They want to get into both capitalism and paradise by pulling strings. Even the socialism-capitalism concepts, which are counterposed to one another like unambiguous antipodes, have not been conceptualized. Is there a way out of the gapping chasm? I am profoundly convinced--such that in my conviction I am like a fanatic, a zealous believer--that until we find a solution to the socioeconomic impasse, there is no nor will there be any way out. Paradise will never be built in Crimea by itself, inasmuch as there are laws of systemic order and interdependence which exist regardless of the wishes of politicians. I am sure that it will not be even six months before everyone is saying the same things as myself and that the restoration of a unified state based on common borders, customs, financial system, and monetary units will ultimately be the inevitable reality. A special historical role has been prepared for Crimea, however, in the unification process--the motivating factor of integration in an economic union with Russia, Ukraine, Belorusia [Belarus], and other republics. Such, in brief, are the strategic tasks. [Anenkova] Is it possible to mitigate the fate of the "poor and sick," as you put it, in emergency fashion? After all, while politicians are seeking their formulas, needy Crimeans are literally dying. [Grach] Stabilization of Crimeans' living standard within the framework of today's possibilities is the Communists' paramount task. We intend to seek to ensure that the Supreme Council pass a law on the creation of a state system of social protection of the populace in accordance with the principle of the controlled conformity of wages, pensions, and grants to the actual subsistence minimum. We will demand of the executive the implementation of specific measures aimed at combating unemployment and creating new jobs, introducing government subsidies fixing the price of bread and milk, and ensuring free health care and education, higher included, and the accessibility of children's establishments to each family and other social safeguards, which must be observed as the holy of holies. We feel particularly for the children, who have been deprived of the legitimate right of harmonious development: They have been thrown out onto the street and into basements and have been forced to criminally acquire the wherewithal to live. We are duty-bound to defend our women. We are in irredeemable debt to our old people, who as gratitude for lives given to the state, have been condemned to stand cap in hand at the church porch. [Anenkova] On what basis do you plan the restoration of Crimea's economy? [Grach] The economic basis should, in our opinion, be a multistructured economy with the retention of the leading role of public property and state regulation. It is state regulation that should ensure the extrication of the national economy from the severe economic crisis, and the multistructured economy is the way of achieving the social harmony that we so much need on the basis of a concurrence of interests of the broadest strata of society: from the worker and employee through the entrepreneur. For the purpose of stimulation of the producer of any form of property (private included), we will seek a fundamental change in financial policy in the direction of privileged taxation and lending with a simultaneous expansion of the tax and investment field, the establishment of government subsidies for agriculture, and the removal of the "price cutters" in respect to agricultural and industrial products and will contribute in every possible way to the development of both the kolkhozes and sovkhozes and tenant and private farms. [Anenkova] What is your attitude toward property? [Grach] Only those who are filling their pockets with dishonest money may fear the program of the Communists: We will conduct a relentless struggle against crime, corruption, and profiteering, creating all the conditions for the producer-proprietor to thrive. The sole area where private property is unacceptable is land, the basic wealth of Crimea, which must belong to all the people. Land may be leased, indefinitely included, and may be inherited, but may not be bought and sold. Otherwise, we would face the threat of becoming on our native peninsula not only "emigres" but also colonized slaves. There are already such trends on the territory of the former Union. [Anenkova] What kind of system of state administration would seem optimal to you? [Grach] We are for a broadening of the sovereignty of the soviets of all levels--as a guarantor of the strengthening of the state status of Crimea, excluding the possibility of the establishment of an authoritarian dictatorship. The optimum path of the solution of strategic questions of the republic's socioeconomic development could be, in our view, consultation with the people via referendum. And we are prepared upon entering the Supreme Council to offer the people, together with the government, a program, if national salvation is what you want. [Anenkova] Leonid Ivanovich, have there been in your life events, meetings, and achievements that have made a particular mark on your memory? [Grach] There have been a multitude of memorable meetings, of course: As a party official, I preferred to work among people and help them resolve their problems--people were always coming to my office, and not in vain, probably, confident that they would get a sympathetic reception. But there is in the sequence of events an achievement of which I am particularly proud: the referendum that revived in 1991 from Crimea Oblast the Republic of Crimea. Remember the Varfamaleyevka reprisal against the Meskhetian Turks and the tent compounds of the Crimean Tatars (refugees) pitched in Crimea? We formed a peacemaking delegation at that time and set off for the scene of the events in Uzbekistan. The tragedy that we saw there was impossible to contemplate with an easy heart: ashes in the place of yesterday's dwellings, faces contorted by horror and anger.... An Uzbek woman, the secretary of the rayon party committee, as I recall, gave shelter in her home to 100 terrified casualties and went out to meet the infuriated mob. In a yard near Fergana, I picked up from beneath my feet a note in a child's handwriting: A young girl had written in a letter to her brother in the Army that Papa and Mama were working and that all were alive and well and doing alright.... The night before, the whole family had been wiped out. This incident was, evidently, the last straw, scarring the heart and the memory. The lessons of history are always costly. And a person who cares more about his own health than about the fate of near ones and dear ones and about the fate of the motherland is hardly capable or deserving of being called a statesman.
