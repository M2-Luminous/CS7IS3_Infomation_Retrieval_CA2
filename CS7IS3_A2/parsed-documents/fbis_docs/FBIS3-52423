There are indications that in Cairo at the beginning of the new year the two sides will sign a more detailed agreement to implement the Declaration of Principles smoothly and without any new problems, allowing for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on the scheduled date of 13 April. Although the latest round of talks that opened in Cairo on 28 December is going be tough and bitter, it is clear that the two sides fully realize that they have no alternative but to resolve their differences as soon as possible, and to reach a compromise ending the growing frustration in the occupied territories and sparing the two sides a desperate confrontation where mutual violence escalates to a serious point risking the collapse of the Declaration of Principles. Rabin should have realized that he cannot, despite his rude bargains, reduce his agreement with the PLO to a limited administrative rule that firmly blocks Palestinian hopes for an independent state, and that he cannot distort the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho to a redeployment of the occupation forces in the two regions. [passage omitted] 'Arafat, for his part, should have realized that the Gaza-Jericho First declaration is nothing more than a limited partial agreement concerning the first stage of an autonomy that will be implemented in all the occupied territories for the next three years before an agreement on the final status of the West Bank and Gaza is reached. Consequently, there is no need for mixing positions and stages in a manner that adds to Rabin's difficulties as he faces an increasingly vicious internal Israeli opposition. In the face of Rabin's stubborn reading of the Declaration of Principles, 'Arafat tried to offer an alternative reading. But 'Arafat's reading was at the other extreme, so wide and loose that it went beyond the text of the Declaration of Principles, mixed the various stages of implementation, and made the Palestinian state one of the objectives of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. Both 'Arafat and Rabin should have put himself in the shoes of the other so that they could reach a balanced agreement. There are limits to what each can accept now in a tense climate, mutual obsessions, escalating violence, and growing opposition seeking to foil the agreement so that violence and tension can prevail. 'Arafat cannot possibly accept a nominal withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, no matter what Rabin's excuses and arguments about the security of Israel and its settlements. And Rabin cannot possibly now offer an implicit acceptance of an independent Palestinian state by agreeing to Palestinian border crossings, Palestinian national currency, or a Palestinian central bank. Accepting such points would mean more than an implicit recognition of the Palestinian state at an early stage that only offers autonomy in Gaza and Jericho first. [passage omitted]
