According to EL NACIONAL, the Venezuelan Army intelligence section detected a guerrilla column of no fewer than 50 men, allegedly from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), between Junin Municipality in Tachira State, some 600 km southwest of Caracas, and Norte de Santander Department in Colombia. Area residents confirmed the military report. EL NACIONAL, quoting reliable military sources, added that the presence of Colombian guerrillas was discovered during a joint operation by the Colombian and Venezuelan Armies, which led to the declaration of a state of maximum alert and the reinforcement of border posts. Likewise, the national press agency VENPRES quoted Venezuelan military sources as saying that some 10,000 Colombian guerrillas are reportedly on the border between the two countries. According to VENPRES, the rebels are responsible for the intense "theater of war" over the past seven months, which included an increase in kidnappings and cattle rustling incidents. Late last year five Venezuelan soldiers were killed in two explosive attacks attributed to the National Liberation Army of Colombia, which prompted angry reactions in Caracas. As for the Venezuelan National Guard helicopter crash yesterday in which two soldiers were injured, military spokesmen described the incident as "a strong reaction by the Colombian guerrillas to the active Venezuelan air and land patrols over the southwestern border of the country." Defense Ministry spokesmen, however, have not yet explained the real cause of the helicopter crash. Some police spokesmen say it was caused by a guerrilla attack, while Colombian authorities say excess weight caused the crash and that the shots were fired by the Venezuelan soldiers themselves.
