The Fijian government broke off diplomatic relations with India in 1989 after it accused Indian diplomatic staff of becoming involved in Fijian politics. "The government will seek to resume full diplomatic relations with India, and will invite the government of India to re-open its embassy in Fiji as soon as is practicable," Ratu Mara said. The president also announced that the government of Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, returned to power in general elections last month, would seek to regain Fiji's seat in the Commonwealth. "Fiji sincerely hopes that this can be achieved in the not too distant future," Ratu Mara said. Fiji's membership of the Commonwealth lapsed in 1987 after brigadier Rabuka, now prime minister, led two military coups against an ethnic Indian-dominated government and declared Fiji a republic. The Indian government has said it would block a Fijian application for membership unless the country changed its constitution, which favours ethnic Fijians. Under the 1990 constitution, ethnic Indians are restricted to 27 seats in the 70-seat House of Representatives and are barred from holding the prime ministership. Ratu Mara said the government considered a review of the constitution to be a priority. "Government will move quickly to reconvene the expanded cabinet subcommittee on the constitution so as to resume consultations on the next phase in the review process," he told parliament. The review would seek agreement on the composition and membership of an independent commission to undertake a review. The constitution provided for a review within seven years. "History has created for us a society from which we cannot run away, but it is our responsibility as leaders to build upon this inheritance and create a viable and vibrant nation of which we can all be proud," Ratu Mara said. A Ministry of Information spokesman said diplomatic ties with India were originally broken off because "they were seen to be meddling in our political affairs and were told to go, but they are now welcome to come back.
