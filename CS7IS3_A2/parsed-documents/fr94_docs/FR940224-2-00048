FR940224-2-00048 FR940224-2-00028 [Docket No. RP93&hyph;204&hyph;004] Texas Eastern Transmission Corp.; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff February 17, 1994. Take notice that on February 14, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, the tariff sheets listed on appendix A of the filing. Texas Eastern states that on December 30, 1993, Texas Eastern filed certain tariff sheets: (1) Pursuant to ordering paragraph (C) of the Commission's order issued October 29, 1993, in Docket No. RP93&hyph;204&hyph;000, to implement a small customer mitigation methodology, and (2) to flow through a rate refund received from Columbia Gulf Transmission Company. These tariff sheets reflected a proposed effective date of October 31, 1993. By Commission order issued January 28, 1994, (January 28 Order) such tariff sheets were accepted and suspended to be effective January 1, 1994, subject to Texas Eastern refiling the sheets to revise the billing amounts prospectively, for the remainder of the amortization period, so as to adjust for the differences between the new allocations and the amounts already billed to customers. Texas Eastern states that pursuant to and in compliance with the January 28 Order, Texas Eastern is refiling the tariff sheets listed on appendix A of the filing. In the December 30, 1993, filings, Texas Eastern states it contemplated a twelve (12) month amortization period for these billing amounts beginning October 31, 1993. Texas Eastern has already billed its customers for the months of November 1993, December 1993 and January 1994 according to First Revised Sheet Nos. 165, 166 and 167. As a result, the tariff sheets listed on appendix A which are effective January 1, 1994, show that the Account No. 858 Stranded Cost Direct Bill commences on January 31, 1994, because January 31, 1994, is the first day of the next unbilled amortization period (February 1994). Texas Eastern states that this is purely an administrative matter resulting from the billing process and will not affect amounts previously billed for the months of November 1993, December 1993 and January 1994. Attachment A of the filing illustrates the calculation of the new principal amount by customer for the remaining nine (9) month amortization period in accordance with the January 28 Order. The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets listed on appendix A of the filing is January 1, 1994. Texas Eastern states that copies of the filing were served on Texas Eastern's jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before February 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
