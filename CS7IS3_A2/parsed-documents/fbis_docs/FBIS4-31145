[passage omitted] The Swiss paper's forecast attracts attention since the current revival of Krajina-Italian relations ensued after a lull that was preceded by a case of open lobbying on the part of Italian senator Arduino Agnelli, favoring general Serbian interests on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. At the end of last September, Senator Agnelli attended a session of the assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and the Assembly proclaimed him an "honorary citizen of the RSK." At that time, the Krajina authorities suggested to Agnelli that he support Knin's initiative for Italians to mediate in solving disputes between Krajina and Croatia, and he promised to provide "good services." "I hope that we will march into a liberated Zadar together. The Croats do not deserve to have such a lovely town," Martic thanked Agnelli. [passage omitted] The announcements of a rapprochement between Italy and Krajina, if only in individual statements by more influential politicians, were followed by the phenomenon whereby the Italian question in Istria and Dalmatia became more topical. The Osimo agreement issue reemerged despite statements by some Italian parties and officials that these documents had become part of history for good. The question is, of course, whether the Italians care so much about the status of Serbs in Krajina so that they would call into question their relations with their most important seacoast neighbor or whether they have also realized that Krajina is a favorable "political medium" through which one can articulate certain political interests more efficiently. This dilemma becomes completely superfluous if one keeps in mind Italy's latest actions, which are aimed at hampering Croatian (and Slovene) admission to the European Union and include the Krajina card as part of the game. By losing aggressive German support and with its general rating in the world falling, Croatia, analysts of international relations assess, has not only become "softer" regarding the possibility of Italy realizing a dominant position in the region of the Adriatic, but also a gratifying "issue" that Italy can use in order to more efficiently enter international games of solving the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. As far as Krajina is concerned, its interest is mainly exhausted at a diplomatic-psychological level and therefore the attempt at creating a political Knin-Rome axis, although it is a good diplomatic move, cannot have long-term effects. Over the long-term, Krajina's position still depends on the Zagreb-Belgrade axis.
