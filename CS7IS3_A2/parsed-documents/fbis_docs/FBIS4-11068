FBIS4-11068 "drlat077_t_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-077 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 Venezuela Minister Assures Stability, Trust in Government Minister Assures Stability, Trust in Government PA2104014594 Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 15 Apr 94 p 4 PA2104014594 Caracas ECONOMIA HOY Spanish BFN [Report by Gregorio Salazar] [Text] The Miraflores Presidential Palace was engulfed in a foul and irritating cloud yesterday morning, as police used tear gas at the nearby Fermin Toro High School. The sound of gas canisters going off and bird shot rifles being fired at the demonstrators served as a backdrop to a news conference by General Barry McCaffrey, commander of the U.S. Southern Command. Gen. McCaffrey is here to discuss regional security and drug trafficking matters. Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom made a midmorning statement: "We are living in an atmosphere of tranquility, stability, and trust in the government. The polls and what the people on the street are saying demonstrates this." Reporters focused their attention on the pipe bombs placed at the doors of the of Banco Latino. This forced the minister to say that "these events do not have the significance or the weight that some people would like to give them..., and they are not big enough to pose any kind of threat to the nation." When addressing a question about the identity of those responsible for what he called "these scattered uprisings," he answered with a question: "Who do these attacks against the Banco Latino benefit or who could they benefit at this moment in time? Ask yourselves those same questions. I am not going to answer it. Let public opinion make up its own mind." "None of those responsible for yesterday's events has any real political significance." The minister was not clear; the reporters presumed that he meant the government employees' strike and the farmers' demonstration at the Central Bank of Venezuela last Wednesday. Another ongoing investigation is one looking into alleged terrorist plans, based on a report by Zulia State Governor Lolita Aniyar against ranchers in the Perija region. Escovar said that the commission he sent there has interviewed many people and that even the director of the weapons and explosives department was in Zulia. The minister also said that he did not know if Commander Hugo Chavez was planning any sort of uprising or conspiracy. Finally, the minister gave a flat "no comment" to a question about the "switch" on the Board of Directors of Aeropostal, allegedly carried out by Gustavo Velazquez and Mrs. Tarazona. Some reporters rewound their audio cassettes to listen to the minister's opening statements: "We are living in an atmosphere of tranquility, stability, and trust...."
