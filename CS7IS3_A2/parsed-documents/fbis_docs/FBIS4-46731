Dzhappuyev, Kabardino-Balkar Republic State Statistical Committee chairman: "Food Product Price Increases in First Quarter 1994"] [Text] In the first quarter of 1994 prices for goods and services rose by 33.4 percent, including a 30.3 percent increase in the price of goods, and 85.9 percent for services. For food products the price index was 134.3 percent, with figures of 113.8 percent in January, 107.5 percent in February and 109.8 percent in March. During the current year there have been increases in January in the regulated prices of bread and beef and twice (in January and March) for milk, yogurt and curds. As a result of this the price of milk has increased by a factor of five since the beginning of the year, and stood at R400 [rubles] in March, as compared to R80 in January. The price of beef increased by a factor of 2.5 (R2,000 compared to R1,600 [sic]) and the price of bread by a factor of 1.5 (R180 per loaf compared to R120). During the first quarter the prices of certain food products in the regular retail trade network and at markets were virtually equal, as the cost of a one kilogram of sausage purchased from the retail trade network increased by 58.5 percent (R5,195 compared to R3,278), and by 50 percent (R6,000 compared to R4,000) at the collective farm market. The corresponding figures for butter were 59.7 percent (R4,200, R2,630) and 26.7 percent (R3,800, R3,000), for hard cheese -- 61.4 percent (R3,550, R2,200) and 60.7 percent (R4,500, R2,800). Due to a decline in stockpiles of vegetables in the regular trade network and at markets there has been a fairly significant increase in vegetable prices. For example, the price of one kilogram of cabbage increased by a factor of 1.7 in the regular trade network (R300, R180) and by a factor of 2.2. at kolkhoz markets (R1,000, R450). The corresponding price increase for onions was by 25.4 percent (R627, R500) and by 44.4 percent (R1,300, R900). As a result of significant infusions of sugar, vegetable oil and eggs into the republic's trade network the prices of these items at kolkhoz markets have begun to drop. Since the beginning of the year the price of vegetable oil has come down by 16.7 percent (R1,000 per kilogram, as compared to R1,200), the price of sugar has dropped by 14.3 percent (R600, R700), and chicken eggs are now 25 percent cheaper (R900 for 10 eggs, as compared to R1,200). As of 29 March 1994 the prices of basic food products remained quite high in the capitals of republics, krays and oblasts in the Northern Caucasus, as is clear from the following figures (all prices are in rubles per kilogram or liter): Item Nalchik Krasnodar Stavropol Rostov-on-Don Makhachkala Vladikavkaz Cherkessk Maykop Regular Trade Network Beef 2,000 2,014 2,200 1,814 2,200 2,500 2,700 1,778 Pork 2,475 2,071 2,800 1,817 --- 2,200 --- 2,040 Chicken 3,105 2,011 3,080 2,867 3,000 3,700 2,648 2,170 Sausage, 5,195 4,991 4,370 4,448 4,315 4,350 4,985 4,385 first quality Butter 4,950 3,738 4,000 3,830 4,013 3,600 4,322 3,872 Vegetable 779 780 870 794 1,250 1,100 1,062 977 oil Margarine 2,000 1,660 2,000 1,750 1,867 2,467 2,034 1,686 Milk 400 520 400 476 555 150 550 481 High-fat 240 557 484 524 573 290 580 486 yogurt Sour cream 2,600 1,741 1,990 1,845 2,578 1,525 2,000 2,187 Chicken 885 746 810 864 1,200 983 830 847 eggs, 10 Granulated 651 556 580 594 700 683 625 609 sugar Salt 98 78 200 126 175 150 200 40 Bread, 240 313 333 288 366 60 347 338 first and second quality Vodka 3,280 4,350 5,080 3,653 4,747 1,790 4,150 4,397 Potatoes 260 208 220 260 400 275 193 218 Kolkhoz Markets Beef 2,500 2,800 3,800 3,000 2,700 2,500 2,750 2,600 Pork 2,800 3,000 4,000 3,500 --- 2,500 3,700 3,000 Chicken 5,333 3,100 4,000 3,500 4,500 5,500 4,000 3,500 Vegetable 1,000 800 900 700 1,500 1,200 1,000 700 oil Milk 833 450 330 500 800 700 500 330 Sour cream 4,000 4,000 2,700 3,000 5,000 3,300 --- 3,000 Curds 1,500 1,500 1,000 1,500 2,500 --- --- 1,500 Eggs 900 700 900 800 1,000 917 800 900 Potatoes 400 250 250 250 400 350 225 250 Cabbage 1,000 800 800 700 850 467 700 800 Onions 1,300 1,800 1,300 1,300 1,500 1,800 1,600 1,800 Carrots 1,000 1,200 1,000 800 1,300 1,250 1,250 1,000 Apples 800 800 750 800 1,000 1,000 1,160 1,000
