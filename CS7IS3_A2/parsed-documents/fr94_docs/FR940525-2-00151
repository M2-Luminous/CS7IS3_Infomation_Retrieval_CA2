FR940525-2-00151 FR940525-2-00078 A. Preferencing All four commentators attempted to draw an analogy between the Cincinnati Dealer Preferencing Program (``CSE pilot'') 23 and the BSE proposal by alleging that the latter is in fact a preferencing system despite the lack of a reference to the term ``preferencing'' in the proposal. 24 The NYSE also alleges that although the BSE rules currently provide for the same auction market procedures as NYSE Rule 72, the competing specialist proposal effectively would change those procedures by always giving priority to the designated specialist when no other contra-side agency orders are present. 25 The BSE, in response, asserts that their priority, parity, and precedence rules work the same way as the NYSE rules did, when competing specialists were permitted on their floor, in that a BSE specialist quoting the ITS/BBO would have priority over the other specialist who is quoting an inferior market. 26 23 The CSE pilot originally was approved as a six month pilot for 60 issues per preferencing dealer. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28866 (February 13, 1991), 56 FR 5854 (February 7, 1991). It was subsequently extended several times and is currently approved through August 7, 1994. The number of CSE issues which a dealer may preference has been increased periodically to 350. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29885 (October 30, 1991), 56 FR 56676; 30353 (February 7, 1992) 57 FR 5918; 30809 (June 15, 1992) 57 FR 27990; 31011 (August 7, 1992), 57 FR 38704; 32280 (May 7, 1993) 58 FR 28422; 33975 (April 28, 1994). 24 See NYSE letter 1; NYSE letter 2; CSE letter; CHX letter; Amex letter 2. 25 See NYSE letter 2. 26 See BSE letter 2. B. Internalization Internalization of order flow is the ability of diversified firms to retain incoming customer orders by routing them to their affiliated specialist for execution, thereby participating on both sides of the transaction. The NYSE asserts that the BSE proposal could lessen auction market depth and efficiency because the preferenced order flow is internalized by specialists, does not participate in the auction market, and is executed outside of it. 27 The NYSE and Amex further maintain that by allowing internalization of order flow, the BSE proposal will diminish the efficiencies of auction market pricing by denying preferenced orders any exposure to the primary market and opportunity for price betterment thereon, and ultimately will lead to market fragmentation. 28 27 See NYSE letter 1. 28 See Amex letter 1; Amex letter 2; NYSE letter 1. The NYSE believes the Commission should weigh possible positive effects of competing specialists, such as fostering competition, against the potential negative effects, such as distortion of the auction market, and encourages the Commission to undertake a more comprehensive study of preferencing in order to determine whether or not it works to the benefit of the investing public. 29 In response, the BSE suggests that competition will heighten as the competing specialists strive to establish priority on the BSE floor. 30 Moreover, according to the BSE, liquidity in the national market will increase at the ITS/BBO because (1) the competing specialists will be forced to quote at the ITS/BBO to retain priority, and (2) the BSE quote disseminated when two or more specialists are simultaneously bidding at the same price will reflect their aggregated size. 31 29 See NYSE letter 1; See also Amex letter 2. 30 Consistent with traditional auction market principles, the only instance where preferencing would force a competitor with clearly established priority on the BASE floor to step aside to a preferenced order is when the ITS/BBO is greater than the BSE BBO. In such a circumstance, the BSE specialist does not have priority at the ITS/BBO and therefore BEACON will route the order to whomever is the designated specialist.

Amy Bilbija, Commission, on December 16, 1993. 31 The Commission notes that the BSE is aware that it may not aggregate auto-quotes for dissemination in ITS because auto-quoting in size is not permitted under the ITS Plan. An auto-quote is a systemic pricing change mechanism that generally tracks on the primary market. The NYSE and Amex also note that the BSE system in theory requires marketable customer limit orders to be cleared before a preferenced specialist can trade with its own order flow. 32 The NYSE and Amex maintain, however, that there is nothing to prevent BSE member firms from withholding their limit orders from the market, and sending them down to the exchange floor only when they have become marketable, at which time they are paired off against the affiliated specialist for execution. 33 The NYSE and Amex further assert that BSE firms with affiliated specialists would be motivated to act in such a fashion because they would be providing each organization an ongoing opportunity to trade as principal with its customers' market orders. 34 The BSE, however, maintains that BEACON will not accommodate such a practice because the system does not accept paired orders (where one side is an agency order and one side is a BSE market maker as principal). 35 32 See NYSE letter 1; Amex letter 2. 33 See NYSE letter 2; Amex letter 2. 34 See NYSE letter 2; Amex letter 2. 35 Conversation between Karen Aluise, Assistant Vice President, Boston Stock Exchange, and N. Amy Bilbija, Commission, on February 14, 1994. The Commission notes that the practice of withholding limit orders may be inconsistent with achieving best execution of customer orders and may unnecessarily interpose a dealer into an agency transaction.
