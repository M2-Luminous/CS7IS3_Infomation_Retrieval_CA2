An official of the South Korean presidential staff quoted the president as saying some 90 timber cutters from North Korea had applied recently to the South Korean embassy in Moscow and the country's consulate in Vladivostok, asking for a political asylum. "However, these requests will not be met in order not to irritate North Korea", the official said. According to him, Kim Yong-sam also stressed that "the government's stand on this matter has not changed" and the possibility of North Korean workers' resettlement to South Korea is not being considered. According to information of the South Korean Government, about 16,000 North Koreans are presently working at timber-felling sites in Russia's Khabarovsk territory. They are attracted by relatively high wages, as compared with those in North Korea. Some 170 North Korean workers have fled Siberian labour camps with a view to avoid returning to their native land. At the moment, they have to knock about Russia without even any passports. Some of them managed to illegally cross the border into China, where a lot of ethnic Koreans live at present.
