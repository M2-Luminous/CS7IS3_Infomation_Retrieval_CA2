According to a committee spokesman, this makes partners ask questions. For example, a delegation of the Slovak parliament, which finished its visit to Moscow on May 24, wondered why the treaty of cooperation between the two countries, signed in August 1993, had not been ratified yet. More over, the time for ratifying it has not been chosen. The committee spokesman said that the deputies received a draft of the aforementioned law from the Russian president only in late April, and will discuss it at a session soon.
