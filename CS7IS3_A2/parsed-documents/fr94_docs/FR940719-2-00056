FR940719-2-00056 FR940719-2-00032 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No. CP93&hyph;261&hyph;000, CP93&hyph;261&hyph;001] Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.; Notice of Availability of the Environment Assessment for the Proposed Brockton Loop Cromwell Compressor Station Project May 13, 1994. The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has prepared this Environmental Assessment (EA) on the natural gas pipeline facilities proposed by Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Algonquin) in the above-referenced dockets. The EA was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the proposed AFT&hyph;5 Pipeline Project, including: •3.8 miles of new 16-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline; •compressor station modifications; and •modifications to five meter stations. The purpose of the proposed facilities would be to provide new firm transportation service of up to 14,758 MMBtu of natural gas per day for Bay State Gas Company. The EA also evaluates alternatives to Algonquin's proposal. The Massachusetts Energy Facility Siting Board has recommended an alternative to the proposed route in the vicinity of Linwood Street identified in the EA as the Hampden Avenue/Jackson Heights Variation. The staff analyzed this, as well as other routing variations but did not find that any of these variations were environmentally superior to the proposed route with the mitigation recommended by the staff. The discussion of the variations begins on page 19 of the EA. We would welcome any additional comments on the variations.. The EA has been placed in the public files of the FERC and is available for public inspection at: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Division of Public Information; 941 North Capitol Street NE., room 3104, Washington, DC 20426 (202) 208&hyph;1371. Copies of the EA have been mailed to Federal, state and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, newspapers, and parties to this processing. A limited number of copies of the EA are available from: Mr. Howard Wheeler, Environmental Project Manager, Environmental Review and Compliance Branch II, Office of Pipeline Regulation, room 7312; 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;2299. Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Written comments must reference Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;261&hyph;000 and CP93&hyph;261&hyph;001, and be addressed to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. Comments should be filed as soon as possible, but must be received no later than June 2, 1994, to ensure consideration prior to a Commission decision on this proposal. A copy of any comments should also be set to Mr. Howard Wheeler, Environmental Project Manger. Comments will considered by the Commission but will not serve to make the commentor a party to the proceeding. Any person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures (18 CFR 385.214). The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file late interventions must show good cause, as required by §385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do no need intervenor status to have your comments considered. Additional information about this project is available from Mr. Howard Wheeler, Enviromental Review and Compliance Branch II, Office of Pipeline Regulation, at (202) 208&hyph;2299. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12278 Filed 5&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
