I have come to this Congress with an open and confident spirit. I am not unfamiliar with Congress. I came from it. I know its virtues and limitations. The presidential system of government believes Congress is a place for real encounter and cooperation. Great Chilean congressmen have contributed under that political system. [passage omitted] What is the basic idea this president wants to convey to this sovereign assembly at the beginning of his administration? I have come to assert that Chile has a great historic opportunity. I have come to invite the country to take this opportunity. I have come to explain how the government hopes to take advantage of this opportunity in the immediate and near future. Taking an opportunity means recognizing it. Our great writers and historians have taught us that Chile had other opportunities in the past. One of them is very well known because when it was not taken, it meant a long history of national frustrations. The people feel great bitterness when they lose their opportunity and have to wait for a long time for a new one. An opportunity is not a miracle as a result of a plan or the magic or force of a political boss. An opportunity is the result of work by all the people which sometimes does not come true because of disagreements among their leaders or because the size of the projects is not up to the circumstances. This is when the sacrifice of the people can become useless and forgotten. I am deeply convinced that a powerful series of national and international factors have opened a great opportunity for us. Chile has grown over the past 10 years at an average rate of over 6 percent a year, which is unusual in the history of Chile. During this period, our exports increased at a rate of over 9 percent, inflation decreased from an average 20 percent per year in the second half of the 1980's to an average 13 percent during the last two years. These achievements were made along with a historic reduction of unemployment, which dropped from an average of over 17 percent in the last decade to about 5 percent in the last few years. Our great hope in the future, however, lies in increasing our savings and investments. During recent decades, the savings rate never surpassed 18 percent of the GDP, in the last few years it has risen to about 22 percent. In the last couple of years, the investment rate, which traditionally never reached 20 percent, has risen to between 25 and 27 percent. This is unprecedented in the last 50 years of Chilean economic history. This economic growth will be accompanied by a greater social determination through a decrease in poverty levels and an increase in production. This was the start of an era in which we have achieved economic growth with equity. If we are able to maintain this trend in the next 10 years, our country will certainly have reached the threshold to overcome underdevelopment. World transformations have opened new horizons for our expectations of economic growth and a new political, cultural and social agenda. The internationalization of the economy is a reality today. We face the challenge of exporting all goods and services with comparative advantages to all countries throughout the world. Soon there will come a time when our traditional economy will probably continue to grow and, at the same time, we will perfect the current comparative advantages and thus achieve proper margins of competitiveness of new goods and services. The new post-Cold War international agenda is ambivalent. On the one hand, the conflict that characterized the second half of this century -- which during peak political tensions internationalized intrinsically local issues as we Chileans know too well -- is categorically over. On the other hand, we are simultaneously witnessing the opening of new expectations of altruism with new threats of barbarism. The end of bipolarity has done away with rigid dogmas that characterized our recent past and allows for a wider, more diversified, and richer discussion of the options available at all social levels. The globalization of communications and an increasing interaction, however, challenge our identity. We need to critically assimilate the global culture that surrounds us through our own development. If our social, political, and economic coexistence become cosmopolitan without an adequate hierarchical order, our Republic runs the risk of becoming a true Tower of Babel. To assume this historic opportunity, we must prioritize subjects, objectives, and challenges; and thus center our country's energy on the needs of our people. This should be achieved by concentrating our efforts in those areas which have a greater impact on the quality of life of all Chileans. We have defined three great tasks that must be assumed with a patriotic attitude because beyond being the specific duties of the administration in power, the future of all Chileans depends on these national objectives. They are: the consolidation of our economic development, eradication of extreme poverty, and establishment of a modern labor code; the design of effective and all-encompassing health and education systems able to meet the demands of a fast-growing society; and lastly, the insertion of Chile into the international scenario. In the last few years, Chile has conquered a privileged position among countries with developing economies. This constitutes a solid basis upon which to build the country all Chileans desire. We are determined to continue to build and expand this path toward development on the basis of equity and stability. The success achieved in the recent past compels us to redouble our efforts in the immediate future. This year, we experienced an economic adjustment process that will result in an economic growth of about four percent and an estimated inflation rate of 11 percent. Today's sacrifices, however, are an investment for the future. We will be inflexible in our struggle to curb inflation because it constitutes the worst tax to burden those fellow citizens who live off a salary or wage. This is a high priority task for my administration. In the past few months, we have already adopted measures to decrease high spending. We will not curb the inflation rate by resorting to the easy alternative of decreasing the exchange rate because it will undermine our exports. There will be no economic growth without effort and sacrifice. We will achieve a greater economic growth only if we are able to significantly increase our national investments and savings. This compels us to be more austere both at the private and public levels by avoiding spending, which many times is justified, and thus increase our savings and finance investments. Continued high economic growth demands constant efforts to strengthen savings and investments and their effectiveness is strongly tied to development and the expansion of the financial market. We are committed to implementing the new capital markets law promptly. We hope to achieve a reasonable and timely solution to the debt of private banks with the Central Bank through the adoption of responsible measures that will not undermine the Central Bank's patrimony. The government, which will persevere in its efforts, will use the savings and investment fiscal policy, the commercial policy, and production incentives, as tools to achieve the following goals: 1) To curb inflation so that during my administration we may achieve single-digit inflation comparable to that of successful economies; 2) a real economic growth of no less than 5.5 percent during my administration so that by the year 1999 we may increase the current per capita income of $3,160 to about $4,400. This represents a 38 percent increase at today's current values; 3) a more dynamic job market to increase the job and labor force by 2.5 percent per year; 4) a production increase that will average about 3 percent per year. Although this is demanding, it will allow economic growth on a more equitable basis; 5) a gradual but systematic increase of real salary levels to substantially increase the real salary of workers during my administration; 6) a significant increase in consumption levels of low-income families in line with the new sustainable opportunity pattern [patron de oportunidades sustentables] which is designed for them; 7) a continuation of our commercial opening process by expediting the internationalization process of the financial and investment fields to considerably increase our competitive levels. [passage omitted] Throughout history, Chilean foreign policy has always abided by the following main principles: Firm respect for international law, the peaceful solution of conflicts, international cooperation, support for democracy, and friendly relations among all nations. Within the current international context, compliance with these principles is evinced by the active and dynamic support given to the internationalization of Chile's economy through what we call diplomacy for development. With this encouraging attitude in mind, we have defined three main targets for our country's foreign policy. First, we will seek to further internationalize the Chilean economy through alliances and agreements which will give us a better chance of becoming part of an increasingly interconnected world. Our second objective is to improve our relations with our main trade partners throughout the world, while fostering an atmosphere conducive to the strengthening of democratic stability, especially in Latin America. Our third objective will be to selectively participate in initiatives to attain peace, foster democracy, increase respect for human rights, and implement development and social fairness throughout the world. We will act in keeping with certain guidelines and policies. Our country fully supports the principle of open regionalism and believes that regional agreements are the appropriate mechanism to expand trade and investments. We believe these agreements should ultimately seek increasingly free world trade. This approach allows us to unilaterally open our economy, sign bilateral agreement, and actively participate in multilateral negotiations. Our foreign policy will give priority to our ties with other Latin American countries. Latin America has again become one of the world's most economically dynamic areas. Economic integration and complementariness are, thus, more necessary than ever. We would like to contribute to the shoring up of an atmosphere of peace, dialogue and mutual trust among the countries of this region. With this objective in mind, we will implement a policy based on constructive rapprochement, and physical and economic integration. This year, we expect the court of arbitration will issue a ruling that will end the dispute [with Argentina] over Laguna del Desierto, thus reducing pending border disputes to the minimum. Our evaluation of the results of bilateral agreements Chile has signed so far with Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, and Venezuela, is very positive. These agreements and our domestic policies that seek to further open our economy have contributed to make more dynamic our commercial relations with other Latin American countries. We will continue to negotiate with Ecuador, and we hope that our talks with Peru and Brazil will make more headway than they have so far. We are especially interested in our relations with the Common Market of the South [Mercosur] to which Chile's two main Latin American trade partners belong. In the coming months, Chile will propose to Mercosur a mechanism which, without requiring us to become a partner in that common market, will pave the way for the establishment of a free trade zone in the region. We are aware that in the medium term, it will become necessary to find a regional framework to reconcile the many partial agreements that various countries have reached among themselves. The Latin American Integration Association [ALADI] should provide us with the proper legal foundation for an integration policy, and provide the main scenario for multilateral action to the point of becoming a true Latin American trade forum. Chile will support efforts to make the Rio Group the common representative for Latin America at global debates. This group must expand its economic scope, especially to join forces against protectionist measures which threaten our development. The Rio Group must resume its initial quest for political agreements to tackle pending problems related to peace, security and coexistence in Latin America. Our Latin American policy must be fully compatible with our drive for greater participation in world markets. My administration will give priority attention to the negotiation of bilateral or multilateral agreements aimed at the attainment of this objective. We want to broaden our bilateral agenda with the northern countries. With the U.S. Government, we recently made the political decision to begin negotiating a free trade agreement which could be either bilateral or multilateral by having Chile join NAFTA. My administration views negotiations for this kind of agreement as a priority. This does not mean just any agreement will be attractive to us. It is very important to coordinate negotiations and properly weigh the impact of the various elements such as the opening of the goods and services market, trade regulations, mechanisms to resolve disputes, intellectual property, investments, environment, labor affairs, and other issues that an agreement of this kind involves. Only through a joint effort by the entire country will the negotiations have a positive outcome for Chile, and pave the road for other Latin American countries. Europe is also an important target for our foreign policy. The EU is the world's largest common market, and continues to be one of Chile's main commercial partners. Furthermore, our country has excellent political relations with the European countries. These relations are based on deep-rooted common values and this has prompted a significant flow of cooperation and investment. We have things in common that we want to develop and thus strengthen commercial ties with the EU and its members and to soften the impact of protectionist tendencies that harm Chile. We are prepared to negotiate -- either bilaterally or multilaterally through the Rio Group -- a partnership with Europe that will give stability to our commercial and financial operations. Chile's foreign policy also seeks to increase the opening toward the Asian-Pacific countries. The Pacific Basin is bound to be one of the main scenarios of the future world. In October this year, we will join the Asia Pacific Cooperation, APEC, thus crowning our efforts to tighten bonds with that part of the world. Our presence in the Asian-Pacific region is, however, not strong enough yet. The Chilean Government can create favorable conditions and establish the necessary contacts, but it is up to private entrepreneurs to make use of these facilities daringly and creatively if we truly want to make Chile Latin America's outlet to the Pacific. [passage omitted] The protection of the environment and natural resources is yet another priority of my administration. Our work to protect the environment will abide not only by the provisions of the Constitution and of the Basic Law for the Environment; we will also take several other steps. The state will be given effective legal, economic, and administrative tools to include protection of the environment in the policies for each sector. For this the administration will strengthen the National Environment Commission [Conama] and the appropriate regional commissions. This year we will develop and implement the rules and regulations for the evaluation of the environment, which the Basic Law for the Environment calls for, and the regulations that will allow us to set environmental standards. We will improve the people's environmental awareness through formal and informal education methods aimed at fostering environment-conscious behavior patterns. For this, we will train over 1,200 monitors over the next three years. The administration will promote environmentally sustainable technological development. Along those lines, we are already implementing a program of subsidies for technological upgrading aimed at reducing by 60 or 70 percent the consumption of industrial components that harm the ozone layer by the year 1996. We also want to develop consultative mechanisms for the citizenry and the productive sectors concerning the drafting of environmental policies and instruments. The administration is already in touch with these sectors in its effort to create the above mechanisms. This effort will be strengthened soon through the establishment of a communications center under the Conama umbrella, and by involving social agents in the adjustment and implementation in Chile of the Rio-21 environmental agenda. We will actively involve public agencies that have a role to play in the preservation of the environment in solving administrative problems and in training and the allocation of resources. To accomplish this, we have the invaluable support of a World Bank program which is already operational. We will implement a program to control water and air contamination, for which the appropriate standards will be established. The administration will also encourage financial companies to support worthwhile environmental projects. For this, the administration will expedite technological upgrades and allow the companies to comply with regulations by providing the lines of credit to finance the necessary investments. We will support the environmental efforts of the municipalities for which instructions have been issued to develop the necessary instruments for better and more effective management of urban, industrial, and dangerous waste. We will also strive for a more effective use of energy. As part of our planning of the use of energy, and in keeping with our international commitments, we have prepared a list of gases related to the greenhouse effect. We will also improve the national wildlife reserve system, coastal zoning, and marine reserves. [passage omitted] The future of our nation is safeguarded by a nonpartisan, coherent national defense policy designed in consensus by democratic institutions. No particular problem will deflect us from these guidelines. In matters of national defense, the administration will assume its pertinent role of strategic and political leadership. To this effect, it will strengthen and streamline the existing defense institutions. It will promote the adequate modernization of our Armed Forces by granting them a stable budget based on strategic criteria, and by assuming the challenge of reorganizing them in keeping with the demands of the international and regional scenarios. We want all citizens to be aware of the privileges and duties that the task of national defense entails. We will actively promote the involvement of civilians, at the academic and technical level, in the development of the Armed Forces and in national defense matters. The administration will promote this national awareness through a National Defense Report to be issued in one year. This report, which will be available to all citizens, will explain in detail the objectives and tools of our national defense. My administration has decided to fully occupy Chilean soil, sea, and air spaces. We will consolidate and integrate our domestic borders and will effectively occupy our lands. To this effect we will study the initiative that the Chilean Army has promoted in this regard within the vast concept of the regionalization and national development programs. Moreover, when I opened the Month of the Sea, I proposed a series of initiatives for the development of a sea policy. In addition, the Navy has made important contributions to developing sea resources, which constitutes a new privileged space for development opportunities. We need an organization to promote these initiatives and to coordinate the activities of those organizations dealing with sea-related activities. In view of this, within a six-month period, the government will establish a National Oceanic Commission that will be in charge of overseeing the effective occupation of the sea, the safeguarding of Chilean rights, and the balanced exploitation of sea resources. The administration is also closely following the vast prospects for the peaceful exploitation of space: communications, weather forecasting, and environment. In view of this, it will study the Chilean Air Force's proposal to create a national space institute. Our challenges in the defense area will be based on the pillars of knowledge to promote the commitment of citizens and a national defense policy for a safe future. [passage omitted] There will be no sustainable development for our fatherland if we are unable to establish well-designed and effective political institutions that are recognized by all as just and legitimate. There are countries with successful economies that have been ruined by faults in their political systems. There have also been countries with truly legitimate political systems that have seen their development frustrated because of the explosion of longstanding social conflicts, or because of their inability to draft a coherent security and defense policy. My administration has proposed that the constitutional reform be discussed within the broader framework of the state reform and modernization program in order to adjust it to international changes at the economic, international affairs, and political levels. This is not a question of minorities or majorities or an issue concerning the imposition of the will of one group over that of the other. By definition and essence, this is an issue of consensus. I want to be perfectly clear on this issue. I propose, therefore, a frank, open, and constructive proposal. I believe everyone must admit that there are a large number of issues in the current constitutional order that lack consensus. No matter on which side of the fence you are standing -- among those who defend the current constitutional order or those who criticize it -- we must admit that this constitutional order lacks the consensus it should and needs to have. There is a lot of contradictory criticism in Chile about the electoral system, the municipal order, the manner in which mayors are elected, the limits and procedure for controlling legislative elections, or how the Senate is formed. Moreover, a series of proposals and initiatives are circulating on inabilities and incompatibilities in regional council reforms. It is neither practical nor ethical for our country to exhaust these issues in rigid political struggles without implementing this reform. On this basis I urge you to adopt a futuristic outlook, one of rapprochement through dialogue, and one that seeks constructive solutions in congress and in the political parties' debates. Let us overcome stagnation because this only helps to aggravate problems. Let us not use this issue to point out the differences between government and opposition parties. Let us not adopt a narrow-minded attitude by only proposing reforms based on either government or opposition power strategies. Let us not center our discussions on ideological issues or try to seek personal attention. If we avoid these temptations, we will be able to have a constructive debate instead of one that will increase our differences. More specifically, more than centering our discussions on authoritarian enclaves to safeguard democracy, we must face the challenge of defining what kind of congress we need for Chile; and of establishing a municipal order that heeds the current national needs, seeking democracy at the municipal level, decentralization, efficient administration, and ethicality. Within this context, my administration is working on two constitutional reform bills which we will soon submit to Congress. The first is inspired by the idea of having an expeditious and modern congress with truly democratically elected members. In view of this, we will be proposing reforms in the following areas. First, the reform of the electoral system, establishing one that will guarantee reasonable results based on the principle of one citizen, one vote, and reflecting the representativity of main opinion trends, contributing to political stability and long-term governability. We are also open to reforms that will increase the effectiveness of legislative work, expedite paper proceedings, and make less bureaucratic the drafting of bills. In this regard, the government proposes to do away with the differences between ordinary and extraordinary congressional terms. Moreover, it proposes reforms seeking to make joint committees more efficient and expedite proceedings in the drafting of laws. We are willing to introduce reforms to the Constitution that will increase the supervisory duties of the Chamber of Deputies. A modern congress must offer guarantees to congressional minority blocs so that they can exercise their supervisory duties in an effective and responsible manner. This presupposes, under terms to be specified, a decrease in the number of legislators needed for the establishment of investigating committees [applause], but it also guarantees the responsible exercise of supervisory duties so that no one shielded by legislative immunity may undermine the honor and dignity of people without being punished. [applause] A constitutional reform, like the one we aspire to implement in Congress, cannot exclude the case of designated senators. The proposal of this amendment does not presuppose an adverse judgement against the persons who are today exercising these duties. My administration is convinced that the Senate must be formed on the basis of the will of the people. [applause] The second constitutional reform draft bill to which we are devoted is that concerning municipal government. This administration is willing to discuss an amendment that will allow the direct election of mayors. The approval of this reform compels us to carry out an exhaustive discussion of the overall modernization of the municipal administration system, which presupposes the study of several interrelated issues. Let us consolidate our institutions on the basis of national objectives. We need coherent and overall democratic operational objectives at the regional and municipal levels. Let us keep in mind that what is at stake here is the competence and the essential resources needed to achieve an equitable balance between the municipalities and regions of our country. There is another issue I would like to comment on, which affects the quality of politics, the administration of the state, and our entire society. I am referring to ethics and morality. Chile is a country with an honorable tradition of public service. We must safeguard and protect this moral patrimony. Though they are of course serious, the recent reports of irregularities and abnormalities cannot compel us to say that we are facing a situation of systematic or rampant corruption. Nonetheless, we must be prudent and safeguard our fatherland with a view to the future. We also cannot ignore that drug trafficking and other illegal transactions are dangers that are looming over our fatherland. In view of this my administration is determined to increase the quality of life of our citizens by reasserting the moral values that are essential for public servants; by improving the social control of government leaders; and by increasing openness in the exercise of political duties and in the interrelation between political and economic power through a more effective handling of public assets and institutions. The lack of public ethics is the result of an uncontrolled exercise of power, and ambiguous responsibilities. In view of this we must define responsibilities, and what is legal and illegal in public life. This is a consensus that must be achieved with the ultimate objective of restoring a new national public ethics code. The promotion of morality presupposes the achievement of a national consensus because public ethics affect private business and public administration alike. In view of this, we have promoted and established the National Public Ethics Committee, encompassing all the branches of government and representatives of civilian society. Its objective is to draft guidelines which, once introduced through administrative and legislative measures, will be clear guidelines for preventing and punishing behavior that is not in keeping with ethics and morality. We will have specific results in this regard within a couple of months. We will continue to work relentlessly, but calmly and diligently, in the same manner in which we have written the history of our nation. My government will comply with its duty in this area. By the end of this millennium, we either will or will not have taken full advantage of the historic opportunity we have received from the nation, with the unprecedented circumstances existing in the world today. One of the most common ways of undermining the strength and drive of the national plan is by hiding behind group interests. The relative situation of neglect affecting any given group, within the context of various production and service sectors, will be corrected only through a persevering, effective, and coherent policy. There is no other way of reversing the historical process that provoked the weakening of that sector. Each Chilean must be aware of what this new opportunity is all about. We must find ways to stop opportunists, hasty populists, and those who are still longing for polarization and violence. Each Chilean should know that political stability is an essential condition for economic growth. Everyone, especially the lower income sectors, must know the extent to which social development is dependent on economic growth. The poorer, humbler people can still tell between those who seek progress and those who only instigate useless disputes. Ending an era in which ideologies prevailed cannot generate a void entailing a lack of ideologies or ideas. Drawing on the nation's spiritual strength, we must build a common democratic foundation. This foundation, which ought to be based on ethical-legal principles, must promote a culture upholding responsibility. This foundation should be taught in schools, families, and through the media, as well as in churches and in other national spiritual centers, so that it may be legally binding for everyone. The country must reaffirm its resolve to act with the strength of its old pioneers. The country requires new efforts and new tasks, without which the national plan will lose strength. Civic friendship and a conciliatory spirit are the driving forces behind this new opportunity. The desire to search for agreements has been one of our major achievements in our coexistence in recent years. This desire may thus not be conceived as a mere truce, or as a ruse to block the action of the opposition. To search for agreements is to promote understanding rather than confrontation; it means to understand that development requires stability; it entails awareness that politics is built on confidence, which gives way to constructive behavior. It means to understand that no agreement will bring adverse effects on those who promoted it, but that it will rather bring legitimacy and glory upon those who promoted it. [applause] In this spirit I urge everyone to look, without pause, for basic agreements concerning the rules of the political and economic games and broad cooperation among the branches of government. Let us be aware of this opportunity. We have the chance to humanize politics. Let us all make sure that our legitimate democratic disagreements stay on a suitable course. We have made much progress, but let us not fail at such a decisive moment for our economic expansion and political consolidation. [passage omitted] The nation must display sound, calm optimism in order to continue treading this historic path. By the end of the next decade, the resolve of each Chilean will have made a great nation from this small community. [passage omitted] Seventy days ago I solemnly pledged here to respect the Constitution and the laws, and to work for the greatness of the fatherland. Today, complying with the desire of our people, without arrogance, with happy humbleness, with resolve, courage, and strength, I am committed to leading our country on the path leading to this great opportunity. May God enlighten me in this great task. Long live Chile! [applause]
