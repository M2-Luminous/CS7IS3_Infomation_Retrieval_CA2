Opposition leaders who were attending the Zim-rights consultative conference in Harare, however, emphasised that they were urging members of their parties to defend themselves should they be attacked by anybody for holding legitimate rallies. Mr Tekere was quoted at the weekend as having said "Let us build an opposition army of "Angels with Swords" to put down the Mugabe-ZANU (PF) evil. "Let us mobilise and recruit from among all able-bodied Zimbabweans, irrespective of party-political affiliation, for our "Angels with Swords" to put down, for all time, any temptation to resort to party-political violence." Yesterday the president of ZANU (Ndonga), Rev Ndabaningi Sithole, said that if it is to be an "Army of Angels", to him that amounted to a call that the people involved should be ready for any eventuality. "The angels are always there," he said. "They swing into action when there is need. In this sense I am thinking of spiritual angels. "Ndonga says if we are attacked we will attack. If they kill us we will kill them. If they disappear us (sic) we will disappear them." The vice-president of Forum Party of Zimbabwe, Mr Washington Sansole, said what the party chief, Dr Enoch Dumbutshena, meant by urging members to arm themselves with spears and axes had been taken out of context. "It (the statement) is attracting confusion to what the original purpose of Dumbutshena was," he said. "The emphasis was on defensive action...Only if you are attacked within your home. "Past experience," he said, "is the invitation for house-to-house campaign is a euphemism to violence. "ZANU (PF) has never been successful in holding peaceful elections. If our supporters encounter a situation which requires them to take defensive action they should not be afraid to do so." Mr Sansole spurned the idea of "Angels with Swords". Rev Sithole said there should be an interim government in the run-up to, and during the, elections. "The problem is changing the attitudes of the people," he said. "The problem is the powers-that-be. That is why we, in ZANU (Ndonga), believe that up to the time of the elections tremendous popular pressure has to be brought on the Government to allow the introduction of an interim government. "People are losing confidence in the Government," he said. "Once they (people) adopt an interim government, the confidence will be restored." Rev Sithole said an interim government would be a barometer indicating whether (ZANU) (PF) was sincere in saying next year's general elections would be free and fair. Rejecting this idea, Rev Sithole said, was an indication that the Government was not sincere in its intentions. He said that, with the interim government in place, the present government would go on as it is, but some people from "reputed" opposition parties would be brought into the executive. "Each of these (opposition) parties would give one or two people to be in interim government, which will guarantee free and fair elections."
