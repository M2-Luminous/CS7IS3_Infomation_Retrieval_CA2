FR940620-1-00005 FR940620-1-00002 Pursuant to the proposed regulation and consistent with the Working Group's recommendations, FCS institutions would be required to make a criminal referral and file a Referral Form when a criminal violation of the United States Code involving the institution's assets, operations, or affairs appears to have occurred and one of the circumstances listed in ยง617.2(a) exists. However, the proposed regulation should not be construed as reducing in any way an institution's responsibility to otherwise report criminal activities when these circumstances do not exist. The referrals would be made to the appropriate investigatory and/or prosecuting authorities, whether Federal, State, or local. Originally, the FCA proposed the use of a uniform criminal Referral Form which was designed by the Working Group. A uniform criminal Referral Form was expected to aid law enforcement agencies in determining whether investigations and/or prosecutions are warranted by standardizing requests for information and documentation. The FCA planned to incorporate this form's standards and procedures in its own criminal Referral Form. When first published, the proposed regulation indicated that the Referral Form, with instructions explaining how to complete, file, and distribute the form to the appropriate investigatory agency, would be obtained from the FCA's Office of General Counsel (OGC) or from the FCA Examination Manual . Due to unforeseen circumstances affecting all the Federal financial regulatory agencies, the Working Group has not yet promulgated a uniform criminal referral form. Consequently, the new Referral Form has not been developed. As now contemplated under the proposed rule, System institutions would continue to use the existing criminal Referral Forms found in the FCA Examination Manual . However, System institutions should expect the distribution of the new Referral Form after the Working Group completes the standardized uniform criminal referral form. III. Analysis of Changes and Comments by Section A. Section 617.1_Purpose and Scope The Council noted that the proposed regulations did not include a sample of the Referral Form and, as a result, it could not determine whether System banks would maintain any role in the criminal referral process. As previously stated, the FCA did not publish the Referral Form with the proposed regulation because the uniform criminal referral form, which the FCA intends to incorporate, had not, and has not yet, been promulgated by the Working Group. The existing Referral Form, which may be obtained from the FCA Examination Manual , does not create any substantive requirements, nor will the new Referral Form. The Referral Form merely serves as a vehicle for ensuring that System institutions report the information necessary to make a criminal referral. The new Referral Form is not expected to require System institutions to submit any more information than they previously have been required to submit using the existing Referral Form. For these reasons, the FCA believes even if the new Referral Form were available at this time, its publication would not be necessary. If the uniform criminal referral form ultimately promulgated by the Working Group creates new and previously-unanticipated requirements, the FCA will reconsider whether to incorporate it in its entirety into the System's Referral Form. B. Section 617.2_Referrals The Council questioned whether or not the proposed regulation adequately addressed ``borrower transgressions.'' The FCA believes that the proposed regulation provides for the referral of all known or suspected violations of Federal criminal laws, including both insider and borrower transgressions. In ยง617.2(a) (2) and (3), the proposed regulation specifically addresses borrower transgressions and would require a criminal referral when known or suspected criminal activity occurs if certain circumstances are met. Section 617.2(a)(2) applies when the suspect is not an employee, officer, director, agent, or other person participating in the affairs of an institution, i.e., a borrower. Section 617.2(a)(3) applies when there is no substantial basis for identifying a suspect, which may include a borrower. Therefore, no amendment is believed to be necessary. For instance, a referral would be required when known or suspected criminal activity involving actual or potential losses of $1,000 or more occurs and the institution has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects as a borrower(s). A referral would also be required when known or suspected criminal activity involving actual or potential losses of $5,000 or more occurs and the institution has no substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects. In this latter instance, the possible suspect or group of suspects could be a borrower(s). Also, ยง617.2(a)(1) addresses insider transgressions and would require a criminal referral, regardless of the amount of an actual or potential loss, where an institution employee, officer, director, agent, or other person participating in the affairs of the institution is suspected.
