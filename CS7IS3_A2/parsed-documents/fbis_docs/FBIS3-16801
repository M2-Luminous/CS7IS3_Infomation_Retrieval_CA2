It is important to note that the agreement for the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia is also ready to be initialled. Estonia had hoped that this could have been done at the last round of talks, but instead the Russian side presented new demands and even placed the mutually agreed upon withdrawal date of August 31, 1994 into question. In light of the Russian Prime Minister's recent stated agreement to remove Russian troops from Estonia by August 31, 1994 and the international consensus that the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia can not be tied to any conditions, the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes that Russia will initial the agreement to withdraw troops from Estonia during the 18th round of negotiations April 5-6 in Moscow. By completing the removal of its troops from all three Baltic States by August 31, 1994, Russia will finally be in conformance with paragraph 15 of the 1992 Helsinki document, which requires "early, orderly and complete" withdrawal.
