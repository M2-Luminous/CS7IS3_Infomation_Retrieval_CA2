In reply to NEPSZAVA's question, the minister stated that this measure concerned more than 100 schools. As is well known, based on the terms of this contract the government would undertake to finance religious schools for 20 years, in spite of the fact that local governments as well as the parties protested the planned transaction. The deal has been called a renationalization of the schools, which is contrary to the spirit of the law on public education, namely, to the intention of decentralizing public education. As Gabor Horn, education specialist of the Association of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], put it, if these contracts go into effect, religious institutions will give up their schools themselves. After all, this contract will turn religious schools into public schools. Assessing the past four years of the portfolio, the minister called the new, 1993 law on public education an outstanding accomplishment. At the press briefing presenting his evaluation he added: The national basic curriculum was completed after much superfluous discussion which did not contribute to the portfolio's reputation. As the greatest accomplishment concerning higher education, the minister emphasized the autonomy of institutions. According to information available to us, the program for the Renewal of the Profession of Educators [PSZM] did not receive a penny of the 82 million forints which were allocated to it from the budget. This money is intended for the establishment and development of county regional educational centers. Concerning these, Ferenc Madl told NEPSZAVA that the restoration of the PSZM program is under way, but this does not mean that it will be abolished. The board of trustees which used to be headed by Jozsef Zsolnai was dissolved only in form. The minister said he considered it conceivable that by the time the contractual obligations of PSZM are fulfilled, a different crew, of similar composition than the previous one, can take over this program.
