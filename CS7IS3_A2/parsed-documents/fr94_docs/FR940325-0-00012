FR940325-0-00012 FR940325-0-00003 Backfit Analysis This regulation does not impose any new requirements on production or utilization facilities. The regulation deletes the requirement that all states within the plume exposure pathway EPZ for a given site fully participate in an offsite exercise for that specific site at least every 7 years. It also relaxes the requirement to perform an ingestion exposure pathway exercise from every 5 years to every 6 years. These changes would permit, but do not require, licensees to change their emergency plans and procedures. Therefore, these changes are not considered backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109 (a)(1).
