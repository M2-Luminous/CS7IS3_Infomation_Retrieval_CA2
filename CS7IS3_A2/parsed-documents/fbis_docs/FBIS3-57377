This is said in a statement by the Ukrainian Constitutional Democratic Party [UCDP] promulgated on 24 January. In the opinion of the Constitutional Democrats, the attempts to please international financial organizations will only further discredit Ukraine as a country "run by ignoramuses." The UCDP believes that no one in Ukraine has any illusions about the cabinet of ministers, but the performance by Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko has transcended all permissible bounds. The UCDP has called for his immediate resignation. Meanwhile the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet will not return to the consideration of the budget until 27 January.
