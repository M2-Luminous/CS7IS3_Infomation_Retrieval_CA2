"Since the beginning of the war in former Yugoslavia, a new drug route has developed from Turkey to the port of Trieste," Helmut Gram, chief of the Carinthian customs guard, reported on Monday. Direct ferry-boats from Turkey with up to 140 truck trains on board arrive in Trieste three times a week. As international investigators know, for the major part of illegal drug smuggling, these new opportunities are used for supplies to Germany. About 50 percent of the arriving trucks cross the Italian-Austrian border in Thoerl-Maglern. For some weeks, five male and one female special officers, with the most modern equipment and a drug sniffer dog, have been on duty around the clock. Three members of the drug squad gathered experiences in Burgenland, where the first Austrian special unit against drug trafficking was established and is working successfully. There will also be more controls on tourist traffic. "If there is any suspicion, it might take hours to search a passenger car," Gram said, "but in general it will be seen to that there are no major obstructions of the tourist traffic." Cooperation with the Italian customs and port authorities has developed well, the drug specialists reported.
