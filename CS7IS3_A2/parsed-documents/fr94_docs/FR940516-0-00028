FR940516-0-00028 FR940516-0-00013 Advisory Note 15 is revised to restrict its application to Bulgaria and Romania. Advisory Note 16 is revised to restrict its application to Albania, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Romania, and Vietnam. Advisory Note 19 is revised by removing references to the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Notes 25 and 27 are added. This rule revises the country policy provisions in §785.2 to conform with changes in licensing policies for proscribed countries. This rule also moves Poland, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic from Country Group W to Country Group V. As a result of this change, Poland and the Czech and Slovak Republics are now eligible for exports under certain special license procedures (e.g., the Distribution License Procedure) and general licenses (e.g., General License GFW). This rule also amends the EAR to include new supporting document requirements based on the implementation of Import Certificate/Delivery Verification (IC/DV) procedures for Bulgaria and Romania. Bulgarian and Romanian ICs and DVs are issued by the respective Ministries of Trade in each country. Supplement No. 1 to Part 775 is amended to add the addresses of these issuing agencies. This rule also amends Supplement No. 1 to Part 775 by revising the name of the agency that issues Indian Import Certificates to small scale industries and entities. On January 2, 1992 (57 FR 8), the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) published a final rule clarifying that the geographical area formerly known as the Soviet Union remained a controlled destination as listed in Country Group Y. That rule allowed exporters to use the designation ``Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'', ``Soviet Union'', or ``USSR'' on export control documents involving that geographic area until new political entities were identified. This final rule revises Supplement No. 1 to part 770, Supplement No. 5 to part 778, and §785.2(a)(1) to include a listing of the states located in the geographic area of the former Soviet Union. These new designations should be used on all export control documents. The dissolution of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Yugoslavia) has raised questions among exporters concerning the export control requirements for that geographic area. The geographic area formerly known as Yugoslavia continues to fall within Country Group V. At this time, the provisions of the EAR that apply to this area remain unchanged, except that this rule revises the documentation requirements to substitute a Form BXA&hyph;629P, Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser, for the Yugoslav End-Use Certificate requirement. In addition, this rule eliminates the Yugoslav End-Use Certificate requirement for exports/reexports under the Distribution License and the Service Supply Procedure. The Consignee/Purchaser Statement procedure set forth in §775.2 provides a broader range of exemptions than was previously available under §775.5 for the Yugoslav End-Use Certificate. Finally, this rule revises §776.10(a)(2) to make the special documentation requirements for exports to Country Groups QWY and the People's Republic of China of electronic computers and related equipment conform with the revisions made by this rule in the Advisory Notes for Category 4. Rulemaking Requirements 1. This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.
