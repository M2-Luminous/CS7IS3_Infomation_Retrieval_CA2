In the aftermath of the St. Kitts-Nevis labour party-organised demonstration, police confirmed numerous reports of damage to property due to fire and other causes. The damage includes some 20,000 tons of sugarcane destroyed by fire in the island's sugar belt. Desmond Mallalieu, general manager of the St. Kitts Sugar Manufacturing Corporation (SSMC), said with harvesting of the 1994 crop not yet underway, some of the burnt cane will be lost due to spoilage. Fire also gutted an unoccupied wooden building -- the property of the National Caribbean Insurance Company -- close to government headquarters, scene of the demonstration. A primary school, run by the Methodist Church, was also burnt. Informed sources have indicated that damage to government headquarters itself where several windows were smashed, could be in the region of 3,000 dollars (one EC dollar = 37 cents U.S.). The state car used to transport the governor general suffered damage to the extent of 10,000 dollars, officials said. The vehicle was extensively damaged while it was parked in the garage at government headquarters. Police investigations are continuing. Prime Minister Dr. Kennedy Simmonds has termed the demonstration a "disgrace and a discredit" to all those who participated in it. Simmonds said it is clear from last month's experience that such lawlessness can do great harm to the economy and affect the lives and livelihood of people in every sector of society. A state of emergency was imposed here on December 2 after opposition supporters rioted following the installation of the Simmonds-led coalition which won five of the 11 parliamentary seats in general elections on November 29. Simmonds said he was pleased that his party supporters who came out to cheer their representatives, had behaved admirably, had obeyed police instructions, and did not get into any confrontation with Labour Party supporters or the police.
