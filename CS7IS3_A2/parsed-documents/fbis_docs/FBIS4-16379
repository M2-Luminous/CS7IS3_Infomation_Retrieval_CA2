Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov told ITAR-TASS that the talks had proved very productive. First of all, Panov said, the two countries have begun laying the groundwork for South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's visit to the Russian capital in June. A package of bilateral documents will be prepared for the Russian-Korean summit meeting, and will include a political document. Moscow and Seoul have also begun preparing a series of bilateral agreements, some of them economic. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's negotiations with Han Sung-chu contained a substantive exchange of opinions concerning the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. The two sides agreed to maintain close cooperation in that question. The South Korean delegation positively responded to Russia's proposal to call an international conference on the security and nuclear status of the Korean peninsula. Seoul considers it possible to widen the proposed conference's possible agenda. Another possible topic of discussion for the conference is cooperation in various fields with the sub-region, Aleksandr Panov said.
