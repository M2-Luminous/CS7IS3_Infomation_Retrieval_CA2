FBIS4-17418 "drsov079_u_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 Latvia Russian Negotiator Says Pact Must Be Signed Russian Negotiator Says Pact Must Be Signed WS2504092594 Tallinn BNS in English 1549 GMT 23 Apr 94 WS2504092594 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Riga, Apr 23, BNS -- If Latvia refuses to sign the whole package of initialed troop withdrawal documents, including the section on social guarantees of military retirees, Russia may halt the pullout indefinitely, said chief Russian negotiator Sergey Zotov. "I can officially say that the question in that case will be about immediate suspension of Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia and cancellation of decision on Aug. 31 as withdrawal deadline," Zotov told a Latvian newspaper Friday [22 April]. "The end of August is not far away and if the signing of all four agreements is longer delayed we will start to suspect Latvia of an intention to evade the signature," Zotov told the nationwide DIENA newspaper. The Russian delegation head asked Latvians not to overdramatize the situation, though. He and his delegation plan to tour Riga next week to meet with Latvian negotiators. No concrete date for the meeting has been fixed yet. The trip will be aimed at preparing the visit of Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis in Moscow during which he will meet with his Latvian counterpart Boris Yeltsin, said Zotov. Zotov claimed that the day of the presidential summit was unknown yet but Latvian media reported earlier this week that the presidents would meet on April 30. Latvian experts spent in Moscow three days this week and met with Russian colleagues in a bid to soften the agreement on social guarantees for military pensioners, sources told DIENA. A source said that Latvia can hope for little and not serious changes in the agreement on Russian war pensioners, which grant them broad social guarantees, like easy access to residency permits. As reported, Russia expected Ulmanis to sign the package April 21 but the Latvian parliament failed to adopt a decision authorizing him to do so.
