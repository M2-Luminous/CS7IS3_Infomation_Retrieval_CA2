FR940407-2-00061 FR940407-2-00036 States generally are precluded from enforcing their civil regulatory programs on Tribal lands, absent an explicit Congressional authorization or State-Tribal agreement to do so. California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U.S. 202, 216 and n.18 (1987). Yet, under the current statutory scheme, EPA generally is precluded from enforcing the MSWLF Criteria as well. Furthermore, Congress has not yet created an explicit role for Tribes to implement the subtitle D program, as it has done under most other major environmental statutes amended since 1986 (Safe Drinking Water Act, CERCLA, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act). RCRA does not explicitly define a role for Tribes under sections 4005 and 4010 and reflects an undeniable ambiguity in Congressional intent. Indeed, the only mention of Tribes anywhere in RCRA is in section 1004(13), a part of the ``Definitions'' of key terms in RCRA. Section 1004(13) defines the term ``municipality'' to mean: A city, town, borough, county, parish, district or other public body created by or pursuant to State law, with responsibility for the planning or administration or solid waste management, or any Indian tribe or authorized tribal organization or Alaska Native village or organization[.] Id. (emphasis added). The term ``municipality'', in turn, is used in sections 4008(a)(2) and 4009(a) of RCRA with reference to the availability of certain Federal funds and technical assistance for solid waste planning and management activities by municipalities. Thus, Congress apparently intended to make explicit that Tribes could receive funds and assistance when available in the same manner as municipal governments. However, Congress did not explicitly recognize any other role for Tribes under other provisions. There is no accompanying legislative history which explains why Tribes were included in section 1004(13) and nowhere else. EPA does not believe that Congress, by including Tribes in section 1004(13), intended to prohibit EPA from allowing Tribes to apply for an adequacy determination under subtitle D. First of all, it is clear that Tribes are not ``municipalities'' in the traditional sense. Tribes are not ``public bodies created by or pursuant to State law.'' Indeed, Tribes are not subject to State law except in very limited circumstances. Cabazon, supra . Indian Tribes are sovereign governments whose authority is subject only to Congressional approval. Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (10 Pet.) 515 (1832). There is no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to abrogate any sovereign Tribal authority by defining them as ``municipalities'' under RCRA, i.e., that Congress intended section 1004(13) to subject Tribes to State law for RCRA purposes. Moreover, it is a well-established principle of statutory construction that Federal statutes which might arguably abridge Tribal powers of self-government must be construed narrowly in favor of retaining Tribal rights. F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law, 224 (1981); See, e.g. Ramah Navajo School Board v. Bureau of Revenue, 458 U.S. 832, 846 (1982). EPA believes that inclusion of Indian Tribes in section 1004(13) was a definitional expedient, to avoid having to include the phrase ``and Indian tribes or tribal organizations or Alaska Native villages or organizations'' wherever the term ``municipality'' appeared, not to change the sovereign status of Tribes for RCRA purposes. Second, given the limited number of times the term ``municipality'' appears in RCRA, it does not appear that Congress intended to define an all-inclusive role for Tribes for all potential statutory purposes. The ambiguity in RCRA regarding Indian Tribes also is evident from the structure of the 1984 Amendments. As mentioned earlier, Congress expressed a strong preference for a State lead in ensuring compliance with 40 CFR part 258, in that section 4005(c) allows EPA to enforce the Criteria only after a finding of inadequacy of the State permit program. Yet, the legislative history of the 1984 Amendments does not suggest that Congress intended to authorize States to implement such programs on Tribal lands or that Congress intended to override the general legal principle that States generally are precluded from such implementation. Cf. Washington Dept. of Ecology v. EPA, 752 F.2d 1465 (9th Cir. 1985) (RCRA Subtitle C does not constitute an explicit delegation of authority to States to implement hazardous waste programs on Indian lands); accord, Nance v. EPA 1 , 645 F.2d 701 (9th Cir. 1981). Thus, Congress has otherwise put States in a primary role for the MSWLF program, yet on Indian lands has failed to define how Tribes participate where States lack authority. EPA believes it necessary to harmonize the conflicts and resolve the ambiguities created by these provisions. 1 By today's action EPA does not intend to prohibit a State from applying for approval of its MSWLF program extending to Indian lands. However, the State would either have to enter into an agreement with a Tribe or show the existence of specific Congressional authorization or independent civil regulatory authority to regulate these landfills. See, e.g., 53 FR 43080 (1988) (Washington application to regulate UIC wells on Indian lands). EPA concludes that interpreting sections 4005, 4008, and 4010 to allow Indian Tribes to seek an adequacy determination is reasonable. Several factors enter into this determination. First, as discussed in the previous paragraph, this approach is consistent with subtitle D because it preserves Congressional intent to limit the Federal government's role in MSWLF programs. Absent the opportunity to seek a determination of adequacy, there would be few or no adequate permit programs in place on Indian lands (because the State lacked the authority and the Tribe could not apply for program approval), requiring the Federal government to assume a substantial role in MSWLF programs by having EPA enforce 40 CFR part 258 directly.
