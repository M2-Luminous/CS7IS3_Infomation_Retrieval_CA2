Most of these attacks were reported in the local press but not confirmed officially. This new outbreak of terrorism follows intensified repression operations in all of Algeria since mid-March. According to a nonofficial estimate made by the AFP, over 600 alleged Islamists, some 30 members of the security forces and over 100 civilians (including six foreigners: four Frenchmen, one Russian, and one Vietnamese) were killed during that period. That is a total of over 700 dead. The offensive of the security forces is said to account for the lack of progress of the "dialogue" with imprisoned leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] initiated late last year by the government. Although many believe that these contacts continue, the government does not seem in a hurry to meet the demands of the Islamist movement. The latter demands, among other things, that its leaders be released or put on probation, and it asks for a speedy return to the electoral process. A few days from the Aid El Adha (Feast of the Sacrifice), which will be celebrated next Saturday, the recurring rumor of a possible release of banned-FIS leaders, including Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, is circulating again. So far, however, there is no indication that the government is planning any gesture of clemency. Simultaneously with intensified military repression, special courts have pronounced several tens of new death sentences since the beginning of May. Last Sunday, the Algiers and Oran special courts alone sentenced 34 individuals to capital punishment. These verdicts bring to 489 the number of death sentences pronounced since special courts took office on 22 February 1993. So far, 26 of these sentences have been carried out. The development of the Algerian crisis was debated at length last Monday in Brussels by the European Union (EU) foreign affairs ministers. To try and prevent an "Islamic swing over" that would have "incalculable consequences," "the only card we can play is the economic card," the French foreign affairs minister, Alain Juppe, stated. As a result, on Monday 16 May, the foreign affairs ministers agreed to immediately grant Algeria a loan of 150 million ECUs [European currency units] (990 million French francs), representing the second installment of a balance-of-payment support loan promised in 1991. The Twelve also agreed to consider a new loan of 200 million ECUs (also in the form of a balance-of-payment support loan) by the end of the year, subject to a favorable decision by the IMF and the Paris Club.
