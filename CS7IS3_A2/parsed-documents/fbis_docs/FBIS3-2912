Finance Minister Liu Zhongli, entrusted by the State Council, delivered an explanation on the draft law. "Budget is a major means for the state to administer social and economic affairs and strengthen macro-economic control and its plays an important role in the state political and economic affairs," he said. Formulation, examination and approval, implementation, readjustment and supervision of budget have had a lot of loopholes for a long time because China has lacked the law governing budgetary management, he said. The draft budget law consists of 78 articles in 11 chapters. It clearly stipulates that after approval by the People's Congress at the same level, a budget has a binding force and must be implemented. No one shall change the budget without legal procedures and authorization. The stipulation is aimed at turning round the situation in which arbitrary change of budget and softening the binding force of budget often occur. The draft law has also legalized formulation, approval, implementation and readjustment of budget and formulation and approval of final state accounts. According to the draft law, the National People's Congress approves the budget of the central government only and the people's congresses above the county level approve budgets of the local governments at the same level only. The regulations will help solve contradictions and problems in the existing budgetary examination and approval procedures and increase the responsibility of people's congresses and governments at different levels, Liu said. Article 27 and 28 in the draft read: the budget of the central government shall not include deficit; the budgets of local governments shall follow the principle of keeping expenditures within limits of revenues and shall not list deficit. The draft also stipulates that budgets of governments at various levels shall set aside reserves according to a certain ratio of the expenditures of the governments, which will be used to tide over natural catastrophes and other extraordinary special expenditures. Financial experts here said that it is imperative to enact the budget law to realize administration of financial affairs according to law. The first draft was submitted for deliberation to the fourth meeting of the eighth October Standing Committee last October and revised according to opinions of the Standing Committee members afterward.
