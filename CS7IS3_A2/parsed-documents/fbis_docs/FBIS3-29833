The article says scientific accuracy and revolutionary nature of the chuche-based idea of socialism finds a graphic expression in the ideology and theories on the essence of socialist society expounded by it. It further says: Our party's chuche-based idea of socialism is the first in history to give a clear exposition of the essence of socialist society with the popular masses in the centre. The essence of socialist society expounded by the chuche-based idea of socialism is, above all, that socialism is a society under which the popular masses are the masters of everything. It is the socialist society under which all the people have valuable socio-political integrity and live a worthy life, enjoying genuine political freedom and rights to the full. This is a fundamental characteristic of the socialist society different from the exploiter society. As the chuche-based idea of socialism expounds that the socialist society is the society under which the popular masses are the masters of everything, the popular nature of the socialist society has become clear. The ideology and theory are a weapon that deals a telling blow at the imperialists who are engaged in malicious slander against socialism under the cloak of bourgeois democracy. The chuche-based idea of socialism also makes clear that socialism is a society under which everything serves the popular masses. All the policies of the working-class party and state in the socialist society proceed from what they should do to provide the people with better life, and they are entirely subordinated to this purpose. The essence of the socialist society expounded by the chuche- based idea of socialism is also that socialism is a society that is steadily developed by the united efforts of the popular masses. The basic characteristic of the socialist society different from the exploiter society is that it is a society under which the entire people are firmly united on the basis of a single ideology and is developed by the united strength of the popular masses. The socialist society has socio-political conditions to unite all the people on the basis of a single ideology for they have common purpose and interests. As it definitely achieves the unity and cohesion of the entire people, the socialist society gives a strong impetus to the development of society. This has vividly been proved by the proud reality of our- style socialism that is making a long drive, surmounting all the ordeals of history with the might of singlehearted unity. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il developed to perfection from a new angle the socialist idea of chuche and gave a clear exposition of the essence of the socialist society. This is a noteworthy event of great significance in the accomplishment of the Korean people's and world revolutionary people's cause of independence, the cause of socialism, stresses the article.
