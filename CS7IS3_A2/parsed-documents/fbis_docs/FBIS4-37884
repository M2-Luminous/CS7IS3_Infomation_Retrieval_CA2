Arab political circles in some Arab countries began to discuss these questions after they received secret diplomatic reports from Tehran that a new plan was under way to rebuild Shiite organizations in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain and to increase financial and political support for extremist Islamic organizations in Palestine and Lebanon. The information AL-MUHARRIR has received indicates that Tehran has allocated large amounts of money to cover the activities of its satellite organizations. Figures in this regard show that millions of dollars have been allocated to rebuild and breathe a new life into Shiite organizations in the Arabian Gulf region. The main organizations and the amounts of money they will receive are as follows: - The Islamic Front for the Liberation of Iraq, which will receive $100,000 per month. - The Iraqi al-Da'wah Party, which will receive $150,000 per month. - The Popular Front for the Liberation of the Arabian Peninsula, an anti-Saudi organization, which will receive $150,000 per month. - The Islamic Movement for the Liberation of Bahrain, which will receive $70,000 per month. It is worth mentioning that these four organizations have offices in Tehran. Diplomatic reports say that by supporting these organizations, Iran is seeking to stir up unrest in Gulf countries to restore Iranian influence, which prevailed during Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's reign and which diminished gradually after the mullahs controlled the government and after the end of the Iraq-Iran war. Reports also say that pro-Iranian organizations carried out bombing operations in Kuwait years before the entry of the Iraqi forces in it. They add that Iran was responsible for some bombing operations and shootouts that occurred in Kuwait after the return of al-Sabah family to power. The same diplomatic reports say that the Iranian leadership has drawn up a new plan to support the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, led by Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, and to provide necessary amounts of money to the movement to enable it to build bases in the occupied territories. Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, presented al-Shaqaqi to the Iranian officials. Since then, the latter has been receiving $100,000 per month to cover the costs of his organization in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, in addition to other amounts of money being paid to the occupied territories' branch through special channels.
