However, as has been said more than once, the war has not ended and it is only a matter of time before it begins again. Consequently, the renewal of combat actions in Abkhazia is unavoidable. Therefore, it would be better for us to take into account those military mistakes or technical failures that took place during the course of the conflict. In spite of the self-sacrifice of Georgian fighters, these errors were, to a significant degree, responsible for the defeat of the Georgian Army and the loss first of Sukhumi and then the whole of Abkhazia. Without a State Army: The process of forming a single Georgian army has been going on for several years now. However, almost nothing has been done in this respect. A hastily formed, untrained, undisciplined army will not be able to win a war. Any person with a military education knows that an army is formed through incessant training at barracks. In this respect, the situation is bad. The barracks, firing ranges, and military bases that Russia transferred to the Georgian Ministry of Defense are in a demolished state. Many are, in general, abandoned military installations that do not have the appropriate military contingent and that have been plundered by the local population. However, once repaired and provided with elementary defense, they will play a decisive role in the formation of the Georgian Army. There are significant problems within the military commissariats that are unable to call up the necessary number of young persons for service in the armed forces. The reason is simple: The commissariat is a bureaucratic body. Due to thousands of "arrangements" and machinations, conscripts have easily been able to avoid compulsory military service. If this body is not reformed or replaced by another structure, we will not be able to achieve the desired results. We have to create an institution that will punish with the full severity of the law those persons who avoid service in the armed forces. The lack of officer cadres remains an unresolved problem. On the initiative of the Ministry of Defense, Georgian and non-Georgian officers serving in the Russian Army have started to be brought into the national army. However, unless there is an improvement in the social situation of officers, this priceless treasure will slip out of our hands. The existence of armed formations remains an insurmountable barrier to the creation of an army. These subunits are not accountable to anyone and, in a number of cases, appear almost as bandit detachments. It has been repeatedly stated that they are to join the official armed forces but, in reality, nothing has changed. Quite recently, the republic's defense minister again issued an order on the necessity of all military formations becoming part of a single army and on providing the sides that participated in the Abkhazian conflict with weapons and technical equipment. Naturally, the nonexistence of a trained army played a big role in the defeat in Abkhazia. However, the antiquity of Georgian military equipment and weapons had decisive importance. At the initial stage of the conflict, the Abkhazians had a qualitative rather than quantitative advantage in equipment over their opponents. However, following violation of the Sochi agreement [signed on 27 July 1993], they also had quantitative superiority. Armored equipment: The existing conflicts on the territory of the former Soviet Union have clearly shown the importance of armored equipment in conditions of war. In today's conditions, having modern armored forces that have been tactically trained means being halfway toward winning a war. Unfortunately, Georgia has nothing to boast about regarding its armored equipment. Of all the former Soviet republics, Georgia was the one that received the most antiquated and worthless equipment. Whereas Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan received modern armored vehicles (T-72, T-80, BTR-80, and so forth) from the Russian Army, Georgia, on the other hand, was given tanks and APC's (T-54, T-55, T-62, BTR-60BP, and BRDM) dating from World War II and its aftermath. During the initial stage of the Abkhazian war, the Georgian side had a big advantage (in the main, quantitative) as far as armored equipment was concerned. However, the situation gradually changed. The Abkhazians had in their weaponry: T-72, T-55, BTR-80, MT-LB, and so forth. The defenders of Gagra and Sukhumi were astonished by the qualities of the so-called "uncapturable" T-72 tank. It was impossible to destroy it with small-caliber guns and the RPG-7 and "Mukha" [antitank] rocket launchers. The IFV-2 also worked well for the Abkhazian side, a vehicle which, for the most part, is an improved version of the IFV-1 in possession of the Georgians, the only difference being that it has a semi-automatic gun (while the IFV-1 is still loading a shell, its new modification manages to fire 10). Of the new Russian weapons that were used by the Abkhazians, it is worth singling out the antitank guided missile. This missile was responsible for destroying a large number of tanks on the Georgian side. These were fired, in the main, from the [seismic] laboratory in Zemo Eshera. The importance of armored equipment is also borne out by the opinion of the majority of the defenders of Sukhumi, according to which the city would not have fallen if they had possessed tanks. Artillery: At the start of the conflict, the Abkhazians found themselves in a difficult situation as they practically had no artillery. They had innumerable automatic weapons, machine guns, rocket launchers, but no cannons and howitzers; by rarely using 85 mm D-44-type cannons, it was impossible to destroy the many Georgian tanks and, in general, inflict serious damage upon the enemy. However, as time passed, the Abkhazians acquired all the modern artillery currently to be found on the territory of the former USSR. Their weaponry included 122 mm D-30 howitzers and 152 mm self-propelled artillery systems (2S-3 "Akatsiya" and 2S-1 "Mimoza"), and they also later acquired the so- called "Grad" launcher vehicle, which is capable of salvo fire and has a huge destructive force. The Georgian Armed Forces did not lag behind the enemy as far as artillery was concerned; as a result of the selfless struggle of artillerymen, Sukhumi escaped being taken on several occasions. The plethora of artillery and the lack of qualifications of those operating it (thanks to Russian military instructors, the combat capabilities of Abkhazian artillery significantly increased during the final period of the conflict) conditioned the destructive and devastating character of combat actions. This was shown by the burned-down city of Sukhumi and the destroyed villages in Ochamchire rayon. Aviation: Georgian aviation was produced, in the main, at the former Dimitrov 31st Aviation Factory (Su-25 fighters) although the Georgian Ministry of Defense did receive a squadron of strike [damrtqmeli] helicopters (Mi-24 and Mi-8 MT). Our aviation took an active part in the Abkhazian war but it also incurred big losses. By using antiaircraft missile systems, the Abkhazians succeeded in shooting down several planes and helicopters (Su-25, Mi-24, and Mi-8 MT). Such losses incurred by Georgian aviation are wholly understandable since we had neither fighter-interceptors (Su-27, MiG-29) nor combat radar systems, as a result of which our aviation became an easy prey for Abkhazian antiaircraft defense and fighters. It is a joke to speak about Abkhazian aviation. It would be more correct for us to speak about Russian aviation that was hired by the Abkhazians and that actively participated in the conflict: Su-25's bombed and reconnoitered Georgian positions and Mi-24's also frequently took part in battles; however, it was the Su-25's that carefully protected the aforementioned fighting vehicles. In spite of the high caliber of Russian pilots and the poor capabilities of Georgian antiaircraft defense, the Georgians did succeed in shooting down Mi-24's, Mi-8 MT's, and, most importantly, Su-25's. Antiaircraft Defense: It would not be an exaggeration to say that antiaircraft defense brought the greatest advantage to the sides fighting in the Abkhazian war. This was particularly true in the case of the Abkhazians. By means of the "Igla," "Strela," and "Osa," portable antiaircraft missile systems and the "Su-25" [as published] "Shilka" self-propelled antiaircraft gun, they were able to neutralize Georgian aviation. The "Osa" was particularly effective in this respect. It should be said here that, according to certain sources of information, the latest antiaircraft systems located in Gudauta were also used in battles. It is true that the antiaircraft defense of the Georgian Armed Forces was not equipped technically to the same level as that of the Abkhazians. Nevertheless, it also achieved certain results. The date 19 March 1993 represents a landmark in the history of our antiaircraft defense. On this day, a Su-27 fighter-interceptor (tail number 11) belonging to the Russian Army and piloted by Major Vatslav Shipko was shot down. In addition, several assault aircraft and strike helicopters belonging to the Russian Army and based at the Babushera military airfield were destroyed. If we do not take into account barges and "Kometa" [launches] on which heavy-caliber machine guns, guns, and "Grad" launchers were installed, the sides involved in the fighting did not have navies. By using these means, it was impossible to carry out precise bombing of the opposing side's positions and it resulted only in destruction and the killing of the peaceful population. Such an Abkhazian navy presented a danger for Georgian aviation as they had portable antiaircraft systems on the launches, which enabled them to destroy several Su-25's belonging to the Georgian Armed Forces and several passenger aircraft belonging to the "Orbi" Aviation Company. At the same time, it was established that vessels belonging to the Russian Black Sea Fleet were participating directly in battles on the Abkhazian side. For example, the combatant ship "Bezukoriznennyy" fought against the Georgians. The one thing for which the Abkhazians made superb use of their so-called navy was landing an amphibious assault force, which caused considerable damage to Georgian military formations. Fire arms and rocket launchers: In this war, different types of Kalashnikov assault rifles [AK] were widely used. The Kalashnikov improved assault rifle (7.62 mm) [AKM] proved to be particularly effective. A 5.45 mm bullet from the AK-74 and AKS [folding-stock assault rifle] changed its trajectory when fired in cornfields or mandarin groves in contrast to a bullet fired from the AKS [as published] that did not change its trajectory. In this respect, the Abkhazians were at an advantage. They were armed, in the main, with AKM's and a rocket launcher of the same make that was unrivalled in street battles. Of the Kalashnikov assault rifles, one can single out the 7.62 mm Kalashnikov medium machine gun and the 12.7 mm Degtyarev-Shpagin heavy machine gun. These weapons represented a big force in battles in forests and ravines. Snipers also played their part in the fighting. They used the Dragunov and Tokarev semiautomatic sniping rifles. It is significant that there were many female snipers on the Abkhazian side. One of the "heroes" of the Georgian-Abkhazian armed conflict was the rocket launcher. On account of geographical conditions, it proved to be the most effective weapon in this war. It was used both to destroy armored equipment and to bomb positions. The Abkhazians undoubtedly held the advantage regarding this type of weapon. The sides involved in the fighting had the RPG-7, RPG-18, "Mukha," RPG-22, "Osa," and the 30 mm AGS [expansion unknown] rocket launcher. Proceeding from all the aforementioned, one can draw the following conclusion: The Georgian defeat in Abkhazia resulted from having an army that was untrained and lacking in discipline at an elementary level and having antiquated military-technical capabilities compared with the Abkhazian side. Therefore, if we want to achieve any kind of military success in the future, we should start eradicating these shortcomings now.
