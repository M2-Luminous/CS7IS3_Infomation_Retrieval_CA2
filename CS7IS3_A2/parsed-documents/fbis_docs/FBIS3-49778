M.: "Another Depos in the Play?"] [Text] As BORBA has unofficially learned from sources close to the leadership of the Serbian Renewal Movement, some of the membership would like to try to "enliven" the work of Depos [Democratic Movement of Serbia], but a Depos essentially different from the one that exists at present. In addition to the Serbian Renewal Movement and the unaffiliated members from the original Depos, the new Depos would also have place for the Democratic Party (the section that supports Zoran Djindjic), the Democratic Party of Serbia, and the Peasant Party of Milomir Babic.
