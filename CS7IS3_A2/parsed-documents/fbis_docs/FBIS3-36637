He believes that the Ukrainian parliament's resolution on the ratification of the START-I treaty, passed on February 4, 1994, has many "ambiguous places." It does not say, for instance, what percentage of nuclear weapons is to be eliminated. Dubinin said that on November 18, 1993, the Ukrainian parliament passed the resolution on the ratification of the START-I treaty, according to which only 36% of the Ukrainian missiles and 42% of the warheads were to be eliminated. "This goes against both the START-I treaty and the Lisbon agreements. It's still unclear whether Ukraine intends to eliminate 100% of the nuclear weapons located on its territory in strict accordance with the START-I treaty and the Lisbon protocol," he said. According to Dubinin, neither is it clear whether Ukraine will join the nonproliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state. Speaking about Ukraine's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, he said that Russia is approaching this issue calmly. "Russia has already supported the partnership concept. Why should Ukraine not join it?" he said.
