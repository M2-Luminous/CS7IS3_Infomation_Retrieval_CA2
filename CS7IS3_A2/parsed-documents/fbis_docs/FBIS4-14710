The representatives of the movement "For a Peaceful Abkhazia!" are appealing to you once again. Our dear brothers and sisters! History will not forgive our indifference and passivity in the face of the total catastrophe threatening the small Abkhazian nation. Therefore, we appealed to the UN secretary general, the president of the Russian Federation, and the chairman of the Republic of Georgia Parliament-head of state to adopt the most urgent and cardinal measures for the most speedy peaceful settlement in Abkhazia. In our appeal, we asked them to use all the levers at their disposal to force Ardzinba and his grouping to engage in a constructive dialogue, abandon their sick ambitions of which the Abkhazian people and the representatives of other nations living in Abkhazia have become hostages. In our appeal, we warned that, if our voice was not heard, we would be forced to oppose the Ardzinba regime with weapons in our hands because the fate of the Abkhazian people was in danger. Unfortunately, no one, as yet, has responded to our appeal. Therefore, we ask all those who hold dear the fate of our fine motherland Abkhazia and the fate of our children: Help us so that our voice may be heard by the authoritative leaders of international organizations and the heads of states and social movements who could contribute to the matter of the speediest settlement of the conflict. We appeal once more to all the inhabitants of Abkhazia, to all who, by the will of fate, found themselves on Abkhazian land with weapons in their hands: Enough bloodshed and violence! Let the coming spring of 1994 be a spring of hope and peace! Our appeal is not a cry of despair; it is a call from the souls of people who realize that we all stand on the edge of the abyss. We are ready to turn our weapons on those politicians who have lost their sense of reality in order to prevent our people from perishing.
