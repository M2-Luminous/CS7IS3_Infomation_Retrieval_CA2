According to statistics from the region, it had 353,700 poor families comprising more than 1.6 million people by the end of 1985. To help these people shake off poverty, the region put more efforts into teaching them agricultural technologies and techniques rather than simply giving them money as before. The regional commission of science and technology, the regional women's federation and the agricultural department of the region have composed a complete program to aid the poor by setting up evening schools and training classes and offering correspondence courses and hands-on teaching. By now, about 85 percent of the poor farmers and herdsmen have mastered one or two practical techniques. The region has also sent thousands of scientists and technicians to the grassroots level to help the poor people. As the region suffers from a lack of rain, the regional government began to build 90 irrigation works in 1986. Now it has poured 300 million yuan into these projects, among which 46 have been completed. These projects have increased the reservoir water reserve of the region by 90 million cubic meters and irrigated more than 80,000 hectares of farmlands and grasslands.
