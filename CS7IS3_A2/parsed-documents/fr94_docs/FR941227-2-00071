FR941227-2-00071 FR941227-2-00051 Subject: Industrial Funding of Federal Supply Schedule Program. 1. Purpose. To provide guidance for industrial funding of the Federal Supply Schedule program in order to recover associated procurement and administrative costs incurred by the Federal Supply Service (FSS) for contracting through the schedules program. 2. Background. During the fiscal 1994 budget process, Congress directed FSS to review its appropriated activities for conversion to reimbursable funding. Based upon that review, the schedules program was identified as one of the programs suitable for reimbursable funding. The GSA fiscal year 1995 budget, therefore, reflected a $7.8 million reduction in operating expenses for the schedules program. The remaining appropriated monies for the program will be eliminated over the next two fiscal years. The cost of providing supplies and services through this program must therefore be included in the cost of those supplies and services. The Federal Supply Schedule Program is FSS' largest supply support program, accounting for over $2.8 billion in sales annually. The program benefits the customer agencies, as well as the contractors who participate in the program. Federal agencies benefit from the schedules program because it provides an expedited means for acquiring quality commercial products, including latest technology, at reasonable prices based on the Government's aggregate buying power. Contractors benefit from the program because it provides them a low cost entry into the Federal market. By obtaining a schedule contract with GSA, contractors avoid the administrative cost of responding to multiple solicitations from many different agencies. In order to better serve our customers and suppliers, FSS is implementing a single payment office, GSA, to handle schedule invoices. Agencies will continue to forward delivery/purchase orders directly to the schedule contractors, who will in turn deliver requisitioned items directly to the agencies. However, instead of invoicing the agencies, the contractors will submit their invoices (for both supplies and services) to the GSA Office of Finance for payment. GSA will bill the agencies. (See attached Outline of Payment/Billing Steps.) The new payment arrangement eliminates the agencies' responsibilities related to processing and paying thousands of invoices. Government payment offices will be billed twice a month by GSA. Based on the above, agencies should enjoy substantial administrative savings. GSA, as the single paying office, will be able to maximize timely payments, thus, avoiding interest charges and earning prompt payment discounts. Schedule contractors will benefit by not having to deal with numerous agency accounts payable offices. Further, they will no longer have to cope with a variety of different accounts payable procedures, since they will only be subject to GSA's procedures. As the single payment office, GSA's commendable record for timely payment of invoices will result in contractors being paid much quicker than many are now experiencing from some schedule users. GSA will recover the costs associated with contracting, billing, and payment of schedule purchases by adjusting the awarded price upward by one percent. This adjusted price will be the price printed in the schedule contract pricelist. GSA's negotiation objectives will include consideration of the new simplified payment terms and conditions and will seek discount concessions recognizing the benefits to contractors of streamlined payment procedures. Contractors will bill GSA at the negotiated contract prices. GSA's billings to ordering activities will be at the printed schedule pricelist amounts. The present strategy calls for a 3-year implementation beginning in fiscal year 1995. As current schedules expire, new basic solicitations will include the new clauses which will provide for funding of the program. At the completion of the 3-year implementation period, any existing contracts that do not contain the new clauses will be modified to incorporate these provisions. The implementation schedule may be expedited contingent and consistent with changes in GSA's appropriations. 3. Effective Date. This Acquisition Letter becomes effective two weeks after its signature date. 4. Expiration Date. This Acquisition Letter expires one year from the effective date, or upon inclusion in the Supply Operations Handbook, FSS P 2901.2A, whichever occurs earlier.
