The aircraft that were shot down, according to him, refused prior to this to heed a warning and make a forced landing. The official NATO representative stated that U.S. F-16 fighter aircraft participated as part of NATO forces in the shooting down of the planes. He also said the U.S. planes flew from one of the bases in Italy. The official NATO representative said first that the planes that were shot down either belonged to the "Bosnian Serbs" or to Serbia. He later corrected himself, saying that they flew from territory controlled by Bosnian Serbs. He also recalled that the NATO planes were authorized to take action on the basis of the Security Council resolution banning flights over Bosnia. This ban, according to him, was infringed by a total of six Galeb-type planes, but two planes from this group succeeded in avoiding being shot down. The same representative failed to reply to a question as to whether this was an isolated incident or an action with more serious consequences. He also refused to comment in any other way on this incident, of which he said only that it took place early this morning.
