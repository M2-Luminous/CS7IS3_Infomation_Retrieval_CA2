According to the amended law, candidacies to the presidential post shall be advanced by parties, inter-party blocs and electors' conferences. (The old law envisaged the advancement of candidates on their own initiative, or by worker groups - Interfax). The advancement of candidates shall begin 3 months before and end 2 months before elections. A candidate that has collected 100,000 signatures shall be allowed to run an election campaign. The new law has a provision which obliges a candidate to collect at least 1,500 signatures in two thirds of the total number of electoral districts. Elections shall be held in 27 electoral districts - in all regions and the cities of Kiev and Sevastopol. A candidate who has scored more than half of the votes shall be considered elected to the post of president. Elections shall be considered valid if more than 50% of the electors take part in them. If none of the candidates scores the required number of votes, a second round is held involving two candidates supported by the largest number of electors. During the second voting, a candidate who scores more "pros" than "cons" shall be considered elected to the presidential post. Presidential elections shall be held on June 26. Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk announced this week that he would not run for presidency. Explaining his decision, Kravchuk said that presidential elections should hardly be held just three months after parliamentary elections, scheduled for March 27. He pointed out that although he did not oppose the idea of presidential elections, he believes that amid the current economic crisis such prompt elections might overly politicize society. The president's and Cabinet's press service circulated a statement which clarifies Leonid Kravchuk's position. It says, among other things, that Kravchuk's position reflects the current situation and prospects for its development. The president does not rule out, it goes on to say, that elections to parliament and executive bodies may go beyond the allotted time limit and overlap with early presidential elections and elections to the local governments, all of which may cause vacuum of power, whereby the old parliament would cease to exist, while a new parliament and cabinet would not be formed up. Given this, only president can run the state. If the president announces early elections in such a situation, the executive bodies may fall part and the reigns of state power might be utterly lost. Meanwhile, RUKH [Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka] leader Vyachesav Chernovil (Kravchuk's rival during the elections in December 1991 -- Interfax) qualified Kravchuk's refusal to run for presidency as a tactical game. "This does not mean that Kravchuk has firmly decided not to run for presidency," he told Interfax. He also said that the press service's statement does not say a word bout his refusal to participate in the election campaign and that Kravchuk's moves are aimed at undermining presidential elections, at least in June.
