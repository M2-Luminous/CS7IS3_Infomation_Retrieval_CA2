The largest planning body, the State Planning Commission, actually redefined the role of planning and investment when it recently announced more reform measures. "All that the market can manage should be left to be managed by the market," said Gui Shiyong, vice-minister of the commission. Planning departments should restrict their activities to those that the market cannot do or has failed to do well, he added. Between 1949 and 1992, the government favoured a centrally planned economy. Planners' tasks were gargantuan, controlling virtually every aspect of national life. But this has made decentralization of planning and investment a task of similar magnitude. Thankfully, the efforts have been successful, Vice-Minister Gui said. After almost 15 years of reform, local governments and enterprises have more decision-making power and possess more self-supplied funds, financial revenue? foreign exchange, as well as rights for investment. Directive plans on agricultural production were cancelled in 1985. As for industrial production, goods fulfilling directive plans make up only 4.5 percent of total industrial output. Concerning retail sales, only 5 percent of goods in shops are tagged with imposed directive prices. With less directives to keep them busy, planning groups have shifted their function to broad oversight of the economy. That means less administration but more economic policies and legislative methods. However, the existing planning and investment system still fails to meet market requirements, said Gui. Outlining the necessary scope, he highlighted the function of planning, the content of plans and new methods of implementing reform. There is a lack of co-ordination among various regulatory means such as taxes, pricing, interest and exchange rates, he said. The public seldom participates in formulating plans, and planning law is rather weak. Administrative interference still hampers the decision-making process of enterprises. What's more, self-restraint has not been established in the investment system, said Gui. Since State subsidies remain in many enterprises and projects to keep their operation alive, their individual investors are not actually responsible for them. The main spur to decentralize came at the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October 1992 when the socialist market economy was conceived. That meant giving the market the natural power, while downgrading central planning to a regulatory and aid role. The State Planning Commission's latest reform aims to replace most administrative controls with economic regulations. For the few cases in which administrative methods and mandatory planning are actually needed, the methods should be improved in accordance with the requirements of the market economy. Local authorities need to be fully involved in the planning on the premise of guaranteeing the unity and authority of the central government, said Gui. Powers such as issuing currency, determining bench-mark interest rates, regulating exchange rates and adjusting major tax categories and tax rates should all be controlled by the central government. Economic affairs like local economic development and market activities can be organized by local authorities. Public participation in designing and implementing plans should be strengthened. This would be more open, scientific and effective, he said. The commission has already worked out more reform measures for the investment system. A new system will strengthen responsibility of enterprises as well as banks, according to Gui. When a project is constructed, certain enterprises must be identified as being responsible for it--from drafting the process, raising funds, constructing or producing to repay bank loans and bonds, as well as monitoring the appreciation of the asset's value. A similar responsibility system should also be established in banks. For project approval, a registration system will gradually replace administrative examination and approval. Competitive projects with high profit returns and sensitivity to market factors will be left to enterprises themselves, with both decision-making power and risk responsibility given to the management. Enterprises will mainly raise funds from commercial banks, and the government will gradually withdraw their investments in these projects. The government will prioritize infrastructure projects and foundation industries as well as public welfare, science, education, culture and public health. Control on the total amount and structure of investment should be strengthened, Gui said. The State Development Bank, one of major regulatory means, was established recently to play a positive role in directing and adjusting investment. This can be accomplished through its policy loans, together with other measures such as taxes, interest rates and prices. A market system which involves advisory, design, construction, auditing, and supervision of projects needs to provide assistance for enterprises. Meanwhile, relative laws and regulations should be made to ensure orderly investment activities.
