FR940804-0-00091 FR940804-0-00023 What further action the section 504 agency will take will depend on the EEOC's (or, as appropriate, the Civil Rights Division's) findings, conclusions, and resolution. This rule contemplates that in most cases the ``further action'' would be that the section 504 agency would notify the complainant and the respondent that it is closing its file based upon the EEOC's resolution of the charge. For example, closure by the section 504 agency would be the appropriate action when: (i) the EEOC found no cause and issued a right-to-sue letter, and the section 504 agency agreed with the determination that no violation occurred; or (ii) the EEOC found cause and the violation was completely remedied through either a conciliation agreement or litigation, and the section 504 agency agreed that the violation had been remedied. Section XX .11␣EEOC Review of Deferred Charges Section XX .11 describes the steps that shall be taken when a section 504 agency processes a dual-filed complaint or charge and the EEOC defers its processing of the charge. Paragraph (a) of § XX .11 outlines the different ways in which a section 504 complaint may be resolved. Referral to, and action by, the Civil Rights Division is included in § XX .11(a) because one of the options available to a section 504 agency, when it has found a violation and it has not been able to negotiate a voluntary compliance agreement, is referral to the Civil Rights Division for judicial enforcement. Paragraphs (b) and (d) of § XX .11 impose the same types of obligations on the section 504 agency to notify the EEOC of its resolution of the complaint and to share with the EEOC any materials related to the resolution of the complaint that would permit the EEOC to evaluate the findings, as paragraphs (b) and (d) of § XX .10 impose on the EEOC. Paragraph (c) of § XX .11 imposes requirements on the EEOC analogous to those § XX .10(c) imposes on a section 504 agency. This paragraph contemplates that in most cases the appropriate ``further action'' would be that the EEOC would notify the charging party and the respondent that it is closing its file based upon the resolution of the complaint by the section 504 agency, and, where appropriate, would issue a right-to-sue letter. For example, closure and issuance of a right-to-sue letter by the EEOC would be the appropriate action when the section 504 agency found no violation and the EEOC agreed. Alternatively, closure alone would be appropriate when the section 504 agency found a violation and the EEOC agreed that the violation was completely remedied through either a conciliation agreement, an administrative hearing, or judicial enforcement.
