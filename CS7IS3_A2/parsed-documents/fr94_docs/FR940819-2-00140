ACTION: Notice; request for comments. SUMMARY: On April 28, 1994, the FHWA and the FTA Administrators jointly issued guidance to their respective regional administrators on the implementation of the Federal certification of the metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) (transportation management area (TMA)) planning process. This guidance outlines the principles and interim procedures that will be utilized in implementing the certification process required under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) and as further articulated in the US DOT regulations. This notice also announces the schedule of FY 1994 reviews as known at this time. As indicated in the attached certification guidance, the FHWA and FTA are planning approximately twenty reviews for FY 1994, approximately half of which will be pilots for the purpose of testing and refining the review process. Interested parties are invited to submit comments on the individual planning processes to be reviewed. DATES: Comments on metropolitan planning processes under review must be received within thirty (30) days of the scheduled review in order to be considered during the certification review process. Where reviews have already been held by the publication of this notice, individuals interested in commenting on them should immediately contact Sheldon Edner (see following paragraph for phone number and address and further instructions below). Where dates are to be announced, a supplemental notice announcing these dates will be issued when the specific dates are confirmed. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For FHWA: Mr. Sheldon Edner, Planning Operations Branch (HEP&hyph;21), (202) 366&hyph;4066 (metropolitan planning) or Mr. Reid Alsop, FHWA Office of the Chief Counsel (HCC&hyph;31), (202) 366&hyph;1371.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Sections 1024, 1025, and 3012 of the ISTEA, Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 1955, 1962, and 2098, amended title 23, U.S.C., and the Federal Transit Act by revising sections 134 and 135 of title 23 and section 8 of the Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C. app. 1607) which require a continuing, comprehensive, and coordinated transportation planning process in metropolitan areas and States. The FHWA and the FTA revised their previous metropolitan planning regulations to implement these changes and published the final regulations on October 28, 1993 (58 FR 58040). As part of an ongoing commitment to public involvement in the planning process, the FHWA and FTA are soliciting comments on this guidance. As the agencies conduct certification reviews in FY 1994 we will be looking at possible modifications based both on the experience of having conducted the reviews and on the comments received on the guidance and during the reviews. Specifically, the FHWA and FTA are interested in comments regarding the process of review, appropriate sources of information to be considered during the review, and the role of key government officials and the public in providing input to the review. General Additional Public Involvement in Certification Process The FHWA and FTA are soliciting public comment on the planning processes of the FY 1994 certification review sites identified below. The agencies are particularly interested in input regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the planning process in light of the requirements identified in 23 CFR 450 Subpart C. Additionally, the views of local officials and the public are welcomed regarding the use of the planning process in transportation investment decisions.
