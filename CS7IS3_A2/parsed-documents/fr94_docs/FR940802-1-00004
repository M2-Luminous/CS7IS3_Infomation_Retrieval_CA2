FR940802-1-00004 FR940802-1-00001 Sixty-two percent of the parents in the follow-up investigations reported that the child used the walker more than once a day. For each use, 37 percent reported that the child typically was in the walker for less than 30 minutes; 45 percent reported that for each use the child typically was in the walker for about 30&hyph;60 minutes. C. The Industry The Commission knows of 18 manufacturers or importers of baby walkers and jumpers. The leading manufacturer sells several times as many walkers as the next largest, and the top 9 brands or private labels are thought to account for about 60 percent of the market. D. Risks of Injury and Death Deaths. The Commission is aware of 11 deaths related to baby walkers that have occurred between 1989 and 1993. Of these, four children drowned, four suffocated, two fell down stairs, and one fell out of a walker and received a fatal head injury. In one of these incidents, the seat loosened, allowing the child to slip downward and suffocate when his trachea was compressed against the walker's tray. In all the other incidents, the walker may have provided the child with the mobility to access the hazard. The deaths reported to CPSC are not statistically representative, and may not include all the deaths associated with baby walkers during this time period. Also, with the exception of 1991, CPSC received death certificates from deaths classified as ``falls'' from only one or two states. Thus, the number of fall-related baby walker deaths known to CPSC is probably an undercount. Injuries. In 1993, there were an estimated 25,000 baby walker-related injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms in the United States. Baby walkers account for higher numbers of injuries annually than does any other type of nursery product. For example, in 1991, there were an estimated 10,400 injuries related to strollers and carriages, the nursery product category with the next highest number of estimated injuries. Based on an estimated 27,000 emergency-room-treated injuries to children under 15 months of age in 1991 and an estimated 4 million walkers in use, the estimated annual rate of injury is 6.75 injuries per 1,000 walkers in use. The most current data show a 12 percent increase in baby walker-related injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms for January through April 1994, compared to the same period in 1993.
