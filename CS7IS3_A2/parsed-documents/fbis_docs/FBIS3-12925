What do you expect in this regard? [Habash] What happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque is an odious and bloody massacre that severely shocked the national, Arab, and international levels. It is a massacre that shocked the human conscience everywhere. Whoever knows the history, nature, and mentality of the Zionist entity and the Zionist movement was not been surprised by this massacre. The Zionist history is rife with massacres. This bloody massacre has shattered any illusions about the nature of this fascist, racist, bloody entity. Most explicitly, I hold the Zionist entity's government and Rabin personally responsible for what was committed against our innocent and defenseless people at the Ibrahimi Mosque and the subsequent premeditated killing of the sons of our people who rose to express their indignation throughout the occupied homeland. As Rabin talks about peace, his troops and settlers continue their cold-blooded killing of innocent worshipers and our defenseless masses. It is ironic to claim that the perpetrator of the massacre was an insane settler. In fact, the massacre is the logical outcome of the policy of settlement and arming the herds of settlers from head to toe. It is the logical outcome of having an army addicted to killing and slaughtering. The United States also bears direct responsibility for this and other massacres, for it continues to protect the Zionist entity, cover its crimes, and does its utmost to spare the Zionist entity any harm, and even condemnation. This is most visible through its stands at the UN Security Council, where the U.S. Administration is desperately fighting to circumvent the horrible massacre and its indications and dimensions. The settlements spread over our territory are an absolute violation of all UN resolutions. Why are these resolutions not implemented immediately? Why doesn't the U.S. Administration show the same enthusiasm to enforce the will of the international community, that it shows when imposing its will and racism against the peoples of Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and other countries? There is no explanation for that except acceptance of what the Zionists are committing against our people to break their will and resistance and to peddle destructive schemes. In the same vein, I do not absolve the spineless Palestinian leadership from responsibility for the tragedies and massacres of our people. That leadership has abandoned all national rights and recognized the Zionist entity's right to exist on our soil and agreed in the Oslo-Cairo accords to keep the settlements and settlers implanted among the sons of our people. However, this leadership knows well these settlements' nature and expansionist and bloody objectives. He who allows the occupation and its troops and settlers to stay on our national soil bears direct responsibility for the occupation authorities' acts of killing, repression, and terrorism against our resisting people. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has strongly and glaringly exposed the falsehood of all Zionist-U.S.-'Arafatist demagoguery about the alleged peace. What is being offered is capitulation that maintains occupation and settlements and approves of the acts of repression and killing against our people. The crime is terrible and appalling. Therefore, we should be extremely vigilant to deny the U.S. and Zionist attempts to circumvent and contain this massacre through cosmetic measures any chances of success. 'Arafat and the Oslo team are striking a deceptive tone to absorb and contain the overwhelming and decisive popular reactions. The masses are well aware of the illusions and deceptive campaign that the spineless leadership has promoted after the signing of the Oslo and Cairo agreement. The masses are also aware of this leadership's deceptive talk about peace, security, prosperity, and sovereignty. Therefore, in view of this massacre, we explicitly state that our masses can be protected and their security maintained only through the departure of the occupation troops, the complete removal of settlements from our land, and recognition of our people's right to repatriation and statehood, including Jerusalem. This means that the humiliating agreements, which fundamentally contravene our national principles and rights, should be overturned. We are demanding an urgent popular and political movement pressing for the following: --Overturning the humiliating agreements which contravene our national rights. --Halting negotiations completely. --Removing the settlements from our land completely. --Providing international protection for our masses in the occupied homeland immediately in preparation for the Zionist army's full withdrawal. --After the failure of the U.S. course which started in Madrid and the subsequent agreements, leading up to the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, we are demanding a return to the international option and the UN resolutions approving our people's national, inalienable rights: The rights to repatriation, self-determination, and statehood, including Jerusalem, the capital of Palestine. This should be an alternative to the U.S. course. We hope that the massacre will constitute a turning point in the life of our Palestinian masses, the national, democratic, and Islamic political forces, and on the pan-Arab level to collectively confront the destructive Zionist-imperialist scheme and to maintain the option of struggle in order to attain our national and pan-Arab objectives.
