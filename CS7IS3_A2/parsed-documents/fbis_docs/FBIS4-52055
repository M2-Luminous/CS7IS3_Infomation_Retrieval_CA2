FBIS4-52055 "dreas088_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 North Korea Need for New U.S. `Peace Arrangement' Viewed Need for New U.S. `Peace Arrangement' Viewed SK0605052094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0504 GMT 6 May 94 SK0605052094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["World Is Watching U.S. Attitude" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Government in a Foreign Ministry statement April 28 proposed to the United States that the two countries hold negotiations for the establishment of a new peace arrangement which will help to check arms buildup and recurrence of war, stabilize the situation and reliably guarantee a durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula on a practical basis. How the United States approaches the DPRK's new peace overture for negotiations will be a touchstone proving whether it wants peace or war, declares NODONG SINMUN today. The news analyst says: It is imperative to replace the armistice agreement with a peace agreement and set up a new peace arrangement to take the place of the present armistice mechanism, if the hostile relations are to be removed and rapprochement is to be achieved between the DPRK and the USA and genuine peace and security are to be guaranteed on the Korean peninsula. The continued acute military confrontation on the Korean peninsula is attributable to the illegalities and the policy of antagonizing and stifling the DPRK on the part of the United States which has wantonly violated the Korean armistice agreement and paralyzed the armistice mechanism. If the present state of truce is to be maintained on the Korean peninsula, the signatories to the armistice agreement must fulfill their obligations pursuant to the agreement. Over the period of a little more than four decades, however, the United States has unilaterally and systematically broken and violated the provisions of the armistice agreement. Their violations of it have assumed more grave dimensions these days. As a matter of fact, the United States disowns the effectiveness of the agreement and even ignores its existence. The illegalities of the United States have reduced the armistice agreement to a mere sheet of paper and deprived it of the role as an institutional mechanism to prevent the aggravation of tensions and the danger of war. Due to the maneuvers of the United States, the armistice supervisory tool is paralyzed and the armistice mechanism is incapable of performing its function. With a view to concealing its violations of the armistice agreement, the United States unilaterally forced the inspection teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to withdraw from the U.N. command-controlled area and unilaterally designated a South Korean Army "general" as the chief delegate of the U.N. Command to the Military Armistice Commission, for which he is totally unqualified because of legal irrelevance, in gross violation of the Korean armistice agreement. The unreasonable behavior of the United States has reduced the Military Armistice Commission to a de facto nominal and inoperative body in which its legitimate component parties have ceased to exist. We can no longer entertain any expectation of the armistice agreement and the armistice mechanism, which remain only in name and are used for covering up the U.S. policy of strangling the DPRK. The nuclear issue and other acute problems cannot be settled on the Korean peninsula as long as there exists the present armistice arrangement under which the DPRK and the USA remain hostile parties. Facts show that only when the armistice agreement is replaced with a peace agreement and a new peace arrangement is set up to take the place of the present armistice mechanism will it be possible to remove the hostile relations and achieve reconciliation between the DPRK and the USA and preserve a genuine peace and security on the Korean peninsula. The United States must clearly see the essence of the situation and the reality and accede to peace negotiations with the DPRK.
