The move, estimated to bring in hundreds of millions of yuan, is an important step for Shanghai's comeback as a financial center for the Asia-Pacific region. Already a few banking giants, such as J.P. Morgan and Citibank from the United States, and Credit Lyonnais and Banque Indosuez from France, have shown intentions to set up branches or representative offices here. According to Shanghai's blueprint, Waitan, which claimed 113 bank buildings before 1949 and was transformed into the city's administrative center afterwards, will be built into China's "Wall Street". A special institute has been established by housing management units, to help relocate the departments in these former financial buildings mainly along the East Zhongshan Road. Since last year, quite a few buildings have changed ownership. For example, China foreign exchange center has used a building which previously belonged to the aerospace industry administration. Now, many units, such as the municipal trade unions, textile bureau and foreign trade administration, are preparing to withdraw from Waitan.
