Your excellency, I would like to express my deep regret and sorrow at the incident which occurred on 23 February in your country's embassy -- most probably at the instigation of self-seeking elements who seek to make fraternal and friendly relations between the two neighboring and Muslim countries tense. Your excellency, religious and cultural ties, and material and moral support of the nation and government of Pakistan on the uprising of the people of Afghanistan against foreign aggression and the granting of asylum to millions of Afghan refugees have so deepened and expanded our relations that the occurrence of incidents such as the aforementioned cannot damage our countries' religious and good neighborly relations. I take the opportunity to wish from the compassionate God your excellency's health, long life, success, and prosperity for the people of Pakistan. [Signed] Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, President of the Islamic State of Afghanistan.
