All workers in the public and private sectors are urged not to report to work today in order to enable the security forces, who have routed the attackers who came from Ghana, to deal with the situation. It all began shortly after 1800 on 5 January, when sporadic shots from automatic weapons were heard at the Dove of Peace Monument, CICA-Toyota, and Tokoin-Ramco. According to a statement issued by the national defense minister, the attackers' aim was to surround the Togolese Inter-Arms Regiment camp, capture the soldiers, and repeat the 25 March 1993 events. A curfew was imposed from 1800 to 0600 in Lome municipality and its environs, and all land borders have been closed until further notice.
