They are produced from local components and using state-of-the-art scientific and technical methods, Dr. Radovan Antanasijevic of the Zemun Physics Institute has said. Dr. Antanasijevic, director of the center for applied Physics at the Zemun Institute, told a TANJUG correspondent that the Institute has developed and manufactured the tank laser range-finder within less than a year, despite the shortage of documentation and equipment. The laser range-finder is a complex optical electronic system, used as part of modern combat equipment for defining the distance of the target quickly and with precision. The probability of hitting the target at first attempt is over 70 percent, due to the application of laser and other state-of-the-art range measuring and information processing systems. The range-finder produced in Yugoslavia measures distances of up to 10,000 meters, with an error margin of five meters. [passage omitted]
