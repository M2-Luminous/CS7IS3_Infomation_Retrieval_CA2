An interview with him appeared today in the newspaper SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIA. At the same time, the BPF leader is promising that if he wins the elections scheduled for 23 June, he will adhere to a "friendly but firm policy" in relations with Russia, and is by no means going to force Russians out of the republic. [passage omitted] The other five candidates for the presidential post associate the future of Belorussia with close and warm relations with their "eastern neighbor."
