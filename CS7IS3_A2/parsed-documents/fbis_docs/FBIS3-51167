All this should be accomplished using less resources. During 1993 research in the Cuban agricultural sector was aimed at faster implementation of production results and the promotion of scientific projects that would replace imports and attract foreign exchange. The research centers carried out 79 scientific projects. Fifty of those projects were praised for their importance, and six received the Cuban Academy of Science's 1993 prize for the most important research projects of the year. At a science and agricultural workers' meeting, Carlos Temprano, the official in charge of scientific activity in the agricultural sector, referred to the goals of researchers for the current year: [Begin Temprano recording] They must help increase production and efficiency through Agriculture Ministry programs by promoting results and physical-technical activities. These activities should be promoted with less effort, more integration, and better quality in the areas of production and service, which the various research institutions are tasked with helping. We must increase the scientific and technical level of researchers, professionals, and technicians from the science and technical units and those who work in productive organization and technical services at all levels within the institutions. We must attract foreign exchange and local currency to solve the most basic needs of the institutions. We must also reduce spending and meet financial plans. We must perfect the system to introduce results that promote mechanisms that will adjust this task to new conditions of production in our country's agriculture. [end recording] It became evident at the meeting that there is a need for a better link between the research system and productive activity. It also became evident that scientists must enlarge the small work force existing in our fields. Scientists must also focus their research on initiatives that will result in the lowest fuel consumption possible. Scientists who are linked to agricultural tasks agreed that, in view of Cuba's difficult situation, their research centers must seek their own financing by offering advice and training to interested institutions; all this must be done taking into consideration the high level of Cuban professionals.
