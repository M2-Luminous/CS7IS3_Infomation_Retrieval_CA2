The truce will be effective only in the northern region of the country where the recontras operate, Mendieta said minutes after opening a meeting attended by ranking chiefs of the Army, the Government Ministry, and the Catholic Church, as well as representatives of the OAS International Support and Vertification Commission (CIAV). The meeting will study a disarmament proposal submitted last Thursday by the Catholic Church and writer Pablo Antonio Cuadra, director of LA PRENSA, which is owned by President Violeta de Chamorro. Last evening the so-called recontras announced a unilateral cease-fire and requested assistance in evacuating their wounded, one week after the Church announced its peace plan.
