Lula confirmed this possibility on Saturday afternoon in Esteio, a town in Greater Porto Alegre, where he attended a barbecue with PT followers and candidates. Lula will wear the vest only "under special circumstances," and depending on the place. He made it clear that he would like wearing that kind of protection. "Yet this does not depend only on the candidate," he said. Concern about the candidates' security increased after the murder of Mexico's PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] candidate Luis Colosio, who had been leading in the preference polls. Today Lula preferred to praise the protection he has received from the Federal Police and the military police in each state. "The minimum that each state is expected to do is to preserve the right of expression," he said. In Vitoria (Espirito Santo) last Wednesday, a man carrying a dagger was apprehended near Lula's rostrum. Lula's private secretary Jose Carlos Spinosa said that "the police stripped him of his dagger and let him go." There were no indications that he had intended to use the dagger against Lula, but the episode served to alert the candidate's guards. "We are taking precautionary measures," Spinosa said, but did not admit that the bulletproof vest was one of those measures. Unlike in 1989, the PT this year requested the protection of the Federal Police and of the state civilian and military police to guard the candidate's physical well-being. This is guaranteed by the law. During Lula's campaign in Greater Porto Alegre, he was accompanied by two federal policemen and two military brigade vehicles.
