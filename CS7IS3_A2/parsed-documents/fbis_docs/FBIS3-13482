The resolution was to be presented at the UN Human Rights Commission. Intensive debate on the matter was continuing for the last few days and voting was scheduled on 9 March. Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told a news conference at the Foreign Ministry on 9 March evening that China and Iran had told Pakistan not to press for the adoption of the resolution or to withdraw it. Both of them are Pakistan's friends and their request cannot be ignored. By withdrawing the resolution from the UN Human Rights Commission, the Government of Pakistan repeated the same blunder it committed when it withdrew the resolution on the same topic from the UN General Assembly in December last year. It had then evoked a strong reaction not only inside the country, but also among the people of Azad Kashmir, occupied Kashmir and Kashmiris throughout the world. In justifying the withdrawal of the resolution from the UN Human Rights Commission, the foreign minister has said that this cannot be construed to mean Pakistan's failure. Because 44 of the 53 members of the commission had decided to abstain from voting, and there would have been no significance if the resolution had been adopted by a vote of only eight members excluding the commission president. The foreign minister's logic is beyond the comprehension of the Pakistani people. The people are justified in asking the foreign minister and the prime minister why the Pakistani Foreign Ministry could not deduce that 44 members would abstain from voting and thus make a resolution adopted in such manner meaningless. The Foreign Office was so unaware that it did not understand the "importance" of the global perspective of the resolution and it failed to anticipate that a large number of commission members would not vote on the resolution. If it was aware, then why did it keep assuring the people of Pakistan that "the Pakistani resolution will be adopted with a heavy majority" and that India would be globally condemned, boosting the cause of the freedom struggle in Kashmir? The country's important and patriotic circles will also find it very hard to agree with the foreign minister's argument that the countries which decided to abstain in the voting actually gave India an opportunity to improve the situation in occupied Kashmir. We would like to remind the foreign minister that when Pakistan withdrew the resolution against India from the UN General Assembly, it was then said that the friendly countries which pressured for the resolution's withdrawal felt that India would hold talks with Pakistan on the Kashmir dispute. But the fate of that talk is well- known to the people of Pakistan as well as the leaders of the present government. It is on record that the Foreign Office and the rulers have both been regretting it after they realized that India had requested for talks only to buy time. The question is, will India really improve the situation in occupied Kashmir now that the resolution has been withdrawn from the UN Human Rights Commission. Will India agree to allow world agencies to freely visit occupied Kashmir, to assess the situation there, and to withdraw its forces from occupied Kashmir? These are the questions even a naive person would answer in the negative. But why did the veteran officials of our Foreign Office fail to understand them? The foreign minister has claimed that the practical aspect of the resolution was to force India to allow international missions to visit occupied Kashmir. But, India has already allowed a delegation of ambassadors into occupied Kashmir. Perhaps the foreign minister did not notice the news about the delegation carried by the international media during the last two days. Pakistani newspapers and radio and television reports have also noted that the delegation was not allowed to move freely. On the contrary, the people who tried to meet the delegation were baton-charged and fired upon. KHABRAIN has reported the other day that Pakistan's decision to amend the resolution made it [word indistinct]. Through an amendment to the resolution on 8 March, Pakistan has omitted the provision that a UN Human Rights Commission mission be sent to occupied Kashmir to investigate the human rights situation and submit a report to the commission. Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, chairman of the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee, also criticized the amendment saying that "the amendment in the resolution has vindicated my apprehensions." He had also convened a meeting of the Kashmir Committee on 20 March to discuss the matter. It remains to be seen how the committee reacts at the meeting to the Pakistani decision to withdraw the resolution itself. The present government has prompted harsh criticism and confrontation by withdrawing the resolution. We fear the opposition will react strongly to the Pakistani Government's decision. The decision will also affect the Kashmir struggle negatively and Kashmiris will be gripped by a feeling of frustration. The people and Kashmiri circles will not accept the justification presented by the government for its decision.
