Alfons Burtscher, of the Seibersdorf Nuclear Research Center, who examined the metal, said that this material is usually used for containers for radioactive substances, yet after extended radiation with neutrons in nuclear power plants one might even extract small quantities of plutonium from it. In the form in which the uranium was found, it did not pose any danger to the neighborhood. Burtscher said that the radiation was 10 millirem per hour. [passage omitted]
