That conference was attended by some 400 burgomasters, mayors, aldermen, and representatives of self-government dietines from more than 50 cities, along with politicians from the Movement for the Republic [RdR], Union for Real Politics (UPR), Christian-National Union [ZChN], Center Accord [PC], RTR [Movement of the Third Republic], Polish Peasant Party-Peasant Accord [PSL-PL], and National Party, along with Solidarity activists. They supported the protests of NSZZ Solidarity [Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity"] against the crisis budget of the state and the impoverishment of Polish families, and they encouraged their supporters to take part in the demonstration announced by NSZZ Solidarity for 9 February. Those present also protested the amending of the law on war veterans by the Second-Session Sejm as conflicting with principles of justice and Polish tradition of honoring the sacrifices made in defense of national independence. J. Olszewski warned, "Nowadays, we are facing an attempt to turn back the clock of ownership. We must revert to the ideas of Solidarity. The tasks facing us transcend the strength of any one political party or even bloc. We must reach an accord on the principles of the Poland of the future, of the Third Republic, or otherwise we shall not topple the old order." A program for economic measures was presented by A. Glapinski (PC) and for gmina finance by H. Klata (ZChN). "Not just the pilot program but the reform of public administration is at stake," Lodz Mayor G. Palka (Solidarity, ZChN) pointed out, while S. Pastuszewski (Christian-Democratic Labor Party) voiced his satisfaction that the draft law on communal savings and loan associations, prepared by deputies of the previous Sejm, became championed by the PSL. L. Pruchno-Wroblewski, deputy chairman of UPR, praised the ideal model of the gmina as consonant with the principles of his party. Malopolska local-government activists B. Bubula and K. Barczyk (ZP-RdR) shared their experience in carrying out the center-right's local-government program in Krakow and Malopolska. Criticisms of the new administrative division of Poland into "powiats" were substantiated by the chairman of the Rakow Gmina Council, W. Switalski (Christian-Democrtic Labor Party). The coming elections to the gminas are the first chance to halt the advance of the Left. In this connection, the center-right and patriot and Solidarity groupings still have much to accomplish, but there is less and less time left.
