The responsible officials for public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management will be the State Directors for: _Idaho, 3380 Americana Terrace, Boise, Idaho 83706; _Montana, Granite Tower, 222 N. 32nd Street, Billings, Montana 59101; _Wyoming, P.O. Box 1828, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82003; _Utah, 324 South State Street, Suite 301, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111; and _Nevada, P.O. Box 12000, Reno, Nevada 89520. The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency in October, 1995, and will be available for public review at that time. A public comment period of 90 days will be provided for the draft EIS. The UCRB EIS Team (Team) believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EISs must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. [ Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978)]. Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts. [ City of Angoon v. Hodel, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980)]. Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 90-day comment period on the draft EIS, so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Team at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final EIS. To assist the Team in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It also is helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments also may address the adequacy of the draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. It is expected that the final EIS will be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency approximately 6 months after the draft EIS is published. The record of decision for National Forest System Lands will be issued with the final EIS and will be subject to Forest Service appeal regulations (36 CFR 217). The BLM's proposed plan amendment decision will be published with the final EIS and will be subject to BLM protest regulations (43 CFR 1610.5&hyph;2). The BLM's record of decision will be published following resolution of any protests. David F. Jolly, Regional Forester, Northern Region. Dale N. Bosworth, Regional Forester, Intermountain Region.
