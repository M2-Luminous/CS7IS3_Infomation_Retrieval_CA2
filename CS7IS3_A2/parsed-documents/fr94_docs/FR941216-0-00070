FR941216-0-00070 FR941216-0-00016 For these reasons, the NPL need not be amended if further research into the extent of the contamination expands the apparent boundaries of the release. Further, the NPL is only of limited significance, as it does not assign liability to any party or to the owner of any specific property. See Report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senate Rep. No. 96&hyph;848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980), quoted at 48 FR 40659 (September 8, 1983). If a party contests liability for releases on discrete parcels of property, it may do so if and when the Agency brings an action against that party to recover costs or to compel a response action at that property. At the same time, however, the RI/FS or the Record of Decision (which defines the remedy selected, 40 CFR 300.430(f)) may offer a useful indication to the public of the areas of contamination at which the Agency is considering taking a response action, based on information known at that time. For example, EPA may evaluate (and list) a release over a 400-acre area, but the Record of Decision may select a remedy over 100 acres only. This information may be useful to a landowner seeking to sell the other 300 acres, but it would result in no formal change in the fact that a release is included on the NPL. The landowner (and the public) also should note in such a case that if further study (or the remedial construction itself) reveals that the contamination is located on or has spread to other areas, the Agency may address those areas as well. This view of the NPL as an initial identification of a release that is not subject to constant re-evaluation is consistent with the Agency's policy of not rescoring NPL sites: EPA recognizes that the NPL process cannot be perfect, and it is possible that errors exist or that new data will alter previous assumptions. Once the initial scoring effort is complete, however, the focus of EPA activity must be on investigating sites in detail and determining the appropriate response. New data or errors can be considered in that process .␣.␣. [T]he NPL serves as a guide to EPA and does not determine liability or the need for response. (49 FR 37081 (September 21, 1984). See also City of Stoughton, Wisc. v. U.S. EPA, 858 F. 2d 747, 751 (D.C. Cir. 1988): Certainly EPA could have permitted further comment or conducted further testing [on proposed NPL sites]. Either course would have consumed further assets of the Agency and would have delayed a determination of the risk priority associated with the site. Yet *␣*␣* ``the NPL is simply a rough list of priorities, assembled quickly and inexpensively to comply with Congress' mandate for the Agency to take action straightaway.'' Eagle-Picher [Industries v. EPA] II, 759 F. 2d [921,] at 932 [(D.C. Cir. 1985)]. III. Contents of This Final Rule This final rule adds 18 sites to the NPL, 14 to the General Superfund Section (Table 1) and 4 to the Federal Facilities Section (Table 2). Proposal # 12 (57 FR 4824, February 7, 1992) provided 3 sites, Proposal # 13 (57 FR 47204, October 14, 1992) provided 3 sites, Proposal # 14 (58 FR 27507, May 10, 1993) provided 4 sites, Proposal # 16 (59 FR 2568, January 18, 1994) provided 2 sites, and Proposal # 17 (59 FR 43314, August 23, 1994) provided 6 sites; all are being added to the NPL based on HRS scores of 28.50 or greater. As discussed more fully below, the following tables present the sites in this rule arranged alphabetically by State and identifies their rank by group number. Group numbers are determined by arranging the NPL by rank and dividing it into groups of 50 sites. For example, a site in Group 4 has a score that falls within the range of scores covered by the fourth group of 50 sites on the NPL.
