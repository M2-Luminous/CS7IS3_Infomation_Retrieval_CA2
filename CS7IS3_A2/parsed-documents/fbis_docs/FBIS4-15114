The UN secretary general and members of his delegation began their working day quite early. At 1000, they met with Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Kenik, chairman of the State Committee for Problems of Consequences of the Chernobyl Catastrophe. Different kinds of assistance rendered to Belarus by the world community were discussed. Both sides also spoke about the coordination of efforts to study and alleviate the radiological, medical, socioeconomic, ecological, and psychological consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. In my opinion, Mr. Butrus-Ghali very precisely pointed out that Chernobyl is a symbol of both international solidarity and security. The secretary general was then received by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich and Supreme Soviet Chairman Mecheslaw Hryb. International experts drafted projects for developing industries in the Chernobyl zone, and this issue was also discussed in the course of the meetings. Belarus requested that the United Nations allocate membership fees to finance those projects. [passage omitted] Mr. Butrus-Ghali was startled by the fact that although the disaster had occurred on Ukraine's territory, 70 percent of the radioactive fallout affected Belarus. One in every five Belarusian citizens is suffering from the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident. Meanwhile, the corresponding figure in Ukraine is one in every 30 citizens.[passage omitted] The secretary general underlined: Belarus will receive my support so that the issue of Chernobyl is not removed from the UN agenda.[passage omitted]
