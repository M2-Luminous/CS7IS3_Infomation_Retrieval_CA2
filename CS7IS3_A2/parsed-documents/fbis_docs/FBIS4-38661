Peslyak; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] [Sergey] Yushenkov, [chairman of State Duma Committee for Defense], said that comparison of the systems of civilian control over the armed forces in the two countries [United States and Russia] shows that our system is not developed. Russian Foreign Minister [Andrey Kozyrev] said that it is not democratic to lay down the condition that Russia should unilaterally accept the obligation to end arms supplies to certain regions in the country before talks can start. We are for stability without conditions being laid down for one side. The Karabakh conflict, which has destabilized the situation in the Caucasus, creates problems for us on our southern border, yet some people abroad see us as neo-imperialists here, rather than as peacekeepers, and even regard Russia's efforts as being opposed to those of the CSCE.
