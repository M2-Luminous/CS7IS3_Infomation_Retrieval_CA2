The ministry will make the minimal number of changes in force requirements but if more are needed, the Force Requirement Coordination Committee will conduct an in-depth study. In addition, the ministry will set up a clear channel of officials responsible for every Yulgok project while simplifying the process of acquiring military hardware. These plans were contained in a report released by the ministry on Saturday. It was compiled by the National Defense System Improvement Committee, headed by the superintendent of the Korea Military Academy, Lt. Gen. Chang Sung. The committee studied the plans over a period of two months. The report deals with 30 fields covering the system, regulations, organization and manpower of the Yulgok program and military supplies. It recommends 164 improvement tasks, of which 141 short-term items will be dealt with from this April through 1995 and 23 medium- and long-term problems will be handled after 1996. "The proposal for reform of the Yulgok projects and military supplies procurement system placed emphasis on efficiency, rationality, responsibility, speciality and transparency," said Gen. Chang. "The committee will form a follow-up committee in order to push the proposed reform continuously for one year," he added. Accordingly, the 31-member National Defense System Improvement Committee formed under special orders by Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae last April 10 will be disbanded as of Tuesday. It will be replaced by a follow-up committee comprising five to six officials. The Yulgok project has received its budget from the government based on overall estimates in the past. But from 1995, the government will decide on each project before making allocations, except for those requiring secrecy because of purchase negotiations. If any project costs more than 1 trillion won, the government will form a special committee of concerned ministers to study it before seeking cabinet and National Assembly approval. When a change in force requirements must be made, a Force Requirement Adjustment Committee comprising officials from the Defense Ministry, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the three branches of the Armed Forces will study it so that the proposed change does not depend on any one particular official. In order to make it clear where responsibility lies in every stage of the decision-making processes, the Joint Chiefs of Staff will decide on changes to forces requirements and procurement methods, while the kinds of weapons will be decided by the ministry under the direction of the second assistant minister. Negotiations and contracts will be made by the Logistics Center (LOGC) and simple weapons procurement will be left to each branch of the Armed Forces.
