FBIS4-60303 "drnes100_j_94022" FBIS-NES-94-100 Daily Report 24 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Wrapup of Reaction to al-Bid Secession Attempt Noted Wrapup of Reaction to al-Bid Secession Attempt Noted GPCGC Condemns `Rash' Action JN2405064394 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0430 GMT 24 May 94 JN2405064394 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] The General People's Congress General Committee [GPCGC] has held an emergency meeting under GPC Assistant Secretary General 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani at the end of which it issued the following statement: Our Yemeni people and the Arab and Islamic nation were distressed when the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] under 'Ali Salim al-Bid issued its ill-fated secessionist declaration. The GPCGC vehemently condemns this treasonous, foolhardy, and rash action and views al-Bid's secessionist declaration only two hours after the implementation of the decision by the joint meeting of the Council of Ministers and the Speakership of the House of Representatives to halt all military operations as another scandal by this deviationist gang, and as the gloomy end, and the resounding collapse of the last of its fragmentation and partitioning illusions and dreams. This is because it flagrantly deviated from national consensus, the popular will, and from the deeply-rooted ideological, historical, and national constants of our people, and because it became involved in the conspiracy to fragment the homeland's unity and engage the country in sectarian, provincial, and tribal disputes. While condemning and strongly rejecting this criminal action, the GPCGC supports and blesses all the unity steps, the courageous sovereign decisions, and the responsible historic and national stands that were adopted by the leaders of the higher constitutional bodies, with at their head brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces. At the same time, it emphasizies to our Armed Forces the need to tighten the siege on the dens of this gang, to pursue its corrupt symbols, to stalk them wherever they may be, and to expeditiously arrest them and bring them to trial so that they may receive the just punishment for all the atrocities and the reprehensible fascist crimes they have committed against our people and homeland. The GPCGC highly values the victories and the great heroic feats the sons of our Armed Forces and Public Security daily record and which they baptize with costly blood in all the locations of honor and dignity in defense of unity, and to protect the democratic achievements and the elected legitimate institutions. The GPCGC would like here to note its great appreciation of all the honest soldiers and officers of unity who were misled by the gang of apostasy and secession but who, after becoming aware of the reality of the vile conspiracy, rushed to join the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, refusing to obey the orders of this isolationist and renegade gang within the YSP. The GPCGC emphasizes that it is still confident that the unity leaders within the YSP are capable of confronting the secessionist trend within the party, of liquidating it, and of clearly supporting the unity state and its institutions. The GPCGC also urges all our people with their national and social forces, their political parties and organizations, their popular organizations, and their trade unions to stand as one rank in support of unity and to safeguard democracy and constitutional legitimacy and all the civilized achievements of our people. It also calls for mobilizing our masses potential and our homeland's resources to confront the schemes of this unjust and criminal gang and protect the security, stability, and independence of the homeland. The GPCGC praises all the fraternal stands and sincere sentiments that many of our Arab brothers and friends in the world have expressed when they reiterated their support for the unity of our people and for constitutional legitimacy, and their concern not to interfere in Yemen's domestic affairs. From this premise, the GPCGC warns against any contact or dealings with this gang and views the recognition of this fictitious and secessionist entity by any fraternal or friendly country as an enmical act against our people, an infringement on their sovereignty and independence, and a blatant and rejected interference in their domestic affairs. The GPCGC is confident of our masses ability, the capability of our Armed Forces, the alertness of our security organs, and the cohesion of our national ranks to score decisive victory on all the secessionist agents to obey God's saying: And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevails justice and faith in God. Issued by the General People's Congress General Committee, Sanaa, 23 May 1994
