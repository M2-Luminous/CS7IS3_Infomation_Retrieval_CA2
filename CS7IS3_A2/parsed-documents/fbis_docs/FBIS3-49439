Is the Serbian side changing anything in the platform for the continuation of the talks in Geneva? [Karadzic] For the time being we are not changing anything. We do not wish to add to any sort of confusion in hope that a peaceful solution will be found. We will leave it until the 18th [January], perhaps the 17th, or perhaps even after the 18th, in order to orient ourselves toward the future situation that will result from the Muslim-Croatian talks. I would like to say that we have nothing against the Izetbegovic-Tudjman meeting in Bonn if this will contribute toward their reconciliation, which would help the overall peace in the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, if Germany tries to reconciliate the Muslims and the Croats and turn them against the Serbs, we will oppose this, naturally. For this reason we do not wish to contribute to any sort of disruption of the constructive atmosphere and will wait to see how the events develop.
