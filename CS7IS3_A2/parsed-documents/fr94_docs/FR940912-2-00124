By letter dated July 25, 1994, Robert G. Byram, Senior Vice President-Nuclear of PP&L, informed the Commission that the Board of Directors has proposed a corporate restructuring plan to be presented at the annual meeting of shareholders scheduled for April 26, 1995. If a majority of the shareholders approve the plan, PP&L will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of a new holding company named PP&L Resources, Inc. (Resources). PP&L would remain as holder of the licenses for the aforementioned facilities. If the plan is approved, the common stock of PP&L will be converted on a share-for-share basis into common stock of the holding company, and there will be no effect upon the management, operation, and financing of the PP&L nuclear facilities. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.80, the Commission may approve the transfer of control of a license, after notice to interested persons. Such action is contingent upon the Commission's determination that the holder of the license and the transfer of such control is otherwise consistent with applicable provisions of law, regulations, and orders of the Commission. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 1st day of September 1994. Mohan C. Thadani, Acting Director, Project Directorate I&hyph;2, Division of Reactor Projects_I/II, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
