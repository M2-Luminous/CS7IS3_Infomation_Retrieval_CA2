FR941116-0-00090 FR941116-0-00019 FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION 46 CFR Parts 502, 503, 510, 514, 540, and 583 [Docket No. 94&hyph;14] Update of Existing Filing and Service Fees AGENCY: Federal Maritime Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Maritime Commission (``Commission'' or ``FMC'') is revising its fees for (1) filing petitions, complaints, and special docket applications; (2) providing various public information services, such as lists of non-vessel-operating common carriers (``NVOCCs''), record searches, and document copying; (3) filing applications for freight forwarder licenses, performance and casualty certificates for cruise operators, and for admission to practice before the Commission; and (4) providing various services related to the Commission's Automated Tariff Filing and Information System. These revised fees reflect current costs to the Commission. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective January 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeremiah D. Hospital or George S. Smolik, Bureau of Trade Monitoring and Analysis, Federal Maritime Commission, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20573&hyph;0001, (202) 523&hyph;5790. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register on July 28, 1994, 59 FR 38411, (``NPR'' or ``Proposed Rule''), 1 proposing to update its existing filing and service fees. The NPR noted that the Independent Offices Appropriation Act (``IOAA''), 31 U.S.C. 9701, permits it to establish fees for services and benefits that the Commission provides to specific recipients. The NPR also pointed out that the primary guidance for implementation of IOAA is Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') Circular A&hyph;25, as revised July 8, 1993. OMB Circular A&hyph;25 requires that a reasonable charge be made to each recipient for a measurable unit or amount of Federal Government service from which the recipient derives a benefit, in order that the Government recover the full cost of rendering that service. OMB Circular A&hyph;25 further provides that costs be determined or estimated from the best available records in the agency, and that cost computations shall cover the direct and indirect costs to the Government of carrying out the activity. 1 On the same day, the Commission also published in the Federal Register (59 FR 38418) a companion Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in Docket No. 94&hyph;15, New Filing Fees, proposing to implement new fees for, among other things, tariff and agreement filings. The NPR advised that the FMC's existing filing and service fees have been in effect since 1983, and that they no longer reflected the Commission's actual costs for providing these services. The Commission, accordingly, proposed to update its fees to reflect current costs.
