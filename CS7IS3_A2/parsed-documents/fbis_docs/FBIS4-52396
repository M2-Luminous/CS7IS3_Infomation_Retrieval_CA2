The TQM system, known as an efficient way of improving product quality, has made unique development in Japan through pan-corporate quality control (QC) circle campaigns. Plans of support for individual ASEAN nations will be worked out in 1994 and then be put into practice for five years from fiscal 1995. Specifically, 1) manuals on quality improvement will be prepared; 2) Japanese experts will be sent to the ASEAN nations for on-the-job training; 3) foreign students will be invited for training in Japan; and 4) seminars will be held. MITI will soon start coordinating requests from those nations, and will decide how much time should be given to which industrial areas, for instance. At a meeting held between the six ASEAN economic ministers and then MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai in Singapore last October, an agreement was reached on action plans to promote industrial development in the ASEAN nations. The action plans included "the promotion of industrial standardization and quality control for improvement of product quality."
