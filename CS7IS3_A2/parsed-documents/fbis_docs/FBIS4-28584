The Lao Government assigns the National Tourism Organization and the Government of the Union of Myanmar assigns the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism to be in charge of implementing [the agreement] and providing conveniences to each other in opening offices of tourism representatives in one another's country on the basis of the valid laws of the country concerned. At the same time, the two sides will encourage one another to exchange lessons and documents on the organization, management, administration, and operation of tourism businesses and assist one another in training personnel in the tourism sector. The agreement on the establishment of a joint commission for cooperation stipulates that with a desire to increase and strengthen firmer and lasting relations and cooperation between the two sides, to reaffirm the wishes of each side in strengthening the ties and cooperation between the two countries, with a desire to further strengthen the existing relations of friendship, and to promote the development of bilateral cooperation between the two countries on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and respect for each other's sovereignty, the two governments have agreed that the two sides will set up a joint commission to facilitate consultations and cooperation between the two countries, especially in the economic, trade, scientific, social, cultural, and other fields of mutual interests. The said commission is charged with exploring and finding ways and methods aimed at promoting the said objectives and with ensuring appropriate coordination and the implementation of the various resolutions and agreements, including this agreement. With regard to the governmental agreement on the permanent international boundary between the two countries along the Mekong River, the signatories to the agreement have agreed that beginning on the day the agreement becomes valid, the boundary between the LPDR and the Union of Myanmar will be permanently fixed in accordance with the present conditions of the Mekong River, which have been surveyed and demarcated by the joint Lao-Myanmar waterways survey team, regardless of any changes which may later occur in this river. The boundary between the two countries is 236 kilometers long and is demarcated by 86 border posts on each side of the boundary which was jointly surveyed by the two sides beginning in January 1991 and ending in 1993. The agreement also stressed the safeguarding of the boundary between the two countries in which the signatories will employ appropriate measures to maintain and protect the boundary demarcation posts located in their respective territories in order to prevent their removal, degradation, and destruction. At the same time, the signatories also agreed that neither side can carry out navigational operations or utilize the currents of the Mekong River or water on the side of their international boundary for industrial purposes, drainage, storage, irrigation, hydroelectricity generation, and other purposes which may bring losses to the interest of the other side. In dealing with this problem, the signatories will continue to closely work together for mutual interests by utilizing the Mekong River in a correct and fair manner. This agreement also defines the rights to navigation along the Mekong River which is the boundary between the two countries. The rights to navigation of the signatories will be totally guaranteed even though changes may later occur along the navigation route of the said river. In addition, the agreement also stipulates that if boats or nationals of a signatory country are in danger or broken in the Mekong River belonging to the other side, that side must provide needed assistance at all times to the boats, navigators, crew members, and passengers as well as cargo on those boats. The signatories also agreed that all materials collected from the boats which are in danger or broken will not be charged with any customs duties and fees provided that they are not used in each other's country.
