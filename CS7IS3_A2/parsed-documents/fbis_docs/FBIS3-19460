This is one of the issues that was blocking the EU [European Union] enlargement negotiations. Speaking in Brussels, Javier Solana described the agreement as reasonable although he admitted that it is not all that Spain had asked for. The Spanish foreign minister highlighted that the quotas are not the main point this agreement. The end of the transitory regime in 1996 instead of in the year 2003 is more important [Spain will be able to fish in all EU waters in 1996 instead of waiting until 2003]. For his part, Vicente Albero told this radio station that Spanish companies can establish joint ventures in Norway and thus fish on the Norwegian quota. He added that Spanish fishermen will have access to the Norwegian fishing grounds and that the fishing quota has finally been increased. On another hand, next Tuesday [22 March], the EU will have to solve the institutional dispute about the voting system in the Council of Ministers. According to the Greek presidency, this will be the last chance if blocking the EU enlargement is to be avoided. Despite a long meeting, the Community foreign ministers were unable to reach an agreement on how many votes will be needed in a 16-member Council of Ministers to block a decision. Spain and the United Kingdom want, for very different reasons, the blocking minority to stay at 23 votes while the rest of the countries favor increasing it to 27 votes when the four new members join.
