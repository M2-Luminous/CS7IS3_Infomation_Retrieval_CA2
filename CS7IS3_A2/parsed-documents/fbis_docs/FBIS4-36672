He said this in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Abu Dhabi yesterday. Al-'Attas said that the DRY's priority now is "a cease-fire and then to discuss the procedures for disengaging the forces and deploying observers." He added that the DRY urges the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states and Egypt, to which the credit for the UN Security Council resolution goes, to continue their role in the Security Council so that the council may continue to implement its resolution and take the necessary measures for that in accordance with the stipulations of the UN Charter. Al-'Attas said that "Recognition of the DRY is not our priority, because recognition has become a reality since war broke out. The pressing question now is to halt the war." He pointed out that northern forces have recently -- having failed to achieve the aims it had set for themselves -- resorted to hitting residential areas and civilian and economic installations. Al-'Attas said that Aden's contacts with the GCC states have borne fruit over the past two days, as the United States has issued a new statement expressing utmost concern over the continuation of the fighting and openly expressing its position calling for an immediate halt to the war. He stressed that the continuation of the war will result in numerous complications, and that "the northerners' insistence on continuing it reflects despair and loss of control." On the Arab League's exclusion from the diplomatic efforts Aden is making, al-'Attas said that "the DRY has from the outset referred to the Arab League, and contacts are continuing with it, as a meeting has been held with the Arab League secretary general." He pointed out that the league supports the UN Security Council resolution, but the conditions the Arab League is experiencing are not helping it to take a decision. He said that "the DRY welcomes any role by the league in the framework of the UN Security Council resolution."
