Ms. Robin Raphel's absurd remarks on Kashmir, questioning the Instrument of Accession; Mr. Warren Christopher's letter of appreciation to the Prime Minister on the peaceful solution of the Hazratbal crisis; and now the move to scrap the Pressler amendment, paradoxically, are all part of a change. The Pressler amendment came into effect on October 1, 1990 mainly to chastise the countries of South Asia which were refusing to sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] and surrender the right to acquire nuclear weapons. In Pakistan's case, the punishment was to cut off military and economic aid to which that country had got so accustomed that its elite could not do without it. The amendment has been a major irritant between Islamabad and Washington. Amending this amendment would give Mr. Clinton freedom to resume aid to Pakistan. It would give an instant reward to premier Benazir Bhutto, currently America's favourite among Pak leaders. However, by implication this move is more anti-Indian than pro-Pakistan. It carries strong implications for India. The stated purpose of the U.S. decision, the Americans say, is not to allow Pakistan to go nuclear but encourage it to look for a more "equitable and non-discriminatory" application of punitive measures against nuclear threshold countries. Another justification provided is that the Pressler law "no longer serves U.S. nonproliferation objectives in South Asia." It is a well-known fact that New Delhi and Washington are not on the same wavelength on the NPT. While the U.S. wants India to sign the NPT on the dotted lines, India regards the treaty as unacceptable because it is discriminatory. Pakistan has expressed its willingness to sign the NPT, provided the U.S. forces India to submit on the NPT. The idea is to give currency to propaganda that India does not want a nuclear-free South Asia. The pro-Pakistani lobby in the U.S. has been arguing that Pressler's restrictions target Pakistan alone and no other country. Pakistan's ruling elite wants Pressler employed against India, although this country has no military nuclear programme. It appears that Mr. Clinton has accepted this convoluted logic. It is rightly apprehended that the new law, when approved by the U.S. Congress, can be used to deny American aid to India. And correspondingly aid can be resumed to Pakistan. India's political leaders have so long been passive on this issue that it is probably futile for them to say anything different from the mantra they have repeated these last 30 years. Our so-called open option policy should be made really open. Ms. Bhutto's assertion that Pakistan's nuclear programme cannot be capped and Mr. Clinton's move to scrap the Pressler amendment should persuade India to undertake an in-depth review of the whole issue.
