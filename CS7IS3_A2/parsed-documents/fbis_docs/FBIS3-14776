Our special correspondents in Chisinau report as follows: [Begin Anca Florea recording] This morning, Chisinau Radio broadcast an interview granted by President Mircea Snegur. The questions and especially the answers convey the preelectoral picture of the Republic of Moldova. We will try to sum up what he said. President Snegur assessed that the 27 February elections are linked to the opinion poll on 6 March. The first will create a parliament, the second an answer to a complex question that will form the foundation of the Constitution. He called on the citizens of the Republic of Moldova to cast their vote urging them not to be indifferent to their fate, although, quote, even a small percentage will ensure the validation of the elections, unquote. President Snegur expressed the hope that a parliamentary majority will be achieved, which, quote, could work actively, without useless discussions, unquote. Western interest in this country was explained by the President of the Republic of Moldova through the preservation of stability in a conflict area in the past one and a half years, contrary to other areas of conflict in the former Soviet Union, where this was not possible. He added that the separatist tendencies are also of interest, especially for the foreign observers who have arrived in Chisinau. In connection with future relations with the future parliament, President Snegur said, quote: No parliament will be able to cooperate with the president if it tries to promote a more or less conservative line or to stop the reform process, unquote. This is why President Snegur emphasizes the need to create a parliamentary majority. The first event that will follow the elections is the signing of the 'Partnership for Peace' program in Brussels and the signing of the documents on its entry in the CIS, President Mircea Snegur affirmed. Asked about the participation of the Gagauz people in the elections, the president of the Republic of Moldova affirmed that the differences with the separatists can be solved only through conciliation, quote: I am firmly convinced that solely compromise will help us reestablish the republic's integrity, unquote. In connection with the current political, economic, and social situation of the Republic of Moldova, President Snegur stated that the people belonging to the nomenklatura are not the only guilty ones. He said, quote: The nomenklatura are those who are working, who are still able to do something, and therefore I do not agree with promoting the idea of only new people. We have had a revolutionary government, a reformist government, and a national reconciliation government. What the revolutionaries achieved in one year can be noted today: Ever since 1990-91 we have been unable to recover our senses because there was only destruction, unquote. In concluding his interview granted to Chisinau radio stations, President Snegur did not reject the idea of a presidential republic, if necessary, reiterating that without a parliamentary majority there are no prospects. As a general assessment, President Mircea Snegur said, quote: We have to be optimistic and compare the situation in the Republic of Moldova with the situation in other countries within the area of the former Soviet Union. Being supported by international bodies, we hope that we will elect a parliament which, in cooperation with the presidency, will give an impetus to the positive beginning which exists in the Republic of Moldova.
