Apart from the issues he discussed, the president announced the resignation of the present government headed by Faustin Birindwa and mentioned the names of Professor Mulumba Lukoyi and Etienne Tshisekedi as candidates for the post of prime minister as proposed by their respective political groups. However, the list is not limited, stated Kipolongo Mukambilwa yesterday evening. In fact, a third candidate, (Kabangu Musa), has just been announced by his party, the National Union for Progress [Union Nationale pour le Progres], Unapro.
