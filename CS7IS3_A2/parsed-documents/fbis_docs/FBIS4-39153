We believe that the deputy prime minister's view of the realities, illusions, and prospects of the Republic of Crimea's development and his proposals on reforming the economy are of interest to Crimea residents and our readers. Not many people know about the Crimea. I apologize for such a statement, but while I was born in the Crimea and am familiar with it, I never thought that it possessed such immense potential. Briefly, the southern zone, which occupies a fairly small territory, is a recreation zone. Next is the zone of agriculture--elite agriculture, I would say. It is viticulture and tobacco-growing in the south, fruit and vegetables, and in northern Crimea--hard varieties of wheat. The industrial zone also is not common knowledge, in particular, the military-industrial plants. There are some very modern high-technology plants, extremely interesting, which produce competitive products. For instance, there is a plant-- and I was astonished by this fact--that has orders from West Europe all the way through the year 2000. It is the Kerch plant Zaliv, which makes tankers. There is a rather substantial chemical industry in northern Crimea, some of it unique. The Crimea has many ports. In Kerch, for instance, practically every plant has its own port. The Sevastopol ports are well known, but not all of them--and there are many. Donuzlav and Feodosiya are very interesting ports. In Chernomorskoye there is a Gazprom port, since gas is produced there, in the Tarkhankut area--quite a bit of it; there is also oil. I want to mention one more fact, probably amazing to many: The Crimea has an absolutely fantastic airfield potential--there are 11 airfields, eight of which can accept "shuttles." They were used for testing the newest aircraft and aircraft carrier-launched aircraft. This is its potential. But the current state of the Crimean economy is absolutely dismal. Plants are on the verge of stoppage; even Zaliv, which I mentioned, is in trouble. All the wine cellars are filled with our famous wines--a complete glut at a time when the demand for them, particularly in Russia, is enormous. Practically all industry and agriculture are near collapse. There is no money, and frequently no notion of how to utilize all this now. And, what is completely amazing, sometimes there is no understanding that the issue of production is not that important--the important part is to sell all the output. Amazingly, some enterprise directors still cannot grasp this notion. There is a quiet hatred toward middlemen who themselves do not produce anything and just want to make a profit at someone else's expense, but at the same time the directors themselves cannot sell anything. And if professional traders come to them, they are treated like gangsters. This is a problem that is described by a word that is fashionable these days--mentality. We need to utilize the Crimea's potential. I believe this is not all that difficult to do. There is no other such elite region on the territory of the former USSR. I believe that this potential can be made to work rather quickly, but naturally serious reorganization is in order. What stands in the way of transformation--other than the mentality I mentioned? The absolutely unbelievable, terrible barriers we have erected between us. Since the Crimea is not Russia, Russia happily applies a custom duty on, in particular, Crimean wines, so that although the production cost is quite low, the price in Russia becomes very high. Obstacles pop up in the most unexpected places. For instance, there is a Crimea-Caucasus ferry in Kerch Bay; it gets filled up on the Russian side, where a declaration has to be filled out for export of fuel and lubricant materials. [passage omitted] Having come here, we decided to begin by removing the most glaring barriers to normal economic activities. In our opinion, it was prohibitive taxation. I was used to the fact that everybody in Russia complained about high taxes, but when I saw Ukrainian taxes, I was totally lost and could not figure out how anyone can work here at all. One of the specialists who came with me, after a good look at Ukrainian taxation, exclaimed: "My goodness, this is Abalkin's garrote, the shadow of forgotten forebears." We prepared, and the president of Crimea issued, an edict on changes in taxation. We no longer had any tax revenue, because nobody had any profit anymore. Lightening the tax burden in principle increased the tax revenue rather quickly. The second was, naturally, an edict of foreign currency regulations. It was not profitable to work with foreign currency. Foreign currency was confiscated at an exchange rate far below the real one. A free-floating foreign currency exchange rate is, in my opinion, an elementary requirement. The Ukrainian Government is killing its own exports and then wonders why it cannot pay for gas. Then they want to collect even more money to pay for gas, and then they absolutely cannot pay. I think this is self-strangulation. The third edict is the edict on banks and banking activities. The most important part is that we want to lower the charter capital requirement. Ten million ECU is too much; at 1 million some Russian banks already expressed an interest in working here, in particular, Tveruniversalbank, Menatep, and Inkombank. This would resolve many problems of transfers. It was a pleasant surprise for me to find out that many Ukrainian ministers support us. Our actions were to the liking of the main members of the cabinet, except the very top echelon. Next we intend to seriously get into the process of privatization. The Ukrainian privatization scheme is quite dangerous. While the Russian scheme envisages a quick transfer of capital, and therefore the process of restructuring, in Ukraine, with its registered vouchers and absence of an investment fund, it is unclear how the transfer of capital will take place. Therefore we would like to utilize a somewhat different scheme. Of course, our dream would be to have the scheme that is being used by the Germans in the eastern lands. But this may take decades. The purpose of privatization is more efficient operation of these production facilities--not collecting money for the treasury, as some think. I am fully convinced that it is not possible--and not necessary--to get any money for the treasury from privatization. The money some are able to pay for privatization should be invested in that same production, because there is not a single production facility right now that does not need investment. The treasury should count not on these one-time handouts from heaven--it should count on taxes from successfully operating enterprises. We need them to work. This logic dictates the following method: Since we need to push citizens' money into privatization and investment, the voucher method is good as bait, to make them feel like a proprietor. After that, investment funds should get to work. As early as 1988-89, when we discussed privatization programs, Western specialists advised us: You need to create investment funds, which will accumulate capital, since nobody will be able to invest such money on an individual basis. As to the labor collective as proprietor, this is possible at small enterprises (small store or shop). People know one another in such places, trust one another, have responsibility toward one another; they understand that this really is their money, their income. As to large enterprises, this means stoppage. Privatization without investment is a myth. The potential also can be seen from different angles. There are absolutely amazing illusions in the Crimea. One of them is that Crimean sanitariums are such a treasure that the whole world will rush to buy them, elbowing each other out of the way. What are we talking about when they do not even have normal plumbing? Generally, regarding recreation, I agree that very interesting work is underway on the southern shore of the Crimea, but I personally would not go for existing sanitariums. Unfinished construction--yes. But even better--new zones that could be developed into resorts. In particular, I have in mind Tarkhankut, which could easily become Crimea's second recreation zone. I see the following areas as interesting for development and for applying oneself: banking, processing of agricultural products, marketing, trading Crimean wines, production and sales of the best varieties of tobacco--for instance, Dubek, which should be revived. In industry--air fields, ports, any industry where resource-saving technologies can be used; in short, everything I described as Crimea's potential.
