Gaydar, first deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation, by M. Panova; place and date not given: "The Logic of Reform"] [Text] The government of Russia has been accused of neglecting "explanatory efforts" for a reason. Even professional economists do not always understand the logic of steps taken by the government; many actions cause bewilderment and, as a consequence, protest. In an effort to assist the readers of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN in figuring out what the government itself means by the policy of reform, the editorial office approached Ye.T. Gaydar with a request to answer a number of questions which are encountered most frequently in letters from our readers. Therefore, Yegor Gaydar, first deputy prime minister of the government of Russia, is our interlocutor. [Panova] Yegor Timurovich, before we ask you questions about the plans of the government, we would like to ask how you personally assess the path traveled by the country since the fall of 1991, when the policy which has come to be called the "Gaydar reforms" began? [Gaydar] Let me answer two questions at once--about the reform process, i.e., the way the reforms were carried out, and about the intermediate result, i.e., what the reforms have brought about. The reform process has been extremely contradictory, and transformations have proceeded quite inconsistently. It is the custom in our country to address rebukes to some generic authority; however, it should be understood that authority as a united entity or at least noncontradictory has not existed in our country so far. The government was involved in continuous confrontation with the Supreme Soviet, which did everything to stop the reforms. As is now obvious to all, various trends also existed within the government, and the reformist line was not necessarily dominant. We were forced to agree to numerous compromises and retreat on many significant nuances in order to salvage the key point. This inconsistency was perceived by both specialists and the population. The choice we had was either to do what was possible while consenting to much of what we considered incorrect, but taking what we viewed as fundamental steps, or, "saving face," become the opposition and observe, this time from the sidelines, how the country would waste an opportunity to overcome the crisis. We preferred the path of compromise, although perhaps we disappointed a segment of our supporters in this manner. As far as the results of these two years are concerned, I cannot agree in any way with apocalyptic assessments which are quite frequently published in the press. On the contrary, clear-cut favorable trends have emerged in the economy of Russia. Strange as it may seem, the word "success" is considerably more fitting for Russian reforms than the word "failure." Our current situation should not be compared to the United States or Germany but rather to our own situation as of two years ago, as well as to the tendencies and expectations we had at that time. Recall the fall of 1991--complete breakdown of the market, empty stores, the dominance of barter, humiliating hours in lines, and the feeling of hopelessness. There were a great many predictions of famine, cold, and rebellion. One may be as critical of the activities of the government as one wants, but it is impossible not to acknowledge that these predictions have failed to come true. Not only have we survived, but we feel much more confident than two years ago. For example, even the most irresponsible people do not discuss the threat of famine at present. In general, when our opponents now enumerate the troubles of the Russian economy with an accusatory intonation, we would like to ask the basis for their belief that it could have been easier? At the time of disintegration of the USSR several crises at once were superimposed over one another. The output of energy resources--the main item in Russian exports--declined sharply. Due to the attempts of the last union government to patch up the holes with the use of Western credit, Russia fell into a debt trap. An irresponsible financial policy brought about the emergence of a huge merchandise deficit and the actual depreciation of the savings of the population, which really perished right then, in the years of perestroyka. In January 1992 this merely became obvious. Of course, the standard of living of a majority of the population is still very low. However, in this instance, too, everything is not as bad as it appears to be. In the last 10 months the real income of the population has not declined, and if we were to compare it to the beginning of 1993, it has increased. Therefore, despite the situation remaining quite complex, with quite a few things not working out the way we had planned, I view the results of the past period favorably. [Panova] As you see it, what should be the key priorities of economic policy for the next year or two? [Gaydar] Our main task is to ensure a break in the inflationary spiral and ensure the predictability of key economic parameters in the production sphere. For this purpose, it is necessary to consistently reduce all types of subsidies in the production sphere in 1994: import subsidies, preferential credit, and credit extended to the states of the Commonwealth, and to bring the deficit to a volume not exceeding 5 percent of the gross domestic product. In turn, this will make it possible to abandon the financing of the budget deficit through emission by the end of 1994, and to switch to financing it from healthy sources, both domestic (state treasury bonds) and foreign. The rate of growth of the money supply will drop from 10 percent per month in early 1994 to 3 percent per month at the end of the year. This will make it possible to maintain a relatively stable rate of depreciation of the ruble against the dollar, not to exceed one-half of the rate of inflation. The currency exchange rate, relatively cheaper imported goods, and the strengthening of price competition on this basis--all of these may be used to slow down inflation from 15 percent a month at the beginning of 1994 to 5 percent a month at the end of 1994. Subsequently, as the rate of inflation drops, prerequisites will be created for lowering the discount rate of the Central Bank, lowering the interest rate on the market, and, correspondingly, the growth of private investment in the production sector. [Panova] What awaits us in the sphere of taxation? [Gaydar] Unfortunately, in the environment of a considerable budget deficit there will be no opportunity to reduce the burden of taxes in 1994. At present the level of tax withholdings comes to 50 percent of the gross domestic product; a real reduction in it may be discussed no earlier than 1995. The key directions in this area are: reducing taxation of wages (withholdings for social security), and canceling levies on above-the-norm labor compensation fund. The codification of a universal form of distribution of taxes to the levels of the budget system, between the federal budget and the territories, a transition from customized norms for each region established in the process of bureaucratic bargaining to universal rules, with appropriate support to poorly developed regions--such is the substantial advance which may and should occur in 1994. An increase in taxes on factors of production--natural resources, real estate--as a share of the total volume of taxes is yet another long-range avenue for the system of taxation. However, this will only become possible after a low level of inflation is attained. [Panova] People have the impression that the government's tax policy encourages only commerce and banking, but makes operations in the production sphere unprofitable. [Gaydar] Generally speaking, our taxes are the same for both production and commerce. However, the effect you mentioned exists as a consequence of the so-called inflationary tax. The inflationary tax means losses which the owners of monetary savings suffer as a result of high inflation. Naturally, losses due to the inflationary tax are not comparable to profits in commerce and the banking sector, in which money is turned around quickly. In turn, these losses are very significant in production, especially in sectors with a long production cycle, and for the population. This problem cannot be solved through differentiated taxation of the spheres of production and distribution; after all, increased taxes in the sphere of distribution will cause massive tax evasion. This is why there is only one way to even out conditions for taxation--it is to stop inflation. [Panova] Will the privatization policy undergo changes? [Gaydar] As we discuss the process of privatization, we should compare what has already been accomplished in the course of it with what is yet to be done in the long term. Privatization in Russia is unprecedented in scope and not comparable to the experience of any of the countries of the world. There are monumental technical difficulties in its path here affecting the forms of privatization, the system of vouchers, and the appraisal of privatized property. All of these are objective aspects. However, there are also subjective aspects. We are not the authors of the privatization program--we proposed a different program which did not have such great preferences for labor collectives, that is, the point for which we are now being criticized. However, decisions were made by the Supreme Soviet, often contrary to our opinion; as a result we have a compromise version of the program with many flaws. We cannot change the rules of the game in the middle without the risk of triggering major social conflicts; this is why we should conduct the current stage of privatization to the end and change the rules gradually. Property has already been distributed, but effective control over it by the new owners has been absent so far. The role of the management and labor collectives is clearly excessive. This is why the most pressing task is to create effective owners, to establish rules and procedures for the redistribution of property, and to create a system counteracting all attempts to squander such property. In this instance, the role of investment funds as outside coowners of enterprises in resisting the arbitrary rule of directors is very great. We are making a transition from the system of handing out property free of charge to selling it, from unconditional privatization to privatization conditioned on additional investment. [Panova] At present, everyone agrees that structural changes in our industry are necessary. What would be your description of the situation in this sphere? Are structural changes underway in our country? Are you satisfied with this process? [Gaydar] Of course, structural changes are progressing, and they are not progressing poorly. Statements about a profound crisis in industry or fatal declines in production are either manifestations of incompetence or simply deliberate distortions of the facts. Let us look specifically at areas where we have considerable declines in production, for example, light industry. However, many light industry enterprises were so ineffective that they generated a negative value added for our entire industry, whereby the total cost of output was less than the cost of resources consumed in production. The "production of the means of production"--machine tools for the production of machine tools, metal for the machine tools producing machine tools, power for smelting this metal, and so on--which is well-known from school textbooks, is also declining in our country. On the contrary, the share of civilian machine building and the food industry in the structure of the national economy (in constant prices) is increasing. The strengthening market mechanisms is throwing up a barrier in the path of producing everything that is not associated in any way with meeting human needs. Industry for the sake of industry, which indeed is a peculiar accomplishment of ours, is yielding to production for the sake of the people, however slowly and with resistance. Certainly, such a decline is beneficial. It is no accident that, until a few months ago, the total level of decline in production in Ukraine was lower than in Russia, whereas the standard of living fell considerably more than in our country, and social tensions were greater, to boot. We are gradually getting rid of that production which was pulling us to the bottom. It is necessary to note one more aspect here which is important in principle. So far, the process of structural change has proceeded without major social upheaval and against the background of a quite low unemployment rate. For two years now they have been promising us the 20 million level of unemployment. However, at present the rate of unemployment does not by any means exceed 3 percent, even with the inclusion of those who are on forced leave. We have every reason to believe that in the coming 1.5 years the unemployment rate will remain quite low. Nonetheless, the government is attentively following the situation in the labor market. We have developed special programs of aid to the unemployed and retraining for those who, having lost their jobs, would like to train in new professions.
