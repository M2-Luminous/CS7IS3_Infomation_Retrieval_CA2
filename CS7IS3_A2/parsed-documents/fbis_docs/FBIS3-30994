[Begin recording] [Tomecek] The alternative of political realism believes that a way out of this situation lies in the possibility of stabilizing the political state of affairs in Slovakia. This will lead to the creation of a government of reason [vlada z rozumu], a so-called wider coalition. Such a government would stabilize the situation in Slovakia until new elections, which should resolve the political situation in Slovakia. Of course, we tried to discuss the point that, if we want political stability in Slovakia, it would probably not be feasible for top political representatives to enter such a government. We therefore propose that our [HZDS] representatives consider the possibility of having a government without top political representation. The prime minister accepted the alternatives that had appeared in the press, the so-called four alternatives. On the basis of the manner in which our group presented this appeal--and, of course, because it also concerned him as chairman of the movement and as the top political representative--I think he will present his viewpoint at an extraordinary meeting on Saturday [12 February]. My personal opinion is that, if somebody holds different views, it does not mean that he will leave the movement just because his views are not accepted. We have been building this movement a long time. We have certain obligations, not only social ones but, of course, also obligations toward this movement. Therefore, I do not suppose the movement will splinter as you have formulated it. [Correspondent] Will you support the government bill on large-scale privatization? [Tomecek] Of course, our group intends to support the government bill. [passage omitted] [Second correspondent] What was the result of voting in the parliamentary club of the HZDS on the resignation of the two deputy chairmen? [Tomecek] Regrettably, I can announce that the resignations of Vladimir Bajan and of Marian Kelemen were accepted. [passage omitted] [end recording]
