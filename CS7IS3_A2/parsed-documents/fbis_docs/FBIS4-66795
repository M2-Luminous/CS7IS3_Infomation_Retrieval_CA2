Narasimha Rao, on Tuesday strongly denounced attempts by the developed nations to create fresh impediments in the form of "unjustified controversies" that would nullify the comparative advantage to developing countries in the globalisation process of their economies. Inaugurating the golden jubilee session of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) here, the Prime Minister said the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade related bilateral negotiations should not "countenance any moves to put these concerns on the trade agenda, with the thinly veiled intention to nullify the comparative advantage of the developing countries." Economic and trade ministers of more than 20 countries are taking part in the week-long 50th session which is expected to express concern over the neo-protectionism attitude being adopted by the industrialised world. Referring to the new conditions being imposed on the third world by the developed nations, Mr Narasimha Rao said the "legitimate concern for environmental preservation and upgradation should not, however, be made the alibi for raising of protectionist trade barriers, since only augmentation of trade and technology flows would provide the necessary resources for a transition to more environmentally friendly products and processes. On meeting the challenges posed by environment degradation, which was going to assume "gigantic proportions" in the coming century, the Prime Minister advised all ESCAP members to adopt agenda 21 of the Rio declaration on environment development. The ESCAP session is being held here after a gap of nearly two decades. Last it met here was in March 1975. Referring to the role of ESCAP the Prime Minister was confident that the deliberations would be distinctly useful and contribute further towards promoting the spirit of regional cooperation for the overall development of this region. "For Asia and the Pacific region, ESCAP has been the torch bearer and catalyst for economic and social development and has provided an added impetus to the process of growth in this region," he pointed out. Drawing the attention of the gathering to the disapperance of the super power rivalry and the era of the cold war, he said this had created "expectations of a peaceful future and fostered an environment conducive to the enhancement of regional cooperation. "The world is witnessing a general movement of the restructuring of economies away from command and control systems to market-based ones. The winds of change have affected Asia also. The unifying forces of development in the region should cement mutual relations and create a climate of confidence and faith," the Prime Minister emphasised. He called upon the member countries to unitedly strive for development of the region. Referring to the world economic scenario, the Prime Minister said the present recession was creating economic problems. There were other parts, though not developed as yet, that were witnessing substantial and consistently high rates of growth. "This establishes the complementarity that needs to be exploited for securing overall global welfare," he pointed out. The fast growing economies provide the opportunities that the economies in recession require to achieve revival. It was therefore important that this be understood by the developed and developing countries alike. Emphasising, that the need of the hour was "cooperation and not confrontation," Mr Narasimha Rao said the countries of the North should appreciate the desire of the developing countries to catch up with the rest of the world. It would be counter-productive to create problems on narrow short-term considerations, he cautioned. It was in this perspective that the free flow of resources, capital, technology and market access had become more relevant than ever before to give a strong impetus to global economic growth, he said. On the Asia Pacific region, he said for reasons of history, geography and culture it had gained a distinct ethos which joins together the mosaic of cultures and ethnic groups constituting this region. The economies of this region had achieved "some of the highest growth rates in the world today," and become the subject of analyses for economic and political planners all over the world. Trade and flow of investment within the region too had grown phenomenally giving this region the basis for forging a distinct Asian-Pacific identity and unity. The development of this identity would be realised if the sub-regional cooperation groupings such as SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] and ASEAN [Association of South East Asia Nations] could serve as building blocks towards developing and strengthening inter-sub-regional and region-wise cooperation, he opined. "We are observing a general tendency of national boundaries going down. Even the sub-regional groupings are expanding as is illustrated in the emergence of APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation)." Stating that it was necessary to address the economic and social issues before us in a wider framework than national/subregional perspectives, Mr Narasimha Rao said there was need for strengthening the socio-economic development programmes under the "one single umbrella of ESCAP" rather than duplicating and dividing them. ESCAP should thus play the role of a coordinator and catalyst for the promotion of region-wise trade and economic cooperation and for strengthening the economic ties between the sub-regional grouping. The Prime Minister said a large number of countries continued to battle against poverty, deprivation and unemployment. "We have to find a solution of these problems, which inevitably involves reforms, but the reforms must have a human face. The pace, range and scope of restructuring programmes should not burden those sections of society least able to bear them. Massive upgradation of education, health care, housing and transport are called for immediately. Though implementation of policies and programmes to alleviate poverty are primarily the responsibility of member countries, the support of the UN bodies in this gigantic task was essential, the Prime Minister said.
