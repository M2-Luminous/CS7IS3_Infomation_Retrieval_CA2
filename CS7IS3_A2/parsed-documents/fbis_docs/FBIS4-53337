"Wishing you happiness" Disappeared The weather in early January in North Korea is usually very cold, and in this frigid weather the communists stage a propaganda barrage, including political-ideological campaigns, to idolize Kim Il-song and his son, Kim Chong-il. That is why the new year atmosphere in North Korea is entirely different from what it used to be before liberation. And it is one of the main features of this season that the Workers Party [WPK] bustles about trying to make people feel that the atmosphere is less oppressive. In North Korea there is a lot of propaganda going on every month. But February is special because Kim Chong-il's birthday falls then. The lunar new year, the founding anniversary of the Academy of Sciences, and Machine Industry Day also fall in February. Formerly, the founding anniversary of Korean People's Army (KPA) was also observed then, and February marks the proclamation of the Communist Manifesto. But as arrangements for the transfer of power between the Kims took hold, Kim Chong-il's birthday came to assume special significance, and people have to bustle about at home and in their organizations making preparations to celebrate the "February Holiday," Kim Chong-il's birthday. [passage omitted] In North Korea the word "happiness" is interpreted by and large in a Confucian or superstitious sense. The communists have long claimed that there is no such thing as Heaven or Buddha, nor God. The Workers Party emphasizes that "No one should depend on Heaven and God, unscientific beings, but realize that he can be happy only under the solicitude and care of Kim Il-song and his son." That is why to say "Wish you happiness" would be tantamount to an insult to Kim Il-song and his son. [passage omitted] The typical greetings exchanged among North Korean people on New Year's Day are "Congratulations on the New Year." Some go one step farther and say, "Be healthy in the New Year." The highest form of greeting is to say, "Let us work harder to be loyal to the leader and the party." The words people use in addressing one another in North Korea differ slightly depending on one's social status. The word "tongji" [comrade in English] is used in addressing a superior, and the word "tongmu" [friend, or comrade in English] in addressing a subordinate. The word "sonsaeng" [teacher] is used among teachers when they address each other, or by a junior when he addresses his many years senior. In most cases "tongmu" or "tongji" is used. By the superior-subordinate relationship here is meant not only the relationship in offices between superiors and inferiors but also the differences in social status and sex. It is customary for women to use the word "tongji," which is considered more honorific than the word "tongmu," in addressing a male colleague who is equal in rank and about the same age, for the simple reason that he is a male. To give typical examples of how North Koreans address one another, they put either the surname or given name and his title before the word "tongmu,' for instance, "so and so guidance worker tongmu." In addressing a soldier, one puts his military rank before the word tongmu. In addressing an unmarried woman whose name is not known, the words "chonyo tongmu" are used. During their stay in Pyongyang, members of the South Korean delegation to the last North-South high-level talks were said to have used the word "agassi" when they talked to waitresses or female guides in their hotels or at the parties, and this evoked an ire of the waitresses and female guides. But as far as these waitresses were concerned, their protest was quite natural or so it seems. This is because the meaning of the word "agassi" is distorted in North Korea, and it implies a mean word associated with bar hostesses or toys for playboys. 2. Origin of "February Holiday" In the month of February all North Koreans are busy preparing for Kim Chong-il's birthday. This, together with the rigidity of social customs, produces an atmosphere giving the impression that no other human beings exist except Kim Il-song and his son in the North. Kim Chong-il's birthday began to be officially marked inside the party in 1973 shortly after he emerged as the future successor. The observation of his birthday gradually expanded until it became an official national holiday, observed both partywide and nationwide, beginning in 1976. As is well known, the Workers Party carried out concrete campaigns to highlight the image of Kim Chong-il as heir to Kim Il-song after he was formally designated as such under meticulously worked out many-sided plans. Kim Chong-il was born to Kim Il-song and his wife, Kim Chong-suk, in the former Soviet Union's far east where the senior Kim and his wife were spending relatively peaceful days after having taken refuge there from mopping-up operations by the Japanese Kanto Army. While partially acknowledging the circumstances surrounding Kim Chong- il's birth, the North Korean Communists worked out an elaborate plan to conceal information on the place of his birth. Under this plan it must have been not so difficult to change his birthplace from the Soviet Union to Mt. Paektu and present him as a genius from his childhood. Unexpected difficulties were encountered in the attempt to squash all kinds of sordid rumors and scandals about Kim Chong-il that circulated in the days when he was enroled at Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute and Namsan Higher Middle School. The main reason is that he indulged in so many unsavory acts. But in those days these scandals were regarded as something to be proud of in view of his great importance as the son of Kim Il-song instead of being looked upon as misconduct. Naturally it became an awfully difficult to conceal them. It must have been under Kim Il-song's orders that the North Korean Workers Party did its best in those days to preserve Kim Chong-il's "authority and prestige." This is apparent from the fact that the party presented "the 10-point program for establishing the unitary ideology system of the party" in 1974, strongly demanding the idolization not only of Kim Il-song but also of Kim Chong-il in accordance with the principle of "the unitary leadership system." The Kim Il-song clan concentrated its influence in such a way as to enhance Kim Chong-il's position, and this caused various secondary problems. It is well-known among party insiders that in those days Kim Chong-il's most intimate college classmates who were involved in his misconduct were ruthlessly punished. During the early part of Kim Chong-il's leadingship in art, filmdom in particular, with his post at the party's Department of Propaganda and Agitation, he indulged in debauchery with beautiful women in movie and theater circles for quite a long time. Shortly after Kim Chong-il was appointed as party secretary in charge of the WPK Department of Organization in his capacity as the future successor to power, his birthday was observed as a party holiday beginning in 1974, when he was 32. On his 34th birthday on 16 February 1976, his birthday was designated as a national holiday, and ever since it has been observed as such. 3. Kim Chong-il's Birthday and Lunar New Year North Korea reinstated traditional festivals such as lunar New Year's Day in preparation for the eventuality that it would be compelled by its domestic situation to agree to inter-Korean personnel exchanges not only at an official level but also at a private level. North Korea feared that through North-South talks South Koreans might come to notice that many traditional national festivals had long since disappeared, and North Koreans might come to notice how the South Koreans still observed traditional national festivals. True, North Korea revived some of the old festivals including the lunar New Year and the Tano Festival (the fifth day of the fifth lunar month). But the peculiar characteristics of the communist regime permitted the revival of these festivals only in form. Inasmuch as the lunar New Year happens to fall in about the same season with Kim Chong- il's birthday, it was an impossible thing to revive this festival in its original form. North Korea could have attached some significance to it, but did not do so because of Kim Chong-il's birthday. In those days in North Korea, as is the case now, it was inconceivable to think Kim Chong-il could be involved in any misconduct. Kim Il-song never permitted the disclosure of Kim Chong-il's debauchery, which remains the junior Kim's major misbehavior. A countless number of those infamous pimps who vied with each other in those days to curry favor with Kim Chong-il were subsequently sacrificed to prove that not Kim Chong-il, but the sycophants were responsible for all his flaws that appeared before or after he was designated as Kim Il-song's future successor. They include: Chon Mun- sop, then commander of the Guard Force; Chang Yun-pil, then adjutant general for security at Guard Department I, the General Bureau of Security; Pak Sung-un, then deputy director of propaganda at the political affairs bureau, the Ministry of Public Security; and Cha Kye- ryong, then head of the Movie Actors Group. Kim Chong-il continued to indulge in debauchery even after he was designated the successor, producing many more toadies. Kim Il- song's second wife, Kim Song-ae, dropped hints to him about Kim Chong- il's misconduct. But Kim Il-song squashed them recalling her interference when they were young and suspecting that Kim Song-ae might be dropping such hints in retaliation for her fall in her prestige in as a result of Kim Chong-il's designation as successor. However, at about the time Kim Chong-il's sex scandals were on the verge of becoming public, his relatives, including Hwang Chang-yop and his wife and Yang Hyong-sop, were officially informed of the misconduct, making them concerned about its possible consequences. With this happening, Kim Il-song became enraged and exercised his authority to bring the trouble under control. First, Kim Il-song examined Kim Chong-il's performance as successor in the making, and after determining the causes of the trouble, dealt with those responsible. Later, during a top-level session of the December 1977 WPK Plenum, he placed "special organizational issues" on the agenda. With Kim Il-song in the chair, the meeting did not scrutinize Kim Chong-il's conduct, but nevertheless evaluated his performance very closely. From beginning to end, the meeting examined "problems that have cropped up within the party." Following the Plenum, the party removed Kim Chong-il's portraits from some places and suspended the campaign to idolize him. In addition, such strict restrictions were placed on matters requiring Kim Chong- il's full participation that he was allowed to handle them only with the approval of Kim Il-song. In those days ordinary homes were not allowed to hang Kim Chong-il's portraits; only the Party Central Committee and other party organizations at the central level were allowed to do so. That is why ordinary people had practically no way of knowing about this ruffled father- son relationship. However, it is true that people got the impression that the frenzied campaign to idolize Kim Chong-il had nearly come to a halt and that Kim Chong-il himself was so circumspect as to take a back seat. With things coming to this, the question of making Kim Chong-il the successor became a subject of open discussion once again beginning in the late 1970's because Kim Il-song had no way of choosing anyone other than Kim Chong-il as his successor. In 1973, a year after Kim Il-song's 60th birthday in 1972, Kim Chong-il was appointed as Party secretary in charge of organization. However, there was a time when various adulatory titles for Kim Chong-il disappeared for a while--titles such as "the Party Center," "the sagacious leader," "the great Kimilsongist," and "the lodestar." In those days a harsh punishment was meted out to Yi Yong-mu, Kim Chong-il's notorious pimp who was promoted to the directorship of the General Political Bureau, the Ministry of People's Armed Forces, from its deputy directorship. Many of his associates also became a subject of discussion as possible targets of punishment. Some of these pimps were hit hard by Kim Chong-il himself for the mistakes they committed as pimps, and others were punished by his father because they were too sycophantic to Kim Chong-il. Then Minister of Culture Pak Chong-sin, the former South Korean stage actress who defected to the North, ended up losing her position because she, a middle-aged woman, offered no help to Kim Chong-il in his debauchery and was in fact regarded as a source of trouble by meddling in every move of famous actresses. On the surface, the sole excuse used in dismissing people in North Korea is the failure to implement party policy and the distortion of Kim Il- song's instructions. In all cases, the real reason was that officials had called for righteousness against the wrongdoings of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il or they failed to please their whims. This same Kim Chong-il came into the spotlight once again during the process of making preparations for the Sixth WPK Congress in 1979, and he has remained in the spotlight ever since. Leaving his work and daily life aside for future discussion, here I will briefly describe how North Korea celebrates Kim Chong-il's birthday. 4. Additional North Korean National Holiday As was the case with Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il has tried hard to attach great significance to his birthday. [passage omitted] There was one change that took place for the first time after Kim Chong-il was elevated to his post as director of the WPK Department of Organization and Guidance. Ordinary people came to know of it two to three years later. There are many who still do not know about it. The change was the replacement of license numbers of cadres' private cars with the numerals indicating the date of Kim Chong-il's birthday. Beginning in the mid-70's Kim Chong-il personally presented sedans to cadres as gifts. All these cars carried license numbers beginning with 2-16. This practice continues. North Koreans call these sedans "gift cars" or "Central Party cars." [passage omitted] Cars carrying license numbers beginning with 2-16 can pass check points in the suburbs of Pyongyang and travel anywhere in the country without a travel pass, curfew pass, or Sunday pass. North Korea raised the lower limit on the ranks of officials eligible for the private use of automobiles by one or two grades beginning in the early 1970's due to the gasoline shortage. Lower ranking officials had to use official cars dispatched upon request. Even the operation of dispatched cars was strictly controlled, with their use banned on Sundays and at nighttime. Kim Chong-il presents signed "citations" and "watches bearing his name" to close aides. Anyone who receives a citation or a gift watch from Kim Il-song or Kim Chong-il who retires under the age limit, is entitled to receive his pre-retirement salary. For this reason, these citations and watches are highly coveted. These are luxury watches made to order, and have a large variety, including gold Rolexes and Omegas. They are allocated according to the ranks of the awardees. Of course, retirement pay varies according to rank. Anyone who had an opportunity to meet Kim Il-song or Kim Chong-il on official business, or who was granted an audience in recognition of meritorious service, will be recorded as one granted an audience. He will not only be given social prominence but also be assured of a monetary reward in his old age. Of course, its size varies depending on the substance and nature of the audience. In North Korea no cadres, party members, or non-party officials are allowed to exchange gifts. This is because the ban on exchange of gifts is stipulated in the 10 Party principles on the grounds that gift exchanges are bound to result in an unprincipled collaboration. When a cadre is discovered exchanging gifts, he becomes a "target of disciplinary action" and is subject to charges of violating the unitary ideology system. He is subjected to disciplinary action by the party or loses his job. However, it is a stark reality that despite these strict controls, the practice of exchanging gifts is rampant due to chronic scarcities and shortages. But things are different with Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. As was the case with Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il is fond of exchanging gifts. While watching him playing his gift-exchange game, one may question whether he is administering the affairs of state or playing house. This is because he indulges so much in the game of exchanging gifts and other tokens with his aides and toadies. [passage omitted] On his birthday Kim Chong-il gives gifts to his close aides, top cadres, and even second-echelon officials in the Secretariat according to rank. He pays more attention to choosing gifts on his birthday than he does on the occasion of the "DPRK Foundation Day" or "Party Foundation Day." In some cases he gives far more and far better gifts on his birthday than on his father's. Most probably, he might be doing so under special instructions from Kim Il-song. With the establishment of Kim Il-song's and Kim Chong-il's practice of exchanging gifts with others, a gift section was formally set up in the WPK Central Committee to prepare all gifts to be presented. In addition, the Office of the President and the second bureau of the General Bureau of Security each have their own special sections to handle gifts from Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. In special cases, Kim Chong-il presents automobiles to some cadres on his birthday on 16 February. Ordinarily, daily necessities and food items are the bulk of the gifts. Generally, the list includes: fabric for suits, shirts and ties, underwear, briefcases, suitcases, and various home electronic appliances, books of poetry, quotations from Kim Il-song or Kim Chong-il, fountain pens, ballpoints, calendars, etc., etc. Included in food items are: venison, pheasant, various kinds of meat, canned meat, tangerines, candies, and alcoholic beverages (one or two bottles). Gifts are presented collectively to each unit of each party organization sometimes, and individually at others. With food gift items, it is customary to share them with people in the same office or subordinates. But occasionally, this is not the case with some recipients. Before Kim Chong-il's birthday was designated as an official holiday, Kim Il-song on the occasion of his 60th birthday had a serious and lengthy discussion with his aides to examine various problems that might arise in the future when Chong-il's birthday was to be observed as a national holiday so that they might work out measures to deal with them in advance. The reason was that they believed that the observance of Kim Chong-il's birthday would be of great importance in idolizing him. Kim Chong-il was born on 16 February 1942. In those days the date 8 February was observed as People's Armed Forces Day in commemoration of the founding of the KPA on that date in 1948. Therefore, realistically it would be a problem if they were to observe two national days in the same month, about a week apart. The reason was that they had to highlight Kim Chong-il's birthday, and yet it would be illogical to downgrade Armed Forces Day. After much thought, the WPK had at a fantastic idea. The 8 February holiday would be merged with the founding anniversary of the People's Revolutionary Army Day on 25 April, integrating the two into People's Armed Forces Day. The Party claimed that this was in line with the KPA being the successor to the People's Revolutionary Army. The underlying thought was that the date of birth is something that cannot be changed and that by combining the two armed forces days, the party would be able not only to highlight the KPA as the inheritor of the revolutionary tradition but also to enable the KPA to take pride in its history, which is as long as that of the army of any other country. 5. Birthday Functions Functions on Kim Chong-il's birthday do not differ much from those on Kim Il-song's except for the peculiar focus of the former. Emphasis is placed on highlighting Kim Chong-il's image as an "artistic genius" and "the sun of the future." Customarily, he loathes appearing at formal conferences or official gatherings. On the contrary, he rather likes informal get-togethers, such as social gatherings, private parties, concerts, and drinking parties. [passage omitted] The subjects of conversation at social gatherings held at Kim Chong-il's initiative are mostly political issues and matters related to the idolization of him, or sex problems discussed in the background of music and dance. It is no exaggeration to say that the basic established theories behind current party policies in North Korea have their origin in conversations at these sundry informal gatherings such as private parties organized by Kim Chong-il's aides in his honor, where all problems converge so that he and his aides might discuss them. Parties are organized prior to Kim Chong-il's birthday presumably to decide the scope and form of the celebration. Subjects of discussion will include: the direction of political work; the substance of propaganda and agitation; the direction of art and cultural work; matters relating to report meetings, commemorative lecture meetings, and seminars; the direction of overseas propaganda; the direction for birthday celebrations giving full play to the characteristics of each sector; the substance, methods, and forms of events that will be held by agencies at all levels and by the general public in celebration of the birthday. Needless to say, not all these matters are discussed each time. Except for policy issues concerning the birthday observance and some of the matters relating to the scope, form, and substance of the observance, it is a rule to follow past practice even without specific instructions. In the early 1970's, his birthday began to be observed. Subsequently, the scope and substance of its celebration gradually expanded and diversified each year except for about a one year hiatus in around 1978. Mass artistic presentations developed as the main form of celebration. In the beginning the observance of Kim Chong-il's birthday was overshadowed by Kim Il-song's, but it is significant that the observance increasingly became an open affair and finally developed into a public observance full of political paraphernalia. Until the late 1980's the general substance and form of celebration consisted of art performances in each unit and organization in addition to those presented by national art organizations. On the whole, performances at each unit took the form of a mass presentation by administrative, party, and other cadres of the unit. Strikingly, they have sought artistic impressions of loyalty through inter-unit competition. Normally each unit presents art performances three or four times. But they spend several months making preparations. Some go so far as to concentrate on rehearsals leaving work aside. Others lacking their own talents appoint outsiders or expert artists to certain positions in advance and call them up when they need them as members of the cast in their presentations in honor of Kim Chong-il's birthday. Powerful organizations such as the Central Committee are more prone to this kind of expediency. Kim Chong-il or Kim Il-song takes part in the best program selected from art performances presented by non-professional groups, and the cast of that program will win the trust and special consideration of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. That is why all units are vying each other to, in their words, "offer happiness and satisfaction." That is what is going on in North Korea today. All kinds of things occur in preparation for performances. Some cadres, total strangers to the arts, are compelled to participate because they cannot decline, for it involves the question of loyalty. The moment they appear on stage, they stand like a totem pole, unable to utter their lines, or they act so awkwardly that the audience breaks into laughter. It is so comical that Kim Chong-il likes it. That is why more and more people are participating in birthday performances, and some interesting performances are staged. Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il mobilize various party and government organizations to exact birthday gifts from our 20 million fellow countrymen in the North. As on Kim Il-song's birthday, all organizations and certain individuals are forced to present letters of congratulations on Kim Chong-il's birthday. This was established as a routine political formality. [passage omitted] They have even created a special flower called the Kim Chong-il flower just as they previously created the Kim Il-song flower. On Kim Chong-il's birthday, all units and inhabitants have to present their gifts, which are roughly divided into four categories: first, foreign currency as a token of loyalty; second, gold as a token of loyalty; gifts of loyalty (health food, agricultural products, traditional native products, fishery products, and various ornaments and valuables); fourth, the selection of the Kim Chong-il's ideal maiden.
