According to Ukrainian authorities the film carries anti-Ukrainian overtones. "We would not want this to be repeated, we do not want a propaganda war," Ukrainian Embassy attache Teodozij Starak told PAP Wednesday. Starak directed attention to press comments preceding the film which spoke of "battles with the German, Ukrainian and Soviet occupiers." "We have not reacted to any other articles in the press, but this film was shown on state television," Starak added. According to the embassy, such films do not serve the development of positive relations between Ukraine and Poland. "Its not state television, its public television," Foreign Ministry Press Secretary Grzegorz Dziemidowicz commented. The Polish Foreign Ministry will take up a position on the matter in a few days, after having viewed the film, and listened to expert opinions.
