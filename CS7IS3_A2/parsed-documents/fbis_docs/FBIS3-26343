Amnesty International says the nuns were arrested last June and jailed for allegedly taking part in an anti-Chinese demonstration. Amnesty urged concerned people to write to the Tibetan Regional Government, asking for clarification of the case. Last month, another human rights group, the Tibet Information Network, said the Chinese authorities had stepped efforts to halt political activism among Buddhist nuns.
