The place and date of the news conference are not given. De Leon begins by announcing that on 28 February he sent three draft laws to Congress, one of which calls for reforms to the Electoral and Political Parties Law that will reduce to 76 the number of deputies and for making possible the participation of civic committees in the elections. The president adds that another draft calls for reforms to Article 201 of the Penal Code in order "to punish more severely the individuals responsible for kidnapping, as this is one of the crimes that harms society the most." De Leon explains that "prison sentences for kidnappers will be increased to 25 and 30 years, instead of the 8 and 15 years currently in force," and that capital punishment -- which is now being applied only if the kidnaped person dies during the action -- will also be applied "if the victims are defenseless, such as minors, persons over 60 years old, and women, as well as if the victim suffers severe injuries." The third draft is the president's veto of a decree that made reforms to the Social Welfare Institute of Journalists. Answering a reporter's question on the issue of human rights and capital punishment, de Leon answers that "there is a convention that establishes diminishing and possibly eliminating capital punishment," and "it is up to Congress to examine this issue carefully." With regard to recent visitors, de Leon answers another question by saying: "Today I had the honor of receiving the French minister delegate of humanitarian action and human rights and the German vice chancellor. The Guatemalan Government and president were very pleased to receive from the French minister not only a ratification of support for the Government of Guatemala, but also to receive from the French people and Government recognition of the efforts the people and Government of Guatemala are making to preserve and strengthen our democracy." On the same subject, the president adds that the German vice chancellor "reiterated Germany's economic, technical, and moral support for Guatemala." The reporters then ask de Leon Carpio about the public health situation, to which he responds that he had an urgent meeting today with the health and finance ministers to discuss the purchase of medications and the payment of old debts so the hospitals may receive urgently needed supplies, such as oxygen tanks.
