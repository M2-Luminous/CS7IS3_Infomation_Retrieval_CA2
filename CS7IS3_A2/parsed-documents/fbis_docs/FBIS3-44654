The Ministry of Communications decided to construct expressways at the beginning of the 1980s when the country's economy began to boom. Building of the first one started in 1984 in northeast China, from Shenyang to Dalian. After its completion in 1990, the 375-km- long road brought with it great economic and social efficiency. The ministry made a long-term program in 1988 to build a national highway network in several five-year plan periods. Since then, some expressways have been built from Guangzhou to Foshan, Xian to Lintong, Beijing to Tianjin and Beijing to Shijiazhuang. Several expressways from Shanghai to Nanjing, Guangzhou to Shenzhen and Hangzhou to Ningbo are now under construction. These expressways have given an impetus to the local economic development along these roads. Some industrial zones and economic development areas have arisen along the routes.
