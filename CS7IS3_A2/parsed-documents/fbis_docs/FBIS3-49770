Will this be a government that will manage to stop the run of misfortunes by surviving the parliament's entire term of office for the first time since 1989, or will it end up like the previous governments? Deputy Prime Minister Marek Borowski has been saying that changes will be introduced to the extent possible. Will these changes be sufficient? Apart from an unshaken belief in the current Cabinet's success expressed by Zbigniew Siematkowski of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], other politicians have been having many fears, and these fears are not always accompanied by the malicious hope that the current coalition may be just another example of failure. Winners' Optimism Zbigniew Siemiatkowski thinks that the coalition is heading in the right direction: "One can have doubts about whether the rate at which we are going is appropriate, or about whether everything contained in the SLD election program was implemented. In that regard, everyone, of course, has a right to his own opinion," he says. "We regard the 19 September elections as entering into a contract with society for four years. In the contract, there are some priority goals, and there are also some less important ones that will be implemented at a later stage. The year 1994 is a time of fundamental reorganization of the process of managing the state and also of macroeconomic processes aimed at eliminating the biggest irregularities in the economic policy. We are aware that society, while agreeing to the direction of the transformations, spoke against the social policy implemented thus far. We will try to coordinate the two processes, but it is not possible to do that within a few months. But some mechanisms were included even in the current budget draft, which will bring improvement for households as quickly as in two to three years." According to Siemiatkowski, the main danger facing the current Cabinet comes from the impatience of those who expect quick successes, whereas the Cabinet's main chance is that it is in the comfortable position of being able to plan its policy. The previous cabinets did not have that comfort. "The failure of our Cabinet and of our ideas would be a failure of the entire system," Siemiatkowski says. "The failure of the reforms carried through by the left-wing government would not automatically mean that society will put its faith in someone else from the left wing." "The Union of Labor [UP] is further removed from the governing coalition today than at any time in the past," says UP leader Ryszard Bugaj. "Those who have a dominating position in the coalition--I do not think the entire coalition speaks with one voice--seem to have a preference for a strategy of adaptation that will leave the country's powerful centers intact." The moods and aspirations of big social groups play a minor role from the standpoint of that strategy. According to Bugaj, an attempt at a radical shift in the economic policy would be massively opposed by the press (that is, mostly the liberal press) and by the president, even if big social groups expected the policy to be implemented. Under the circumstances, the coalition's leadership decided in favor of trying to gain the support of small but strong pressure groups. Such a policy is dangerous because it can lead to a conviction in society that no matter how one votes on election day, the result is always the same, and big frustrations always result from such convictions. Part of the SLD is clearly heading toward a liberalization of the economy. Influential SLD activists think that the party will manage to achieve what the Democratic Union [UD] failed to achieve along with the liberals because the SLD has the left-wing label. That is not very likely to happen. "Some of my colleagues have been watching that with satisfaction, thinking that UP will remain as the only credible political party that does not change its views," Bugaj says. "The trouble is that, during the next elections (it is not a certain thing at all that they must take place in four years because they might as well happen sooner), many people will decide that mistakes and failures are to be attributed to the so-called left wing, and we are included in that label." "A Moment of Truth Will Come Soon" ...prophesies Bugaj. "A major danger to the coalition's coherency will come from radical social problems. They do exist even now anyway, but they will not be a danger to the coalition until they are articulated and transformed into specific action. That is because then the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ], which is very dependent on social moods, will have its room for maneuvering radically curtailed." According to Janusz Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], the next presidential elections are a prospect for the governing coalition (unless there is social unrest). With the current configuration of forces in parliament determined by the voters, presidential rules are the only alternative left at the coalition's disposal. So the coalition's stability is a guarantee for maintaining the parliamentary-Cabinet rules. The political calendar is advantageous to the governing coalition. We have both self-governmental and presidential elections coming up. Both Lech Walesa and Aleksander Kwasniewski have already begun their presidential campaigns. So the coalition has a very good chance of surviving till the time of the presidential election. But the coalition's weakest spot is in the individual parties that make it up. The government does not have to be afraid of losing 30 or 50 votes in the parliament because the margin of safety it enjoys is substantial. So the party leaders' biggest problems will concern what happens inside their individual parties. Aleksander Kwasniewski wants to change his electorate by courting those who up to now were UD voters, and by showing that the SLD is a modern type of party that cares about the country's stability. On the other hand, if Kwasniewski loses the votes of those who up to now were his electorate, he may lose the presidential election. That contradiction has been manifesting itself more and more though because Kwasniewski publicly admits to being a social-liberal, and that is primarily because he does not like poverty. But he has not yet decided to make such bold statements within the party itself, and this is the way it is going to be for a long time. Besides, there are different trends within the SLD, and different aspirations as well. According to Piechocinski, coming into alliance with the Polish Socialist Party was a big mistake because it strengthened the extreme left-wing and orthodox wing within the SLD. The OPZZ is another problem because its leaders have big political ambitions, and, apart from that, an internal fight among various leaders is going on within it. Kwasniewski may face enormous problems with coming to grips with this phenomenon. In addition, the situation is being complicated by the position taken by UP, which remonstrates with the electorate upon... The SLD Having Betrayed Left-Wing Ideals That causes a certain gap because the SLD's rank and file, who have been watching this, are asking themselves the question: "Apart from Kwasniewski's personal satisfaction, what is the use of a victory at all?" That may lead the SLD to transform itself into a federation of clubs that will not vote the same way in the Sejm. The Polish Peasant Party [PSL] also faces a difficult situation because there have occurred big differentiations in the countryside, and there have emerged many groups there whose interests are completely different. It is impossible to satisfy all of them. That is how the big debate in the PSL concerning its program came about: What kind of a party is the PSL supposed to be, and what are its ideas concerning the state? If the PSL decides to meet the demands of all of its electorate groups on an immediate basis, that could create serious problems for the governing coalition. But the biggest danger comes from the possible lack of economic achievements. "Unless there are such achievements, the current political elite will be thrown out with a bang because the voters will push them aside for their inefficiency," Piechocinski says. Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN] predicts that a Belweder-peasant government will be formed in a few months. "The most likely scenario for the current governing coalition to split up is for a... Conflict Between the SLD and the President ...to occur during the presidential election campaigns of Lech Walesa and Aleksander Kwasniewski," says Krol, who, under this scenario, also predicts the dismissal of the "postcommunist ministers" from the government, who had been recommended by the SLD. According to the KPN leader, the SLD will then be in the opposition, and we could see early elections. The current governing coalition could also be divided through evolutions of both parties, which today are bound by power and a similar past. "The PSL wants to become a centrist and a traditional kind of party, whereas the SLD wants to be social-democratic in order to replace UD," Krol says. But Zbigniew Janas of UD thinks that the fate of the current coalition depends on what happens to the SLD itself: "There is an enormous external [as published] differentiation within the SLD, which is similar to the one present in the Citizens Parliamentary Club [OKP] after the elections of June 1989. It would be a worthwhile effort to examine the course of events leading up to the OKP's disintegration. Most probably a split within the SLD will take place at the same rate. For the moment, there is still the euphoria in the aftermath of the elections and the satisfaction after having taken over power, but disputes will begin when the government encounters its first problems," Janas says. According to the Sejm deputy for UD, internal opposition will increase its strength also within the PSL, which may pose a danger for the entire coalition. This is even more so because there will not be as much money devoted to agriculture as some would like to see. Janas thinks it would be a miracle if the coalition supporting Pawlak's Cabinet survived until the end of the four-year term.
