FR940323-2-00041 FR940323-2-00028 DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed Disposal and Reuse of Naval Hospital Philadelphia, PA Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), the Department of Navy announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the potential environmental effects of the disposal and reuse of the Naval Hospital (NAVHOSP) Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In accordance with recommendations of the Department of Defense Secretary's 1988 Commission on Base Realignment and Closure, the Navy has disestablished NAVHOSP Philadelphia. The proposed action to be analyzed in the EIS involves the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of NAVHOSP Philadelphia for subsequent reuse. NAVHOSP Philadelphia consists of approximately 49 acres and a total of 56 buildings, and structures, including 47 permanent, eight semi-permanent, and one temporary facility. NAVHOSP Philadelphia is located in the southern portion of the City of Philadelphia, north of the Philadelphia Naval Base, in the County of Philadelphia. The reuse of NAVHOSP Philadelphia has been studied by the Mayor of Philadelphia's Commission on Defense Conversion. The redevelopment/reuse plan developed by the Commission will be the basis for the EIS. The reuse plan proposes a 15 acre area for market rate housing, a five acre nursing home/assisted living facility, and a 30 acre addition to Philadelphia's Fairmount Park. The Park area would include 13 acres of passive recreation, four acres of active recreation, and 13 acres for parking. The ``no action'' alternative, Navy retention of NAVHOSP Philadelphia land and infrastructure in caretaker status, will be addressed in the EIS. However, because of the process mandated by the Base Closure and Realignment Act, selection of the ``no action'' alternative would be considered outside the jurisdiction of the Navy. The EIS to be prepared by the Navy will address the following known areas of concern: effects of new development at the Hospital on the natural and socioeconomic environments, effects of future growth on area schools, recreations facilities and transportation systems, and the effects of reuse on any historic properties on-site. Preliminary studies indicate the most of NAVHOSP Philadelphia is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, with many of the buildings and structures contributing to the district's significance. Major environmental issues that will be addressed in the EIS included, but are not limited to, air quality, water quality, wetlands, endangered species, transportation, and socioeconomic impacts. The Navy will initiate a scoping process for the purposes of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues related to the proposed reuse alternatives. A pubic scoping meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, April 6, 1994, beginning at 7:30 p.m., at the Holy Spirit Church, in the Church Hall, 1835 Hartranft Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This meeting will be announced in the local papers. A brief presentation will precede request for public comment. Navy representatives will be available at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern to the public. It is important that federal, state, and local agencies and interested individuals take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns that should be addressed during the preparation of the EIS. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit their oral comments to five minutes. Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comment in addition to, or in lieu of, oral comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics which the commentor believes the EIS should address. Written statements and or questions regarding the scoping process should be mailed no later than April 29, 1994, to: Commanding Officer, Northern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, 10 Industrial Highway, Lester, Pennsylvania 19113 (Attn: Mr. Robert Ostermueller, Code 202), telephone (610) 595&hyph;0759. Dated: March 18, 1994. Patrick W. Kelley, CAPT, JAGC, USN, Alternate Federal Register Liaison Officer. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6792 Filed 3&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3810&hyph;AE&hyph;M
