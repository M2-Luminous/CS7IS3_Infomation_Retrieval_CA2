He explained that such a decision "would violate GATT and would conflict with the interests of the world's large exporting nations." Rexrodt said his country's investments in Mexico will increase if Mexico signs an agreement for reciprocal promotion and protection of investments. In 1993, 31 percent of Mexico's exports to Europe went to Germany and, in turn, Germany became Mexico's foremost commercial partner in the region. After meeting with Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello Macias, Rexrodt explained that Germany has given Mexico priority status in its relations with Latin America. An example of this, he said, is the "Technogerma Mexico 1994" industrial fair, which was inaugurated by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Monday.
