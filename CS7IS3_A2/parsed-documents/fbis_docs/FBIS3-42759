The tension in relations between Russia and the Baltic countries is mounting. State Duma Deputy Vyacheslav Igrunov ("Yabloko"), member of the Committee on the CIS, answered OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's questions about the prospects for the development of these relations. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Do you feel that the friction in Russia's relations with the "Baltic troika" has grown more intense recently? [Igrunov] Yes, probably. Whereas the status of the Russian-speaking minority in the new independent states was of little interest to most people in Russia at one time, now there is so much concern about this problem that it has even resulted in the revision of policy guidelines. Politicians from the "patriotic" camp and even those who are customarily called democrats have displayed profound impatience with their neighbors because of the status of their fellow countrymen. In a certain sense the new round of conflicts in relations with the Baltic countries was unavoidable. We are caught in a vicious circle: The deterioration of conditions in Russia is motivating the political class in the Baltic countries to seek a place under NATO's protective umbrella. Any Western concessions in this respect then evoke an unhealthy reaction from Russia. We were too late to do everything possible for the Russian-speaking minority during a relatively calm period, and now we have to take extraordinary steps to keep the situation from getting worse, and all of this is being done today, now that we have a new parliament, where the absolute majority of deputies are in favor of the restoration of the USSR or of dramatic measures to protect Russian interests. Similar changes have taken place in the agencies of the executive branch of government. This is making a grievous impression on our northwestern neighbors, an impression which will be exceptionally difficult to dispel. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] If the majority of Duma deputies are in favor of restoring the USSR, then why did the number of deputies signing up for the parliamentary committee on the CIS fall short of even the number required by the rules of procedure for the formation of a committee? [Igrunov] There is no contradiction here. On the contrary, the committee is supposed to find civilized ways of establishing cooperation within the CIS for progress in integration, but most deputies do not even acknowledge the CIS as an entity worthy of consideration. They are not concerned about these matters and do not feel that they warrant attention. They prefer simple solutions--either economic pressure or the use of force in some form. They are acting according to Zhirinovskiy's logic: "They will crawl to us on their knees and beg to become Russian provinces." [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Will the recent decisions of the Brussels session of the NATO Council influence the leaders of the Baltic states to give up their plans to join this military bloc? [Igrunov] No, they will continue to seek membership. The experience of recent years has shown that, despite the West's cautious stance, the persistence of the Baltic countries has always brought them success. Apparently, the leaders of those states are now hoping for the exacerbation of the situation in Russia, which could change the NATO stance. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Which are the problems that could escalate tension in the near future? [Igrunov] One example is the military transit traffic through Lithuania to Kaliningrad Oblast, which is still part of Russia's territory and one of its main military bases. Any attempt to limit this traffic could evoke a regrettable response. Furthermore, there is a Lithuanian minority living in Kaliningrad Oblast. This ethnic minority has assimilated well and has not displayed any particular interest in its historical roots, but it still might be exploited for the escalation of tension. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Are you saying, in other words, that difficulties can be anticipated primarily in relations with Lithuania? [Igrunov] No, they are more likely to occur in relations with Latvia and Estonia. In my opinion, this will be caused primarily by the deterioration of economic conditions. Russia is unlikely to continue allowing the free re-export of its nonferrous metals and fuel through the Baltic countries. These operations are now being conducted with the active participation of the Russian-speaking population there; the restriction of the re-export operations could have an adverse effect on this minority's economic status and cause ethnic and cultural conflicts. Besides this, there is the extremely acute problem of the civil rights of our fellow countrymen. Latvian and Estonian politicians are trying to exploit the tension resulting from Zhirinovskiy's victory. A third of the Russian-speaking population in Latvia will be ineligible to vote in local government elections. There is little difference between this and the situation that existed in South Africa until recently. A legislative bill on the prosecution of individuals who were engaged in anti-Estonian activity during the years of Soviet occupation is being deliberated in Estonia. According to this document, the laws of the Estonian Republic remained in force during the whole period when Estonia was part of the Soviet Union, and all of the people who violated these laws are criminals and should be punished. It is true that there have been verbal stipulations that these legal standards were not completely in force at that time, but this does create the possibility of judicial proceedings against any individual who lived in Estonia during the Soviet era. Most of the Russian-speaking population did not even know anything about these laws. Obviously, the new law--if it is passed--will be enforced selectively--on ethnic grounds. There are already some suggestions of this. Relations with the Russian-speaking population have been relatively calm to date in Lithuania (just as, incidentally, recent relations with the Polish minority). This could continue if A. Brazauskas' economic policies do not fail. In all other respects, Lithuania will be extremely active and is most likely to be more persistent than the others in seeking NATO membership. Nevertheless, if the Russian Government and parliament behave prudently, Lithuania could serve as a bridge to the two other Baltic states for the improvement of relations with them. [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Do you feel that Russian policy toward the new independent states is acquiring new aims? [Igrunov] Patriotic aims are unavoidable in Russian policy. In my opinion, Zhirinovskiy is not simply a Russian problem, but a global one. Look at what is happening in Germany or the United States. We can only wonder whether European civilization is capable of a reasonable response to its own challenge. If we view the matter from this vantage point, Zhirinovskiy is a permanent factor, and not a temporary one, in our policy. The alternative is politicians like Luzhkov, and not the democrats. We are running out of time, we will have to make our move soon, and now we must decide how we can preserve our own values in this situation.
