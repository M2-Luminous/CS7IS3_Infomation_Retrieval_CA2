Wang Jue, an economics professor at the Beijing-based Party School of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said that in instituting a modern enterprise system, major state enterprises will have multiple principal holders of their property rights, instead of just one principal holder, that is, the state. The change is vital to the success of enterprise restructuring, said Wang, who is attending the current session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Under a planned economy, a state enterprise operated as a subsidiary of a government administrative department, without the status of a legal entity, he said. [sentence as received] According to Wang, in fact, the transformation of their operational mechanism by state enterprises means turning state property into the property of a legal entity. "The state will sever its administrative ties with enterprises by permitting legal entities to invest in enterprises. Only in this way can we increase enterprises' competitiveness," he said. The government may either entrust investment companies to operate state-owned property or lease such property to these companies, he said. These companies will become legal entities entrusted by the state to make sure that state-owned property will not be infringed and will increase in value, he explained. The economist also stressed the importance of separating the ownership of the investor (the state) from that of a legal entity (an enterprise). Under given conditions, the ownership of the investor takes the form of holding the stock right by the investor, he said. That means that as a shareholder, the investor should have the right to receive returns from its assets and to participate in making policy decisions and choosing managers, he explained. As a result, the investor will become a shareholder of the enterprise, represent the people or perform the duties of a property owner on behalf of the state, he said. "Therefore, state enterprises will not change their nature, but will change their managerial and operational methods only," he noted. Only thus is it possible to create necessary conditions for the establishment of a modern enterprise system, he said. It is very difficult for major state enterprises to solve such problems as unemployment resulting from the transformation of their operational mechanism, he said. According to Wang Jue, the solution to such problems lies in taking comprehensive measures by both the government and society. First of all, the state should assist a number of key enterprises in expanding their capacity and providing more jobs. Second, the state should earmark funds to help retirees, veteran workers and the disabled solve their problems in their livelihood. "In my opinion, the money should not be given to individuals, but should be used to invest in joint-stock companies so as to draw dividends," he said. Third, it is necessary to encourage some workers to shift to the service sector. The economist also emphasized the need to establish more foundations and various other organizations to alleviate the burden of state enterprises in running social welfare. "I am sure that with the implementation of these supplementary reform measures, major state-owned enterprises will certainly be able to operate efficiently," he said.
