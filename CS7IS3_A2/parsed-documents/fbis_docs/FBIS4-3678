Age-old legends and touching scenes again added splendor to Sino-Turkmen friendship. At 1515, Premier Li Peng, who is currently on a visit to Turkmenistan, arrived at the Ashkhabad Carpet Factory, which was established over 60 years ago, for a visit. Factory Director (Bayilan) warmly welcomed Premier Li Peng and his party at the gate. After walking into the workshop, Li Peng frequently extended greetings to women workers skillfully doing their work. The factory director said: The factory employs over 1,000 staff and workers. The carpets it produces are famous all over the world for their beauty as well as their fine and close-woven texture. It is here that Turkmen's industriousness and wisdom, as demonstrated by pairs of weaving hands making their traditional carpets, enjoy long- standing popularity and brisk sales to other parts of the world. What makes the factory proud is the fact that Turkmen carpets have won eight gold medals at international expositions. One of them was awarded by the Paris Expo in 1937. Factory Director (Bayilan) said to Li Peng: The carpet weaving industry occupies an extremely important position in Turkmenistan. Our national emblem incorporates five basic carpet designs. Chinese guests gasped with admiration at pieces of carpets full of ancient, legendary figures at the factory museum. Pointing at a carpet with designs woven on both sides, the factory director said: The texture of this rare carpet is very close-woven. It has over 1 million knitting knots per square meter. The host said with pride: The craftsmanship of the decorative carpets and tapestries produced by the factory is very exquisite. They are very valuable. The factory has an annual output of 2,700 square meters [figure as published]. Products are mainly sold to Germany and Britain. Standing in front of a carpet woven with a dragon design, Li Peng examined the carpet for a long time. It is an unusual carpet, woven with a design of eight legendary Chinese dragons and a cotton boll, which is a traditional Turkmen design. According to a briefing given by the host, this was the design on the ceiling of a mosque in the 12th century. A male artisan and an 18-year-old girl tried to weave the design on a carpet. When the weaving of the design on the carpet was almost finished, with only a space of 15 cm left undone, they perished in an earthquake that destroyed the mosque. The wife of the artisan completed the weaving of the carpet. Factory Director (Bayilan) said: "The design signifies that Turkmen-Chinese contacts date back to ancient times." The guests were touched by the story. Li Peng and his wife posed for a photo in front of the carpet. To welcome Premier Li Peng's visit to Turkmenistan and the carpet factory, two female workers specially hastened to produce a tapestry woven with a portrait of Li Peng and offered it as a present to their honored Chinese guest. The factory director said: "In the tapestry are woven the friendly feelings of all the workers of our factory for you and the Chinese people." In return, Premier Li Peng offered a traditional Chinese embroidery as a present to the host. He said: "Like your carpets, famous Chinese embroidery is also embroidered by needle, stitch by stitch." At the end of the visit, Premier Li Peng gladly wrote an inscription: "Great Achievements From Industriousness and Wisdom and Masterpieces of Superb Craftsmanship." The visit, which lasted less than an hour, left an unforgettable impression on the Chinese guests.
