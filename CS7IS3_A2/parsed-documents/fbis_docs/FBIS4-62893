The strike is staged at the call of the Independent Mine Workers' Union, which demands that the Karaganda Coal administration sign an agreement to guarantee better social conditions, such as the timely payment of the wages, social, and medical insurance and the allocation of credits for the purchase of housing. The administration refuses to sign such an agreement with the union on the grounds that an agreement on tariffs has already been signed with the official unions. On the eve of the strike the Director General of Karaganda Coal, Grigoriy Present, sent a cable to the mines, qualifying the action of protest as illegal. It will be regarded as absenteeism, he said. The official unions of mine workers did not support the strike either, viewing it as illegal and untimely.
