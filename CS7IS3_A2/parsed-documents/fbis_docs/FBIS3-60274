Congress has approved the law creating it. The law establishes incentives for those who replant forests and severe penalties for those who contribute toward contamination. High school graduates who are serving in the military may do so in environmental tasks. He who contaminates will pay. This is one of the main purposes of the Environmental Law, which will guard and conserve the country's natural resources from now on but with full collaboration from the community. [Begin Aduardo Uribe, National Department of Planning Environmental director, recording] The bill creates several ways for community participation. It allows the people who live along rivers and in forests to speak up and participate in the decisions that will affect their environment. [end recording] Each municipality will design its own environmental conservation plans. They will receive special support from the police, and the attorney general will delegate environmental matters. [Begin Uribe recording] There are taxes, fines, and penalties established for destroying our natural resources. There are penalties that can be applied and executed by the public forces, municipal and regional authorities, and the Environment Ministry. According to the law, these entities now have police functions. [end recording] The project takes off using a $25-million IDB loan followed by the government's contribution. A new aspect of the law is that 20 percent of young enlisted men will be allowed to serve in ecological tasks. There are also awards for those who restore the environment by planting all types of plants and introducing animal species. The government will absorb up to 75 percent of any restoration efforts.
