[Begin Cristiani recording] Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro, presidents of the state branches, deputies, magistrates, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, ambassadors and heads of diplomatic missions accredited in Nicaragua, cabinet members, members of Nicaraguan private enterprise, special guests, dear friends: I am very pleased to be here in Nicaragua honoring my dear friend President Chamorro's cordial invitation. I have been even more honored tonight because I was awarded the General Jose Dolores Estrada San Jacinto Battle Order. I receive this decoration in the name of the Salvadoran people, the true forgers of peace and democracy in our country. If I am to be given credit for something, it is to have interpreted the Salvadoran people's vehement desire to live in peace and freedom. During recent years, when I shared with Dona Violeta -- beyond protocol, I dare call her by that name out of affection -- so many Central American experiences, we have observed the close relationship between our peoples and their problems and solutions. History has provided deep common roots for the two peoples. It is from the tree of the present, so to speak, that we must pick the fruit of common destiny. El Salvador and Nicaragua are friendly countries for various reasons. Historical misfortunes have sometimes befallen us. The traditional lack of deeply rooted freedom has made us suffer untold trials and tribulations. From a certain date, what brings us closer together is the common effort to nurture democratic institutions on the arid land where authoritarianism and arbitrariness once throve. Our peoples are still suffering the consequences of many past mistakes, but in our respective peculiarities and difficulties, each of the two peoples agree on raising the banner of democracy.
