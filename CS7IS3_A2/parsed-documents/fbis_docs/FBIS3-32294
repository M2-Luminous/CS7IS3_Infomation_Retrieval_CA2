Guyana's foreign minister, Clement Rohee, moving the first motion on the charter, said it was, in his "humble opinion," non-controversial and should be welcomed in all Caricom member states. Rohee, however, faced criticism from the main opposition People's National Congress (PNC) and the small Working People's Alliance (WPA). PNC shadow foreign minister, lawyer Clarissa Riehl, noted that the Guyana cabinet had considered the draft charter at a sitting in August last year. He said the draft should have been circulated in high schools, universities and in other public fora. Riehl, who said the PNC supported the motion in principle, questioned whether any consultation on the charter had ever taken place and what form it would take in the future. "I would like to know why a copy of the charter was not laid in parliament itself at some date prior to today's date and even at a minimum, why a copy of this charter, as a common courtesy, was not appended to the motion paper," the former magistrate told parliament. "This administration, Mr. Speaker, appears to have the greatest difficulty in assimilating this term -- consultation. They banter the word around and they don't seem to understand the meaning of it." Riehl also asked about the structured programme to raise public awareness on the charter of civil society, suggesting the draft copy should have been "sent around" to become a talking point in the country. She added: "Mr. Speaker, one gets the distinct impression also that this government is only paying lip-service to West Indian togetherness because these things are treated with such disdain." Riehl also pointed out several similarities in the charter with principles enshrined in Guyana's Constitution, which she said were piloted by the PNC, including equality before the law, political rights and women's rights. She urged Rohee to get the "largest number of people" involved in the consultative process regarding the charter. WPA leader, economist Clive Thomas, said his party had long called for such a charter, but added it remained "disappointed" with the draft. "I think that the charter, in our age, must be a charter which moves from the declaration of principles, from the statement of intent to the activation of enforceable covenants and rights for people with due procedures and institutions and mechanisms for redress," Dr. Thomas remarked. He said the current charter is basically useless without any mechanisms for enforcement and any legal or other procedures to ensure it becomes an obligation for caricom states. "Without the entrenchment of the rights in this charter into the laws of the institutions and the procedures of this land and in the rest of the Caribbean, it will remain the piece of paper on which it is written," he told parliament. He questioned the point of having a charter talking about respecting the right to life which at the same time does not set up standards by which governments should be measured regarding children and maternal mortality and life expectancy. "What can be more fundamental to the right of life than being able to live? How can you have a charter of civil society that ignores any standards altogether of the determination of the social rights of people in this caribbean region?" he asked. "How can you speak about access to social services without defining precisely and in enforceable terms how people will get access to education, to health services, to sanitation and so forth that you can take to the court or some body for redress because the charter has the force of law?" Thomas also criticised the West Indian Commission-proposed charter for the "vaguest of vague" references to environmental concerns and ignoring Amerindian rights. "It doesn't even mention the word indigenous, almost as if it is completely abstracted from Guyana or even the part of the Caribbean where indigenous peoples still survive," Dr. Thomas declared. He said the draft should be nothing more than a starting point for debate. The charter, first proposed by the West Indian Commission, deals with a wide range of issues such as respect for fundamental civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, the rights of women and children, greater accountability and transparency in governance and a fair and open democratic process. Leader of The United Force (TUF), Manzoor Nadir, also said he supported the bill in principle. The Guyanese foreign minister defended the charter, saying the process has to start somewhere. He said it was not drafted by the Guyana Government, but was a regional document with inputs from all the countries. "We have to start the process somewhere," Rohee said. "The process of consultation will be spread throughout the length and breadth of Guyana as far our possibilities allow." Debate, he added, will begin after the motion has been passed in parliament. Rohee also denied the Guyana Government has gone to sleep on a proposal put forward by Trinidad and Tobago's prime minister, Patrick Manning, calling for an economic and political union involving Barbados, Guyana and Trinidad. "The Manning initiative has been overtaken by the proposal that was raised by the honourable prime minister of Barbados (Erskine Sandiford) who called for a confederation of Guyana, Trinidad and Barbados after or during the course of the heads of government meeting in the Bahamas (in 1993)," Rohee said. Sandiford, Rohee added, has promised to circulate his thoughts on the confederation. "It is in the light of that development, Mr. Speaker, that the Manning initiative lost its momentum and was overtaken by the proposal advanced by the distinguished prime minister of Barbados."
