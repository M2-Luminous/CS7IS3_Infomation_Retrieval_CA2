"It appears that the pressure brought to bear by NATO and the U.N. is working, that the ceasefire is holding, the withdrawal is continuing," Clinton said. "I do want to say it's now clearly time to get the diplomatic initiative going again while we maintain our vigilance," he said. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is in London for talks with British and French officials on the Bosnian situation. On Tuesday [26 April], Christopher will be meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before going to the Middle East. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has proposed that Russia, the U.S., Europe and the U.N. convene a summit on Bosnia, but Clinton said the idea was premature although "deserves serious consideration." "The United States won't be ready to move on a summit until we have a better idea what the Serbs are up to," the ASSOCIATED PRESS quoted an unnamed administration official as saying.
