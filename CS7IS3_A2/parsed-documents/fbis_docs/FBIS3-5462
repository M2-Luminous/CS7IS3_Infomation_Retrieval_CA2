"We are terribly concerned about the kind of conditions which North Koreans are subject to," Han said in a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents Club here. Some 150 to 200 North Korean loggers in Siberia hope to either come to Seoul or stay in Russia, the foreign minister said, but "there are legal complications" in trying to bring them to South Korea. One of the problems is many of the loggers' unclear status in Russia, as they lack passports or some form of identification. Seoul officials say that before they can be flown to South Korea, the Russian Government must determine their identity, define their status and allow their departure. But Seoul is looking for a solution, he said, that "we will consider favorably." Meanwhile, he defended South Korea's national security law, saying it had been revised through "a unanimous, democratic" process. "We have an adequate mechanism to protect the human rights of each individual," Han told the foreign journalists, responding to claims from abroad that the law is subject to abuse. With another inter-Korean contact just a day away, Han reiterated that meaningful dialogue between the two is a prerequisite to North Korea-U.S. high-level talks. Seoul is looking not to isolate but to bring North Korea into the international fold, said Han, so that Pyongyang can adapt to the post-cold war world order. The foreign minister criticized the recent U.S. decision to revive the Super 301 trade provision, calling it "unfortunate." Seoul hopes that Washington will tread cautiously so that bilateral trade relations are not harmed in the process of applying the revived law.
