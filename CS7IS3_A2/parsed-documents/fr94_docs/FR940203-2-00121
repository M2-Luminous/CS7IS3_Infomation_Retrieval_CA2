FR940203-2-00121 FR940203-2-00068 Discussion: The Federal role that is delineated in the ``Background'' section of the October 14, 1993 notice is a broad characterization of the Federal role envisioned by the Secretaries. The ``Background'' section is not meant to delineate each of the ways in which the Federal Government might assist States or localities to implement school-to-work systems. Counseling and integrating existing Federal, State, and local programs into comprehensive School-to-Work Opportunities systems is clearly of vital importance to the national School-to-Work Opportunities framework and are embodied in the criteria in this notice as well as in the pending legislation. Although it is not the Secretaries' intent to recount all possible Federal roles here, the Secretaries have added reference to a fourth Federal role, that of creating a national School-to-Work Opportunities framework through common core criteria and national standards. The Secretaries believe that the Federal role referred to by the commenter is implicit in this notice. Changes: Reference to an additional Federal role, that of creating a national School-to-Work Opportunities framework, has been added to ``Background'' section of this notice. Comment: One commenter thought that the final priority should give preference to, and thereby require applications to identify a significant portion of the funds available for local systems for use in high poverty areas. Discussion: The competition covered by this notice is for State grants only. From grants received under this competition, grantees will distribute a substantial amount of funds to localities, including high poverty areas. Each State must demonstrate in its plan how it will ensure opportunities for ``all students'' to participate in the program. In addition, each State will be required to describe how its School-to-Work Opportunities system will be expanded to cover all geographic areas, including high poverty areas. The Departments will soon announce a separate direct grant program for local projects located in high poverty areas. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter believed that it was unclear from the notice whether there are clear vehicles for the Federal Government to help States and localities learn from each other and from the experience of international competitors, and to build a knowledge base of effective school-to-work models. Therefore, the commenter suggested that the notice be modified to include a separate grant program or a contract to support the Federal Government in achieving these roles. Discussion: This notice relates only to the School-to-Work Opportunities State grants competition. However, other funds will be available under the fiscal year 1994 appropriation for Federal level activities, such as technical assistance and research and development, that will help States and localities learn from each other and from the experiences of our international competitors, and that will help States build a knowledge base of effective school-to-work models. The Secretaries do not envision one separate grant or contract for achieving these purposes, but plan to utilize the broad range of vehicles available to them. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter noted that very little institutional structure is available in the United States that could manage the partnerships anticipated, and suggested awarding a separate seed grant to a local body not politically tied to any one of the stakeholders for this purpose. Discussion: The Secretaries believe that States and local communities can best determine how to form and govern the partnerships required under this program. A local partnership can determine for itself which entity in that community is best equipped to manage the partnership. Thus, the Secretaries see no need for the separate direct Federal grants recommended by the commenter. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter noted that certificates and credentials in the United States are linked to limited, very defined jobs, such as ``radiology,'' and not to sets of skills that integrate knowledge across an industry. The commenter suggested that the States will need to overhaul their current approach to certification and credentialing if this definition is to be realized. Discussion: It is the Secretaries' intent that States design School-to-Work Opportunities programs of high quality that will prepare students to become part of a high-performance workforce and that will lead to skill certificates as one of the outcomes of participation. Until there is a system of national skill standards, States are encouraged to apply the highest standards and certifications available. During this period, the Departments will be assisting States in identifying sources and means by which to access existing high quality, industry-recognized standards and accompanying assessment tools, as well as assisting States to collaborate effectively with each other toward the development of high quality skill standards. Once the National Skill Standards Board begins its work, and even before there are skill standards actually endorsed by the Board, States will be required to take the work of the Board into consideration in their development of standards for skill certificates, as is likely to be required under the proposed School-to-Work Opportunities legislation. This is intended to facilitate the development of national, portable credentials and to avoid unnecessary duplication and overlap.
