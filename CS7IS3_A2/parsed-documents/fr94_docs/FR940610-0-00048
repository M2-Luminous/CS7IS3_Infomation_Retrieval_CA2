FR940610-0-00048 FR940610-0-00023 Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 700, announced a method for determining the deemed yearly rate of return for new pooled income funds. This method defined the deemed rate as the highest annual average section 7520 interest rate for the preceding three years, reduced by one percentage point. The proposed regulations would have defined the deemed rate as the highest annual average section 7520 interest rate for the preceding three years, multiplied by 90 percent. Both methods produced the same result for each of the years after the enactment of section 7520: ␣ 1First year of pooled income fund 15/1/89 to 12/31/89 11990 11991 11992 11993 11994 Notice 89&hyph;60 method 9.4 9.8 9.8 9.8 9.4 8.4 Proposed regulation method 9.4 9.8 9.8 9.8 9.4 8.4 Commentators have indicated a strong preference for the method announced in Notice 89&hyph;60, because they view the computation as simpler than that set forth in the proposed regulations. In response to these comments, the final regulations adopt the method described in Notice 89&hyph;60 for determining the deemed yearly rate of return for new pooled income funds. Comments were received concerning whether, in valuing transfers to a new pooled income fund, the same deemed rate of return would be used throughout the entire three-year period. The final regulations provide that the deemed rate of return for transfers to a new pooled income fund is recomputed each calendar year using the monthly section 7520 rates for the three-year period immediately preceding the calendar year in which each transfer to the fund is made until the fund has been in existence for three taxable years and can compute its highest rate of return for the three taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the transfer of property to the fund is made. A commentator suggested that, with respect to the interpolation method for valuing transfers to pooled income funds and charitable remainder unitrusts, a taxpayer be permitted to elect a more exact method of computing the appropriate interest rate. The method prescribed in the proposed regulations has been in use for many years and is prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in Publication 1457, ``Actuarial Values, Alpha Volume,'' (8&hyph;89) and Internal Revenue Service Publication 1458, ``Actuarial Values, Beta Volume,'' (8&hyph;89). The IRS and Treasury believe that any change from the method prescribed in these publications, which are in current use, would create undue confusion for taxpayers. Consequently, the commentator's suggested change is not being adopted at this time. Comments were received inquiring about the application of section 7520 to the valuation of annuities issued by certain organizations other than insurance companies. In response to these comments, the final regulations explain that the section 7520 tables are to be used in valuing these annuities. This is an application of the principle adopted in Rev. Rul. 84&hyph;162, 1984&hyph;2 C.B. 200, for transfers after November 23, 1984. A different method of valuation continues to apply for purposes of computing the exclusion ratio in reporting the annuity payments under section 72. These clarifications have been made by updating §1.101&hyph;2(e)(1)(iii)( b ) and Example 8 of §1.1011&hyph;2(c). Comments were received concerning the presumption in the proposed regulations under section 664 that, if a governing instrument for a charitable remainder unitrust does not prescribe when the distribution is made during the period, the distribution is presumed to be made on the first day of the period. Unitrusts have traditionally been regarded as providing for distributions at the beginning of each period unless the governing instrument provides to the contrary. This presumption has been reflected in unitrust factors prescribed in the regulations under section 664 since the enactment of that section. Therefore, the presumption that distributions are made on the first day of the period, if not otherwise provided for in the instrument, is continued in the final regulations.
