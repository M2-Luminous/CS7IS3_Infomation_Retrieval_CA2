Sanchez added that the union members pointed out that their demands are fair and necessary in light of the Guatemalan economy's inflation rate. Workers noted that in the past weeks, the prices of basic necessities have experienced a significant increase to the detriment of family finances. Price increases for basic necessities combined with the increase in rural transportation fares and fuel have affected the poorest families. With the increased prices for widely used products, in addition to higher interurban transportation rates and fuel prices, the hardest hit are Guatemalan families who do not have and are unable to obtain the necessary funds to survive. The government employees march began at 1000 and covered the main streets and avenues of Guatemala City. The demonstrators carried banners and posters with antigovernment slogans. Standing across from the National Palace, the state employees chanted: "Ramiro you are submissive, you grabbed a rifle; Ramiro you are submissive, you grabbed a rifle," and they subsequently took up positions at the building's main entrance. The guards closed the doors to prevent any incidents. The demonstrators eventually withdrew voluntarily but gave assurances that their activities and demonstrations will continue until De Leon Carpio meets the state employees' demands.
