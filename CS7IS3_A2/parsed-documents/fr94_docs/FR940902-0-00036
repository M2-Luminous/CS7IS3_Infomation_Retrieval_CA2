FR940902-0-00036 FR940902-0-00010 Section 627.240 of the interim final regulations sets out requirements pertaining to the on-the-job training (OJT) activity authorized at sections 204(b), 253(a), 314(d) and in title IV of the Act. The interim final regulations dealt with a few broad areas related to OJT, such as the duration of OJT, OJT payments, contracts for OJT, employer and participant eligibility, as well as a definition of OJT. Many of the commenters observed that the requirements for OJT have become so burdensome as to make OJT no longer a viable JTPA training option. The 1992 Amendments made a number of changes in the requirements for OJT programs which are implemented in these regulations. These changes were aimed at eliminating perceived abuses in OJT programs. While it is true that these new requirements do limit some flexibility in operating OJT programs, the Department does not agree that the new requirements in any way make OJT a less desirable or feasible training option. Indeed, the Department believes that OJT is an important training vehicle for the JTPA program. As demonstrated by The National JTPA Study (December 1994) , OJT provided ``the most consistent positive program impacts on the earnings of adults *␣*␣*. Both women and men in this subgroup enjoyed large positive earnings gains that were statistically significant and sustained throughout the 30-month follow-up period.'' The Department believes that entities which deliver OJT will find that these final regulations set forth only those requirements which are necessary to preserve the integrity of the OJT activity and to ensure that it remains an effective training tool. With regard to the definition of OJT in paragraph (a), it is essential to recognize that by using OJT, the JTPA system is purchasing occupational training needed by a participant_often training not elsewhere available, which is provided through employment that will usually continue with the employer after the training is completed. (Note the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of the final rule regarding placement of OJT participants with other employers). The objective of OJT is not, as suggested by some commenters, to subsidize wages or to reduce an employer's wage costs, but to purchase training and to provide an opportunity for JTPA participants that they might not otherwise have. The contents of paragraph (a) are reorganized into three subordinate paragraphs for better clarity. Language is added in a new paragraph (a)(1) to clarify the definition of OJT by: (1) Making reference to the ISS as part of the process for determining whether an individual should be offered OJT, (2) making specific reference to the OJT agreement, and (3) making specific reference to the principle that the purpose of the OJT arrangement is to purchase training in exchange for reimbursement of the employer's extraordinary costs. By far the most prevalent comment on the interim final rule was that the Department needed to clarify the provisions relating to the limitations on the duration of OJT which were contained in paragraph (b) of the interim final rule. The final rule clarifies the durational rules for OJT. The basic rule is that OJT is to be for the length of time normally needed for training to acquire the skills needed to perform the occupation up to a 6-month length of training. OJT may not exceed that 6 month maximum training period except in cases in which the training is less than full time and the training period will exceed 6 calendar months. In that case, OJT may not exceed 500 hours. To more clearly convey these rules, paragraph (b)(1) is broken into four subordinate paragraphs. Paragraph (b) is also reordered for greater clarity. Six months of training is defined as the amount of time an employee would work on a regular or full-time basis in the occupation for which the OJT contract is written in a 6 month period. If the training period is shorter, the training time is still considered to be the amount of time an employee would work on a regular or full-time basis for that period. Commenters observed that OJT contracts were usually written in terms of hours and wondered how this related to the 6-month limitation. The Department wishes to promote local discretion in developing OJT contracts; therefore, the regulations do not prescribe a particular time category by which SDA's designate the 6-month period, so long as the designation is consistent with the purpose of the statutory limitation. For example, the 6-month training period may be expressed in the number of hours (usually not more than 1,040 working hours), days (180 days), or weeks (26 weeks in 6 months) that an individual would work full-time in a 6-month period. Contracts for OJT which are expressed in any of these ways will be acceptable. In simplest terms, an OJT employee who enters employment on May 1 and works continuously on a full-time basis on the OJT occupation would complete 6 months of training on October 31. Whatever time category the SDA chooses to use to designate the duration of the OJT contract, it should treat any adjustments (such as those provided for in the discussion below) in the same terms, so if there is an adjustment for illness to a contract written in working hours, the adjustment will be made in working hours, not weeks or days. If the OJT period is interrupted for a full day or more by events beyond the OJT trainee's or the employer's control, such as holidays, illness, plant downtime, or strike, such time may be added to the original period. Thus, using the time period of the above example, if an OJT participant is in OJT to learn a machine operation but is ill for 10 working days (approximately 80 working hours, two working weeks, or one-half of a working month) the OJT period may end approximately November 11 through November 15 (instead of October 31) depending on how duration is designated in the contract. (The employer would not be reimbursed for the period in which the participant is not in the OJT occupation.) The objective of this rule is to assure that the participant receives the full period of training (up to 6 months) in the occupation for which the OJT contract is written. This rule, of course, applies only to time that a participant was scheduled to spend in the actual OJT activity. It does not apply to any of the participant's other activities, either in training or outside of their OJT employment.
