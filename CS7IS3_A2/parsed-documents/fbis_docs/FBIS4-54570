The government returned the bill for alterations. If it passed the bill in its current form, there would be the threat of a slowdown of the privatization process and the formation of an obstacle to enterprise. The government discussed and approved several proposals for intergovernment agreements and documents, among them the draft Agreement Between the Government of the Slovak Republic and the Government of the Croatian Republic on the Extradition and Admission of Citizens. It also approved the National Council of the Slovak Republic's bill on customs. At a news conference during the government session, Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Simko said that the customs law deals in a completely new way with the organization of the customs administration and its status with respect to other bodies, duties, powers, and resources of the customs officer, the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons toward customs officers. He emphasized that the law gives greater powers to customs officers and even enables them to use some restrictive measures. The government approved its work schedule and its plan of legislative work until 30 September 1994. It agreed to the schedule of carrying out work ensuing from the report on the state of the Department of Agriculture and the economic conditions for the implementation of the intentions for this year. It also approved a directive on one-time extraordinary compensation of between 10,000 and 50,000 Slovak korunas for an injury or death in the course of working for the civilian defense. It approved an amendment to the National Council of the Slovak Republic Law No. 83/1991 on the work of Slovak Republic bodies in the implementation of the employment policy according to earlier regulations. The bill submitted makes payments from the Slovak Employment Fund for financing work beneficial to the public also available to state budget and subsidized organizations, which the National Council of the Slovak Republic Law No. 325/1993 ruled out. The proposed amendment does not affect the state budget. The government disagreed with a deputy's draft extensively amending the National Council of the Slovak Republic Law No. 325/1993 on the state budget of the Slovak Republic for 1994 and changes to other laws. The government acknowledged the report on guaranteeing the offer of property in the second wave of coupon privatization. It contains, among other things, the criteria for the selection of enterprises offering property in the coupon privatization, a proposal of the schedule for the preparation of the offer, and the implementation of the actual process of distribution of the shares. "The relevant minister will prepare by 20 May 1994, in cooperation with the founding ministries, a list of the enterprises included in the coupon privatization. The volume will thus be determined with added precision of property included in the second wave of coupon privatization," Minister Milan Janicina said at a news conference. The government also acknowledged informative documentation on the preparation for the introduction of a compulsory certification of farm and food products in the Slovak Republic beginning on 1 May 1994. As Minister Peter Magvasi stated, because four conditions were not satisfied for calling off the 1 May date, exporters of food products will have to present a certificate from the country to which they are exporting. According to the agreement in effect, the government can no longer change the date of compulsory certification of farm and food products in the Slovak Republic because it is given by approval in the National Council of the Slovak Republic. The government authorized Minister Magvasi to discuss the issue with his Czech counterpart, Dlouhy.
