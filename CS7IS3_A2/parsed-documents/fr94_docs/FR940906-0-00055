FR940906-0-00055 FR940906-0-00019 Response. Early in the development of the fee collection program for the Research Plan, the Council recommended the use of actual exvessel prices and values for processors that purchase fish from fishermen and the use of standard exvessel prices for integrated harvesting and processing operations that do not purchase fish. This recommendation adjusted prices to reflect the actual prices for the former class of processors and post-season price settlements. By 1992, the Council had identified problems with this recommendation and voted to recommend the use of standard exvessel prices for all processors. The problems included the following: (1) The incentive of fishermen and processors to understate actual exvessel prices, (2) the difficulty of verifying that the reported prices were correct, (3) the difficulties of applying post-season adjustments in exvessel prices to the standard exvessel prices used for processors that catch their own fish, and (4) the lack of timely price information from fish tickets. The Council recognized that actual inseason exvessel price data may provide a more equitable basis for fee assessments among processors who purchase fish. However, the Council determined that the potential for more equitable fee assessments was not sufficient to overcome the problems associated with using actual prices. The Council has recommended that NMFS establish standard prices for 6-month periods. This recommendation should increase the ability of NMFS and the Council to set standard prices that will closely approximate actual prices. This process will be facilitated if the exvessel price information from fish tickets becomes available in a more timely manner. Fee revenue and actual fee liability would be more uncertain if they were based on inseason price or payment adjustments. If prices increase, processors could have difficulty collecting the additional fees from fishermen, and if prices decrease, processors may not make the appropriate refunds to fishermen. Over time, the unexpected increases and decreases in exvessel prices are expected to cancel out. Under the final rule, the standard exvessel prices will be based on: (1) Exvessel price information during the most recent 12-month period for which data are available for different seasons, gear types, management areas, and processing sectors; (2) factors that are expected to change exvessel prices in the upcoming calendar year; and (3) other information that indicates what exvessel prices would be expected to be in the upcoming calendar year. Therefore, to the extent practicable, price forecasts will be used. Comment 27. When differences in prices by gear, area, mode of operation, and season are real and significant, separate standard prices should be established for each. Response. NMFS agrees and intends to propose exvessel prices that reasonably accommodate price differences by season, gear, area, and processing sector (inshore and offshore components) (see the response to Comment 26). However, even when real and substantial differences exist in exvessel prices by gear, area, mode of operation, and season, there are justifications for not establishing a separate standard price for each. To the extent that exvessel prices differ due to differences in the services a fishing vessel provides in addition to harvesting raw fish, it may be inappropriate to establish separate standard prices. Comment 28. It is unfair not to account for differences in prices due to stage of product processing and mode of operation. Response. As noted in the response to Comment 27, NMFS believes it may be inappropriate to charge different fees per pound of retained catch for different fishermen due to differences in the distribution of services between fishermen and processors or to assess a higher fee per pound for a group of fishermen that perform services that are typically performed by processors. Comment 29. Prices should be imputed by area when the size of fish differ by area and product prices differ by the size of fish. Response. The cost of accommodating this suggestion could be justified if large differences exist in product prices by area of catch. The annual processor survey conducted by the State of Alaska does not collect price data for narrowly defined areas. As a result, NMFS would have to use other sources of product price data that would tend to increase information and analytical costs and, perhaps, decrease the quality of the price estimates. In the future, NMFS may consider rulemaking to collect additional price information if existing sources of data are deemed insufficient. Comment 30. The method used by NMFS to impute exvessel prices is acceptable, but the product prices and product price to exvessel price conversion factor should be reviewed, a conversion factor of 20-percent should be used, and an industry committee of those familiar with these species should be part of the review process. Response. The Research Plan specification process set out in the final rule at ยง677.11 includes review of the imputed standard exvessel prices by the OOC, AP, Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC), the public, and the Council before the standard exvessel prices are proposed. The proposed standard exvessel prices will be published in the Federal Register annually, and the data on which they are based will be included in a report available from the Council. Public comments will be requested on both the proposed standard exvessel prices and the data on which they are based. The final standard exvessel prices will be established after further review by the OOC, AP, SSC, and the Council. Therefore, the process for establishing standard exvessel prices allows for as much input and review as the industry is willing to provide. The industry is free to establish a committee to assist in establishing standard exvessel prices.
