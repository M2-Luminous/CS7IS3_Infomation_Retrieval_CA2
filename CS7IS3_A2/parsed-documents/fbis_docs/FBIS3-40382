Would you say that it will help you maintain employment at equipment manufacturers? [Halna du Fretay] As you just said, the 1994 budget shows a slight upturn. Unfortunately, it comes after several years when it was reduced in current francs. It is a good sign; it shows that the government is aware that the situation of our industry had become tragically inadequate. For all that, this budget will not enable us to solve all employment problems. Our current activity also depends on previous years' budget commitments. Our feeling is that the year 1994 will be still more difficult than last year. There will be still more layoffs, more employment adjustment plans, and probably more companies filing for bankruptcy. I would like to add that the difficulties raised against our prime contractors concerning the implementation of employment adjustment plans constitute an incentive for them to take back some activities and subcontracting. In other words, you prevent layoffs in one place and you create them in another. All we can say is that things will not get as much worse in 1994, with a defense equipment budget of 130 billion francs [Fr], as would have been the case if the budget had remained at Fr97 billion like last year. [Dupont] Each new program increases self-financing by manufacturers, in particular equipment manufacturers. Do you feel that you are in a position to make the effort required? [Halna du Fretay] For many French equipment manufacturers, the need to provide additional co-financing while sales and series production are decreasing and margins getting smaller forces them to operate in the red or on the verge of it. For the NH-90 program, the financing required of equipment manufacturers represents 40 to 100 percent of design and engineering costs. All equipment manufacturers are eager to compete for this program, especially because there are not that many new programs. But some will be unable to keep up with the self-financing levels currently considered. In addition, with NH-90 we have the quite abnormal situation of a military program which may or may not go on to series production. On the other hand, the U.S. government pays for 100 percent of military research and development! [Dupont] With declining deliveries of new aircraft, fleets throughout the world are aging. What are French equipment manufacturers doing to seize the opportunities that may arise in customer service and modernization? [Halna du Fretay] We can say today that French equipment manufacturers have reached the level of their U.S. competitors as far as customer service quality is concerned. Besides, since the beginning of this decade, the Airbus inventory represents a significant part of the world fleet, which now provides us with a solid base for customer service. As far as spare parts for older aircraft are concerned, our competitors are the "brokers" and we must be at least as good as they are; which means that we must offer airlines close-by servicing facilities, just as they do. For new-generation aircraft, we must increasingly be able to offer overall service in the form of maintenance agreements based on flight-time, the goal being to free airlines from the burden of maintaining spare parts inventories. The same trend can also be observed on export military markets, where equipment manufacturers are increasingly required to provide these services. That is an additional effort that we must make. In another respect, fleet aging does create an emerging market among airlines, to improve the operational capacities, in particular landing, and the operating costs of their older aircraft. As for the modernization of military aircraft, the French are already quite well represented on these markets. But this will never amount to much and it will not replace domestic original-equipment markets. [Dupont] The crisis in the aircraft manufacturing industry hit equipment manufacturers before it hit prime contractors. Will the recovery also be felt first at equipment manufacturers? [Halna du Fretay] The crisis hit equipment manufacturers before prime contractors because spare part markets collapsed and original-equipment inventories were reduced, or because prime contractors took back some activities. It is very difficult to make a forecast as to the recovery of spare parts markets. But if prime contractors have actually depleted their intermediate product inventories, then I agree that recovery might be stronger for us and pose rather difficult problems. In some cases, we may even find that suppliers cannot cope because they have reduced their activities so much that it will take them a very long time to bring back their capacities to pre-crisis levels.
