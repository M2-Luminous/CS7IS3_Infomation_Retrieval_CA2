PT [Workers Party] candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva still is the favorite, even though he lost 3 percentage points: He fell from 30 to 27 percent of the votes. PPR [Progressive Renewal Party candidate] Paulo Maluf remains in second place with 17 percent of the electoral preference. After this poll, the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] will press Fernando Henrique Cardoso even more to leave his post by the end of the month in order to run for Itamar Franco's job. Meanwhile, the PSDB says the decision remains with the minister himself. Senator Mario Covas said: "Fernando will entirely let events take their course. He is a man with public spirit. Thus, he will decide if he stays or leaves. He is not a vulgar opportunist." President Itamar Franco's advisers already are acquainted with the poll. During the past few days, Franco has discussed this issue with politicians and has begun to consider a replacement. The PSDB is very interested in this issue because the economic program's success depends on Cardoso's management.
