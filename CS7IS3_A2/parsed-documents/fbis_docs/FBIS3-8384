RDP Group Director General Jan Vlcek asked Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy to make the political decision whether his company may enter the Iranian market. Minister Dlouhy, according to his spokesman Kamil Cermak, is awaiting, however, the stance of Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and Defense Minister Antonin Baudys. A source from diplomatic circles, who does not wish to be identified, told MLADA FRONTA DNES yesterday that the Foreign Ministry intends to honor international obligations and, on principle, not export arms to high-risk regions. Although Iran is not among the countries to which the sale of arms is banned, many countries consider Iran a very high-risk region. "After all, the situation in Iran is not calm and clear. It is in the interest of the Czech Republic not to support armament in this region," the diplomat added. "The RDP Group does not want to export tanks to Iran; it has never even considered it. The consortium discussed the possibility of supplying repairs technology for these tanks," RDP Group press spokesman Jiri Vich specified. The planned deal with Iran should revive some stagnating enterprises. The expected financial volume of this order, which should be filled over five years, allegedly amounts to $0.5 billion. The RDP Group even founded its own bank, TOPFIN. By means of this consortium of small and medium-sized banks, the arms-manufacturing company should finance its production and business transactions.
