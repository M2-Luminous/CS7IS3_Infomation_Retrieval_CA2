[Hata] Since Prime Minister Hata was still in his post as foreign minister, he has tried to make contacts with the United States by taking advantage of various opportunities and making full use of his personal connections. From now on, it will be necessary for all the cabinet members to make use of all connections. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What will be the measures to deal with numerical targets that the United States has demanded? [Hata] While insisting on the basic stand on never accepting this demand, we will continue to make efforts to seek consensus through positive talks. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you have any apprenhensions about the fact that the cabinet is now a minority-ruled administration? [Hata] In actuality, there is no denying that the minority ruling coalition lacks strength. However, even opposition parties cannot ignore public opinion. Therefore, it is necessary for us to persist in promoting policies that can win public support. One of the major tasks lies in creating conditions so that the Social Democratic Party of Japan can be asked to rejoin the coalition. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] It has been pointed out that one characteristic of the Japanese economy is "dango [bid-rigging]." What do you think of it? [Hata] I understand that the point at issue lies in the fact that some deviation is inevitable when an economic act that has long been practiced in Japan is viewed from the standpoint of foreign nations. In promoting economic reform or working out deregulation, we will have to make dynamic efforts to create a free and unfettered economic environment. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of criticism against bureaucrats? [Hata] To put it in another way, they may speak for Japanese bureaucrats' excellent capabilities because they possess not only professional knowledge but also strong administrative ability. In conducting political affairs, we must base our position on a broad standpoint sometimes and view things from an extensive viewpoint at other times. And what is important is that concerted actions are taken [by politicians and bureaucrats]. Nevertheless, it is essential for politicians to take up full responsibilities.
