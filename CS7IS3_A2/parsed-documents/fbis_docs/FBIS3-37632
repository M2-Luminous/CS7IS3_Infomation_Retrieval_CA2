Speaking at a news conference devoted to the results of his visit to the U.S. in Almaty on Monday, Nazarbayev said that "an agreement has been reached to take additional practical steps to boost them (relations) in many spheres." The signing of the charter of democratic partnership between Kazakhstan and America ushers in a new era of cooperation between the two states in order to ensure peace and stability in the Central-Asian region, he said. The Kazakh leader stressed that "not a single step has been taken in the new Kazakh-American agreement in violation of previously adopted accords with CIS countries." However, he noted that some recent publications distort his statements. He pledged to "work for the integration of the CIS." "Russia has always been and remains the top priority partner of Kazakhstan. The republic is destined to go along with it towards economic and social prosperity," Nazarbayev said. He said that owing to cooperation with Russia Kazakhstan plans to extract 50-60 million tonnes of oil annually. The pipeline passing trough Europe can handle only 17 million. "We are now studying the possibility of building a new pipeline to the south, to the Persian Gulf, next century," the president added. He said that the memorandum of defence and military relations with the U.S. is "identical to that signed with Russia six months earlier. The same can be said about the plans concerning the use of the Baykonur space center only in cooperation with Russia, on the basis of previously adopted documents."
