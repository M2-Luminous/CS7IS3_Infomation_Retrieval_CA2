In addition, 57 were booked without physical detention and nine others underwent interrogation to determine whether they should be arrested or booked, a police spokesman said. But the prosecution announced different figures -- 99 students arrested, 61 booked without physical detention and 62 under interrogation. The number of arrested students is expected to rise sharply as the police, estimating those involved in the forced train stoppage at 500 to 550, have decided to arrest all of them. Of the 109 arrested students, all but two belong to Namchongnyon, the spokesman said. He added that in the future Namchongnyon-led demonstrations would not be be permitted unless peace was guaranteed, as the violent protests over the weekend were led by the organization. In a related development, the police are interrogating 270 farmers and students about their roles in demonstrations opposing National Assembly ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement in Yoido and Yongdungpo Monday. Those found to have resorted to violence, such as wielding steel pipes against train workers to occupy railways, during the demonstrations will be arrested, he said.
