At Minister Hirsch Ballin's proposal, the cabinet agreed to lengthen the current supervision arrangement to 1 September of this year. The decision gives the new Pourier government of the Netherlands Antilles, sworn in on 31 March, the time to set up a new administrative structure for the island. The reason the government was put under supervision was the financial and administrative mismanagement suffered over the past few years under the leadership of local leader C. Wathey. Wathey is the suspect in a criminal investigation into fraud worth millions surrounding the enlargement of the airport and harbor on the island.
