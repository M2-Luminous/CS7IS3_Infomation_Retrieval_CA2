Ulucevik arrived in the island today to be briefed by Turkish Cypriot officials with regard to the latest phase of the talks concerning the confidence-building measures package. In a statement to a TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency] correspondent at Ercan [Tymbou] State Airport, Ulucevik said that, on the basis of the conviction that the package will facilitate a comprehensive solution, Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus will not in principle change their attitude unless the package is amended. Ulucevik is accompanied by Ertugrul Apakan, Turkish Foreign Ministry's deputy director for Greek and Cypriot affairs. Ulucevik and Apakan will remain in north Cyprus for two days.
