The report indicated that oil production exceeded forecasts by 12 percent; that is, crude oil production reached more than 300,000 tons. Now, eyes are turning toward the country's main industry, namely the sugar industry, which was surrounded by a high-pitched campaign to exceed last year's output, which is comparable to the output of 1944, when sugar was sold at two and one-half cents per pound. Last year, the revolutionary government set out to significantly increase sugar production, which was already set at more than 6 million tons annually. Sugar production amounted to 4.2 million tons in 1993. The country expects to produce at least 100,000 to 200,000 tons more this year, which is a very difficult task because of the very adverse condition of the industry, which has been affected by an acute lack of fertilizers, transportation, fuels, and herbicides -- usually sprayed in a short period of time thanks to agricultural aviation. The tasks so far accomplished in the industry, due to the overwhelming support of its workers and reserves, were truly heroic, especially when we take into consideration that mechanical sugar harvesters were affected by the aforementioned situation. The legendary brigades of sugarcane cutters [macheteros], who filled Cuban fields with routine deeds as though they were a true fighting army, are currently fused to the ground, fighting, machete in hand, with the same patriotic fervor displayed by our founding fathers last century. The Cuban people and government are relying on these men, because they inspired admiration in many previous harvest seasons. We are also relying on the men of the sugar industry, those who operate and maintain sugar mill equipment and those who work in the laboratories and offices, who are also doing the best they can. This harvest battle has the connotation of a memorable campaign within the great epic that the Cuban people are staging at the most decisive time of their beautiful history. In its determination to accomplish production goals and to surpass them as much as possible, the Cuban Sugar Industry Ministry announced that the harvest season will last a little bit longer this year; it will be extended until late May. In addition, some sugar mills will continue to operate until June at the latest. After that date, sugarcane production plummets so much that it is a mistake to sacrifice sugar fields that can continue to yield crops to ensure that they will yield more next year. The preparatory tasks for the next sugarcane harvest started earlier this year. We can guarantee that in 1995 production in this vital Cuban industry will continue to increase.
