According to Boris Vostry, company vice president for foreign operations, Kozeny can directly influence events in the company without having to change the members in its supreme bodies and without being a member of the board. Even after his resignation from the board, Kozeny remained in the five-member executive committee, which operatively controls Harvard Capital and Consulting. "Harvard is Kozeny's family business, and speculations about his position are therefore irrelevant," Vostry said. The fact that Viktor Kozeny resigned from the Harvard Capital and Consulting board has changed nothing regarding his position of majority owner of the firm, Vostry added. Officially, it is impossible to precisely verify the property situation in Harvard funds because their shares are not tradable, and this information is protected by law. According to a source from another privatization fund, who did not want his name to be revealed because he wanted to avoid possible problems, Kozeny owns the majority of the shares, and another part (of the company) is controlled by his grandfather, Frantisek Stehlik. Kozeny, he affirms, has resigned from the board for health reasons. Ivan Kralik, a former employee of the Presidential Office of Husak [Czechoslovak president under the communist regime] and a member of the company's board, has been entrusted with chairing the board. Kralik also worked at the Castle for a certain time after Havel assumed office.
