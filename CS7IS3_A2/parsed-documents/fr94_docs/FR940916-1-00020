FR940916-1-00020 FR940916-1-00006 Indiana is proposing to delete subsection 145(c) which was approved by OSM on August 2, 1994 (58 FR 41039). Deleted subsection 145(c) contains the following language: ``Soil reconstruction shall be carried out in accordance with the specifications of the Soil Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture establishing prime farmland soil reconstruction specifications for Indiana.'' In its submittal of this amendment Indiana stated that the language quoted above was omitted because of ongoing litigation concerning the language of subsection 145(c). The litigation to which Indiana referred in its submittal of # 94&hyph;3 is Indiana Coal Council, Inc. vs. Babbitt , No. IP93&hyph;1328&hyph;C (S.D. Ind. filed October 1, 1993). III. Public Comment Procedures In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Indiana program. Written Comments Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under DATES or at locations other than the Indianapolis Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the Administrative Record. Public Hearing Persons wishing to speak at the public hearing should contact the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT by 4:00 p.m., E.S.T. on October 3, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held. Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate questions.
