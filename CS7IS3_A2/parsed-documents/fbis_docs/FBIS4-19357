The development plan covers some 10 subprojects concerning traffic, environment, and trade with areas to the east. Sponsoring the program and the coastal project regarding the Gulf of Finland are such private groups as the regional associations of the Kymi River Valley, eastern Uusimaa, and Uusimaa, as well as the individual municipalities along the coast. Among other things, it is proposed that Europe Highway Route 18 [E18] be improved, and that the train between Helsinki and St. Petersburg be able to transit the stretch in two and a half hours. The sponsoring groups also want to improve know-how on trade with Russia and Russian business culture, as well as to increase teaching of the Russian language at all levels of education. "The coastal project has been under way for two years, and the purpose has been to introduce cooperation in order to develop business, improve the environment, and promote regional culture in the area." This was said by Tapio Valinoro, director of a landscape company and chairman of the Kymi River Valley Development Association. A basket with 60 concrete development projects are included in the development project for the Gulf of Finland. From these 60, the involved parties -- the state, municipalities, businesses, and private associations -- can select which individual projects concern them, and can in conjunction with others move them forward. Those elements considered of overall strategic importance are: improvement of land communications -- E18 and the rail route; developing environmental technology; improvement of knowledge regarding Russia; betterment of safety; and establishing planning cooperation over the border. Transit Traffic for 6-7 Billion Markkas The better the communications to St. Petersburg, the more attractive will be the coastal region to those businesses wanting to establish themselves in the Russian market, reason the drafters. The coastal zone in southeast Finland is the most rapid and secure transportation route from the United States (via Rotterdam and Amsterdam) and West Europe to Russia and the other countries of the former Soviet Union. "This now involves a market of perhaps 2 billion markkas per year, but if the entire transportation chain is taken into account, this is estimated to be at least from 6-7 billion markkas," says Valinoro. E18 should be [re]built as a four-lane highway or expressway. The most difficult bottlenecks are found on the Russian side of the border and in Vyborg. The railroads are going to be even more a key factor in the Russian transportation system, and rail will therefore be the only realistic alternative when large volumes of cargo are to be transported for long distances. Time Works in Favor of Helibannan [new Helsinki-St. Petersburg Rail Route] "Considering all this, it is clear that time is working in favor of a future Helibannan," Valinoro claims. The present rail route to Russia should be improved so that the Pendolino train can transit the Helsinki-St. Petersburg stretch in four and a half hours. With this is would be possible to make one-day round trips between the two cities, either for purposes of business or shopping. In the long term a new, more direct rail line to the east is going to prove necessary, and then the travel time can be reduced -- in the best case -- to two and a half hours. Development of environmental technology relates to the key industrial areas along the Gulf of Finland's coastal belt. The adjacent areas within the CIS and the Baltic countries are to constitute the most important markets for Finnish environment companies. An action program must now be drafted which will make it possible for Finnish companies to participate in environment projects requiring international financing arrangements in the former Soviet area. Such a program should cover needs in Russia and, at the same time, involve international financing and Finnish know-how. In comparison with many other areas, especially Tallinn and Riga, which are in competition for the role of entry ports to Russia and the East, the Finnish areas along the Gulf of Finland have an important weak point: our knowledge of the Russian language, and our familiarity with Russian mores and practices and the Russian culture are poor. Head Start of Five to 10 Years At the same time, we have a time jump of perhaps 10-15 years in comparison to Finland. This should be exploited as soon as possible, according to Valinoro. "The opportunities for studying Russian should be expanded at all educational levels. To awaken a greater interest in Russian new teaching materials should be developed which reflect the new, dynamic economy and culture now going on, instead of the bygone Soviet era and its linguistic usages. ``It is also important to activate cooperation in education and research, and to create new programs for practicum exchanges, as well as exchange programs in culture and sports.'' The border between Finland and Russia is perhaps the world's deepest living-standards gap. This creates tension and strong undercurrents. To master them is a difficult job which will likewise yield profit if handled well. The situation in Russia is instable and its future prospects partly concealed in darkness. This creates insecurity and risks, but also opportunities for progress for capable business people. A careful but, at the same time, flexible border regime is under these circumstances a necessary precondition for crossborder economic cooperation, as well as cooperation in general, to run safely and smoothly.
