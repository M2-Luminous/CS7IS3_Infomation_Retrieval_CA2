The Serbian military command has ordered the stopping of the movement of the population between May 9-11 in the said villages because of the use of firing arms by the forces during their training. Also, on May 4, two columns of the Serbian Army, with many armoured vehicles headed for the villages of Duboc, Galice, and Mikushnice of Drenice. The Serbian officers ordered the staff and pupils of the elementary school Azem Bejtja not to move on next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday [9, 10, 11 May] from 0400 o'clock in the morning until 1600, because of the military exercises. Other inhabitants of these Albanian villages were warned of this, as well. Sources from these villages report that the people's movement, especially at night, is very dangerous because of the military presence.
