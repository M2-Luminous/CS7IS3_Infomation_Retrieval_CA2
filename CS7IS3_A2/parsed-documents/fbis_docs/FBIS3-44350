The repairing, which took less than four months, was undertaken by the Henan branch of the China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE) with a loan of 2.13 million U.S. dollars provided by the Japanese Government for the restoration. A grand ceremony for recommissioning of the power stations was held here this afternoon. Expressing his thanks at the ceremony for the help extended by China and Japan, Nepali Congress Supremo Ganesh Man Singh [spelling of name, title as received] said that "it's really unbelievable that the project should be finished in such a short period with excellent quality." Water Resources State Minister Laxman Prasad Ghimire said that "the success of the restoration is mainly due to good management by CWE and the Japanese side." The Kulekhani Hydropower Project was forced to close down after the penstock pipe of the no. 1 station and water supply equipments of no. 2 station were damaged by heavy floods caused by incessant monsoon rains in July this year. The Kulekhani project's two stations provide 100 megawatts of the country's total annual capacity of power supply of 280 megawatts. So its recommissioning would help reduce the load-shedding practised in Kathmandu Valley.
