Mario Soares understands that Cavaco Silva may be concerned about Macao, but went on to say that, as far as omitting human rights violations is concerned, people should use silence to suit themselves. He made the above statements in an interview to Maria Joao Figueiredo: [Begin recording] [Figueiredo] You have said that China has a dictatorship. Are you concerned about Macao and what may happen after 1999? [Soares] No, I am not concerned about Macao, because I am convinced that the Chinese, whatever China's evolution may be -- and I believe there will be evolution in China, like everywhere else -- will be faithful to the Luso-Chinese joint declaration. As far as I am concerned, I am relatively tranquil about the future of Macao. [Figueiredo] There are Portuguese politicians in China at this moment, and the human rights issue has not been mentioned. Do you have any reservations about human rights having been ignored? [Soares] I understand the prime minister's logic. I understand that, when he was in China, he was essentially concerned about our relations with China and the future of a territory for which we have responsibility, namely Macao. I understand that he may want to defend the idea that we should have relations with China, not ignoring, nevertheless, the fact that the Chinese regime is obviously not a regime that is to our liking, because it is not a democracy, it is indeed a dictatorship. [Figueiredo] Is then silence justified? [Soares] No. Silence depends on circumstances, and everybody may use silence when they believe it must be used and also believe that it is the best way for their own country. [end recording]
