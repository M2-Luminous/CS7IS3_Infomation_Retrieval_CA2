In the almost ten-month break in the work of the commission, the Romanians managed to replace over 80 percent of the purification installations of the metallurgical combined works in Calarasi which reduced phenol, hydrogen sulphide and dust emissions. The Bulgarian Institute of Hygiene, Medical Environment and Nutrition carried out joint research with a similar Romanian institute. The Romanian side showed interest in environment related diseases incidence. The Bulgarian side presented the required information and research methods. The measurements taken in January and February in Bulgaria have shown lower concentrations of pollutants against the same period last year.
