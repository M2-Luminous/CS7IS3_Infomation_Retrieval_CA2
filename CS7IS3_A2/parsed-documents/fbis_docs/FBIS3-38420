But he keeps quiet about it, and is little known outside of Westminster. Not for him bursts of oratory in the Commons chamber, regular television soundbites or loud threats delivered outside Downing Street. His preference is for a much more effective course -- the short walk down a corridor in the Houses of Parliament for a private word in the Prime Minister's room. He is James Molyneux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, a shrewd wheeler-dealer, the ultimate Commons fixer. He holds the balance of power in the present Parliament, just as he did in Callaghan's Labour government between 1974 and 1979. The nine Ulster Unionist votes have saved John Major's Government since the general election in 1992 and will do so again. Everyone at Westminster believes Major and Molyneux have a secret deal, as journalists like to describe it, or an understanding, as MPs prefer to put it: the result is the same however it is described, the survival of the Major Government. Given the immense power he holds, Molyneux's behaviour over the last few months has been puzzling. Why has this man, steeped in the Unionist tradition, the leading voice of Ulster Protestantism, been so relaxed about the Downing Street Declaration? Surely, an agreement between London and Dublin talking about self-determination for the whole island of Ireland would have sent a shiver through the man who holds a senior position in the Orange Order, Sovereign Grand Master of its Royal Black Preceptor? Yet on the December day that the declaration was announced Molyneux had little to say, in contrast to the Rev lan Paisley, leader of the smaller, hard-line Democratic Unionist Party, who denounced it as a sell-out to "buy off the fiendish Republican scum." One piece of speculation was that Molyneux, aged 73 and possibly coming close to retirement, wanted a legacy, a peace settlement for Northern Ireland, to go down in history as the man able to rise above his own particular brand of politics, an Ulster Gorbachev. As a piece of speculation, it is complete nonsense. In a lengthy interview with THE SCOTSMAN, Molyneux explained in detail for the first time why he was so relaxed about the Downing Street Declaration. The reason was not that he had mellowed but that he had successfully fought the Unionist corner. He told how in behind-the-scenes meetings with the Prime Minister, an original 30-paragraph Irish document was slashed down to the 12 paragraphs that eventually appeared. He neutralised it, removing anything of any substance, any mechanisms that would have required action or set up joint British-Irish structures. The final declaration was "a muddled, tortuous one," and "while one didn't like the wording, it didn't pose any threat to the Union." The naive optimism that greeted the Downing Street Declaration, a hope that it would bring an end to the killing fields, has long since dissipated. Molyneux's explanation of how he neutered the document explains why. He does not believe the Irish Republican Army will accept the document. "I never did think they would do it. They might have been a bit more sympathetic if the British Government had agreed to the 30 paragraphs.... Once it was denuded of the mechanisms, it was no good for them," he said. Critics of Molyneux, while acknowledging his shrewdness and political skill, say his biggest failure is his inability to take the wider view of Irish politics. A member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Northern Ireland's democratic nationalists, complained: "We are interested in the relationship between Northern Ireland and Dublin. He is only interested in who rules in Northern Ireland." The other complaint is that he is too fond of Westminster. "He is very proud of being Right Honourable and will get a peerage in due course," said one source close to Northern Ireland politics. This is true. But there is more to Molyneux's interest in the Commons than just prestige: Molyneux has used it as a powerbase, not only to consolidate Unionist power but to strengthen it. He has only once made a mistake, when he misread Thatcher. He did not believe she would sign the British-lrish agreement of 1985; but she did. He has not made any mistakes since, at least from a Unionist point of view. Molyneux's public visage is usually blank or mournful looking, typically Presbyterian, though in private he is cheerful and is often described as clubbable, the Westminster phraseology for being easy-going. To Molyneux, having a blank face is a compliment. He tells of how a party colleague, John Taylor, turned to him after they had won a key vote, with order papers being waved all around them: "The trouble with you is that we can never tell whether you are glad or sad about anything." Molyneux said that on that occasion, as on others, he was thinking ahead, his mind already moving on to battles that lay ahead: not for him exuberant displays or histrionics on the night of a famous victory. Politics, for him, is about patience, about taking the long view. Molyneux, as part of the price of supporting Major, has succeeded in blocking proposals to privatise water in Northen Ireland and in gaining agreement on a select committee for Northern Ireland affairs, seeing the latter as a way of bringing even closer ties to the mainland. But his greatest service to Unionism came in the months running up to the Downing Street Declaration. He said the document first surfaced in the Irish Press on 19 November, consisting of 30 paragraphs and confirmed by the Irish Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, as authentic. Paisley and other Ulster politicians went to see Major and made very public statements afterwards. Molyneux made few such statements and instead saw Major about twice a week in private. He could barely conceal, during the interview, his sense of satisfaction at the outcome. The other party leaders have to ask themselves, said Molyneux, who was responsible for removing the contentious parts from the original Irish document. From memory, he recited in detail a paragraph that would have set up a joint British-Irish convention that would have exercised a lot of power over a Northern Ireland Assembly. "Now this is not in the document. And now there isn't in it anything, as opposed to when there were 30 paragraphs, not even one cog or wheel of mechanism anywhere in it. It is just a muddled statement of principles and aspirations and all the rest of it but not a single commitment to do anything, unlike the Anglo-lrish agreement which says `there shall be established, the chief constable shall do this, that and the other, the army commander shall do this.' There is no `shall' or even `may' in it [The Downing Street Declaration]," he said. His one concession was to Dublin's idea for a Forum for Peace, an all-lreland political convention. "The only thing I reluctantly...not reluctantly but which I thought there was no harm in acquiescing to...was Reynolds having a forum `within his jurisdiction.' These words were put in deliberately. He can have a talking shop if he wants to. We are not involved. The British Government is not involved. They can do what they like. It is in their own sovereign territory." He does not rule out a meeting with Reynolds, who sent him a "friendly" letter in December to which Molyneux sent a reply simply acknowledging receipt. But Molyneux is not particularly interested in relations between Northern Ireland and Dublin. What he considers to be much more significant is internal democracy and the talks have been underway since last September with the Northern Ireland minister of state, Michael Ancram, about setting up an Assembly. This has attracted interest in Scotland, where the argument is that if Northern Ireland can have a legislative Assembly, why not Scotland. But Molyneux makes it clear that while the Government may want a legislative Assembly, he does not, and what Molyneux wants, he invariably gets. His plan is for a nonlegislative 85-member Assembly, a sort of glorified local government. It would be more like Strathclyde Regional Council than a full-blown Scottish Parliament as proposed by Labour. If legislation was needed, this could be done by getting private bills put through the Commons, just as English councils do at present. He concedes that if the Assembly worked and became a mature body, there might in the future be a case for adding legislative powers. Molyneux, who fought in the RAF [Royal Air Force] during the Second World War, found himself on the Normandy beaches on D-Day. It was partly an accident, having been transferred only a few days earlier by a commanding officer who did not like him. A lot of his life has been an accident. He has been an MP since 1970 -- first for Antrim South and now for the Lagan Valley -- and leader of the Unionists since 1974. As Major's Commons majority of 17 dwindles further as a result of inevitable by-election defeats, Molyneux's role over the next few years will become more, not less, important. In January 1985, Douglas Hurd, then Home Secretary, frustrated by the intransigence of Molyneux and Paisley, complained that "the Unionist tail cannot go on wagging the British dog forever." The British dog has never been so vigorously wagged as it is at present.
