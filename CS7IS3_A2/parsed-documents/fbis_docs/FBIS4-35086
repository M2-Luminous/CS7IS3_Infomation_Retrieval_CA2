The fundamental premises of his plan are respect for monetary and fiscal discipline, greater deregulation, war on corruption, definition of the state functions, and greater Mexican incorporation into the world economy. That program, he said, will allow us to grow at a 6 percent rate in 1996 and generate from 800,000 to 1 million jobs a year, which is why public and private investment will be raised to 25 percent of GDP. In attending the Eighth Southeastern Business Forum, Cardenas Solorzano explained that his program will be made up of three complementary and concurrent phases: the orderly transfer of the management of the economy, an emergency plan to restore growth and create jobs, and, lastly, sustained growth, social development, and protection of the environment. The candidate explained that during the first phase of its implementation, from September 1994 to June 1995, a package of measures will be created to maintain the stability of the exchange rate, encourage investment flow, and reevaluate the Mexican Government's ties with its foreign partners, international organizations, and the banking and commercial entities of the countries with which greater economic exchange exists. At the same time, Cardenas Solorzano explained that a government economic team will be set up with people of great technical capacities and recognized integrity and professionalism, "who have not joined the economic team that designed and implemented the current government's degrading economic policy." During the second phase, he said, an emergency plan would be implemented to regain growth and create jobs, which would be in effect for two years and require resources close to 16 billion new pesos. Speaking to approximately 500 businessmen from Mexico's southeastern region, he noted that within this context public investment will receive a selective, orderly, and soundly financed boost, as this investment will serve as the initiator of economic reactivation owing to the stimulus it will give to local and foreign investments. During the meeting, Cardenas Solorzano indicated that the emergency public investment plan will target the following priority areas: improving and expanding the road network; repairing, equipping, and expanding railroads and ports; increasing the capacity to generate energy and refine oil; and building and repairing schools, hospitals, housing, and urban services. After describing his economic program as "viable, realistic, and responsible," the PRD candidate mentioned the sources from which the required investment would be financed: savings stemming from the elimination of squandered resources, waste, unnecessary bureaucracy, and chiefly from the war in the federal administration [as published], from which he expects to obtain 3.2 billion news pesos. Similarly, the financing would come from utilizing the rest of the Contingency Fund resources that would make it possible to obtain 1.2 billion pesos and a careful handling of the debt, sources which he expects will generate 10.6 billion new pesos, equivalent to 1 percent of the GDP. "The greater payment of interests would be compensated with taxes, as a result of a higher level of economic activity and, therefore, of tax collecting," he said. Within his emergency plan, Cardenas Solorzano indicated that a new credit policy would be established and for this purpose, funds with preferential rates would be channeled to the micro, small, and medium businesses. He also proposed fiscal incentives for businesses, through actions that will lower the cost of production capital, such as accelerated depreciation formulas, lifting import controls on capital goods, and reducing tariffs on work, farm, and construction vehicles. The third part of the plan, he added, entails launching an economic growth program with equality. It will include an industrial policy, a policy for rural areas, fiscal, political, and social policies, promotion of education, a policy for income distribution, and an ecological policy. The meeting is being attended by businessmen from the country's southeastern states, who hope to hear the presidential candidates of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], the National Action Party [PAN], and the PRD explain their economic proposals to fight poverty and develop not only this region, but the entire country. Nevertheless, PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo said he would not attend the meeting. The same situation holds true for Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe, who had been scheduled to participate the first day of the meeting. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was the only one to present his economic plan. PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos limited himself to presenting a number of diverse measures to economically stimulate this geographic area. Speaking to the businessmen, Cardenas stressed that the basic premise of this program is economic democracy, in other words, "production areas goals, which are defined on the basis of the interests of the majority of the underprivileged Mexicans and on economic decisions in which producers, workers, citizens, and government leaders are involved." He proposed a change in the economic strategy, indicating that his plan "does not mean returning to the past, limiting the role of private enterprise, returning to the state enterprises that have already been sold, erecting barricades to foreign trade, or closing ourselves to foreign investments." It means, he added, making economic decisions democratically and placing at the top of all economic priorities, the struggle against neglect and injustice, the fight against poverty, and the eradication of ignorance. In his economic program, outlined in more than 30 pages, Cardenas Solorzano highlighted its four basic tenets. First, he said the state must not replace private enterprise nor become the absolute director of the economy, "that is why all possible investment opportunities will be opened to private enterprise, but with the state supplementing these efforts in the areas where it is essential." Second, he said there must be constant economic deregulation to remove the bureaucratic obstacles that hinder production activities, conditions of equality in market competition must be created, and monopolies must be fought. His program stresses monetary and fiscal discipline in addition to waging an all-out war against corruption in the government, the business sector, unions, and other production and service sectors. The last point of his program is to further promote Mexico's participation in the world economy while simultaneously seeking a diversification of markets through a realistic strategy of intensifying trade with select countries and regions. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas also devoted some time to answering questions of businessmen attending the meeting. There was a total of 13 questions, and Cardenas did not have enough time to answer all of them. Asked about fiscal policy with regard to the states, Cardenas indicated that state and municipal governments should be given more fiscal resources to improve their capacity to finance their numerous programs. He stressed that states currently contribute 15 percent of all revenues while municipalities contribute 5 percent. "We plan to recommend before a national fiscal convention, which would be called for this purpose, that the municipalities triple their contributions and the states double theirs, thereby reducing the federal allotment from 80 percent to 55 percent," he noted. Cardenas was criticized for his support for the reinstatement within constitutional Article 27 of the inalienable nature of ejidos and communal lands as a means to protect the patrimony of millions of peasants. Answering a question on greater participation by the private sector in significant areas, Cardenas reiterated: "The oil industry and the generation of electricity should remain under state control, which should make them more efficient and fight corruption." A rancher from the area voiced his concern over the invasion of lands by local residents, and he asked Cardenas for his position on land seizures. Cardenas stated that applying the full weight of the law constitutes the only means of protecting small landowners while ending backwardness in the countryside. This statement won him a round of applause. The last questions focused on his political history. Cardenas said he had tried to democratize the party from within but decided to resign from the political organization when he saw this was an impossible task. When the event ended, Bernardo Ardavia, president of the Southeastern Business Investment and Development Council, was asked to comment on the PRD presidential candidate's program. He asserted that many points in the program seem to be a return to the past, "especially when he talks of reforming Article 27. We have already seen that the previous legal arrangement did not bring development or investment to the rural areas in the past 60 years." Cardenas' position, according to Ardavia, "prompts concern because it seems inconsistent. There were points that he did not answer clearly. There were also interesting aspects, such as the mechanisms proposed to protect small landowners. Well, I believe his proposal is an array of grays, and each matter has to be taken separately."
