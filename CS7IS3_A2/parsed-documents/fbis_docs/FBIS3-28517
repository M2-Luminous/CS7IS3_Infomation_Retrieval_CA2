Speaking to reporters during a stopover here on his way to Kota Kinabalu, he said: "We managed to get the message across, and the leaders in Kuala Lumpur now understand our problems. These problems have plagued the state over the past few years. I believe everyone knows that the best way to solve them is through cooperation." He said there are several leaders in Sabah and Kuala Lumpur who want to restore relations and work together again. "We all accept Vision 2020 [national development plan]; we must set aside our political differences and work together," he said. Jeffrey Kitingan, the younger brother of Sabah Chief Minister Pairin Kitingan, declined to elaborate further on the matter, noting that he was returning to Sabah to assist the PBS [Sabah United Party] in the upcoming state elections on 18-19 February. The latest reports say that Jeffrey will run in the Bingkor constituency. He is also expected to strengthen Pairin's leadership and solve the PBS's internal problems. [passage omitted]
