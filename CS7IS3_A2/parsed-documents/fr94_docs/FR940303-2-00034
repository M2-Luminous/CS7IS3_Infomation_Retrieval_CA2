FR940303-2-00034 FR940303-2-00023 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;140&hyph;000] Black Marlin Pipeline Co.; Filing February 25, 1994. Take notice that on January 7, 1994, Black Marlin Pipeline Company (Black Marlin), requests approval to continue filing a FERC Form No. 2&hyph;A: Annual Report of Nonmajor Natural Gas Companies (Form 2A), even though Black Marlin's volumes transported for a fee now meet the criteria of a major natural gas company which would require the filing of a FERC Form No. 2: Annual Report of Major Natural Gas Companies (Form 2). Black Marlin states that it believes the information provided on the Form 2A is sufficient, because: (1) Recent incremental volumes transported by the Company are primarily on behalf of an intrastate pipeline and, (2) additional Form 2 reporting and independent audit requirements would require extensive resources disproportionate to any benefits gained. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before March 4, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
