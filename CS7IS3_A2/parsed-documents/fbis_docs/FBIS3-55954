The proposed government reshuffle will retain current governmental practices and the current decision-making mechanism, which works behind closed doors in a room next door rather than around the governmental table. The outcome is a more administrative government with a more administrative prime minister. Concentrating power instead of delegating it cannot be served up as a parliamentary practice, however attractively arranged. The reason why I consider it necessary to talk to you, esteemed people's deputies, with worry and openness, stems from an issue that a year or two ago was not yet topical. It is topical today and directly concerns Estonian national security. I say this as the top commander of Estonian state defense according to Section 16, Article 78 of the Constitution. [passage omitted] Having said what I had to say and hoping that at critical moments the country's interests would come higher than party interests, I will now, before your very eyes, sign the resolution, which at the present moment in history must unite us, lift us above our differences of opinion, and assist the republican government in keeping the Estonian country's interests apart from party interests.
