During his formal talks with Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali here today, Qian expressed the hope that Pakistan and India would make progress in resolving the Kashmir issue through dialogs. As a neighboring country to both Pakistan and India, China is concerned about the Kashmir issue, said Qian, who arrived here on Monday evening on a four-day official visit to Pakistan. Pakistan Foreign Minister Asif briefed the Chinese guest about the Kashmir situation and Pakistan's efforts to bring about the settlement of the issue. The two foreign ministers expressed their satisfaction at the smooth development of the bilateral relations between China and Pakistan. During the meeting, Asif said that Pak-China friendly relations are sound and have made progress in all fields. He expressed the hope that the two countries would further develop the friendly and mutually beneficial relations. Qian Qichen said Sino-Pak friendship is time-tested and the bilateral relations have seen all-round development since the two countries established diplomatic ties over 40 years ago. Such friendship is not only in the interests of the two countries but also conducive to the maintenance of peace and stability in this region and Asia as a whole, Qian said. The two sides also exchanged views on mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields, on regional security and economic cooperation as well as on the international situation. Qian also appreciated Pakistan's efforts for settling difference among various Afghan parties to restore peace and stability in war-torn Afghanistan.
