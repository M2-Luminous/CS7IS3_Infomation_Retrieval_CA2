Popovic; place and date not given: "The Mistakes Must Not Be Repeated"] [Text] [Popovic] General, was the youngest corps in the Army of Yugoslavia [VJ], which you head, formed because of experience in the last war, and what do you think as a fighter and commanding officer about the applicability of that knowledge in the everyday life of members of our armed forces? [Djokic] The experiences in the last war certainly should be appreciated; they can be used in training the men and the commands, which does not mean that there will be a considerable change in the general approach to training our armed forces. That conflict on the space of the former Yugoslavia still represents only one of the forms of military action typical of civil war in which the initiative of individuals, small groups, and units is prominent, which would not be the case should there be aggression from outside. The Army of Yugoslavia must be able to defend the country against an aggressor who is well-armed, trained, and several times stronger. I think that the experiences at the operational and strategic level are more important than the "tactical experiences" gained in the war in 1991 and 1992; we learned through them that units at the front cannot be commanded from a great distance and directly from the Supreme Command. That is why at the beginning of the war, wherever possible, temporary structures were formed which we called operational groups. The commands of the operational groups were made up of men who did not know each other well enough, so that in the extreme case they were teams that had not practiced together and frequently their results in direction and command were poorer than results achieved by commands at the formation level. We can no longer allow ourselves to make such a mistake. [Popovic] The formation of new units in the VJ is not the only innovation in the process of transformation which has spread through all the pores of military life. How do you look on that process? [Djokic] The transformation has two basic spheres. First, the material sphere, which pertains above all to changes in organization and military structure taking place without major hindrances; they soon will be completed, successfully I hope. In the second sphere, the nonmaterial, political, and moral sphere, a transformation is also taking place and has already been given its framework, which is now clear to the immense majority of members of the Army of Yugoslavia. That part of the transformation requires changes in people's behavior, in the way they think, in the way they regard their obligations and tasks. That is the part that involves depoliticization of the armed forces and professionalization of its members. It is quite expensive and requires much more effort than transformation of organization and military structure. We have had very important results in this area, which shows that our people have already cast off the burden of earlier political commitments, along with many unnecessary tasks, so that now we can commit ourselves more successfully and resolutely to modernization of the armed forces and to professionalization, which should not be conceived as a completely new phenomenon. Even earlier, in the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], we had active officers who were part of an army which was highly professional. Now, we are increasing the number of people who will defend the country professionally, including in our ranks soldiers under contract, who already make up a sizable portion of members of the Army of Yugoslavia. [Popovic] Now that you are already talking about soldiers under contract, how really professional are they? [Djokic] Certain time is needed for soldiers under contract to be turned into professionals, masters of the art of war. So far, we have not had the time to achieve that result through the process of training and screening of personnel. These are only the initial steps, which in military police units, the paratroopers, and other special-purpose units have already produced the first contours of our professional soldier. In other units, that process is going somewhat more slowly, and minor mistakes have also been made. For example, assigning soldiers under contract from border areas to border units carries a high risk that individuals will abuse their position and the duties they perform. The difficult conditions under which we are living now make such doubts increasingly realistic. In future, then, the number of soldiers under contract will be reduced to a reasonable number, and they will be replaced by soldiers serving their regular required military service, from whose ranks we will later recruit professional border guards. In any case, it should be said that most of the soldiers under contract have been performing their wartime duties very competently, and we can confidently say of them that they are real professionals. [Popovic] You have mentioned the border, could you say something more about the situation at the moment on the border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia? [Djokic] For more than two years now, we have been securing the border with Macedonia under very difficult material conditions. Our border units are mainly housed in old and abandoned schools, by contrast with certain other services on the border, which have new buildings with steam heat and all other conditions for an extremely comfortable life and work. A large number of our border guards lived until recently in tents, and even now we are using them to store certain supplies and to perform some of our regular activities. This certainly makes it more difficult for us to secure the national border. Thanks to the exceptional efforts we made in the last three months, with support of authorities in the opstinas of Vranje and Bujanovac and even from the Health Ministry of the Republic of Serbia, we now have several abandoned outpatient clinics which were built in settlements near the border, which we are going to adapt and use as watchtowers. For the moment, we have no very serious problems concerning border security. There are very few with bad intentions, but on the other hand there are many who are trying to cross the border to smuggle fuel. The numbers of those smugglers and the poorly marked or unmarked border resulted in the recent incident which the Macedonian news media exaggerated somewhat, although in the estimation of our border personnel their patrol did cross onto our territory, which is why it was stopped and taken to the watchtower, and from there, after a brief routine conversation, it was returned to their territory. [Popovic] General, some of the units in your corps are being manned from the reserves. Can you say something about the response of military registrants to the call-up for exercises, and in that same context about the influence of party activities? [Djokic] We have given very high marks to the mobilizations which we have carried out up to now as an indicator of the readiness of units to perform special-purpose missions. In recent months, it can be said without exaggeration that we have recorded a considerable growth in the responsibility of members of our war units and an increased reporting rate, which now ranges between 80 and 90 percent of military registrants called up. There has also been an increase in the response of recruits to do required military service, so that there is less and less need to replace peacetime personnel with military registrants, so that they are being called up less and less often and serving less time in wartime units. As for party activity and the influence of parties or their attempt to have an adverse effect on the call-up of military registrants, I must say that there was quite a bit of that in the past. Over the last year, that influence has almost ceased, or is at least negligible. It seems to me that now everyone has understood that defense of the country is the patriotic obligation of citizens and that this cannot be contrary to the program of any party. [Popovic] You say that there has also been an increased response of recruits in the units of your corps; do you have precise figures, for example, on how recruits from those areas are reporting to do required military service? [Djokic] The response of conscripts from the territory of the Nis Military District and military sectors in the zone of responsibility of the Leskovac Corps was higher than 100 percent in the September induction period; that is because quite a few volunteers reported to do their required military service because they wanted to do it earlier. The response of conscripts from other areas to our units is somewhat below that, more precisely about 95 percent. Thanks to additional efforts of our unit, we nevertheless exceeded the number required to man our units. These percentages do not apply to conscripts of Skipetar or Muslim nationality, who still are responding to the draft either scantily or almost not at all. [Popovic] It is well-known, General, that you train conscripts according to the drafts of the new training curricula. How have they been accepted in your units, and how are you getting along in the general lack of money? [Djokic] Experience so far has shown that those curricula provide good conditions for training men and officers successfully and quickly to perform the tasks assigned them. Further practice will certainly point up a need for minor corrections, which will contribute still more to their quality and adapt them to the real needs of units. The shortage of supplies and funds has been adversely affecting the process of combat training insofar as we are unable to continuously renew certain expendable supplies such as, for example, sources of electric power, for which fresh financial resources are always needed. In no case can the shortage of money stop the training process. [Popovic] An unavoidable question in that connection is how much the lack of money affects the soldier's standard of living? [Djokic] We share the fate of all members of the Army of Yugoslavia, and, as far as I know, most of our people. It is hard to say it, but for several months we have been feeding the soldiers only canned food. Whatever efforts we made, we were altogether unable to buy fresh meat. Now, we have nevertheless found some sources of our own for the supply of meat, fruit, and vegetables, because last summer and fall we sent some of our personnel to harvest crops in the work organization "Delises," and we also offered help to "Porecje" in Vucje. Now, we are getting fresh fruit and vegetables from their coolers as we need them. Thanks to cooperation with "Mesokombinat," we have replenished our facilities for fattening hogs. We have also gotten feed, and we will have larger quantities of fresh meat in the spring, through an arrangement that is mutually satisfactory and advantageous. [Popovic] Are the officers also in a better position? [Djokic] When it comes to the standard of living of officers, the situation is still more serious. Regardless of the efforts we have made to provide winter supplies and fuel at more favorable prices, some of the officers still have not managed to prepare for the coming winter. Those officers and their families who came to our units without anything from the secessionist republics are in the most difficult situation. At the moment, we have more than 260 families who do not even have housing. [Popovic] In these confusing times, General, we very often forget those who were our associates until recently. How are "your" pensioners living, and how are they getting along? [Djokic] We have not forgotten them. Nor have we forgotten the disabled persons and survivors of those who were killed in the last war. We provided winter supplies and fuel both for ourselves and also for them. We delivered fuel right to the door of disabled persons. Insofar as the law, and, of course, our own capabilities, allow, we are also providing financial assistance, but all of that, unfortunately, is less than modest. At this point, it is difficult for everyone, but pensioners who were awarded a well-deserved pension during this last year are in a particularly unenviable position if they still have not managed to get their bearings and find a way to supplement their small pensions with any other sources of income. [Popovic] There was a long wait for adoption of the new law on the VJ. Has any significant change occurred since its adoption? [Djokic] We are inclined to justify all manner of things by looking for an excuse even in the absence of a regulation so that we would have a respite and justification for certain oversights that certainly should not have occurred. The new law has now created all the preconditions to rightly require greater accountability not only of individuals in the Army, but also of structures outside the VJ, which are also responsible for defense of this country. Because, as I have said, we have been forced into a difficult material situation, we are greatly restricted in performing our obligations, which does not mean that we are not where we ought to be and that our people are not ready to perform their missions which the homeland expects of them. The measures which are now being taken to straighten out the situation with personnel are bringing about conditions for full successful performance of all tasks assigned to our units. This is a job on which up to now we have been rather sluggish, slow, irresolute, and inconsistent. Now that the law has been adopted, we need to adopt as soon as possible other regulations and complete the process of straightening out the personnel problems of units. The time in which we trained obedient operatives is behind us. We must bring to the leadership of our units and institutions brave officers who have initiative of their own, who are ready to take a risk and complete their part of the job, assuming full responsibility for what they have done. The Law on the Army offers us that opportunity. If we take advantage of it, each of us will precisely know and have his own obligations and his own rights. [Popovic] Will the incisions made in personnel policy leave us without a bureaucracy or without field officers? [Djokic] The bureaucracy is a product of the society in which we live. Just as it multiplied in society at large, so it has also found fertile ground in the Army. During this time, we have had numerous and cumbersome commands with many departments and staff officers who were always thinking up new jobs for new departments and new staff officers. We have had filing cabinets full of all kinds of analyses and studies which never did anyone any good. Because of the financial conditions we have been facing, in the course of just a few restructurings we have made a radical turnaround and considerably reduced that structure for direction and command. I have the impression that at the same time we have not reduced the amount of work as much as we have the number of people, so that now we have a situation where some essential staff officers are really burdened and cannot manage to do all the work.
