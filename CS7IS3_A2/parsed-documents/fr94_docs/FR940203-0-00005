FR940203-0-00005 FR940203-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;209&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8814; AD 94&hyph;03&hyph;07] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 767 Series Airplanes Equipped With Carbon Brakes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes. This action requires inspections of the brake rod inner cylinder bolts on the main landing gear (MLG) wheels and brakes; inspections of certain MLG bushings; installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect; inspection and modification of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel; repair or replacement of discrepant parts; and revision of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), as necessary. This amendment is prompted by numerous reports of brake failure during landing and during a low energy rejected takeoff. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of two or more MLG brakes, which could adversely affect the stopping performance of the airplane. DATES: Effective February 18, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of February 18, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;209&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kristin Larson, Aerospace Engineer, Systems and Equipment Branch, ANM&hyph;130S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;1760; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FAA has received reports from Boeing that certain Model 767 series airplanes, equipped with carbon brakes, have experienced vibratory conditions, which resulted in damage or failure of the brake torque rod cross bolts and pins. Recently, one operator experienced a two-brake failure on a low energy rejected takeoff, whereas previously, there had been reports of two-brake failures occurring only during landings. To date, there have been 13 reported incidents of one-brake failure and 5 incidents of a two-brake failure, all due to the vibratory phenomenon. This type of failure could result in the loss of one or two brakes (out of eight total brakes), depending upon the location of the failure. The possibility exists that more than one brake-couple pair could experience simultaneous failure of the cross bolts or pins, which could result in the loss of more than two brakes. Boeing has advised the FAA that heat damage resulting from high vibrational loads could lead to fracture of the brake rod inner cylinder bolts. If this should occur, the adjacent brake rods would disconnect from the inner cylinder, causing the brakes not to operate at two MLG wheels. As a result, secondary damage to the hydraulic lines and damage to wiring and the airframe could occur. Boeing has also advised the FAA that vibrations during braking can lead to separation of the brake disconnect. Separation of brake hoses from the brakes would increase braking distances, which is of greatest concern if this should happen during a rejected takeoff. Additionally, Boeing has advised the FAA that the development of a fracture in a cross bolt in the brake rod pin assembly could cause the brake not to operate at that MLG wheel. The brake rod could separate from the brake housing, permitting the brake housing to turn on the axle. Under such conditions, while the wheel turns and brake pressure is applied, rotation of the brake housing would cut the hydraulic line and electrical wires attached to the brake. These conditions, if not corrected, could adversely affect the stopping performance of the airplane. The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0116, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994, that describes procedures for repetitive surface temper etch inspections and fluorescent magnetic particle inspections to detect cracks or thermal damage of the existing brake rod inner cylinder bolts on the MLG wheels and brakes, and replacement of cracked or damaged bolts with new or serviceable bolts. The service bulletin also describes procedures for performing repetitive visual inspections to detect cracking of the inner cylinder fork lug bushings, and the brake rod bushings at the inner cylinder fork lug end, and repair of cracked bushings. Accomplishment of the repetitive inspections, and replacement or repair as necessary, will help prevent the possibility of a fracture developing in the brake rod inner cylinder bolts. (The service bulletin limits the effectivity to Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon brakes.)
