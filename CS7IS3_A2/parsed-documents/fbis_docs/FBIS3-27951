FBIS3-27951 "dreas022__a94009" FBIS-EAS-94-022-A Document Type:Daily Report 2 February 1994 ANNEX Japan * Economic Planning Agency Officials Profiled 932B0207A Tokyo KANKAI in Japanese Sep 93 pp 88-100--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 932B0207A Tokyo KANKAI Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by KANKAI editorial staff: "On the Economic Planning Agency"] [Text] The Economic Planning Agency Proper; Seeking To Shed the Role of Being the "Government Economists Group" The Japanese economy has, at long last, begun to escape from the "complex recession," that was caused by the circulating impact of capital deflation brought about by drop in the value of land and stock following the bursting of the bubble economy, and is turning toward recovery. Can the economy smoothly enter the road to recovery and, is it possible to transfer our economic track to one that will provide for sustained economic growth equal to Japanese latent growth potential, which is said to be in the middle 3 percent range? It is Economic Planning Agency [EPA] that is responsible for analyzing the situation and performing general coordination of Japan's economic policy. Last year, EPA accomplished the big job of formulating the "Lifestyle Superpower Five-Year Plan," which was a much-touted policy matter for the Miyazawa cabinet. Beyond that, they put together an emergency economic measure in March 1992 to stimulate the still slumping economy and a comprehensive economic measure for August. The activities of the EPA have been noticeable this year as well as they have done things such as put together a new comprehensive economic measure in April, as soon as the main budget was adopted. However, their reputation in this regard is not universally positive. With regard to their analysis of the business conditions, there are such criticisms as "they misjudged the period of the recession," and "their decision on business conditions was late." Regarding their establishment of economic policy, criticism is heard here and there as to whether they "are adequately fulfilling their role as the government's economic coordination body?" There have even been comments by a weekly magazine saying that "the EPA is a big white elephant." The EPA neither has the power to determine the budget, as the Ministry of Finance [MOF] does, nor the ability to influence business, as the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] does. It has little direct, concrete authority. It is a government agency whose main mission includes research and coordination, and prepare economic plans. It is deplorable that the EPA's ability to carry out research and coordination should become the butt of criticism. Since the end of the Cold War, the global economy has been gripped by various difficult problems, such as the dull economic performance among the developed countries, the conversion of the former Soviet Union and Eastern European states to market economies, and environmental problems on a global scale. What path should Japanese economic development take in the course of all of this? With regard to international problems, how should true international policy cooperation be implemented? Domestically, what policy should be adopted to convert Japan from a society which places importance on producers to one that prioritizes consumers, and will bring about comfortable national life? The EPA confronts a wide spectrum of problems, and the role that they must fill in order to solve these problems is immense. Just how will the EPA respond the criticism coming in from various quarters? How will the EPA respond to demands from the public? The EPA's stance on these issues in the future is an item that will be watched with interest. Looking back on the history of the EPA, it cannot be denied that once it was considered a MITI "branch office," but later it took on the appearance of being a MITI/MOF "joint venture." Many personnel from the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce (the present-day MITI) were dispatched to the EPA's antecedent organizations; like the Office of Planning which, under the National Mobilization Law, promoted Japan's economy before the war, and the Economic Stabilization Headquarters, which put its efforts into the distribution of foodstuffs and commodities in order to promote Japanese economic reconstruction after the war. Even after it changed its name to the Economic Review Agency in 1952 and to the EPA in 1955, MITI continued to support the system by dispatching personnel to take the post of administrative vice minister. The MOF joined hands with the proper [a career employee or staff member] group and, in 1969, was successful in getting "proper treatment" for its Yoshio Kano (a graduate of Tokyo University, entered MOF in 1946) and getting him assigned as administrative vice minister, breaking MITI's monopoly on this post. From that time on, there has been a triangular struggle among the MOF, MITI, and the agency for control of the top-level posts in the EPA. MOF secures the head of the Director General's Secretariat and one bureau chief position, MITI gets the position of member of the policy board of the Bank of Japan and one bureau chief position, and those ministries and the agency proper fight over the posts of administrative vice minister. There is a reason for the burning attachment that MITI and MOF, the two most powerful ministries in Kasumigaseki place on the fight for the top-level positions in the EPA." That is because they want to strongly reflect their respective ministries view in economic policy measures such as the comprehensive economic measures put togetherby by the EPA. The ministries will find it easier to implement policies in future if their point of view is closely reflected not only in emergency economic stimulus measures which were implemented three times during current economic recession, but in such policy measures as "government economic forecast," which EPA prepares for each fiscal year. The conflict between these ministries becomes especially vivid revolving around drafting the government economic forecast and the midterm economic plans. MITI would push for a higher rate of economic growth, while the MOF usually advocates a cautious number. For example, in the "Lifestyle Superpower Five-Year Plan" that was adopted in 1992, the projected average annual rate of net economic growth rate presented was 3.5 percent. It is said that while MITI argued for a higher rate, MOF pushed a lower conservative figure. In the government economic forecast for FY 1993, the situation was different as both MITI and MOF pushed for a projected net growth rate of 3.5 percent and EPA argued for a rate in the low 3 percent range. In the end, a figure of 3.3 percent was adopted. As usual, MITI pushed for a higher economic growth rate in order to stimulate the desire of industrial sector, which (it believes) is under its protection, to invest in plant and equipment. Usually, the MOF advocates low growth rate lest it will be pressured for a higher government expenditures because higher growth rate will necessitate a higher estimate of tax revenue growth. Last year, however, because of the serious business recession, MOF projected a higher growth rate so that it can draft an economic stimulas-type of budget, avoiding issuance of deficit-covering bonds. It is the job of the EPA to coordinate the figures asserted by the two ministries and, while considering the economic situation at hand, take a final position, which is usually somewhere right in the middle. However, last year the number adopted was close to the low number suggested by the EPA, a result which shows that the EPA is coming out from under the influence of MITI and MOF. In fact, following the administrative vice ministerial position held by MOF from June 1986 through June 1987, the agency group took over the seat for three consecutive terms. Following that, although an official from the MOF was again named as administrative vice minister, the seat again reverted to the agency proper. This is because the EPA, which is made up of "a scratch team," is beginning to turn out capable men to take over the position. In the future, the vice ministerial position will probably be filled by EPA careerists, and the position would be given to MII and the MOF only from time to time. However, the scope of administrative ability of the agency careerists will probably be scrutinized carefully. To be able to bandy with other agencies and ministries, including MOF and MITI, on an equal footing, it would be necessary for the EPA to put forth unceasing efforts to strengthen itself and adjust its posture, in order to avoid becoming the object of sarcasm, such as "the EPA has neither money nor power," or "the EPA is just the government economists group," at the hands of other government ministries and agencies. Furthermore, looking at the personnel who have been selected to fill the role of director general of the EPA, although caught between MOF and MITI, when powerful ministers were in place, the EPA joined the ranks of leading agencies and ministries. Several influential leaders greatly enhanced the EPA's existence by serving as director generals, such as former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, who served as deputy prime minister and EPA director general concurrently in the Miki cabinet; former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who served three terms as EPA director general in the second Ikeda, first Sato, and Fukuda cabinets; and former MITI Minister Toshio Komoto, who had the credentials of being deputy prime minister in the Suzuki and second Nakasone cabinets. However, since Komoto, no one in the faction leader class has been tasked to serve as EPA director general, and that is unfortunate. However, as a result of the splitting up of the LDP and the last general election, a coalition government has become unavoidable. The political system finds itself in a situation where it must change to place importance on the standard of living of the people. Under these circumstances, the type of individual utilized for the role of director general of EPA would also become diverse. Meanwhile, as might be expected of an agency that is being called the "government economists group," EPA puts out a lot of economists. It provides human resources not only to the government, but also to academia and private think tanks, and is forming a unique human network known as "EPA line of economists." Adminstrative Vice Minister, Councilor, and Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan The top administrative official of EPA is Administrative Vice Minister Tsutomu Tanaka (entered the agency in 1959; graduated from Tokyo Metropolitan University, Law and Economics Departments). He assumed the seat of vice minister just as predicted by the newspaper forecasts published before the June personnel moves. Tanaka's installation as administrative vice minister returns the post to the agency proper, following three terms by agency propers, Takao Akabane, Shinyasu Hoshino, and Yasuo Katsumura, followed by Shunji Fukinbara from the MOF, and is a continuation of the recent trend to give priority to EPA propers for this post. Tanaka sports a splendid mustache, and he is known in the EPA as "the mustached Tanaka." He has made the rounds of the EPA Research, Planning, and Coordination Bureaus, and he is in the international group of the EPA as he has served a total of eight years, two terms, in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). He has had experience as director of the Coordination Bureau's Industrial Economic Affairs Division, chief of the International Affairs Division in the Director Gerneral's Secretariat of the Environment Agency, director of the EPA's First International Economic Affairs Division, director of the Coordination Division in the same Bureau, deputy director general of the Economic Research Institute, councilor to the Coordination Bureau, and councilor to the Planning Bureau before being named as director general of the Research Bureau. Following that, he was named as director general of the Price Bureau and councilor for Economic Planning before receiving his current post. He is from Tokyo Prefecture. In his first instructions after assuming current post, Tanaka stated that there were difficult aspects in the creation of a new global economic order following the end of the Cold War, emphasizing the importance of Japan's role in this process. He called for a vitalization of the EPA, because, in order for the EPA to grapple with this kind of problem, it will require "a high level of analytic ability," "bold planning power," and "daring coordinating power." The number-two administrative official is EPA Councilor Shosuke Tanaka (joined the agency in 1962; graduated in humanities and sciences from Saitama University). This post's full title is vice minister for International Economic Affairs. This is the same level vice ministerial post as the offices of deputy vice minister for Financial Affairs in the MOF and deputy vice minister in MITI. He attends international vice ministerial conferences as EPA representative. To distinguish his position from bureau level Councilors, this position is known as "EPA councilor" or "agency councilor." He had experience as head of the National Expenditure Division in the Department of National Income at the Economic Research Institute, director of the Overseas Research Division in the Research Bureau, director of the Department of National Income at the Economic Research Institute, and deputy director general of the Price Bureau before becoming director general of the Research Bureau. Following that, he served as director general of the Planning and Coordination Bureau of the National Land Agency and director general of the Planning Bureau before assuming his current post. He is from Tokyo Prefecture. Kuninari Morisei (joined MITI in 1965; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law Department) is EPA's member of the policy board of the Bank of Japan. An official dispatched from MITI is always assigned to this post. Although this official is said to be EPA representative, he is, in fact, representing MITI, and he often states MITI's and industry's position at the Bank of Japan policy committee meetings, which is held twice weekly on Tuesday and Friday. He agrees to reductions of the official interest rate, and opposes rate increases. He had experience as head of the Reserves Division of the Petroleum Department of MITI's Agency of Natural Resources and Energy [ANRE], Director General's Secretariat Welfare administrator, an industrial researcher at the London Center of the Japan External Trade Organization [JETRO], head of the Export Insurance Division of MITI's International Trade Administration Bureau, head of the Trade Insurance Division of the same Bureau, and director of the Industrial Finance Division of MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau, before becoming head of the Director General's Secretariat Planning Office, director of the Commerce and Industry Division for Osaka Prefecture, and deputy director general of MITI's International Trade Policy Bureau, on his way to his current post. He is from Okayama Prefecture. The EPA is headed up by the director general of Economic Planning and the administrative vice minister. Under them comes the Director General's Secretariat, five bureaus--Coordination, Social Policy, Price, Planning, and Research--and one affiliated organization, the Economic Research Institute. Regarding the responsibilities of the various bureaus, it is the responsibility of the Coordination Bureau to prepare the annual government economic forecast. Furthermore, it has responsibility for putting together the emergency and comprehensive economic measures that cover all of the various agencies and ministries. This bureau literally symbolizes the EPA as the government coordination agency. The Economic Welfare Bureau is responsible for consumer affairs. It assumes the administrative role in Economic Welfare Council, a Prime Minister's advisory organ, which is now studying the implementation of product liability [PL]. In 1973 the Price Bureau split away from the Economic Welfare Bureau and the independent Price Bureau received the job of being the watchman over prices. Every year, it publishes the price report, which analyzes the actual situation with regard to prices, and it also watches things such as the situation of the distribution of marginal profits caused by the high yen. The Planning Bureau is responsible for preparation of "economic plans," such as the the "Lifestyle Superpower Five-Year Plan." Each year, the Research Bureau publishes the "Economic White Paper," and also prepares the "Monthly Economic Report." It is responsible for researching and analyzing the internal and external economic environment. The Economic Research Institute prepares annual and quarterly statistics on GNP and also performs the basic economic analysis. Director General's Secretariat The Director General's Secretariat is responsible, like the Secretariats in other ministries and agencies, for coordinating activities with various bureaus, watching over such areas as personnel affairs, accounting, and public relations. It is the coordinator of the EPA, the government coordinating body. The person who manages this Secretariat is Yoji Wakui (entered the MOF in 1946; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law Department). This position is held successively by an official dispatched from the MOF. This is the bridgehead of the MOF's "control of Kasumigaseki." Therefore, it is normal for the MOF to dispatch someone of superior talents, a person who has experience as first deputy director general of the Budget Bureau and who is a likely candidate as vice minister of the MOF, to take this position. Wakui had experience as director of the Investigation Department of the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau, a budgetary planner in the Budget Bureau, a budget officer in the same bureau (responsible for construction and public works), director of the General Affairs Division of the same bureau, secretary to the Prime Minister, and as deputy director general of the Budget Bureau before he assumed his current post. He is from Chiba Prefecture. He was once temporarily assigned to the EPA, and therefore it is of interest to see just how he uses his experience to take the helm at the EPA. The head of the Secretarial Division, which is responsible for personnel affairs, is Yuzo Kobayashi (joined the EPA in 1969; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department). Within the EPA, he is known by the nickname "Kobayu [KOBAyashi YUzo]." He is showing a great desire toward the vitalization of the EPA. He served in positions such as secretary to the director general, director of the Second Economic Cooperation Division in the Coordination Bureau, director of the Price Coordination Division in the Price Bureau, and director of planning in the Planning and Coordination Bureau in the National Land Agency before assuming his current post. The director of the Accounts and Budget Division, which is responsible for Agency administratie matters, including budgeting and accounting, and employee benefits, is Hiroshi Yoshida (joined the agency in 1969; a graduate of Kyoto University, Economics Department). He had experience as director of the Second Research Division of the Research and Development Department in the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), director of the Second Consumer Affairs Division in the EPA's Social Policy Bureau, director of the Remote Islands Development Division of the National Land Agency's Regional Promotion Bureau, and director of the Business Statistics Research Division of the EPA's Research Bureau before assuming his current position. Eiji Sakuda (entered MITI in 1969; a graduate of Keio University, Economics Department) is the director of the Policy Division, which is responsible for things such as general coordination within the EPA, Diet policy, and public relations. He has had experience as director of the South Asia and Eastern Europe Division in MITI's International Trade Policy Bureau, head of the Electric Power Development Division of ANRE's Public Utilities Department, director of the Basic Chemicals Division of the Basic Industries Bureau, and head of the Planning Division of ANRE's Petroleum Department before taking up his current post. The Public Relations Office is in the Planning Division. The current head of the Public Relations Office is Izumi Nakafuji (joined the EPA in 1976; a graduate of Hitotsubashi University, Economics Department). He has been senior exchange researcher at the Economic Research Institute, assistant director of General Affairs Division of the Planning and Coordination Bureau in the National Land Agency, and a resercher in the Price Bureau before assuming his current post. Yoshinori Terui (joined EPA in 1971; a graduate of Tohoku University, Economics Department) is the director of the Electronic Data Processing Division, which is responsible for maintaining and operating the agency's computerized information systems. He has served as a researcher in the Research Bureau, a researcher in the Planning and Coordination Division of the Environment Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau, a grievance officer regarding the market opening problem in the Coordination Division of the EPA's Coordination Bureau, and as a planner in the Planning and Coordination Bureau in the National Land Agency before assuming his current position. Coordination Bureau The director general of the Coordination Bureau, the bureau at the heart of the EPA, is Makoto Kobayashi (joined MITI in 1961; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law Department). This position had been held by officials from the EPA careerist group, including Masaru Yoshitomi--Japan's preeminent economist--and subsequently by former Director General Yoseki Nagase. However, this time around, an official dispatched from MITI, with a long record of experience at EPA, has been named director general. With regard to the problem of distributing marginal profits resulting from the high yen, when he held his former job as director general of the Price Bureau, it is said that he argued with MITI and ANRE, who were resisting by saying "there aren't any marginal profits," and had a survey of the impact of marginal profits in utility bills approved by the conference of governmental price officials. Just how he will use his decisionmaking and work together with two powerful partners, MITI and MOF, in the preparation of the government economic forecast is a matter of considerable interest. After holding the posts of director of the Price Policy Division in MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau, Secretariat counselor in ANRE, chief of Personnel Division in the General Affairs Division of the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology [AIST], and after serving as head of the Planning Section in the Petroleum Department, he has been going back and forth between MITI and the EPA. He has held the positions of chief of the Planning Division in the EPA's Director General's Secretariat, director of the Planning Division in the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, councilor to the EPA's Price Bureau, director of MITI's Tokyo Bureau of International Trade and Industry, and director of MITI's Kanto Bureau of International Trade and Industy. After that, he was moved to EPA, where he served as a member of the policy board of the Bank of Japan, director general of the Research Bureau, and director general of the Price Bureau before he assumed his current position. He is from Tokyo Prefecture. MITI, which used to control the EPA, has had no vice ministerial appointee since 1986. However, Kobayashi is seen as the strongest candidate to fill this position next. We wonder whether next year will see the naming of an EPA administrative vice minister from MITI. The deputy director general of this bureau, Yoichi Okita (joined EPA in 1966; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department) is the eldest son of the late Saburo Okita, a former foreign minister. He had experience as director of the Price Research Division in the Price Bureau, director of the Overseas Research Division in the Research Bureau, and director of Research and Planning at the National Institute for Research Advancement (NIRA) before becoming director of the First Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau. In both 1990 and 1991, he wrote the "Economic White Paper." His father wrote the white paper four times, starting in 1948; therefore, this is the second generation on this line, Saburo and Yoichi, who have penned the "Economic White Paper." As expected, he has the reputation of having precise analytic ability. It will be interesting to see just how this will be used in the Coordination Bureau. After he served as head of the First Domestic Research Bureau, he was a councilor to the Director General's Secretariat in the National Land Agency and deputy director general of the Economic Research Institute before assuming his current position. The other councilor to the Coordination Bureau is Takafumi Kaneko (joined the EPA in 1968; a graduate of Yokohama National University Economics Department). He had experience in posts such as senior researcher in the Economic Research Institute, counselor at the Japanese Embassy in the United States, director of the First International Economic Affairs Division in the Coordination Bureau, and director of the Accounts and Budget Division in the Director General's Secretariat of EPA before assuming his current post. It is said that, when he was head of the Accounts and Budget Division, he had several fierce clashes with MOF officials during negotiations on the budget. He will be the person in charge of grievances regarding the market-opening problem, which affects all of the ministries and agencies, so there are high hopes being pinned on his ability to succeed in this position. The director of the Coordination Division, the first division listed on the organizational table of the Coordination Bureau, is Makoto Nomura (joined EPA in 1970; a graduate of Hitotsubashi University, Economics Department). He has had experience as a grievance officer on the market-opening problem in the Coordination Division of EPA's Coordination Bureau, head of the Price Control Office of the Price Bureau, director of planning in the National Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau, director of the Coordination Bureau's Second International Economics Affairs Division, director of the Research Planning Division at the NIRA, and director of the International Business Affairs Division of MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau before assuming his current position. General coordination of industrial policy is handled by the Industrial Affairs Division, which is headed by Yoshiaki Umemura (joined MITI in 1973; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law Department). He has served in positions such as the head of Energy Policy Planning Division in the Director General's Secretariat of ANRE before assuming his current position. Despite the fact that his successor in this position was from the EPA proper, it is customary for this post to be filled by someone from MITI. The irector of the First International Economic Affairs Division, which handles issues such as trade, the international balance of payments, and foreign exchange, is Yoichi Nakamura (joined EPA in 1973; a graduate of Tokyo Institute of Technology, Engineering Department). He has had experience as a senior researcher at NIRA, head of the National Expenditure Division of the National Income Department at the Economic Research Institute, and director of the Research Exchange Department at the Economic Research Institute before assuming his current position. The director of the Second International Economic Affairs Division is Haruhito Arai (joined EPA in 1975; a graduate of Tokyo University, Graduate School of Sciences). He has had experience in jobs such as deputy director of the Coordination Division of the Coordination Bureau, deputy director of the Economic Welfare Policy Division in the Economic Welfare Bureau, secretary to the minister, and researcher in the First Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau before assuming his current position. The director of the Finance Division, which is responsible for general coordination of finance policy, is Hiroshi Tsukada (joined MOF in 1972; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department). This post is successively manned by a person dispatched from MOF. He has served in posts such as cabinet counselor and director of the Research Division of the MOF's Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy before assuming his current position. The First Economic Cooperation Division is headed by Akira Sadahiro (joined EPA in 1971; a graduate of Waseda University, Political Economics Department and Osaka University, School of Economics). He has had experience in positions such as senior researcher at the Economic Research Institute, director of the Second Coordination Division at the OECF, director of the Research Exchange Division at the Economic Research Institute, and director of the Overseas Research Division in the Research Bureau before assuming his current position. The chief of Second Economic Cooperation Division is Susumu Sanbonmatsu (entered MITI in 1975; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department). He has had experience as the chief of the General Affairs Division of the General Planning Department of MITI's Kyushu Bureau of International Trade and Industry, head of the Planning Division of the Planning Department of JETRO, and head of the Data Processing Administration Division of MITI's Director General's Secretariat before assuming his current post. Economic Welfare Bureau The Economic Welfare Bureau, which is responsible for development of consumer affairs, is a very young bureau as it was founded in 1972. This bureau was established under the Ikeda administration, and its development was accelerated under the Sato administration. Its purpose was to correct the negative effects that the high rate of economic growth was having on people's lives. From the working out of a plan to change Japanese society from one that placed high importance on the producers of goods to one that emphasized, through the formation last year of the "Lifestyle Superpower Five-Year Plan," more importance has been placed on activities in this regard. Currently, it is studying product liability, the so-called powerful relief policy for consumers suffering from damage, legislate into law and therefore a decision on the product liability problem should be made by this fall. The director general of this bureau is Masashi Kato (joined EPA in 1962; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department). He is entering his fourth year as director general of this bureau. He was left in office because the product liability problem is coming to a climax. He has taken an elite course on his road to his current job, serving as director of the Overseas Research Division in the Research Bureau, director of the First Domestic Research Division in the same bureau, director of the Secretarial Division in the Director General's Secretariat, and councilor to the Research Bureau. He wrote the "Economic White Paper" three times during the last period (1985-1987) when there was a strong yen. His reputation as an economist is high, and just how he will coordinate and get consensus on the PL problem, on which there has not been a consensus within the government on how to introduce the measure, will continue to hold center stage for a while. He hails from Tokyo Prefecture. The councilor to this bureau is Takafusa Shioya (joined EPA in 1966; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law Department). He excels in his balanced view, based on his past experience. He was dispatched to both the Environment Agency (1971) and the National Land Agency (1974) when they were formed, and he has also served in the JETRO New York office and at MITI. He has served as councilor in the Director General's Secretariat, director of the Price Coordination Division of the Price Bureau, director of the Commerce Policy Division of MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau, director of the Coordination Division of EPA's Coordination Bureau, director of the Secretarial Division in the Director General's Secretariat, and councilor to the Research Bureau before assuming his current post. It is said that his ability to coordinate was manifested when, as director of the Coordination Division, he coordinated the tug of war between MITI and MOF regarding the formulation of the government economic forecast. It is hoped that this ability will again manifest itself as he coordinates the activities of the ministries in connection to the PL problem. The director of the Economic Welfare Bureau, the first division in the Economic Welfare Bureau's table of organization, is Masataka Hirano (joined EPA in 1969; a graduate of Tokyo Teachers College (now the University of Tsukuba) Graduate School of Sciences). He has had experience in positions such as councilor to the Director General's Secretariat, director of the Second Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau, and director of the First Consumer Affairs Division in the Economic Welfare Bureau before attaining his current position. His previous position was director of the First Consumer Affairs Division, a post which was responsible for the PL problem. Having been in that position, to bring together the entire bureau, he is expected to play an active role in the resolution of this problem. The director of the First Consumer Affairs Division, which is responsible for consumer protection and directly responsible for the PL problem, is Yuko Ishida (joined EPA in 1970; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department). He has held positions such as chief of the Research Division of the Economic Department of the Fair Trade Commission's Administrative Bureau, senior planning officer (responsible for prices) in the Planning Bureau, and director of the Planning and Coordination Division of the Environment Agency's Nature Conservation Bureau before assuming his current post. Yoshiaki Taguchi (joined the agency in 1974; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law Department) is director of the Second Consumer Affairs Division, which is responsible for things such as consumer groups. Leading up to his current position, he has held jobs such as researcher in the Coordination Bureau, and director of the Public Relations Office in the Director General's Secretariat's Planning Division. The director of the Economic Welfare Research Division, which is responsible for the "Economic Welfare White Paper," is Makoto Kondo (jointed EPA in 1972; a graduate of Kyoto University, Economics Department). He has held positions such as planner (responsible for weights and measures) in the Planning Bureau before assuming his current position. This fall, he will be challenged with the preparation of his first white paper, and now that hopes are being placed on change in society placing greater importance on the standard of living, we would like to see him lay out clearly the path that will be taken to build a "lifestyle superpower." Price Bureau This is the youngest bureau. It split away from the Economic Welfare Bureau, becoming independent in June 1973. Price stability is its greatest responsibility. Since the beginning of this year, the strengthening of the yen has continued, and there are growing demands from the public for a distribution of the marginal profits resulting from the high yen and for further rectification of the differences in prices at home and abroad. Opposition has been expressed by industries connected to the lowering of public utility prices, such as electricity fees, that would be brought about by the distribution of marginal profits from the high yen. MITI is also aware of this fact; therefore, in the future, this bureau's true worth as price watchmen will probably be called into question. The director general of the Price Bureau is Michisato Sakamoto (joined MOF in 1964; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law Department). After the last administrative vice minister, Shunji Fukinbara, left office, he was the only bureau director general from the MOF left at EPA. He joined EPA as councilor to the Planning Bureau. Just what kind of activity can we expect from him, being a future MOF candidate for the office of vice minister? The Price Bureau will be the starting point for the honing of his skills. He has had experience in positions such as director of the Mutual Assistance Insurance Division of MOF's Budget Bureau, director of the General Affairs Division in the Economy Bureau, Customs director at Yokohama, director of the Customs Division at the National Tax Administration Agency, director of Direct Taxe Department at the National Tax Administration Agency, and director of the Taxation Department at the National Tax Administration Agency before assuming his current position. He is from Tokyo Prefecture. This bureau has three councilors, of which one, Yoichi Takemoto, is also serving as councilor to the Planning Bureau. Therefore, we will introduce only two other councilors here. Councilor Masaru Yanagizawa (joined the EPA in 1967; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department) went from being director of the First International Economic Affairs Division in the Coordination Bureau to an elite temporary assignment as director of the Planning Division in the National Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau. After that he served as councilor to the Coordination Bureau before assuming his current position. As councilor to the Coordination Bureau, he was responsible for preparation of the new midterm goal for official development assistance (ODA) and grievance policy for the market-opening problem, which affects plus and minuses for the various ministries and agencies. Of the other councilors, Tsugio Ide (joined MITI in 1967; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department), has been dispatched from MITI. There are few people who can correctly read the Chinese characters that make up his name. They are read "Tsugio." He has held posts such as first secretary in the Japanese Mission (Paris) to the OECD, director of the Research Division of the Industrial Policy Bureau, director of the General Affairs Division of the Basic Industries Bureau, and director of the Small Enterprise Department in the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency before assuming his current post. In the EPA, he has served as director of the Policy Division in the Director General's Secretariat. He is the second son of the former chief of the Director General's Secretariat, Ichitaro Ide. The director of the Price Policy Division, the first organizational division in the bureau which is responsible for general coordination of price policy, is Hideaki Yamakawa (joined the agency in 1969; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department). He has served in positions such as senior planning officer (responsible for prices) in the Planning Bureau, director of the Price Research Division in the Price Bureau, and director of the Director General's Secretariat Information Systems Division before assuming his current post. This position has historically been held by a person dispatched from MOF, but starting with Yamakawa's predecessor, this position has been given to someone from the agency proper. It is said that people from the agency proper are getting first crack at being named as division directors because the agency has developed as an organization. The very busy director of the Price Coordination Division, which is responsible for reform of the public utility charges for things such as gas, electricity, and telephone, is Jun Hamano (joined the agency in 1974; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department). He has served in positions such as head of the Economic Structural Coordination Promotion Office in the Planning Bureau and counselor to the Director General's Secretariat before assuming his current post. His activities in his current post, which is the position most focused on the problem of the distribution of the public utilities marginal profits derived from the high yen, are greatly anticipated. The director of the Price Research Division, which is responsible for performing research on prices, is Nobuhiko Kosuge (joined EPA in 1970; a graduate of Tokyo University, Engineering Department). He has served in positions such as senior researcher at the Economic Research Institute and eputy senior researcher at the Middle East Economic Research Institute before assuming his current position. Planning Bureau While the Coordination Bureau is responsible for short-term economic measures, the Planning Bureau is responsible for midterm economic plans. Because they just completed the "Lifestyle Superpower Five-Year Plan" in June 1992, which was the government's new midterm economic plan, they have no major projects in the offing; however, they are forming study committees to look at the theme of follow-up to the "Lifestyle Superpower Five-Year Plan." Along with carrying out the execution of this effort, they are also recharging their batteries in preparation for their next major effort. The director general of this bureau is Atsushi Yoshikawa (joined the agency in 1962; a graduate of Osaka University, Economics Depertment). He has held positions such as director of the International Division of the Environment Agency's Director General's Secretariat, director of the First International Economic Affairs Division in EPA's Coordination Bureau, director of the Coordination Division in the same bureau, councilor to the Coordination Bureau, and director of the Economic Research Institute before assuming his current position. In 1978, as an assistant to Nobuhiko Ushiba, the minister responsible for foreign economic affairs, he had to grapple with formulation of the market-opening policy and brought together several policy measures during the period of high yen following the 1985 Plaza Accord. He is from Nara Prefecture. The councilor to this bureau is Koichi Tani (joined EPA in 1965; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department). On the way to his current position, he has held posts such as director of the First International Economics Affairs Division in the Coordination Bureau, director of the Coordination Division in the same bureau, director general of the MOF's Hokuriku Financial Affairs Bureau, councilor to the Coordination Bureau, and councilor to the Price Bureau. His trademark is his splendid beard. The other councilor is Yoichi Takemoto (joined the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] in 1966; a graduate of Kagoshima University, Agriculture Department). He has been dispatched to the EPA from the MAFF. He has held posts such as counselor in the Director General's Secretariat, director of the Groceries, Oils, and Fats Division of the Foods and Marketing Bureau, and director of the Director General's Secretariat Research Division before assuming his current position. The only director of the first organizational division in this bureau, Shoji Takahashi (joined the MOF in 1970; a graduate of Hitotsubashi University, Economics Department). He has served in positions such as director of the Secretariat Planning Division in the Fair Trade Commission's Administration Bureau, director of the National Treasury Division of the Finance Bureau, and director of the Special Investigation Division of the Administration Bureau of the Security Exchange Oversight Committee before assuming his current post. The post of director of the Planning Division is always given to someone dispatched from the MOF, and this post has become the beachhead for the MOF to have its views reflected in the formulation of the government midterm economic plans. The Planning Division is the only organization in the bureau with the title of division, but the bureau also includes 10 divisional director-level senior planning officers, who are responsible for, international economic affairs; general industry; agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; labor and human resources; finance; social infrastructure;, national life; regional economics; prices; and weights and measures; and one senior officer for Electric Power Development Planning. Each of these officers has considerable staff under them. Research Bureau The Research Bureau is responsible for carrying out various research projects, including the "Economic White Paper," which is published once each year, the "Monthly Economic Report," which is published monthly and contains the government's views on business conditions, and the "International Economic White Paper," which is published annually. This is the bureau in the EPA which is most well known outside of the agency, and it is also the bureau which is the EPA's billboard. The bureau's director general, Seiichi Toshida (joined the agency in 1964; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department), is a government economist in the international school, who has written and translated works such as Reaganomics, and The President's Economics. He has gone through an elite course of positions, including minister's secretary, counselor at the embassy in Washington, director of the First International Economic Affairs Division in the Coordination Bureau, director of the First Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau, director of the Secretarial Division in the Director General's Secretariat, and councilor to the Coordination Bureau. He was the first in the 1964 group to achieve the rank of bureau director general. The fact that, as the director of the First Domestic Research Division, he twice penned the "Economic White Paper" testifies that he is a strong economist with regard to the domestic economy as well. He has also showed his ability as an administrator, and it is said that he is a future candidate for the position of vice minister. He is from Kanagawa Prefecture. The councilor is Yasuko Niimura (joined EPA in 1967; a graduate of International Christian University, Liberal Arts Department). Following an official of EPA Eiko Kawana, currently the senior researcher at the Tokyu General Research Institute, who once served as councilor to the Economic Research Institute, Niimura is the second female councilor to hold a position in the EPA. She has held positions such as senior researcher at the Economic Research Institute, director of the Second Domestic Research Division in the Research Bureau, director of the Social Policy Research Division in the Social Policy Bureau, and director of the Social Policy Division of the same bureau before assuming her current post. As director of the Social Policy Research Division, she wrote the "social policy white paper" three times. She incorporated a unique point of view into the question of "social policy," and her papers stimulated discussions on various matters. Her activities as councilor to the Research Bureau are eagerly anticipated. The director of the Research Bureau's first organizational division, the First Domestic Research Division, which is responsible for the "economic white paper," is Takao Komine (joined the agency in 1969;a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department). He has held posts such as head of the Research Division of the Economic Department of the Fair Trade Commission's Administrative Bureau, director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Coordination Bureau, and cabinet counselor before assuming his current position. He has a good reputation as an economist with many books to his credit, including Change in the Structure of the Japanese Economy, the English translation of which was published in an authoritative U.S. academic magazine. He is endeavoring to make the wording of the "Monthly Economic Report," which is said to be difficult to comprehend, more easy to understand. If one reads this year's "white paper" it can be understood that he makes the point of his argument very clear. The First Domestic Research Division (formerly called the Domestic Research Division, and the Research Division) is called "the government economist's jewel" and it has turned out a large number of talented personnel. These include the late Former Foreign Minister Saburo Okita and the late Yonosuke Goto, who is the all time record holder having penned six "white papers," including the 1956 edition which is known by the name, "It's No Longer the Post-War Era." The list goes on and on, including Hisao Kanamori, chairman of the Japan Economic Research Center, Isamu Miyazaki, director of Daiwa Research, the late Takao Sasaki, the former director of the Joint Research Institute for Life Development, Takeo Takahashi, director of the same, Takao Akabane, Keio University professor, and Yasuo Katsumura, the former vice minister. The director of the Second Domestic Research Division, which is responsible for analyzing trends by region and by industrial sector, is Kaoru Yoshikawa (entered the agency in 1972; a graduate of Kyoto University, Economics Department). He has held positions such as researcher in the Research Bureau, head of the National Economic Calculation Research Office in the National Income Department in the Economic Research Institute, and senior researcher at the Joint Research Institute for Life Development before assuming his current position. The director of the Overseas Economic Research Division, which is responsible for researching and analyzing the trends in overseas economics and for the "International Economic White Paper," is Minoru Ikeda (joined the agency in 1971; a graduate of Tokyo University, Law Department). He has held positions such as secretary to the director general, senior researcher in the Economic Research Institute, director of the Second Consumer Affairs Division in the Social Policy Bureau, and director of the First International Economic Affairs Division in the Coordination Bureau before attaining his current post. The director of the Business Statistics Research Division, which is responsible for researching and analyzing business statistic trends, such as the business condition trend index number (DI [diffusion index]), is Yoshiro Tokunaga (joined EPA in 1969; a graduate of Osaka University, Economics Department). He has served in positions such as director of the Price Research Division in the Price Bureau, director of the Overseas Research Division in the Research Bureau, and senior researcher in the Economic Research Institute before assuming his current job. Economic Research Institute The Economic Research Institute performs basic, general research into areas such as basic economic structure and cycle, national income and national wealth, and other aspects of the economy.. It is divided into the Researcher Office and the Department of National Accounts, and the Research Exchange Office, which was newly established in 1990. In the Research Office, there are three supervisory researchers, eight or fewer senior researchers, and a few guest researchers. Famous University professors are invited to become guest researchers, and in this way, effort is put into exchanges with the academic sector. Just recently, the major economics-related ministries and agency have founded associated research institutes, namely the MOF's Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, MITI's Research Institute of International and Trade, and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] Research Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, to build up the arsenals of theory needed for the execution of policy. However, the EPA's Economic Research Institute was a pioneer for all of these institutes. The director general of the Institute is Isoroku Sawada (joined EPA in 1965; a graduate of Tokyo University, Mathematics and Physics Department). He has served as director of the Electronic Data Processing Division in the Director General's Secretariat, supervisory researcher in the Economic Research Institute, councilor to the Research Bureau, and councilor to the Coordination Bureau before assuming his current position. He hails from Kochi Prefecture. The deputy director general is Yoichi Kojima (joined the agency in 1967; a graduate of Tokyo University, Education Department). He has served in positions such as director of the Overseas Research Division of the Research Bureau, director of the First Economic Cooperation Division in the Coordination Bureau, and supervisory researcher in the Economic Research Institute before assuming his current post. When he was serving as the supervisory researcher, as part of government's technical cooperation with Romania, where he was dispatched for three months, he gave advice regarding the conversion of the Romanian system to a market-based economy. In recognition for this service, he was given a plate of thanks from the Romanian Government. The director of the Administrative Division, Hiroshi Nakatsugawa (joined the MPT in 1956; a graduate of Ryokoku High School), has served in positions such as Director General's Secretariat Diet Communications Coordination officer, and as head of the EPA's branch of the National Diet Library on his way to assuming his current post. Supervisory Researcher Masahiro Ikegami (joined EPA in 1968; a graduate of Waseda University, Business Department) served in positions such as head of the Price Control Office in the Price Bureau and as senior planning officer in the Metropolitan Infrastructure Bureau of the National Land Agency before assuming his current position. Supervisory Researcher Masaru Eto (joined EPA in 1971; a graduate of Kyushu University, Law Department) has served in roles such as senior lanning officer (responsible for prices) in the Planning Bureau before assuming his current post. The director of the Research Exchange Division, an organization responsible for things such as the exchange of researchers with foreign research organizations, is Nobuki Sugita (joined EPA in 1977; a graduate of Tokyo University, Mathematics and Physics Department). He has held positions such as deputy director of the General Affairs Division of the National Land Agency's Regional Promotion Bureau and as a senior exchange researcher at the Economic Research Institute before assuming his current position. The director of the Department of National Accounts, which is responsible for calculating the GNP, is Yoshikuni Kobayashi (joined EPA in 1968; a graduate of Tokyo University, Engineering Department). He has served as a senior planning officer in the Planning and Coordination Bureau of the National Land Agency, chief researcher at the Japan General Research Institute, and director of the Electronic Data Processing Division in the Director General's Secretariat before assuming his current post. Genjiro Watanabe (joined the MAFF in 1964; Chuo University, Law Department), director of the National Expenditure Division served in positions such as head of the Production Division of the Economic Research Institute's Department of National Accounts before assuming his current position. Besides the above-listed persons serving in positions within the EPA, there are also EPA personnel serving in other ministries and agencies. First, there is Shinpei Nukaya (joined the agency in 1963; a graduate of Tokyo University, Liberal Arts Department), who is serving as director general of the National Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau. The Planning and Coordination Bureau used to be the EPA's General Development Bureau, but it was incorporated into the National Land Agency in a reorganization. Therefore, the director general of this bureau is always someone dispatched from EPA. Nukaya has served in jobs such as director of the Price Coordination Division in the Price Bureau, director of the Planning Division in the National Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau, director of the Coordination Division of the EPA's Coordination Bureau, director of the EPA's Secretarial Division, and councilor to the Planning Bureau before assuming his current post. His activities once he returns to the EPA are greatly anticipated. Eiji Kawade (joined EPA in 1976; a graduate of Kyoto University, Economics Department), is currently serving as councilor to the National Land Agency's Regional Promotion Bureau. He has previously served as director of the EPA's Secretarial Division before assuming his current post. There are other officials from the EPA who are serving in other ministries and agency who are said to be superb personnel, including Ichiro Shirakawa (joined EPA in 1968; a graduate of Keio University, Graduate School of Economics), who is serving as director of the Administrative Division in MITI's Small and Medium Enterprises Agency; Shunichiro Ushijima (joined EPA in 1971; a graduate of Tokyo University, Economics Department), who is serving as director of the Planning Division of the National Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau; Satoshi Kawamoto (joined the agency in 1971; a graduate of Tokyo University, Engineering Department), who is serving as director of the Planning Division of the National Land Agency's Metropolitan Areas Development Bureau, and Takashige Komoda (joined EPA in 1972; a graduate of Tokyo Institute of Technology, Economics Department), who is serving as a cabinet councilor in the cabinet's Foreign Policy Councilors Office. The EPA, in which the influence of MOF and MITI had been strong, has begun to become a powerful organization and is becoming more independent. This trend can be seen in the area of personnel assignments as well. In these times, when the one-party rule of the LDP has been broken and the various parties, including the Japan New Party, are raising the banner of the importance of standard of living, the role of the EPA, which coordinates the government's economic policy, has become even more important. What is required of them is to respond adequately to the changing political situation and to develop policies aimed at the realization of an abundant standard of living for the people of Japan. Although the EPA will probably be buffeted by the raging waves of the power politics of Kasumigaseki, we would like to hope that it will show its power as the government's coordinating agency, standing firmly above the popular criticisms.
