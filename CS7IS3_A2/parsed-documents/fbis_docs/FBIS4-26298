The talks, scheduled to begin on Tuesday [21 June] within the framework of the joint Russian-U.S. Commission known as the Chernomyrdin-Gore Commission, will also focus on major U.S. investments in Russia. Before leaving for Washington on Sunday night, Davydov told reporters that in 1993, the two countries' trade turnover increased by 1.2 times from 1,992 to 4.3 billion U.S. dollars. Russia's exports increased considerably, trebling from the 1992 figure to 1,997 million dollars last year, while its imports diminished from 2883.7 million dollars in the same year to 2303.7 million dollars in 1993. This enabled the two nations to reduce the traditional deficit in mutual turnover to a minimum, the minister pointed out. He said that statistics for the first quarter of this year make it possible to conclude that this positive trend in the development of trade between Russia and the United States will continue in 1994. The achievement of an approximate parity in trade between the two countries was largely due to the sharp cut in grain purchases, which earlier accounted for at least one half of all Russian imports from the United States, Davydov said. As to the remaining obstacles in bilateral trade relations, he stated that they include the low competitiveness of many Russian goods, the barriers to exports of high-tech goods from the United States and the severe anti-dumping legislation. Investment cooperation is playing an increasingly important role in economic interaction between the two countries, according to the Russian minister. U.S. firms are in the lead among Western investors seeking to set up joint ventures in Russia. The Russian official said that there are 1,400 joint ventures in the country with U.S. capital investment, reaching nearly 400 million U.S. dollars.
