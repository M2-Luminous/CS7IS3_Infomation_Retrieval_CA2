Success Is Expected if Movement Toward Settlement Proceeds in Two Parallel Courses"] [Excerpts] The NATO ultimatum seems to have once again demonstrated its effectiveness as a peacekeeping tool. Yesterday, the Bosnian Serbs continued the pullout of heavy arms from Gorazde. Although Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev remarked yesterday that these actions were at least one week late, one still should not underestimate the importance of this fact. [passage omitted] In regard to Vitaliy Churkin's words heard in the Sunday television program "Itogi," Kozyrev said that the constant rotation of Russian ambassadors is a style normal for the Foreign Ministry's work, but Churkin has yet to work on settling the Yugoslav crisis. The threat of new NATO strikes against Bosnian Serb positions still remains. At the same time, the current diplomatic activity by the world community leaders opens ways for the resumption of the interrupted negotiating process.
