Kravchuk told the news conference they consider the official Ukrainian visit of the Turkish president to be an important step in the development of bilateral relations and a significant event with a positive influence on the whole Black Sea region. Ukraine attaches great importance to its relations with the Turkish Republic and is striving to build bilateral relations on the basis of principles of mutual respect, equality and good-neighbourliness. The political guideline for the two states is the treaty on friendship and cooperation signed at a summit meeting in 1992, said the Ukrainian president. The recent meetings and negotiations held with participation of Ukrainian and Turkish high-ranking officials focused on deepening of the bilateral relations, primarily in the economic sphere. Both sides noted that the goods turnover has considerably increased over the past years. At the same time, it does not correspond to the Ukrainian and Turkish abilities and needs. Cooperation with the Turkish Republic is a Ukrainian priority, said Kravchuk. Ukraine is interested in the Turkish experience of democratic transformations and building of a market economy. The Ukrainian president stressed that the meetings discussed a broad range of international issues, including the state and prospects for Black Sea economic cooperation and ways to settle conflicts in the Balkans and the Transcaucasia. The sides noted that consolidation of stability and security in the Black Sea region corresponds to their national interests, regional and European interests, and agreed to coordinate efforts in creation of an atmosphere of confidence and cooperation in the region. Mutual striving for expanded cooperation is registered in the joint communique and other documents signed during the official Ukrainian visit of the Turkish president. Kravchuk expressed the assurance the visit will give a fresh impetus to the relations of Ukraine and Turkey. In his turn, the Turkish president said that the republic attaches major importance to its relations with Ukraine, bearing in mind the two states are the largest ones in the region. They feel responsible for peace and friendship in the region, he said. Turkey also attaches great importance to the preservation of Ukrainian territorial integrity and peace within the framework of the United Nations and CSCE. Proclamation of Ukrainian independence has boosted the development of Ukrainian-Turkish relations, he said. The president is sure that his visit will boost cooperation. The Ukrainian-Turkish goods turnover exceeds 500 million U.S. dollars, and they hope to make it one billion. Ukrainian and Turkish businessmen are forming a cooperation union and have started to look for new ways in economy and trade. The president is convinced that new possibilities for the expansion of mutually beneficial relations will be created. The presidents answered numerous questions of correspondents.
