In an interview to AIR correspondent Sebastian Roberts in the Spotlight Program last night, the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, said bilateral discussion is the only way to solve the problem, but Islamabad cannot expect that India should concede all its demands. He made it clear that New Delhi will do everything possible for the resumption of bilateral discussions. Replying to a question, Mr. Salman Khurshid said the withdrawal of Pakistan's resolution in Geneva was unconditional and there is no question of its postponement to the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission. The minister said there is no confusion, as the chairman himself made this clear at the Geneva meeting.
