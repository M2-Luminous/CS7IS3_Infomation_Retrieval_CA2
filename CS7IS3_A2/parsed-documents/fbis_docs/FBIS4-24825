The measures provide that all documents on land and construction projects approved ultra vires or through the abuse of power are invalid, that all approved documents and blueprints for such projects which have yet to begin must be withdrawn for cancellation, that all such projects under development must be immediately stopped and given the maximum fine by the relevant departments in accordance with laws and regulations, and that all units which have undertaken to design or develop such illegal projects will be ordered to stop designing and development and will have their professional grade lowered or their professional licenses canceled. If a unit stubbornly develops an illegal project to make it an accomplished fact, the authorities in charge of the land will not recognize its property rights and must not allow it to be bought or sold, inherited, given as a present, rented out, transferred, or mortgaged; the notary office will not notarize it; the water supply company will not supply water to it; the electricity supply company will not supply electricity to it; the police station will not allow it to be occupied; post and telecommunications departments will not offer postal services or telecommunications service to it; the industrial and commercial department will not issue a business license to it; and the fire service, environmental protection, and public health and quarantine departments will not grant it professional recognition. Relevant persons said: According to earlier surveys, it was discovered that in the districts of Baiyun, Huangpu, and Fangcun in the suburbs of Guangzhou, foreign businessmen have been deceived. They had invested hastily in projects and built standard plants or apartments without obtaining valid documents. Their projects were eventually found to be illegal through inspection, and they were fined and ordered to cancel development and planning for their projects. Moreover, relevant persons reminded people that they should be cautious about exaggerated advertisements in newspapers and on the radio and said that if the property had no legal documentation or documents were lacking, consumers would always fall victim.
