Unless Kanther lists the Republikaner as right-wing extremist party in the next Office for the Protection of the Constitution report, he will work directly into the hands of the enemies of democracy, Eichel said in Wiesbaden on Friday [8 April]. In Eichel's view, there is sufficient evidence of Republikaner members participating in violent acts against foreigners. [passage omitted]
