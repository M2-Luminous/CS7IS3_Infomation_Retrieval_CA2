According to the military assistant, Department of Defense, Captain Amadu Koromah, the first rebel attack was launched on Mandoworo, northwest of Pendembu by some 200 rebels who were repelled by government troops after a four and a half hour battle. Initial reports put rebel losses at five dead but the final figure will be higher as a mopping up operation is now under way. A combined force of National Patriotic Front of Liberia, NPFL, and RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels also launched a heavy attack on Jene, east of Pendembu. Reinforcements have been sent to the area, SLENA [SIERRA LEONE NEWS AGENCY] reports. In another related development, rebels again launched another fierce attack on Joru, 18 miles from Kenema, on Sunday [2 January]. Joru is the headquarter town Guala, Mende chiefdom. According to government information services, the rebels bypassed (Bari Serabu), 2 1/2 miles to Joru, following government troops' defensive posture. Military sources say the battle at Joru was the heaviest since the rebel incursion in that area. The rebels were, however, repelled but passed through Gboyama village where they are believed to have set fire on several houses.
