Entrepreneurs are more optimistic in their forecasts for 1994 for both production and sales, while their export expectations are even greater. Following the remarkable pessimistic forecast in June and slightly more favourable one in September, the December forecast for 1994 showed that the number of entrepreneurs expecting an increase in production has risen by 30 per cent, while those who are optimistic about sales outnumber those who are pessimistic by 32 percent. The greatest modification in expectations is expected in the area of production and sales opportunities -- in the third quarter of 1993 the number of those who expected a decrease in production was seven percent higher than the number of those who forecast growth, and the number of optimistic forecasts for sales was 15 percent lower. Over One Third of Respondents Believe 1994 Will Be Better Year Results of the Stik survey, a public opinion poll carried out by DELO, show that almost one third of those polled expected 1944 to be worse than 1993, 36.7 percent believe 1994 will be better, and 37.3 percent would be satisfied if 1994 turns out to be the same as 1993. A greater number of respondents expect that the economic situation in Slovenia in 1994 will deteriorate rather than improve. As few as 26.8 percent of those polled expect the situation to remain the same in 1994. The poll was carried out from 21 to 22 December and included 1,177 people. Better Expectations for 1994 As many as 39.9 percent of Slovenians believe life will be better in 1994, 24.4 percent maintain it will be the same as this year, and 28.2 percent expect it to be worse, the SPEM marketing research company reported in a poll which included 387 respondents. The most vital part of the population, in particular men between 30 and 54 years of age, believe that Slovenians will lead a better life in 1994 than in the current year. Optimism Gaining Ground Almost one half of the direcors of medium-sized and large companies included in a poll carried out by the Gral agency and published in the GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK weekly said that sales on the domestic market would remain unchanged. A strong third of the directors expect the sales to increase, while only as few as one tenth of those polled expect that their companies will sell less on the domestic market in 1994 than in the currrent year. According to the same poll, a brighter atmosphere is prevailing among Slovenian exporters. Almost six tenths of those included in the poll are hoping their exports will increase in 1994, while only one tenth of them expect that their sales on foreign markets will fall. The expectations of the directors included in the poll about their business standing are very high, since only two out of one hundred directors interviewed expect that the current situation will deteriorate in 1994.
