FR940414-0-00088 FR940414-0-00031 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 040594C] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish, other than demersal shelf rockfish (DSR) in the Southeast Outside district, by vessels using hook-and-line gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the second seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific halibut apportioned to hook-and-line gear in the GOA. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), May 28, 1994, through 12 noon, A.l.t., August 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Fishery Biologist, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the FMP prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. In accordance with §672.20(f)(2), the 1994 Pacific halibut prohibited species catch limit for hook-and-line gear for groundfish fisheries, other than DSR in the Southeast Outside district, in the GOA was established by the final 1994 groundfish specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 740 metric tons (mt). NMFS apportioned 500 mt to the second season, the period May 18 through August 31, 1994. Due to the short duration of the hook-and-line sablefish fishery, observer data will not be available in time to monitor bycatch during the second season of the 1994 Pacific halibut prohibited species catch limit for hook-and-line gear for groundfish fisheries. Therefore, based on the 1993 bycatch rates, the Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with §672.20(f)(1)(ii)(A), that operators of vessels engaged in directed fishing for groundfish, other than DSR in the Southeast Outside district, with hook-and-line gear in the GOA will reach the second seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific halibut by May 28, 1994. NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish, other than DSR in the Southeast Outside district, by vessels using hook-and-line gear in the GOA from 12 noon, A.l.t., May 28, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., August 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at §672.20(g). Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20.
