This is not only demonstrated by the government's acceptance of the so-called Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), which is a formula imposed by multilateral organizations, but also by the acceptance to reduce the state payroll by dismissing 13,500 employees and appointing supervisors in the programs of tax administration and public investment. As part of the measures to be implemented in the so-called Macroeconomic and Structural Adjustment Policy, the government is calling for a series of measures that will affect not only thousands of public employees but the entire population. Voluntary Mobility Program In terms of fiscal policy, the government is determined to reduce the size of the public sector by firing, through the so-called "voluntary mobility program," 7,000 employees in 1994, 5,000 in 1995, and 13,500 in 1996. This decision in reality will only affect sectors where state jobs will be "voluntarily guided." The ensuing effects of this decision will fall, however, also on the families of the dismissed state workers, businesses that will see their sales reduced, and even maids, who will lose their jobs after their employers get fired. Although there are very few exemptions on indirect taxes, the government is determined to eliminate such exemptions, while adopting a mechanism to increase the price of fuel monthly in relation to the U.S. dollar. Fuel Indexed and 6 Percent Eliminated The decision to index the price of fuel to the U.S. dollar will result in an immediate increase in the price of consumer products as well as in the price of raw materials and tools as a result of higher monthly costs in transportation. In addition, the price of energy will gradually increase. The ESAF also establishes fees for such services as health and education as well as elimination of the law earmarking 6 percent of the national budget for national universities. This may have serious repercussions on the training of personnel the country needs for its development. Customs and Revenues Under the IMF A very serious aspect of the ESAF is that the government is willing to place under IMF supervision both the tax administration program and the revision of the Public Investment Program with the World Bank before the country's spending plan is presented. With that decision and the meddling of the two multilateral world organizations, the government will in turn lose its ability to freely decide on its annual budget for revenue and expenditures. No Small- and Medium-Sized Production In another of its recommendations, the ESAF proposes to keep the financial sector free from guided credit policies. This decision will deflate the hopes of small- and medium-sized producers of access to special credit to implement development programs. With regard to the Banades and Banic banks, a continued restructuring and reduction of operating expenses is envisioned, which has normally translated into a reduction of employees. In addition, capitalization of these state-owned financial entities is rejected. ESAF Eliminates Restrictions on Payments Abroad In this aspect, which shows the IMF's true nature as a debt collector, the organization is proposing the elimination of all restrictions on payments for current international transactions and is calling for a reduction in importation taxes. A positive aspect of the ESAF is that it creates a mechanism to encourage exports. One aspect of macroeconomic policy is a draft bill to privatize Telcor [Nicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute] by using indemnity bonuses. It also recommends the liquidation or sale of 38 businesses still remaining at Cornap [National Corporations of the Public Sector], among which are mining and energy companies. It also calls for the "restructuring of ports." As part of this point, the ESAF also deprives the government of its ability to control or interfere in market prices at any given moment. Some of the few positive aspects include the proposed administrative and legal framework to consolidate rights with regard to agrarian property and the preparation of environmental regulations. 6 Percent for Universities in Danger Regarding education, the ESAF proposes giving priority to elementary school education, reducing subsidies on high school and higher education. This will in fact result in a possible reduction in student enrollments at state-owned high schools or universities. This last proposal is linked to the project to eliminate the law which gives 6 percent of the budget to state-owned universities, for which the student movement fought so hard. Although this has not come true yet, there is a danger of eliminating this right. Finally, in one of the most dangerous decisions for workers, behind the decision to revise the Labor Code to facilitate the functioning of the labor market lies the possibility that private sector or state employees may be dismissed at any minute, and temporary job contracts will prevail.
