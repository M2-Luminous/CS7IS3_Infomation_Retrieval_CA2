Troitskiy, Armavir administration chief, by Irina Goryunova, Armavir-Moscow: "G. Troitskiy: There Must Be Just One Authority: Responsibly Executive"] [Text] Georgiy Konstantinovich Troitskiy is in love with his work and with his city. This is obvious immediately, after one hour's acquaintance. The Armavir administration chief, chairman of the Association of Administration Chiefs of East Kuban, champion of Russia, and captain of the Russian combined team for all-round sports loves to walk, is an excellent dancer, and can talk very interestingly about former Politburo members with whom he worked and about someone else from his hometown, the former USSR President... But today the thing that excites him more than anything else in the world is life in Armavir, this particle of Kuban, particle of the Caucasus, and particle of our common Homeland, a city that is ethnically diverse, filled with springtime beauty, and rich in good people and fertile land. [Goryunova] Georgiy Konstantinovich, your biography, your ties with our country's prominent figures, your successes in the management field, and a number of high positions have not prevented from returning once again to the city where your career began. Why? [Troitskiy] The bulk of my activity has been linked with Armavir. I began here. For about five years I was the deputy chairman of an executive committee. Here in Armavir I became a deputy to the city and kray soviet. For nine years I worked as the chairman of the city soviet. That experience and that baggage have been extremely helpful for me in my current work. In addition, experience that proved to be beneficial for me was my work in Stavropol Kray, and later in Rostov, where I worked closely with Mingasprom [Ministry of the Gas Industry], which was administered by Chernomyrdin, who was the customer for my main administration. So more than two years ago I decided to return to my city. [Goryunova] For many years you worked in the system of an authority that is now called an administrative-fiat system. Although you were always closely linked with the economy, the gas industry, and construction. Today you are working in the system of another authority. Do you make comparisons frequently, and to whose advantage are those comparisons? [Troitskiy] Every authority has its negative and positive sides. Practically every authority is not to people's liking sometimes. And a person who is on his wa to power must take that into consideration in his practice. During the days before perestroyka things were easier on the job. For many reasons. Including the fact that there was discipline. It used to be possible to resolve many questions more quickly. But the negative aspects of party leadership, and in particular the equalization policy and the lack of talent among many leaders, immediately manifested themselves in the collapse of the CPSU. The system of allocations by fiat precluded not only creativity, but also taught people how to live with ready-make decisions. The individual's sense of being a property owner was completely destroyed. For example, I repeatedly asked the party agencies the question: why, while protecting merchants' homes as monuments of urban construction, did you categorically ban the construction even of buildings with one and a half stories? The city was filled with sheds and hovels. Today we are having to live with much of our past inheritance. I am alarmed by the lack of a mechanism for interrelationships between the authority and the enterprises. The executive authority today senses this problem in an especially acute way. A number of laws also are not particularly gratifying. For example, the law that has already been enacted by the old Supreme Soviet, to the effect that only the first person has the right to apply his signature. This not only puts an additional workload on me, but also deprives my deputies of their responsibility and initiative. [Goryunova] Armavir is an ethnically diverse city. Under the conditions of the current aggravation of the ethnic conflicts and taking into consideration the especially complicated situation in the Caucasus, how are you coping with the problems that arise? [Troitskiy] People of 79 nationalities live in our city. Of them, 15 percent are Armenians, more than half of whom are old indigenous residents. The general directedness in their life and the language that they use are Russian. The segment of the Armenian population that is in conflict and that emigrated to our area from Abkhazia, Azerbaijan, and Nagornyy Karabakh, is actually creating the difficulties. Although, for the time being, the situation is being regulated. The Krasnodar Kray leadership is taking strict measures and is monitoring the registration process strictly. I grew up in the Caucasus. I have worked in Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. I survived the Armenian earthquake and participated in the restoration of the republic. I know this region very well. And I also know that there are no poor nationalities. There are only poor people. That has always been my position. [Goryunova] What is the political role of the Cossack population in your region? [Troitskiy] The Labinskiy section was created in Armavir as long ago as the tsarist days. It includes representatives of the Cossack population from six or seven areas, including Stavropol and Karachayevo-Cherkessia. So one can say that we have a Cossack center. The Cossacks have sufficient authority. When they operate within the confines of legislation, the administration helps and supports them. But it also happens that they operate from a position of strength and attempt to force their decisions and ideas on people. Inasmuch as the Cossacks are an emotional people, disputes occur, and they are not simple ones. Their program openly proclaims a fight for power: within a two-year period, the changing over to ataman rule. [Goryunova] As the administration chief, are you opposed to this? [Troitskiy] If this is done by election, in the legislative, parliamentary way, they have my blessing. But they are attempting to operate from a position of strength. And that is a violation of legislation. [Goryunova] Can you give any examples? [Troitskiy] One does not have to go far. A sovkhoz hires workers of various nationalities. The people are working on a long-term basis, and working conscientiously. A Cossack raid is carried out, and they are driven out. This is interference in the economic activity of the sovkhoz, the inflicting of psychological, economic, and political damage. I have repeatedly said that you cannot establish power with a lash. Everyone does not like a lash. It is possible to seize power. Power is not a joy. So making life better for people, while being in power, is a task that is a bit more complicated. [Goryunova] Judged on the basis of economic importance, your city is the second one in Krasnodar Kray. Everyone realizes that the recession throughout the country has also affected you. How are you combatting this situation? [Troitskiy] We are all tied up into the same bundle. In my opinion, nobody won from the destruction of the Union. And that includes our city. Nevertheless, whereas in 1992 the recession for Russia as a whole and for Krasnodar Kray was approximately 20 percent, in our city it was 4-5 percent lower, and the same situation prevailed in 1993. This is linked with the fact that Armavir is surrounded by large-scale agricultural areas. The peasants spend less time at rallies. They do not have time for them. The cow wants something to eat, and the land needs care. Therefore the peasants still work the way they used to. We have a considerable branch for processing agricultural produce. We have one of the largest meat-packing plants in Russia, and a large oil and fats combine. These branches were practically untouched by the recession. But the metal-processing industry really was hit badly. Such large-scale associations as Tochmashpribor and Elektrotekhnicheskiy Zavod today have a production slump of more than 50 percent. Of course, the thing that largely saves us is the fact that Armavir is one of a few cities in Russia that have their own land totaling more than 200,000 hectares. [Goryunova] Is the privatization of the land in progress? [Troitskiy] We are not speeding up this process. It is a pity that even today, as used to be the case in previous times, much is being done by the fiat method. Including privatization. In a few places people want to be privatized, and in a few places they do not want to be. Certain people want to work the way that they used to. So the sovkhozes have been practically preserved. It is simply that now they are called associations. Nevertheless we already have 47 individually owned farms. Every city dweller has either a vegetable garden, or a plot where he lives, and some people have two or three each. Approximately 10-12 hundredths per resident. For purposes of comparison: in the Netherlands, it is 3 hundredths per capita. Moreover, half is for export. That is the low effectiveness of land use that we have. [Goryunova] You have worked in various branches of authority --representative and executive. What is your attitude toward the present system of authority? What do you think is hindering its normal functioning? [Troitskiy] I am absolutely convinced that there should be no representative authority. What we need is a legislative agency. My entire vast experience proves this. The authority must be responsibly executive. But we do not have a single monitoring agency that is responsible for anything. Therefore the process of the struggle between the two branches is endless. The representative agencies want to direct the executive authority and want to shift the errors and responsibility to it. The authority, I repeat, must be just one. It must bear the legislative responsibility. But in our area the court does not operate! So the representative authority assumes the allocational and monitoring functions. So long as that exists, we shall not live any better. If one speaks about today's Government, I would begin with the major consideration. Until it turns its head toward the commodity producer, and as long as the banks enrich themselves at the expense of the producer, the strained economic and political atmosphere will be preserved. And, secondly: the executive, economic authority must not engage in politics. But our Government, by delving into politics, is ignoring economic matters. It is necessary immediately to begin thinking about the producer, and to remove those stifling taxes -- the strangle holds of the banking system. Then the people will begin to breathe again, I assure you, and the rallies will end. Thirdly: it is necessary urgently to reduce the apparatus. It is expensive and uncontrollable. [Goryunova] Today there is a holiday in your city. The home-museum of your hometown writer Savva Dangulov is being opened, with an exhibition of his second collection "The Artist and the Muse"... [Troitskiy] Savva Artemyevich was a remarkable person who ardently loved our city. We were friends. I helped to implement his idea and dream of creating an art gallery in the downtown children's library. The home-museum is finally opening, and I hope that it will become the cultural center of Armavir. The creative intellectuals will gather here. I am absolutely convinced that, without the development of culture or is preservation, it is impossible to build anything. Today the lack of culture is pulling us toward the West. It is necessary for culture to be the property of everyone, not just a matter for the intellectuals.
