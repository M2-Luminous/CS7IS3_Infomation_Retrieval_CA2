Two other Serb aircraft which were not attacked in the same incident probably took off from the Serb-controlled town of Banja Luka in northern Bosnia, officials added. The report confirmed a statement earlier in the day by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. The four Bosnian Serb Super-Galeb planes bombed a military plant at Bugojno and a residential area northwest of the factory before they were shot down by two US F-16 fighters, according to a NATO report cited by the officials. The bombings occurred after the F-16 ordered the Serbs to land. The two other Super-Galeb probably bombed an ammunition plant and a fuel depot at Novi Travnik in central Bosnia, the report added. One of the two aircraft probably landed at Ubdina in Krajina, and the other at Banja Luka. They had been spotted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's AWACS radar planes near Banja Luka and were later visually recognized by the F-16 pilots. NATO officials had earlier identified the aircraft as Super-Galeb bombers belonging to the Bosnian Serbs but the NATO report made no mention of the plane's origin. No parachutes were spotted after the four planes were shot down, so the fate of the Super-Galeb pilots was unknown, the report said. Tudjman, in a meeting in Zagreb with special United Nations representative Yasushi Akashi, complained that UN forces monitoring Krajina were exercising "inadequate control." "The example of the Serb military planes that were shot down, and which had taken off from an area of Croatia under UN protection, proves it," Tudjman argued, according to the news agency HINA.
