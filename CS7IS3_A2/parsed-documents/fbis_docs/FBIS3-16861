But as has become known, his visit should have continued today as well. Our correspondent reports on details of this unexpected change in the program. [Correspondent Sablin] Baltiysk, the town of naval seamen, has already gotten used to visits by prominent guests. But nevertheless, one could describe the latest visit there by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev as historic; in a few days the fate of the oldest navy of Russia will be decided at a collegium of the Military Department. It seems that the minister already has his own opinion: the Baltic Navy, even after reduction by 40 percent, should remain the main core of the defense area which is being set up in the Western part of the country. The second important point of the program of Pavel Grachev's visit to Kaliningrad Oblast was the settlement of social problems of servicemen who were withdrawn from the Baltic countries. But the minister did not manage to solve the complex of problems on construction of accommodation because of extraordinary, almost detective-story circumstances. Literally the day before, the special services of Lithuania arrested Vladas Laurinavicius, the head of the "Selma" firm in Kaunas. This is the firm which is building blocks of apartments for Russian servicemen. [Begin Grachev recording] This action was planned. Our conversation with him and all that happened after this conversation was monitored. I am the author of this project and the matter is that in essence "Selma" worked with its own money, so to say, on credit, and they were patiently waiting for us to pay them. Moreover, Vladas was informed that I would bring instructions from the prime minister concerning conditions of payment. I brought them a barter deal, as it were. We should have paid him in oil as we agreed. You know, these instruction are here, in my case, but I cannot give them to him. [end recording] [Announcer] This is some kind of a detective story which has made the problem of accommodation for the servicemen even more difficult.
