Commenting on this, Prime Minister Hosokawa told reporters this morning that he does not have any such intention. On the issue, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said at a news conference today: When the prime minister takes responsibility, clear actions are either to dissolve the lower house or to resign en masse. Of these, Mr. Tanaka probably thought the cabinet's resignation is more likely. I personally have no opinion on that.
