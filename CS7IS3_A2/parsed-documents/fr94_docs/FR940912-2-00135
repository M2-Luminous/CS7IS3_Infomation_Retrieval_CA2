FR940912-2-00135 FR940912-2-00093 Cogenex also seeks authorization through December 31, 1997 for Cogen Canada to borrow on a short-term basis from third parties, which debt may be guaranteed by Cogenex. The interest rate on such debt denominated in dollars would not exceed the commercial base rate at the First National Bank of Boston at the time a loan is made. The interest rate on such debt denominated in Canadian dollars would not exceed the Canadian prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal at the time a loan is made. All loans from third parties would mature in no more than one year and, together with the Cogenex Investments, would not aggregate more than U.S. $20 million outstanding at any one time. Cogenex proposes that Cogen Canada enter into an agreement with EUA Service Corporation (``EUASC''), pursuant to which EUASC would render certain management, financial, accounting and other services to Cogen Canada. Cogenex further requests authority through December 31, 1997 to provide equipment and services to Cogen Canada, as and when needed, on a fair market value basis, but at no less than cost. Cogenex also proposes licensing the use of certain know-how, technologies, models and systems to Cogen Canada appropriate for conservation and load management services.
