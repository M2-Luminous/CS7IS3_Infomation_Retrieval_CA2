General Secretary of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) Mostafa Hejri accused Iran of "killing and attacking Kurds here in the same way as in Iran." He told AFP from his headquarters in Kou Senjaq, northern Iraq, that in the past month "two villages have been nearly totally destroyed by Iranian shelling," although there had been casualties [sentence as received]. Hejri added that Tehran had only stopped its attacks on the Iranian Kurdish population during winter. Kurdish security forces added that an Iranian, who was active in the Iranian Kurdish movement had been killed in al-Sulaymaniyah, in the east of Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, several days ago. Northern Iraq passed to Kurdish control, with the backing of the allied forces, after the end of the Gulf war in February 1991. The KDPI, the main Kurdish opposition party in Iran, has several bases in northern Iraq close to the Iranian border, and in the past there has been intermittent shelling of the border areas.
