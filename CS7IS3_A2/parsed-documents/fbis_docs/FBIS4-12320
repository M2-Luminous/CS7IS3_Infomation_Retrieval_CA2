Reliable sources in Sanaa have reported that Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih informed the Political Forces Dialogue Committee that the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] is floating a "new plan" that calls for the deployment of Egyptian troops between the northern Yemeni and southern Yemeni troops in the former border areas. These sources added that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was informed of the new YSP plan by Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Ambassador Badr Hammam, who also met with YSP leaders in Aden, including 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the YSP Central Committee and vice chairman of the Presidential Council. Sources close to the General People's Congress said that it was Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas who relayed the "new plan" to the Egyptian mediator. The sources added that the Presidential Council chairman expressed his strong dissatisfaction with the new plan, noting that it was only promoted by a minority within the YSP higher command, the majority of which cherishes unity. President Salih noted that this plan would return the country to the situation that prevailed before the merger unity of 22 May 1990. In a separate development, and in a meeting with members of the Political Forces Dialogue Committee, the Yemeni president has denied that his country is importing banned weapons, saying: "Regardless of the differences in perspective we might have, we must resort to dialogue. We should not undermine national constants. Our unity must remain intact. It is better for us to come to the negotiating table to reach understanding and find solutions to our problems and hurdles before the onset of any armed conflicts or violence. This is because the failure to do so would result in bloodshed, devastation, and ruination throughout the homeland." [passage omitted]
