FBIS4-14026 "drnes080_c_94011" FBIS-NES-94-080 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 ARAB AFRICA Egypt U.S. Administration's Foreign Policy Assailed U.S. Administration's Foreign Policy Assailed NC2304102694 Cairo AL-AKHBAR in Arabic 14 Apr 94 p 5 NC2304102694 Cairo AL-AKHBAR Arabic BFN [Editorial: "Strange Statements and Stranger Attitudes by the United States"] [Text] U.S. sources have pointed out that Israel's acquisition of 45 fighter aircraft of the latest version will enable the Israeli air force to hit sites in Libya, Iraq, and Iran, thanks to the aircraft's capability for long-distance flights. This is the first time the U.S. Government has approved the sale of aircraft of this advanced type to another state, as it had been used exclusively by the U.S. Air Force. It is strange for U.S. sources to single out these three states, two Arab states and an Islamic state, regardless of the kind of policy adopted by the latter. In addition, the position of U.S. President Bill Clinton's government on the question of the international inspection of sites said to be used by North Korea to produce nuclear weapons and its threats to conduct air strikes against South Korea should it reject international inspection of its nuclear facilities are surprising to many. They also bring into question the real reason prompting the current U.S. Administration and the preceding administrations to ignore any mention of the nuclear weapons that Israel managed to produce and store in the Negev desert a long time ago and to turn a blind eye to the Tel Aviv government's continued refusal to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. This refusal is a flagrant defiance of the world community and the treaties endorsed by the majority of countries. Washington cannot claim to be ignorant of Israel's nuclear activity, something that is known to all scientific intelligence services, which know the number of nuclear bombs produced by the Dimona reactor and other hidden facilities. Moreover, every now and then the Israeli intelligence services leak information about the nuclear weapons that Israel possesses, the purpose of which is clear: to spread panic and anxiety among the neighboring and non-neighboring Arab states. If we add to this Washington's vacillating position over the tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which encourages the Serbian leaders to continue their barbaric aggression and ethnic cleansing operations against Muslims there, we will realize the real feelings governing the attitude of the U.S. Administration, no matter how much it tries to pretend goodwill, with which Washington officials' statements are replete!
