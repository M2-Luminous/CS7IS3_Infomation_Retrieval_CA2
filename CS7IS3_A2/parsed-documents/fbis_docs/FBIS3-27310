He made the statement here in a meeting with outgoing Chinese ambassador Huang Guocai. Nouhak pointed out: Lao and Chinese leaders have maintained close contacts with each other in recent years. Delegations from various departments at different levels have frequently visited each other. This has improved mutual trust and friendship. Cooperation in the economic and cultural fields have also developed rapidly and produced gratifying results. He said: The two countries have satisfactorily resolved the border issue left over from history in a very short period. They have successively signed the "Sino-Lao Border Treaty" and the "Sino-Lao Border System Treaty." This has not only laid a stronger foundation for the good-neighborly and friendly relationship between the two countries but also established a model for peacefully resolving disputes between countries in this region. Nouhak said: The Lao party and government follow with great interest the splendid achievements of China's in-depth reform and expanded opening up. They are pleased to see that China is more stable politically and socially, its economy prospers with each passing day, and its people's living standards further improve. He wished the Chinese people, under the leadership of the CPC headed by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, achieve even greater victories in building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
