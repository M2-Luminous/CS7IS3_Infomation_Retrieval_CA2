They discovered 24 fields of hashish varieties of hemp. The plants were sown on areas ranging from 100 square meters to 3.6 hectares. Over the past nine months, 127 kg of poppy, 19 kg of marijuana, and more than 3 kg of opium extract were confiscated. In underground laboratories, it would be processed into the ready-to-use heroin. Sergey Poltavskiy, the department chief, made the following comment: "Kherson Oblast is one of the few oblasts in southern Ukraine whose climate and soil are suitable for Indian and southern Chu hemp. And these plants serve as raw material for such deadly narcotics as hashish, marijuana, and anasha." The number of illegal hemp fields in Kherson Oblast is continuing to grow. In some cases, when the fields were left unattended for several years, plants grew and proliferated extremely well. This means that Indian and Chu hemp can adjust to the local environment and proliferate without help of man. This happened before. Let us just recall the notorious Chu Valley in Kazakhstan. Once seeds of the Indian hemp found their way to that area, they immediately spread over tens of square kilometers, turning it into a paradise for drug traffickers. Is there a perspective of another Chu Valley looming ahead? Unfortunately, the answer is "yes." It is extremely hard to detect illegal fields. In many cases they can only be spotted from a helicopter. Plants are hidden between the rows of corn on the corn fields, in plantations of young trees, or in the rush thicket, reached only by water. The militia forces are too understaffed and underequipped to conduct a large scale combing. In the past, forestry officers and road builders used to help the enforcement agencies, uprooting man-made plantations and wild hemp. They even had to make special reports on this. Now, no one has to do anything. The hemp has been left alone. There is nothing to prevent it from spreading to new areas. A package of antidrug laws imposing heavy fines on managers turning a blind eye on hemp in their businesses is stuck somewhere in the vast reaches of the Supreme Council. Will it surface at least before the next "hemp sowing campaign?"
