FBIS3-9776 "dreeu061__a94016" FBIS-EEU-94-061-A Document Type:Daily Report 29 Mar 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria `Panic' Over Lev-Dollar Exchange Rate AU2903174794 Sofia BTA in English 1725 GMT 29 Mar 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2903174794 Sofia BTA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Report by Mariyana Barutchieva: "The Currency Market Today"] [Text] Sofia, March 29 (BTA) -- Today the Interbank Currency Market was blocked by the high exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the lev. While in the morning the dollar was sold between 56 and 58 leva, in the afternoon it reached 78-79 leva. Most of the larger commercial banks withdrew from the Interbank Market today and sold foreign exchange mainly to their regular clients for 58-59 leva/$1. "Panic reigns, the market is paralyzed," said a dealer from one of the large banks who preferred not to be named. It is absurd to predict to what heights the dollar and the other key currencies might rise, he said. In his opinion, the rate of the depreciation of the leva is not so alarming if compared to the rate of inflation. The "panic" was created by the skyrocketing prices of the foreign currencies which he described as "unprecedented". Tension mounts with the saltatory rise of the hard currencies against the lev and people rush headlong to turn their deposits into foreign exchange. "They are ready to buy any currency, no matter what the price is," this reporter learned in an exchange office. Demand is high, the inadequate supply raises tension additionally, dealers said. The interest rates on 6-month deposits no longer attract the population. Some experts believe that the uncontrolled rise of the foreign exchange against the lev can be stopped by fixing the exchange rate of the key currencies against the lev or even by suspension of the currency market. That would set a precedent for an economy which claims to be market-oriented, say transactors in the Interbank Market. In the exchange offices the dollar's price rose to 80-85 leva. The German mark also reached unprecedented prices ranging between 39 and 45 leva. Many of the exchange offices used the cross rate to calculate the rate of the Deutsche Mark on the basis of a rate of 67 leva/$1. The British pound was sold between 100 and 120 leva. Most of the exchange offices were selling actively in order to close their long positions. A dealer from a large state-owned bank who asked not to be named said that later in the afternoon transactions were made at about 65 leva/$1. All transactors in the Interbank Market are expecting drastic measures from the central bank. The national radio quoted the central bank's Governor Prof. Todor Vulchev, as saying: "We know what we have to do in the next few days to reassure people and to reverse the process of depreciation of the lev." From March 1 to March 30 the central exchange rate of the U.S. dollar rose by 23.083 leva, and so did the German mark and the British pound, respectively by 14.342 leva and 34.869 leva. According to the national bank, some $6,354,937.33 were bought and $5,178,413.98 were sold in the Interbank Market today. The central exchange rate of the dollar for tomorrow is set at 60.609 leva, i.e. nearly 6 leva higher than today's central exchange rate.
