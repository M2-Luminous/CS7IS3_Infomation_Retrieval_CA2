According to a report disseminated by the Algerian Government, seven people were killed in one of these clashes. Unofficial neutral sources announced yesterday that ever since General Liamine Zeroual assumed power as surrogate president of the former Ruling Council, nearly 60 people have been killed in clashes between government forces and antiregime opponents. According to political observers, the intensification of the conflict in Algeria has further reduced any hopes of a political solution to the country's crisis. In his first speech after his appointment by the former coupist council, General Zeroual promised the Algerian people that the way would be paved for a political solution to the country's crisis by initiating a dialogue with opponents. These observers believe that the current trend in Algeria is no different than that which prevailed in the era of the former Ruling Council and that there are no indications that the government intends to resolve the political crisis. The release of political prisoners, the lifting of the state of emergency, and the change of approach toward opposing groups and factions are among the factors that could pave the way for a solution to the multifaceted crisis in Algeria. If the newly appointed government of General Zeroual wishes to tread the same path blazed by the former Ruling Council in its attitude to opponents, it will certainly face a crisis and will not have a better fate than the members of the former Ruling Council, who were forced to step down at the beginning of this week. The use of the military has never been effective in resolving a widespread political crisis, and the newly appointed Algerian Government is being forced by the insolvent economy to adopt a quick political solution. For the past few days, the Algerian Government has been announcing to all its creditors that it cannot pay its foreign debts, which only confirms its bankruptcy.
