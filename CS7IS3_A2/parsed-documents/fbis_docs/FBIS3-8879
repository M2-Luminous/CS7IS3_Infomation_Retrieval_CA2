Our journalists were banned from participating in news conferences given by the president and their access to the presidential palace or close to the president's circle at various events or visits throughout the country or abroad was banned, because they are guilty of publishing a figure that represented the salary that President Iliescu was about to receive after a vote in the parliament. The requests of the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI to have the accreditation returned remained without response. Currently, our daily continues to be submitted to presidential sanctions. In these conditions, in which the domestic means of attack have been exhausted, the only solution to settle this situation, which involves the violation of a fundamental principle of the European Convention on Human Rights -- the free access to information -- remains to bring it to the attention of the Council of Europe [CE]. We wish to note that we are not talking about the rights of our paper, but the rights of our readers -- those people who are paying their taxes to the state and thus participate in supporting the expenses of the presidency -- to be informed about President Ion Iliescu's activity. As a matter of fact, the situation is already known by the Strasbourg Forum. The documents of the rapporteurs on Romania, completed on the occasion of the procedure of admitting our country to the Council of Europe, also mentions that the accreditation of certain papers that criticize the leadership has been suspended and it is suggested that this problem should be solved immediately. The same issue can also be found in Document 6953, which was distributed to European parliamentarians at the 1994 January session, a document that was initiated by Daniel Tarschys, president of the Liberal political group. We must note that, for the time being, the citizens of Romania do not have the possibility to turn to the European Court of Human Rights because -- in contradiction to the latest affirmations of Florin Radulescu Botica, Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] senator -- the European Convention on Human Rights has not been submitted to the parliament for ratification. We are quoting a passage from Notification Number 176 in connection with Romania's request to be admitted to the Council of Europe: "The Assembly attaches great importance to the promises made by the Romanian authorities to sign and ratify expeditiously the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 25 of the Convention) as well as the compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court for Human Rights (Article 46 of the Convention)." In these conditions, our daily has decided to draw the attention of the presidents of the two commissions that, on the basis of the Halonen directive, are supervising the implementation of the commitments assumed by Romania when it was accepted to the Council of Europe: Esteemed Mr. President: Through you and through the commission that you head, we turn to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to ask you to intercede with the Council of Europe through the procedural means available to you, in order to put an end to the violation of one of the fundamental standards of European democracy, namely the freedom of the press and the right to have free access to information. We are referring to the act of banning the journalists of our publication, that is, the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI daily, from being present at news conferences organized by Romania's president, as well as banning them from all sources of information connected with the activity of the presidential institution. This measure was taken precisely as a punishment for articles and critical news items that were published in our newspaper about the policy promoted by the president or the government. We would like to mention that the newspaper EVENIMENTUL ZILEI is the most popular daily in Romania and has three daily issues, and that it is obvious that, precisely for this reason, out of all the independent papers published in Romania, EVENIMENTUL ZILEI is the most severely sanctioned, thus the most important source in the written press is being obstructed. This illegal punitive measure was adopted on 13 May 1993 and it has not been lifted, either after our repeated requests or upon the public's request; it has not been lifted upon the recommendation of the Council of Europe either, which was included clearly in the reports of Messrs. Friedrik Koenig and Gunnar Jansson [Council of Europe rapporteurs]. Apart from the material and moral loss suffered by our newspaper as a result of the lack of possibility to relate various information from its own sources regarding the presidential institution, the greatest damage is suffered by the Romanian public itself, which is missing the possibility of having complete and unhampered access to information. We would like to add to the above that it was the same presidential institution that, meantime, brought a series of criminal charges against us for the most-aberrant crimes imagineable. The fact that the respective trials had the purpose of intimidating us and hampering us in our action to freely exercise our profession is also proved by the fact that every time the procedures began, the president withdrew the charges and abandoned the act as unexpectedly as he had started it. In accordance with the normal procedures, we would have liked to turn to the European Court of Human Rights with our problem, however, unfortunately, we still do not have this possibility because Romania, in spite of its pledges, has not, to this very day, ratified the European Convention on Human Rights. We reserve the right that after the ratification of the respective Convention, we can turn to the Court of Justice in Strasbourg. However, considering that the act of finding solutions to this problem can no longer be delayed, we are turning to you for support. Within this context we also express our dissatisfaction with the unjustified slow pace with which the current leadership is going through the procedural moves of ratifying the European Convention on Human Rights. We thank you for the attention you pay to our problem and we express our hope that the actions that you are going to take will be effective and will be in favor of democracy.
