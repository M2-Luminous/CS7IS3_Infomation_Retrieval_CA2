Early yesterday morning, before the opening of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] summit, Wasmosy conveyed this problem to Franco based on a protest note submitted to him by Ciudad del Este Mayor Guillermo Campuzano and by the Foz do Yguazu-based Parana-Paraguay Chamber of Commerce. The note charges Brazilian customs officials with a harassment campaign "that has caused a major reduction in the flow of tourists to Foz do Yguazu and Ciudad del Este, with the subsequent reduction in sales for stores, hotels, and restaurants." The drop in business has been estimated at nearly 40 percent.
