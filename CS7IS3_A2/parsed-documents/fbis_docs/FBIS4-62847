Juppe's goal is to get a better idea of the fundamental economic transformations which are taking place in Russia, to give a push to the development of bilateral cooperation between Paris and Moscow, and to improve the effectiveness of the two countries' cooperation in resolving international problems. "Contacts between the French and Russian leaders are maintained regularly. They have already become a good tradition, reinforced by the 1992 Russian-French agreement", the foreign minister told ITAR-TASS before his departure. "Russia is one of the world's great powers and is rich in cultural traditions and in her ability to renew herself, which is most of all thanks to, I am convinced, the Russian people". Juppe's itinerary for his three-day visit is extremely packed, including meetings and talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, leaders in the government and parliament, Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The top priority in the talks will belong to questions of economic and political mutual cooperation, including along the Russia-European Union and "Big Seven" lines. The two sides will also exchange opinions on ways to attract more French capital into the Russian economy. Among international problems, the French diplomat intends to discuss with his Russian colleagues the Bosnian crisis, the strengthening of European security through the realization of the NATO "Partnership for Peace" programme, the upcoming international conference in Paris for the signing of the pact on stability in Europe, and the state of affairs in the CIS "hot spots" and their surrounding regions. The foreign minister's unofficial activities will include visits to Nizhniy Novgorod and St. Petersburg, a city which he has wanted to visit for a long time.
