One of these agreements is designed to promote the normalization of fishing in the Baltic while another concerns the reciprocal use and safeguarding of fish stocks in inland border lakes. The agreement, signed for a period of five years with an automatic extension, in contrast to many similar documents also contains a mechanism for monitoring the documents' punctilious fulfillment. In the opinion of Vladimir Korelskiy, chairman of the committee for fishing, the next step will be to establish scientifically substantiated fishing quotas in the Baltic and to elaborate measures to safeguard a fish rated as a delicacy -- the smelt -- in the Chudskoye, Teploye, and Pskovskoye Lakes. What draws the attention is the fact that the agreements on the solution of practical isues affecting the two countries' interests were signed before Russia and Estonia had unanimously decided to establish offifcial borders between the states. Obviously fishermen understand better than politicians that while the case drags one the fish, which recognize no state borders, could be swimming off other shores.
