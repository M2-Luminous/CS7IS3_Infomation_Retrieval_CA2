Menem also spoke about the possibility of sending more ships to help in Haiti's political and economic blockade. Menem made these comments during a news conference at the Argentine Embassy in Washington after his meeting with his U.S. counterpart, Bill Clinton, at the White House. During most of the news conference Menem answered questions on international matters, which were at the center of his talks with Clinton today. Menem considers himself a guarantor of peace and democracy. He also mentioned issues that will be discussed in the hemispheric summit in Miami. "We discussed the Haitian situation, the next American continent summit meeting in Miami," the president said. Menem added that Argentina is ready to contribute to any decisions made by the UN Security Council. Speaking about the hemispheric summit, Menem said: "It will center on three main items: democracy and its most important result -- freedom, trade, and continental security. Other topics might be added later." Menem said he is sure economic sanctions against Haiti will yield good results, adding that he is "always speaking about political and economic measures." Menem said there are two ways Argentine troops can be sent to Haiti, where a dictatorial government prevents elected authorities from taking over. "The first case is presidential prerogative. The president can send troops anywhere in the world to keep the peace. This is the case in Croatia, Cyprus, and Haiti. In Haiti we are contributing to the embargo. The president needs congressional approval if troops will be involved in combat situations," Menem added. The president said that during his meeting with Clinton the two leaders discussed "the most worrisome current issues, which includes the case of Haiti. We agreed on the need to increase pressure in the political and economic areas to force the withdrawal of the military from the government." The president said he was optimistic about a possible resolution of the international problem created by the North Korean refusal to deactivate its nuclear programs. "I learned today that U.S., North Korean, and international organizations' representatives will meet next month to try to solve the problem," Menem said. The president also was asked about Brazil's annoyance at Argentina for its support of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to head the World Trade Organization. "I recall that Argentina supported Carlos Salinas de Gortari based on a Colombian request made at the Ibero-American summit. I was not aware then of the Brazilian position on the issue," the president explained. Menem added: "Brazil proposed the candidacy of Mr. [Rubens] Ricupero, a successful economist in Brazil. Therefore, at this time there are two candidates, and the decision is in the hands of World Trade Organization members. [no closing quotation mark as received] Regarding the issue of Haiti, Menem said pressure against the dictatorial government could include actions in the financial field. "These measures will affect the entry of capital and assets, but the decision will be made by the United Nations. As guarantors of democracy and freedom, we will support them immediately," Menem said enthusiastically. The president added: "The international community, through the United Nations, must take steps as quickly as possible when a country does not live in democracy, when people are killed everywhere, and when there is hunger and misery because of it."
