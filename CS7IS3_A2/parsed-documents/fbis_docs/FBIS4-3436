The announcement came after yesterday's peace agreement between Bosnian Serbs and the U.N. peacekeeping force allowing the latter to enter Bosnia's eastern city of Gorazde Wednesday [19 April] to enable humanitarian organizations to pursue their work. This act was in response to statements Tuesday from the Russian and U.S. presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. The Bosnian Serbs also called for the international community to press the Muslims to accept the cease-fire agreement and hold peaceful negotiations to solve the crisis. Foreign press reports said that by the noon Bosnian Serb forces continued to shell the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde, despite their "unilateral peace" announcement. The three-week Serb offensive has killed at least 345 people and wounded more than 1,000, the reports added.
