Prime Minister Dr. Cheddi Jagan also announced Thursday that the government had concluded the sale of the Guyana Stores retail outlet chain; the Guyana National Engineering Corporation, a company reputed for shipbuilding; and government's shares in the Guyana Bank for Trade and Industry. Addressing donors from more than 30 countries and 15 international lending institutions, President Jagan restated his government's commitment to a healthy private sector. The Guyanese president acknowledged that government's pace in privatisation had been slow, but he defended this on the grounds that the process of identifying state companies suitable for divestment could not be short circuited. "There is absolutely no ground for scepticism as regards the orientation... And commitment to a strong and healthy private sector," the prime minister said. "Whatever we do, the people of the nation will not be compromised," he added.
