At the meeting, principal leading cadres and veteran comrades in all fields of the province were urged to extensively recommend suitable persons for reserve cadres at the provincial and city (departmental) levels based on the demands of the province's economic construction and the building of leading bodies. Through democratic recommendation, the field of vision and the channels to appreciate the cadres' capabilities were expanded and a number of young cadres were discovered, thus providing organizational preparations for the readjustment of leading bodies at all levels and for the shift of terms of the provincial party committee and party committees of various cities next year. Attending the meeting were leading comrades of the provincial party committee and other provincial-level leading bodies; some former veteran comrades of the provincial level; principal responsible comrades of various departments and commissions under the provincial party committee; secretaries of the leading party groups and party committees of various provincial-level units, the provincial higher people's court, the provincial people's procuratorate, various people's groups, and various central units stationed in Shenyang; chairmen of various democratic parties and industrial and commercial federations; secretaries of party committees of various cities; deputy secretaries in charge of organizational work and directors of organizational departments under various city party committees; cadres and personnel section heads of various provincial-level units, about 500 persons in total. Wang Huaiyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over the meeting. He said: This meeting is an important one held by the provincial party committee to adopt feasible measures to replace old cadres with new ones, to further perfect the structure of leading bodies, to make leading bodies more vigorous, to strengthen the construction of leading bodies, and to ensure and promote the development of economic construction and all other undertakings. The current democratic recommendation was conducted in the form of being mobilized by the provincial party committee in a unified manner, being arranged by various localities and departments, respectively, being recommended by oneself, and being concentratively estimated by the organizational department of the provincial party committee. Yu Junbo, standing committee member and director of the organizational department of the provincial party committee, made specific explanations of the work of how to democratically recommend excellent young cadres. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered an important speech at the meeting. Gu Jinchi said: In the new historical period, we should carry out three projects: 1) Winning the hardest battle of again pushing the economy on the new stage; 2) establishing the socialist market economic structure; and 3) successfully building leading bodies at all levels. These three projects are closely connected with one another. Of them, the project of successfully building leading bodies constitutes an important guarantee for accomplishing the first two projects. In building leading bodies, an urgent and conspicuous task at the moment is to vigorously select and train young cadres. On how to examine and evaluate young cadres, Gu Jinchi said: In evaluating young cadres, we should persist in seeing innate character, main trend, practical achievements, and development potential. In seeing the innate character, we should primarily see whether young cadres have a correct outlook on the world and on life, are wholeheartedly serving the people, and have a strong sense of dedication and responsibility for developing the socialist productive forces, for enhancing China's comprehensive strength, and for improving the people's living standards. By the main trend, we mean making an all-round, objective, and dialectical analysis of strong and weak points of young cadres and then having a good command of their major factors. By practical performances, we mean judging whether young cadres are working in a down-to-earth manner and quietly immersing themselves in hard work or are merely paying lip service and pursuing personal fame and gain, and whether young cadres are working hard for the present, giving consideration to the long-term interest, and laying solid foundation or are eager for quick success and instant benefit. At the moment, in evaluating the performances of young cadres, we should pay special attention to their style of work and see whether they are realistic and practical in work, whether they can find out the real situation, tell the truth, strive for practical results, and are as good as their words. By development, we mean the development potential of young cadres. Generally speaking, young cadres lack experience in leadership and are poor at handling complicated contradictions, but they have the potential for continued development as decided by the foundation of their quality. So long as we bravely promote those excellent young cadres with great potential to leading posts and let them work at their posts, they will be adapt to their work rapidly. Gu Jinchi stressed: In the current democratic recommendation, we must emancipate the mind, broaden the field of vision, and seek suitable persons from an even wider scope. We should emphatically search talents from the first line of reform, opening up, and economic construction. We should select talents not only among leading organs but also grass-roots units, the county (city) and district leading posts in particular. We should select talents not only among large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, institutions of higher learning, and scientific research institutes but also among the cadres emerging in all sorts of new economic organizations. We should select talents not only among our own localities, departments, and fronts but also positively recommend excellent talents of other localities and units, in particular the talents of the localities and units advanced in building two civilizations. Gu Jinchi called on party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership, pay attention to selecting and training young cadres, and actually list this work as an item of their daily agenda.
