FR940523-2-00035 FR940523-2-00021 U. S. Department of Energy, Freedom of Information Reading Room, room 1E&hyph;190, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20825 202&hyph;586&hyph;6020 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Historically, the Department's national security mission has included the assembly and disassembly of nuclear weapons as mandated by statute, Presidential direction, and Congressional authorization and appropriation. The Department has carried out this mission at the Pantex Plant, located in the Panhandle of Texas in Carson County near Amarillo. Assembled weapons are transported and transferred to the Department of Defense for deployment and retired weapons are returned to the Pantex Plant for disassembly. The Pantex Plant is owned by the Department and currently operated under contract with the Department by the Mason & Hanger-Silas Mason Co., Inc. Over the years, activities at the Pantex Plant have included four major types of operations: (1) Fabrication of conventional high explosives, (2) assembly of nuclear weapons from these high explosives and prefabricated weapons components received from off-site suppliers, (3) maintenance, modification, and quality assurance testing of nuclear weapons already in the military stockpile, and (4) disassembly of nuclear weapons. The Pantex Plant has conducted these activities in a safe and responsible fashion for more than 40 years. In the past, the Pantex Plant's primary activity was the assembly of nuclear weapons. Currently, the Pantex Plant's primary activity is the disassembly of nuclear weapons, although all of the historical missions are being or may still be performed. After the weapons have been disassembled, the disposition of the associated components depends on their characteristics, the facilities that the Department has available, and any future need for these components. Nuclear components, those containing significant amounts of tritium or Special Nuclear Material (enriched uranium or plutonium), are either retained by the Department at the Pantex Plant or sent to facilities at other Department sites. The major nuclear components and their respective destinations are as follows: (a) Plutonium components (pits), which are assemblies containing encapsulated weapons grade plutonium (the major constituent being the fissile plutonium isotope Pu&hyph;239), are currently retained at the Pantex Plant; (b) Radioisotopic Thermoelectric Generators, which are components containing an encapsulated plutonium heat source (the major constituent being the nonfissile isotope Pu&hyph;238), are shipped to the Los Alamos National Laboratory where the heat source is removed and either stored or de-encapsulated and may be shipped offsite for additional processing; (c) Secondaries, which contain enriched uranium, are sent to the Oak Ridge Reservation for storage; and (d) Reservoirs, which are tritium-containing pressure vessels, are sent to the Savannah River Site where the tritium is purified and reused in the enduring stockpile. Non-nuclear components are recycled, salvaged, or disposed of at the Pantex Plant or at other sites. These components include high explosives, electronics, and structural parts (some of which contain depleted uranium). Some disposition of these parts is handled through commercial firms. The Department recently completed the Environmental Assessment for Interim Storage of Plutonium Components at Pantex. The Department evaluated the proposed interim storage of up to 20,000 pits. In response to comments received from State and local officials and other stakeholders, the Department decided to store no more than 12,000 pits at Pantex until a site-wide Environmental Impact Statement (i.e., this Environmental Impact Statement) covering all current and proposed facilities and activities at Pantex is completed. Additionally, this Environmental Impact Statement will address the environmental impacts at other sites which may result from the storage of highly enriched uranium, tritium, and weapons components resulting from the dismantlement of nuclear weapons. A Record of Decision for this Environmental Impact Statement will be issued by November 15, 1996. The Department is preparing to initiate separate NEPA documentation that will address the long-term disposition of the materials and components covered in this Environmental Impact Statement, as well as other materials. Preliminary Identification of Alternatives and Issues A preliminary set of alternatives and issues for evaluation in the Environmental Impact Statement has been identified below. The final set of alternatives and issues to be considered in the Environmental Impact Statement will reflect consideration of the public input received during the scoping period. Proposed Action The proposed action is to meet the Department's responsibilities over the next 5 to 10 years by continuing to operate the Pantex Plant with its current missions, and by continuing to store nuclear components at the Department sites currently used for that purpose. Continuing operations include production of high explosives, weapon components, assembly and disassembly of nuclear weapons, modification and maintenance of the nuclear weapon stockpile, quality assurance testing of weapon components, evaluation and surveillance of nuclear weapons, and research and development activities supporting nuclear weapons. In addition, the proposed action also involves implementing those facility upgrades, modifications, replacement facilities, and new proposed projects that are foreseeable over the next 5 to 10 years, pursuant to the missions at Pantex as established by Congress and the President. This alternative would involve storing, on an interim basis, up to 20,000 pits at the Pantex Plant. The proposed action at the Pantex Plant would include the establishment of a new research center, the potential for new mixed-waste treatment facilities, environmental cleanup and restoration activities, cooperative agreements with Texas Technical University, and activities associated with the technology transfer program. The proposed action would also include all routine activities such as infrastructure and building maintenance, operations and equipment relocations and consolidations, modifications to buildings, general landscaping, site characterization, transportation of materials, and similar support activities. The proposed action will also consider and analyze to the extent practicable any environmental issues or impacts that may arise from the implementation of decisions by Congress and the President to allow third-party inspection at the Pantex Plant as part of any implementation of national nonproliferation policy. Other Alternatives The following is an initial list of other alternatives for analysis in this Environmental Impact Statement. The list is tentative and is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor does it imply any predetermined selection of any alternative or decisions. Changes to this list may occur as the result of public input and the scoping process. Alternatives to the proposed action that have been preliminarily identified include:
