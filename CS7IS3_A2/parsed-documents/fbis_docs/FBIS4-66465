The idea of making more effective and efficient use of elementary manufacturing technology by sharing it as a global asset was first put forward in 1989 by Professor Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, president of the University of Tokyo. When the Ministry of International Trade and Industry threw its weight behind the idea, however, other countries were skeptical. Industrial know-how has long been Japan's powerbase. With the country's economy looking unstoppable at the time, other countries suspected Japan would have the most to gain from the pooling of manufacturing secrets into an international data base. Changing Attitudes Recently, however, the project, known as Intelligent Manufacturing System (IMS) Plan, is winning more acceptance, its supporters say. The ending of the Cold War has made the international community more open to ideas such as ``technoglobalism.'' Intensified competition in the business world is also working to promote the exchange of production know-how. Rival corporations are increasingly forming transnational alliances, sometimes manufacturing products under their competitor's brand name. In January, the International Steering Committee, a private-sector body which governs the project, urged all participating companies and research institutes from member countries to step up their studies on ways to implement IMS. It has set a 10-year goal to have the system up and running. Participating in the project are private corporations and institutes from Japan, the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia. MITI has earmarked more than Â¥1.25 billion ($11.9 million) in 1994 budget for research fees connected with IMS. Time, Money Saver Under the plan, it is envisioned that product designers could access a data base to find necessary elementary manufacturing technologies. This would allow them to build effective applications in a shorter amount of time. The scheme would also give product designers access to information obtained from point-of-sales surveys by other manufacturers. FIGURE The prime benefit of the plan is that it would save money wasted by companies on reinventing technologies that already exist. Furthermore, the establishment of IMS would make it easier to implement environment maintenance systems such as recycling as part of manufacturing technologies. For the past two years, participants in the project have carried out preliminary research on topics including systematization of knowledge, environmentally friendly processing industries and concurrent engineering for international production. Fully 142 facilities, comprised of 87 corporations and 55 universities from participating countries, have played a part in the research. Japan took the lead in researching the systemization of knowledge with 19 corporations, nine universities and national research organizations taking part. Because IMS would create international cooperative research on an unprecedented scale, one of the main topics of the preliminary research was how to deal with intellectual property rights, including patents generated from IMS projects. The studies so far have suggested creating three types of regulations to protect the integrity of the system. Some regulations would be compulsory throughout the entire system, other regulations would be recommended for implementing in cooperative agreements and still other regulations would be permissible depending on the desires of the participants. Preliminary agreements have determined that a partner could share research results with a third party without gaining permission from the other partner. Furthermore, a partner in cooperative research will be able to use research results in commercial applications without compensating the other partner. However, a company can agree to pay fees to non-profit research facilities when using results in commercial applications. An agreement was also reached to draw a distinction between academic use and commercial use of patents held by individual researchers and only charge royalties on commercial uses.
