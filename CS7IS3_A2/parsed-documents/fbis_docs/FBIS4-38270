A statement by the Palestinian Democratic Union, FIDA, said that this delay, whatever its justification or reason, causes harmful effects on the unity of the Palestinian leadership's performance in various spheres and on the clarity of the plan of action. It also paralyzes the capacity of members of the national authority in carrying out their responsibilities as a collective team. The party hinted at withdrawing from the authority and pointed out that "its support for and continued participation in the authority depends on the its possession of a comprehensive national plan to pursue the battle of independence; on the realization of adequate participation, justice, and equality; and on the granting of freedom." The statement also called for accelerating the completion of the authority's domain. The party is currently represented in the authority council by its secretary general, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, who holds the education and arts portfolio, and Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, who holds the youth and sport portfolio.
