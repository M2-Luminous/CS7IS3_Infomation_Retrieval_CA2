You just returned from the roundtable in Pyongyang. How did this meeting proceed? [Khieu Samphan] I thank you, who represent the Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] was very glad that a roundtable was held among all Cambodian parties, for it was the profound aspiration of our entire nation and people. Our nation and people had called repeatedly for such a roundtable, but it had not been possible because of opposition. I led a delegation of Democratic Kampuchea to the roundtable with a profound desire for national reconciliation and peace so that all our forces become reunified, our country can enjoy true and lasting peace, and all our people both in the countryside and in Phnom Penh who have been victims of the war and have suffered for so many years get a chance to live and work in peace and happiness. I joined the meeting with those wishes in mind. The PDK sought by all means to hold sincere discussions and consultations so that the aspirations of our nation and people for national reconciliation and peace can be achieved as soon as possible. [Correspondent] As a matter of fact, what proposals did the PDK make so that national reconciliation and peace can be achieved? [Khieu Samphan] For national reconciliation, I proposed that consultations be held to work out a formulation, that is, to formulate a minimal policy program according to which all parties would agree to set up a national government and national army of which all Cambodian parties would be members. The consultations should be made in the spirit of reconciliation and all parties should make concessions to one another as suggested all along by the king. We should look into possible ways to let the PDK join a national government and a national army, ways to bring all Cambodian parties into the national government and national army, and ways for the PDK to transfer the zones that it controls to the national government and for its army to be integrated into the national army. Most important of all, however, was the fact that we should consult with one another so we can agree on a minimal policy program first. Only after we have this minimal policy program do we have a specific basis that all parties can accept and follow, both now that we are working on national reconciliation and in the future when the national government and national army with all Cambodian parties as members will begin their operations. [Correspondent] What reaction did the two-headed government have to your proposal? [Khieu Samphan] Hun Sen was the one who talked on behalf of the two-headed government. He only talked about a cease-fire. He did not say anything about national reconciliation or how to bring about lasting peace. He refused to talk about national reconciliation and national concord. On the contrary, he put forth three points which were conditions set by the communist Vietnamese and the alliance to do away with the PDK and block national reconciliation and peace. In my opinion, the national forces of all parties should be brought together on the basis of a clear-cut policy program accepted by everybody to achieve national reconciliation. This does not mean that a party should be integrated into another party. Up to the present, there has never been national reconciliation; there has been only war. If we continue on the old road, there will never be national reconciliation at all; the foreigners will continue to interfere, to ignite the war. For this reason, we should work for national reconciliation and for a permanent end to the war. In order to achieve national reconciliation and put a permanent end to the war, there should be a minimal policy program that all parties agree to accept and implement. This minimal policy program is a commitment to be respected by both Cambodians and foreigners in Cambodia alike. So far, there has never been any national reconciliation or rallying of the national forces. It is for this reason that the foreigners -- be it the Vietnamese or the alliance -- have interfered in our affairs and continued to ignite the war that lays waste to our country. National reconciliation and the rallying of national forces is more important than anything else. It is the water that could put out the flames of war. It directly concerns the life or death of our Cambodian nation and race. [Correspondent] Why did Hun Sen refuse to talk about national reconciliation and insist only on the cease-fire without any specific supervision? [Khieu Samphan] During the meeting, I repeatedly stressed that the key to the problem is national reconciliation. All Cambodian parties must do their best to forge national reconciliation in order to end the war at its roots. The cease-fire issue should be settled within the framework of a solution on national reconciliation. We should not have a cease-fire just in order to make preparations for further fighting. I recalled to mind some past experiences in the world. I cited the example of the communist Vietnamese taking advantage of the 1968 Tet cease-fire in order to prepare forces and send arms to attack Saigon. I also recalled the experiences of our own nation. The Paris agreement was a very important document. It was a document of international stature. Its objective was clear: 1. To supervise the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Cambodia. 2. To secure a quadripartite national reconciliation in the form of the Supreme National Council with the then head of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk as chairman. But the Paris agreement was torn to shreds and trampled underfoot. There was no supervision to ascertain that the foreign forces --namely, the aggressor communist Vietnamese forces -- had completely withdrawn from Cambodia. The quadripartite Supreme National Council was given no significant role at all. The quadripartite national reconciliation was aborted. Attempts were made to eliminate and destroy the PDK. All these incidents were about foreigners opposing our national reconciliation and continuing to ignite the flames of war. To this day, everybody knows how badly the war has affected our nation. Despite all of that, I informed the meeting participants that so long as we Cambodians tried our best we would succeed as we had all the capabilities and the support of our nation and people in achieving national reconciliation and true and lasting peace. I repeatedly talked about it and yet the others insisted they did not hear, they did not understand, and they did not agree to discuss the question of national reconciliation. To accept national reconciliation means to stop seeking each other's destruction, to stop fighting each other forever, and to join hands in solving all problems, large or small, of the nation. Why did they refuse to discuss national reconciliation? It was known to all that before and during the roundtable the United States, Australia, and France were very busy mustering arms for the two-headed government. They talked outwardly about a cease-fire, but in concrete actions they were preparing forces and weapons to continue igniting the flames of war. In fact, they needed the time to prepare forces, muster arms, and transport them for stockpiling on each battlefield so they could continue to ignite the war against their own nation and people. [Correspondent] In your opinion, what will happen in the future? [Khieu Samphan] It is my prayer that there will be national reconciliation and genuine peace so that our nation and people can be happy and live their normal lives. The entire Democratic Kampuchea, the entire Cambodian nation and people want national reconciliation and peace. All of us want to continue the consultations and discussions in order to find a way to solve the national reconciliation problem. Our nation and people clearly see who continues to ignite the war and cause them suffering, deaths, separations, woes, and pains. They are: 1. The communist Vietnamese who continue to ignite their war of aggression in Cambodia so they can take the opportunity to send Vietnamese nationals into Cambodia as illegal immigrants in accordance with their strategy of swallowing up Cambodia through demographic warfare. 2. The Western alliance bad elements who join hands with the communist Vietnamese in continuing to ignite the latter's war of aggression so they can take the opportunity to interfere in Cambodia's Internal affairs and push Cambodia into their sphere of influence. Our nation and people clearly know and see who are continuing to follow and abide by the orders of the foreigners who oppose national reconciliation and continue igniting the flames of war. Our people are opposed resolutely to these elements. Our nation and people are well aware of the roots of their sorrow and misery. National problems have not been solved nor have we solved social problems. On the contrary, they have steadily deteriorated and placed heavy pressure on the livelihood of each family both in Phnom Penh and the countryside. Therefore, the desire for national reconciliation, the desire for a permanent end to the war has become the wishes, the vital aspirations of each family of our people. It has become an extraordinarily powerful force that calls for national reconciliation, an end to the war, and peace -- a force opposed to foreigners providing arms to the two-headed government to enable it to continue igniting the war, opposed to forcible recruitment, and opposed to forcing the people to serve as militiamen and reserve forces for inter-Cambodia killings. Our nation and people have seen through the ugly schemes of the communist Vietnamese, alliance, and two-headed government. Our nation and people, our entire nation is resolutely opposed to all these dark designs. This is the invincible force driving for national reconciliation.
