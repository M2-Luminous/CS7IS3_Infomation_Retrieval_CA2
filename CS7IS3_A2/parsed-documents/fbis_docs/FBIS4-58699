FBIS4-58699 "drnes088bb_94003" FBIS-NES-94-088 Daily Report 3 May 1994 Inter-Arab Affairs League Receives Gulf States' Memoranda on Weapons League Receives Gulf States' Memoranda on Weapons 94P50134A London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 3 May 94 p 6 94P50134A London AL-HAYAH Arabic CSO [Text] Cairo--The Arab League has received official memoranda from the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council related to their view of the way to deal with the subject of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East region. AL-HAYAH has been informed about the Saudi, Qatari, and Omani memoranda. The Saudi memorandum emphasized the [necessity of] subjecting the Israeli nuclear facilities to international inspection, while Qatar demanded a "quantitative and qualitative equality in the military capabilities of the region's states," and the Omani memorandum called for eliminating weapons of mass destruction within a framework of achieving peace. It also proposed confidence-building measures and decreased military spending. The Saudi memorandum included the following: 1. The Kingdom supports making the Middle East region free of weapons of mass destruction. 2. It is important and necessary for Israel to join the nuclear weapons proliferation ban agreement, for it to subject all of its nuclear facilities to international inspection, and for the intensification of efforts and prompting by the international community to induce Israel to join the agreement. 3. Signing of a chemical weapons ban agreement is not incompatible with efforts to induce Israel to sign the nuclear weapons proliferation ban. In fact, it is in the interest of such an effort. 4. It is important to bring up in the multilateral talks the subject of Israel's signing of the nuclear weapons proliferation ban and to make the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, within the context of the arms limitation committee. Three points were brought up in the memorandum submitted by Qatar, which hosted the arms limitation committee: 1. It is necessary that arms limitation arrangements mirror the determination of the states concerned with living in peace, in the light of the new circumstances and relationships prevailing in the Middle East in order to achieve stability and security, while taking into consideration the difficulty of achieving any substantial decrease in armaments levels in the region in the absence of peace and stability. 2. The degree of progress in the bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Arab sides must influence the degree of progress in the field of arms limitation. The achievement of progress in the field of arms limitation and security arrangements may have a positive effect on the bilateral negotiations as well, and the achievement of peace is the only guarantee of security for all the parties. 3. Basic considerations and principles that should be the basis for the arms limitation regime are: A. It is necessary to provide a quantitative and qualitative equality in the military capabilities of the region's states, because the current inequality cannot continue. B. It is necessary to achieve security through discussion and political arrangements, and eliminating policies of military superiority. C. These principles should be applied to all the states of the area without exception or preference in an equal, balanced form at similar levels, applied according to a single measurement. D. It is necessary to continue the dialogue about arms limitation questions by gradual stages leading to putting in place a mechanism and regional measures for arms limitation. [Qatar] proposed realizing the nature of the problems and determining them according priorities, agreeing on confidence building measures before the sides announce their intention to take steps in fields which are agreed must have priority. It is necessary that all the concerned sides in the region agree to be bound legally by contractual obligations before joining into the nuclear weapons proliferation ban agreement, and that they concur in the application of international means of verifying their adherance to the agreement. The Omani memorandum included seven points: 1. Dealing with the problem of weapons of mass destruction in the region. They should be eliminated within the context of achieving peace, and the area is still in a situation of doubt and distrust over the renunciation of its destructive weapons stores. The tremendous assets that are being spent on these weapons should be used in development programs. 2. The dialogue about armaments should continue in gradual stages, each of which leads to the next, with a time schedule or program to achieve effective steps toward peace which is parallel to steps toward eliminating these armaments. 3. The memorandum refers to the Sultanate's signing of a chemical weapons ban and requests that all the countries of the region sign it. 4. It is up to Israel and the Arabs to announce their intention to eliminate destructive weapons stores and to accept international inspection of the manufacture and development of these arms at the appropriate time. 5. Conventional weapons in the region should be drawn down, with a view to the long-range national security of each side in the area. The goal is to increase this security so that no side achieves a greater security, military, or strategic advantage at the expense of another. 6. The Sultanate of Oman believes that the principal threat comes from unlimited proliferation of these weapons, and that it is up to every country in the world to work toward a world free of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, safeguarding world peace and security. 7. It is necessary to take measures to build confidence, and the Sultanate proposes: A. Issuing a statement about the danger of not controlling the arms race. B. It is necessary to limit expenses in defense-related fields. C. It is necessary to prevent the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction. D. Settlement of disputes by peaceful means. E. Nonaggression and nonintervention in internal affairs.
