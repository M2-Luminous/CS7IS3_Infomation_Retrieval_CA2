Behind the crumbling facade, there is the headquarters of the man who scares the world with his fascist statements: Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. The elevator does not work, and the garbage is piling up on the staircase. Only a small store on the first floor is clean where the "Liberal Democratic Party" (LDP) offers black leather jackets and flashy T-shirts. The party office beneath the roof is a meeting place for strange figures. A man on a shabby sofa stared fixedly at nothing and moved the upper part his body steadily forward and backward. He is a former member of the Soviet Army who presents his "plan for the free construction of millions of apartments" to visitors. Because of this and other inventions he is worth "$1 billion per day" -- but nobody wants to pay. According to the press spokesman and director of the party newspaper, "ZHIRINOVSKIY'S TRUTH," Viktor Novosyeltsev, Vladimir Volfovich -- his code name is "locomotive" -- is "nice, friendly, and a good husband." Moreover, he is a "vigorous politician and not a shouting man as he likes to present himself. And he is by no means the man depicted by the hostile media. Asked about the number of members, the shy party spokesman mentions "about 100,000." They have to pay 1 percent of their monthly salaries and send their applications to the LDP address, marked for Mr. Zhirinovskiy's attention. These are the rules according to the party program. Some extra money can be earned through interviews. For $1,000, a date can be fixed, and if the party leader is in a good mood, the journalists even get a receipt. "This is common practice all over the world," Novosyeltsev explained. He does not know anything about funds from the KGB and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The party's structure as a one-man show "corresponds to the Russian mentality." To solve Russia's problems, "surgery and not therapy is required," a strong man "who spreads our ideas." Novosyeltsev did not know how to answer the question about what the LDP would do if it assumed power. "That is difficult to say." After a longer pause, he added: "The first thing would be an amnesty for political prisoners and prisoners who committed economic crimes." He continued: "Radical democrats and radical communists should be allowed to exist -- but not within the government."
