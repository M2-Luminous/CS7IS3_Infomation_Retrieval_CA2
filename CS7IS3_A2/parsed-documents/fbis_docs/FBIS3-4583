A KYODO NEWS SERVICE survey of politicians and people concerned in 47 prefectures found that more than 200 new single-seat districts will be invented according to the draft plan. Only 60 to 70 districts, mostly in the densely populated Kanto and Kinki regions, will be newly created under legal procedures after the expected passage of an amendment of the package of political reform bills in early March. The political reform bills, which were approved in January after a long battle in the Diet, calls for replacing the present 511 multiseat constituencies for the lower house with a mix of 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional representation seats. In about 45 new single-seat constituencies, the ruling coalition parties must single out their candidates since they have more than one incumbent lower house member in corresponding present multiseat districts. The opposition LDP, which was ousted from power last August by the coalition government headed by Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa, must make similar adjustments of their candidates in about 35 single-seat districts. Totally new districts in which there are virtually no "incumbent" members will come into existence as well, with the number of such districts reaching more than 90 for the ruling parties and nearly 120 for the LDP. The 8th Election System Council, a government advisory council, submitted the draft plan for redrawing electoral districts for the lower house in June 1991 to Kaifu, then prime minister and LDP president. In drawing up the 300 single-seat constituencies, the council set 549,000 as an upper limit for the population of a voting district and 274,000 as a lower limit. The population of six of the proposed constituencies will be allowed to remain below 274,000 as exceptions. On the council's plan, many of those surveyed complained that it ignores regional history and geographical conditions, but some said another plan would cause problems such as contradiction of the weight of vote per voter. Kaifu and his LDP successor Kiichi Miyazawa were dislodged from power due to their failure to achieve political reform. Kaifu, speaking to the LDP's local convention in Nagoya, central Japan, said Saturday politicians should not intervene in redrawing the single-seat districts. The government "should redraw (the electoral districts) fairly by entrusting the task with a third organization," he said.
