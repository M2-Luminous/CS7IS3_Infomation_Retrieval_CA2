The police have declared war on these gangs, on illegal drugs and on drug trafficking, he said. "I cannot say much about the police plans, but we have identified some 27 gangs linked to drugs and who are operating in the Corporate Area, the Commissioner told THE GLEANER. Metropolitan Crime Officer, Senior Superintendent Forbes, said the thrust in apprehending the drug "lords" will be intelligence-driven. This was in keeping with the recent statement by Minister of National Security and Justice, K.D. Knight, that the new type of policing will depend mostly on intelligence. Some of the communities identified by the police where the drug gangs operate out of are: Central Kingston, Tivoli Gardens, Upper Oxford Street, Hannah Town, Jones Town, Waterhouse and McIntyre Villa in the Kingston 16 area. Information reaching THE GLEANER is that some of these communities are now being probed by the police. Mr. Forbes said in the past there have been speculations as to the link between drugs and guns, but the police have now positively established that there is a link, as in some cases drug money is used to purchase guns. The Anti-Narcotic Department of the Force will play a major role in the drive against these drug gangs. The Division was the recipient of 18 new motor vehicles and some communication equipment yesterday. The vehicles include eight Toyota Corollas, four Isuzu Troopers, two Isuzu double-cab pick-ups, one Isuzu single cab pick-up, one Hiace 15 seater bus, one Toyota panel van and one Isuzu five-ton truck. They were donated to the Ministry of National Security and Justice by the United Nations International Drug Control Programme. Mr. Knight said the police have been working hard and wanted to double their efforts to combat the drug problem. Last year, the police recovered 80.79 kilograms of cocaine, 673 pieces of crack, one kilogram of heroin and 123.93 kilograms of hash oil; and a total of 6,915 persons were arrested by the police for breaches of the Dangerous Drugs Act.
