Export means increasing output capacity and employing all productive capacities in society. This in turn means expanding activity areas and absorbing a percentage of existing unemployment to "lift" the Egyptian economy from "stagnation" to "recovery." However, exporters face procedures that limit their activity. They must pay fees, which increases the cost of goods and makes them unable to compete in foreign markets. An exporter must pay eight different fees, the most recent of which is an explosives detection fee, even though security is the responsibility of the state, not exporters. That fee alone brings in 15 million Egyptian pounds per year. An exporter must also pay the value of 18 stamps; submit about 15 documents, including a certificate, a form, a license, an invoice, a receipt, etc.; and go through about 45 steps to complete export procedures. This, according to a report prepared by a joint committee of the Finance and Foreign Trade Ministry and the Federation of Industries. The report, submitted to the prime minister, "defines" problems and "recommends" solutions. Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi told me, following one of these meetings, chaired by President Husni Mubarak over a two-day period to discuss increasing exports with relevant ministers and heads of industrial and trade organizations, that he considers export "a key" to solving existing economic problems by stimulating output, increasing investment, and creating new jobs, which will drive the Egyptian economy into the "boom state" for which we all are striving. Prime Minister Sidqi said that we want to plan to push export capacity into the tens of billions of dollars annually. Economy Minister Mahmud Muhammad Mahmud told me that the problem is the trade deficit. He said, "I am not so much concerned with achieving a balance of `payments surplus' as I am with limiting the `trade balance deficit.' This deficit is behind the debts and stagnation. Hence, I am hoping for an increase in the export capacity [text mistakenly says "import capacity"]. All of us, the government and exporters, are placing ourselves in the service of this national goal. Before us are markets with which we can do business, such as the Arab and European markets. We have done business with the expanding American market to remedy the large deficit with the United States." The economy minister said that last year's trade deficit totaled more than $7 billion or 2.4 Egyptian pounds. However, a series of resolutions, to be announced following this week's plenary meeting chaired by the prime minister, contain comprehensive solutions for all of the problems impeding the export process. The chairman of the Federation of Industries, Muhammad Farid Khamis, believes that the problem centers on the endless procedures and fees, which increase export prices beyond what is competitive in foreign markets. Nonetheless, Muhammad Farid Khamis is optimistic about solving these problems after attending meetings chaired by President Mubarak, the prime minister, or other ministers, and attended by exporters and producers. Muhammad Farid Khamis emphasizes that export has become a national goal, because of its effect on all domestic economic activities and its national role in balancing the trade balance and the balance of payments to move away from the indebtedness caused by the trade deficit. Muhammad Farid Khamis states that the political leadership and the executive leadership are now taking up the cause of export and removing the constraints and complications that have limited export activity. They are also adopting a clearly defined and targeted export strategy for the present and future, which is based on the position of the national economy and the situation in international markets. Muhammad Farid Khamis optimistic talk is based on his participation in plenary meetings or specialized committees in the ministries, which have prepared recommendations and submitted them to the political and executive leaders. The chairman of the Federation of Banks, Mahmud 'Abd-al-'Aziz, emphasizes the banking system's role in stimulating exports and providing essential services to exporters, the most important being the implementation of export credits, which totaled more than 6,000, valued at more than 10 billion pounds during the past fiscal year. The chairman of the Exhibitions and International Markets Authority, Hamid 'Atwah, calls for greater participation in international markets. State help, and greater help from the sector that produces for export, is needed to finance this participation and to set up exhibitions to introduce Egyptian products. Dr. Madhat al-Juwayni, the head of the Trade Representation Agency, believes that it is necessary to support the agency and expand the trade representation in countries targeted by Egyptian exports and in countries whose markets we hope to enter to introduce them to Egyptian goods. Also commercial attaches should prepare reports and studies on opportunities for Egyptian exports in foreign markets. Such information is important to both the government and exporters and should be used by them. Regarding exporters' complaints about export supervision agencies, Salah-al-Din 'Awad, the head of the General Supervisory Board for Exports and Imports, states that export supervision is to the exporters' advantage, because it ensures "quality." The authority also benefits agricultural exports through packing, sorting, and canning stations. In addition, it has scientific agencies, unparalleled in the Middle East, for monitoring incoming goods. Salah 'Awad states: If there is a desire to eliminate supervision, nothing stands in the way. Just consider what happened in 1987, when we eliminated supervision of agricultural exports. These exports dropped from 94,000 tons to 64,000 tons, because a number of exporters did not maintain quality. Shipments were lost, and the national economy lost. He adds: We have 20,000 exporters. Among them are honorable people. Also among them are people who are not up to par. They harm Egyptian products in foreign markets by exporting products that do not meet standards for quality. Dr. Hazim al-Babilawi is the chairman of a bank which specializes in developing exports. He states his view on this vital issue as follows: Neglecting exports means greater reliance on imports, which increases our foreign debts. What is needed is an export strategy based on export industries, the elimination of bureaucratic and procedural barriers, the establishment of a database to determine trends in foreign markets, and the pursuit of a flexible domestic policy that takes into account continuous changes, with attention to reducing the cost of goods and maintaining quality, so that goods are competitive. What are the problems facing the development of exports and their proposed solutions? By tracking the reports and discussions of plenary committees or technical subcommittees, we can identify, define, and publicize these problems and their solutions. Such reports include those prepared by the Federation of Industries, the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, businessmen, the Trade Representation Agency, and the General Supervisory Board for Exports and Imports. All of these reports enable one to inventory these problems and to gather all of the proposed solutions as well as recommendations for now and the future. The problems now affecting exporters concern the many burdens encumbering them. These burdens, which restrict our ability to increase Egyptian exports because they limit the competitiveness of those exports in foreign markets, include the following: - The lengthy documentation cycle required in the export process. Export procedures include more than 45 steps, which are implemented in more than one place. The integrated provision of services at one location is needed. - An abundance of forms and papers to be processed, difficulty in obtaining some of these forms and papers at times, and the need to process more than 15 documents between the certificate, form, license, request, invoice, and receipt. - A multiplicity of fees, stamps, and the equivalent of stamps collected under numerous names at airports, ports, and loading stations. These growing costs, which have become a real burden for exporters, ultimately affect the price of Egyptian goods. Eight types of fees are imposed under numerous names and headings. The state collects fees for services for which it, not the exporter, should pay, e.g., the fee for explosives detection. - The multiplicity of control processes. Shipments are inspected by the export supervision agencies and permits are issued for them. Agricultural shipments are then inspected by the agricultural quarantine agencies, which require additional forms and fees in order to issue an agricultural certificate. The Export Supervisory Board then requires additional applications to obtain a certificate of origin. The committee formed by the economy and foreign trade minister to examine export problems has called for: reducing the number of steps required; seeking unconventional solutions to export barriers; freeing exports from all constraints; supporting and coordinating between export agencies and organizations; expediting the formation of a national high committee for exports; eliminating the monopoly in shipping services and exposing companies in the public business sector and private sector to competition, given the large disparity between the prices fixed for services at Egyptian airports and ports compared to the prices paid in other countries by exporters for such services, despite the lack of improvement in Egypt in these services and their prices, which have been rising since 1987; expediting promulgation of the Currency Law, whose draft is devoid of any requirement for the TS [expansion not given] Form, considered one of the greatest obstacles in export procedures. 55 Recommendations The technical committee formed to examine export problems has issued 55 recommendations, including 17 to the Economy Ministry, 19 to the Finance Ministry, seven to the Agriculture Ministry, six to the Transport and Communications Ministry, two to the Industry Ministry, two to the prime minister, one to the Petroleum Ministry, one to the New Urban Communities Ministry, and one to the Electricity Ministry. The report by the ministerial technical committee recommended that the Economy Ministry take several measures to help boost Egyptian exports, the most important being to: compensate exporters for the strength of the US dollar; reduce export service fees in governmental departments; provide low-interest financing for export activity; remedy debt problems with the banking system; lower the cost of banking services; exempt imports of raw materials for factories from export and import control measures; disburse incentives for exports amounting to 5 to 20 percent of the value of the commodity exported, depending on its type; refrain from prohibiting the export of any good, lest it lose its position in world markets; permit the import of oil products for industrial use; establish an export support fund financed by a fee on imports; be satisfied with a single form, "Customs 13," to end all export procedures related to customs, agricultural quarantine, and export control. The most important recommendations made to the Finance Ministry are to: exempt export activity from taxes for a defined period; stop deducting 1 percent of the proceeds of exports as a tax; eliminate the sales tax on machinery and spare parts, all requirements for stamps on export documents, and the proportional stamp tax on the capital of share companies; reduce customs on production inputs not produced in Egypt; implement a simple tax rebate system that returns to the exporter, after exportation is effected, customs and sales tax on imported components and services, fees, and different taxes; eliminate administrative fees and expenses imposed on industry under various headings; not permit the imposition of any burdens without the cabinet's consent; and include the members of the chambers of specialized industry in customs arbitration committees. The recommendations made to the Agriculture Ministry are to: establish funds to balance agricultural produce prices to prevent producers from being hurt in the event of an abundant crop amid a slow world market; apply a strict agricultural cycle regarding several crops, the most important being potatoes; eliminate agricultural quarantine fees for exports; create a national project to combat pests and diseases; focus on the discovery of new breeds of high-yield, disease-resistant crop seeds. The recommendations that must be implemented by the Transport and Communications Ministry are to: reduce the fees of shipping agencies, ports, and airports; reduce maritime and air freight charges; and systematically provide refrigerated containers for shipment of perishables to Arab, African, and European markets. The Federation of Industries recommended that the Petroleum Ministry lower fuel and energy prices with respect to exported goods. The recommendations called on the Industry Ministry to review the standard specifications of exports issued by the General Standards Authority, and to limit compliance with standards to security and safety goods and injurious goods. The prime minister was called upon to; ensure that no governmental agency would require fees of any type for export procedures, except for those defined previously in the unified fee; free all types of Egyptian commodities from any constraints stemming from requirements to obtain prior approvals from any agency regarding the type, quantity, or price of an export, as long as export of the good is permitted. In view of the ongoing increases in energy prices, the Federation of Industries recommended that energy prices applicable to industrial activity be fixed for at least three years, and that a good pricing policy be formulated for energy consumption by factories.
