Only one deputy -- Vildan Uzbekov -- retains his position. His resignation request was turned down, unlike those of Eduard Denisov, Ivan Zemlyanushin, and Vladimir Kravtsev. It will be recalled that all four handed in resignation requests after the example of former general prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik. At the moment Ivan Zemlyanushin and Vladimir Kravtsev are on vacation and will be given jobs in prosecutor's office bodies upon their return, with their preferences taken into account. According to some information, Mr. Kravtsev was offered a rather high position in this same General Prosecutor's Office even before his vacation. Eduard Denisov has since been appointed deputy to the Moscow Oblast prosecutor. All those resigned and newly appointed to deputy positions have a substantial length of service with the prosecuting bodies. Oleg Gaydanov joined the General Prosecutor's Office under Aleksey Kazannik and headed the investigation directorate. Valentin Panichev, who joined it under Valentin Stepankov, retains his position of chief military prosecutor. Mikhail Slavgorodskiy, who also joined the service under Stepankov and was dismissed under Kazannik, is back in the prosecuting citadel. A question to be resolved today is what are to be the areas of responsibility of Mr. Ilyushenko's new deputies.
