However, I think it could last longer depending on the questions. Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to ask you if that is all right? [Hosokawa] Yes. [Dean of press corps] As dean of the press corps, I would first like to ask three questions. Following that the other reporters will have a chance. [Hosokawa] Before I field any questions may I say something? [Dean of press corps] Please, go ahead. [Hosokawa] In response to an agreement reached at a meeting of representatives of the ruling coalition parties this morning, leaders of the government and the ruling coalition parties held a meeting at midday to make a final decision on the tax issue in which people are greatly interested. Before outlining the agreement, I would like to point out that the national welfare tax that I announced, together with our policymaking process, have been publicly criticized and I would like to offer my frank apology to the people for this. I would like to outline the agreement. The first point is that income tax cuts amounting to 6 trillion yen will be implemented ahead of a tax rise in fiscal year 1994. The second is that a consultative body will be set up within the ruling coalition to discuss tax reform. The consultative body is mandated to discuss how to fashion a vision of a welfare society, how the people should share the burden of a society of senior citizens, and how the current tax system should be reformed. The consultative body is also mandated to discuss ways to cut taxes and secure financial resources to make up for a fiscal shortfall arising from the tax cuts. Relevant laws will be enacted at a Diet session within this year upon agreement among the ruling coalition parties. I have recently proposed a draft of the tax reform on the basis of discussions held by the Government Tax System Research Council since last autumn, and on a series of lively consultations between the government and ruling coalition parties. But a ruling partner has raised an objection to the tax reform draft. In response, I have asked the ruling coalition parties to coordinate their views again and they reached agreement today. With the ruling coalition parties reaching the agreement, a bill on cutting income tax by 6 trillion yen will be introduced to the Diet during its current session. I understand that a clear path has been drawn toward drastic tax system reform. Discussion will be conducted by the consultative body, which will take into account the ideas I have proposed. I intend to work out a draft of the government's plan for reform of the tax system based on a proposal to be drawn up by the ruling coalition parties. [Dean of the press corps] Mr. Prime Minister, you said a while ago that you apologize to the people. The national welfare tax that you announced has been scrapped. That means your decision has been overturned. Mr. Prime Minister, how are you going to take responsibility for that? I think you are politically responsible for the public criticism. Mr. Prime Minister, would you explain what you have apologized about? [Hosokawa] I believe the biggest issue is our policy decision process. Of course, people have talked about various aspects of the national welfare tax. Among other things, they have pointed out that the policymaking process was overly hasty. I have to apologize to the people for creating that impression. The policymaking process of the ruling coalition parties is one of interparty negotiations and I believe this kind of process has its limitations. As a result, the outcome of interparty discussions are prone to be leaked. I think the process probably creates the impression that the ruling coalition parties are in disarray over policy. As for the importance of my remarks as prime minister, I have always kept that in mind. I believe that I will undergo a process of trial and error in the course of making policy decisions. If there is something I need to correct, I will not hesitate to correct it. [Dean of the press corps] At one time there existed a situation wherein it was questionable which side would formulate a compromise plan between the government and the ruling coalition parties. Some have pointed out that such a situation was created by the ambiguity of the prime minister's instructions and his lack of leadership. Prime Minister, what do you think of this criticism? [Hosokawa] Since the tax issue is important, I have asked the ruling coalition parties to engage in full discussions of the issue. My proposal for the national welfare tax was rejected by one of the ruling coalition parties, and the expression scrapping has been used. Nonetheless, I have asked the meeting of the representatives of the ruling coalition parties to again discuss in detail the tax issue, and this morning the ruling coalition parties reached the agreement I mentioned at this news conference. [Dean of the press corps] Prime minister, you have said the ruling coalition parties will discuss the reform of the current tax system and the securing of financial resources to make up for a fiscal shortfall incurred from future tax cuts. Prime Minister, would you explain through what process the ruling coalition parties will discuss them? Prime Minister, you said you have asked the ruling coalition parties to discuss reforming the current tax system, taking your proposal into account. Prime Minister, some feel your proposal has been scrapped. What do you think of this? [Hosokawa] The ruling coalition parties will discuss ways to reform the current tax system. As for your question about through what process the ruling coalition parties hold discussions, I do not know. However, they will draw a conclusion within this year on the issue of securing financial resources to make up for the financial shortfalls arising from tax cuts. I hope they will work on drawing a conclusion to the issue at the earliest date. [Dean of the press corps] Then, please, ask questions. [Correspondent] My question concerns how the tax cuts will spur the economy. According to an estimate, a salaried household with two children and an annual income of 5 million yen will benefit only about 40,000 yen a year from the tax cuts. A salaried household with two children and an annual income of 8 million yen will benefit only 160,000 yen a year from the tax cuts. Given these tax benefits, I wonder if the tax cuts will generate the desired effect of stimulating the economy. Prime Minister, what do you think? [Hosokawa] It is very hard for me to explain the effect of the tax cuts in numerical and quantitative terms. However, we need to put our nation's economy on a path to full-fledged recovery. To that end, we should adopt various policies, and our adoption of those policies has been strongly demanded by foreign nations and our own people. The reductions in the income tax will spur personal spending and investments in equipment and plants, bringing the pervasive effect to the entire economy. My view is that the cuts in the income tax will contribute to a recovery of the economy. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, you have just expressed your apology and have pointed out that the policy decision process is at issue. Given the last week of political vacuum, I would like to ask you, how do you plan to change the process in the future? [Hosokawa] My answer may be a repetition of what I have just said. Various discussions held by the coalition government have been made public, and this is a good aspect of it. As I just mentioned a while ago, the ruling coalition parties have given the impression that they delayed in making a final decision prior to making the decision public. They present these two aspects. Now, the ruling coalition parties hold the meeting of their secretaries in charge of the policy affairs, the meeting of secretaries in charge of the tax affairs, and the meeting of their representatives. The government and the ruling coalition parties hold their meetings. Major issues are decided at those meetings. I intend to work to prevent a recurrence of the latest situation in the future. I believe I will have to keep that point in mind. [Correspondent] What about the issue of who is responsible? [Hosokawa] As I have said, I think this has proved a very difficult issue. It has not only involved negotiation among the ruling parties on the issue itself, but discussion about what the coalition administration ought to be like. As this is our first, fully fledged coalition administration and it is still new, I would hope people will understand that we are bound to have some trial and error. The ruling coalition parties will work to prevent a recurrence of such a situation, and they will concede to each other when they need to do so. I intend to work hard to keep the coalition government functioning smoothly. [Correspondent] You made similar remarks when you met reporters on Friday. But I am sure you did not offer such an apology at that time. Have you changed your mind over the past few days in now making an apology? [Hosokawa] Of course I had such feelings when I met reporters a few days ago, but the issue was not resolved at the time. I intended to express my views concerning the current confusion when the issue was resolved and the prospects for the tax issue were clearer. [Correspondent] Do you still believe the idea of introducing a national welfare tax is right? [Hosokawa] Since last fall, from about 3 September when I attended a meeting of the Tax Commission, I have expressed my views about how the taxation system should be changed to reflect the fact that society will have to deal with increasing numbers of senior citizens. There is also the issue of how tax cuts should be implemented to deal with the current economic recession. The Tax Commission discussed these issues for more than two months to try to seek a way to satisfy these two factors. After that, discussion has been held at policymaking meetings of secretaries general of the ruling coalition parties, meetings of their economic consultative body, and meetings of representatives of the coalition. I have repeatedly stated my views at Diet sessions since last September. I also asked the Tax Commission to discuss the tax issue in line with my view that unless a well-balanced taxation system of income, consumption, and property taxes is established, Japan cannot prepare for the future aging of society. This basic view has not changed. [Correspondent] Do you mean that you want the ruling coalition parties to discuss the tax issue based on the idea, which you recently announced, of introducing a 7 percent tax in three years? [Hosokawa] No, I do not. I hope that the consultative body of the ruling coalition will hold discussions in the future based on my basic view. At present, though, I am not sticking to the tax rate or anything. [Correspondent] I repeat a question about the national welfare tax. The proposal to introduce the national welfare tax has been killed. Do you refuse to withdraw or give up your proposal, and do you intend to maintain the need for a national welfare tax in the future? [Hosokawa] No, I do not. I announced earlier that the proposal was politically frozen. After it was frozen, a new decision was made at a meeting of representatives of the ruling coalition. As I stated earlier, I think that they will probably discuss the tax issue while keeping my view in mind. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, you are holding this news conference to apologize to the people for what you have done. Prime Minister, you have said that it is inevitable for the coalition government to undergo a process of trial and error, while repeatedly saying you are aware of your political responsibility. I wonder if you are really reflecting on what you have done? This is my frank feeling. Prime Minister, you called a news conference to explicitly say to the people that you plan to adopt the national welfare tax. The people see the reversal of your plan to adopt the tax system as inconceivable. This is what the people frankly feel. At this news conference, I wonder if you feel political responsibility. What do you think of your political responsibility? [Hosokawa] I think your question is very tough and forthright. As Japan moves toward a society of senior citizens, Japanese should share their due burden for society. I have said as much to that effect at the Diet. I also made that statement when I announced the government's vision of a welfare society. I have consistently thought of measures to be taken for a society of senior citizens. Certainly, though, I will not deny that the national welfare tax was announced in a sudden and hasty manner. I am tasked with tentatively deciding on the fiscal 1994 budget and compiling the third supplementary budget. I also have to announce the government's fiscal measures for local governments. And I have to prepare for Japan-U.S. summit talks. I made a decision on the national welfare tax under very difficult circumstances. I do not deny I was hasty in making the decision. I frankly apologize for my haste. I hope the people will understand such circumstances. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, you have repeatedly said that the process is what is at issue. What is at issue is not the process. Prime Minister, what you announced to the people has been reversed, and I think that as the top official in charge of our nation, you are responsible for that reversal. Prime Minister, my feeling is you cannot be released from responsibility by simply saying the process is at issue. Prime Minister, do you not share my feelings? [Hosokawa] I have said I will constantly keep the weight of my remarks as prime minister in mind. Although I am sorry for repeating my statement, my coalition government is the first full-fledged coalition government Japan has had. There have been various discussions. I announced the national welfare tax not as the coalition government's proposal, but as my own proposal. My proposal has not been accepted by the ruling coalition parties and I would like to offer my frank apology on that point. I intend to resolve the tax issue on the basis of the agreement reached among the ruling coalition parties. [Correspondent] As the Japan-U.S. summit meeting is to be held on 11 February, do you think the United States will rate the tax cut plan highly even though the legislation on the 6-trillion-yen tax cut will be effective for only one year? [Hosokawa] I think the United States will rate the tax cut plan highly. [Correspondent] It seems from what has been said so far that you admit the previous decisionmaking process was faulty, but feel this was an issue which required the approval of the ruling coalition parties. Contradicting what you have said since you referred the tax issue to the Tax Commission, you eventually came up with the idea of the national welfare tax. As we look at the problem, it seems questionable whether thorough discussion has actually ever been held among the ruling coalition parties, considering the course of events that lead to your making such an announcement. For example, even Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who happens to be here, said he was unaware of your decision until the last minute. Do you intend to change this manner of decisionmaking? This is the first question, and here is another. It has been revealed the tax cuts will be not be permanent. I feel the truth is that the real problem has been shelved because the legislation is effective for only one year. Anyhow, as there will be a 6-trillion-yen revenue shortfall due to the planned tax cut, you say that necessary steps will be taken to secure a definite source of revenue to make up such shortfalls and that a drastic reform of the tax system will be implemented by the year-end. Are we to understand that you intend to sincerely stake your political future on carrying this out by the year-end to fulfill your responsibility to the people? [Hosokawa] I shall answer the latter question first. The government and the ruling coalition parties will make concerted efforts to reform the current tax system. I believe the passage of tax system reform legislation, within the period I have promised to the public, is the fulfillment of my most important political responsibility. As for what I think of the decisionmaking process, I must frankly admit that this is a rather difficult matter. Even yesterday, as a result of the situation, I held discussions on the tax issue with the chief cabinet minister and others. Getting down to business, we asked each other what steps could be taken. In form, there are various forums, such as a meeting of secretaries general on policy affairs. However, we have here five secretaries general. This is different from the situation in which a single party is in power: Then there is only one secretary general, one general council chairman, and one policy research council chairman. In our case, there are five policy research council chairmen, five general council chairmen, and five secretaries general. Matters must be cleared at these various levels. I am amazed by the difficulties we face. Frankly speaking, I realize we must correct these problems as much as possible. [Correspondent] You mentioned the term political responsibility. I would like to confirm that this means you intend to resign from your post as prime minister? [Hosokawa] No, I did not say that. I said that for the government and ruling coalition parties to try to their utmost to fulfill their roles constitutes fulfillment of political responsibility. [Correspondent] Is this what you refer to as the prime minister's responsibility? [Hosokawa] As I have just said, it is nothing more than that. I believe that to put all our efforts into this and get tax measures implemented would satisfy the expectations of the people. [Correspondent] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has taken quite a hard-line stance on the tax issue, even threatening to break away from the coalition government. As the breakaway failed to materialize this time, does it mean that in the future no party within the coalition will ever take steps toward this end? [Hosokawa] I do not know about that. We cannot tell what kind of problems may arise in the future, nor what kind of approach each party will take on the various problems. In each case, parties will have to make self-sacrifices. I believe the ruling coalition parties will make every effort to hold themselves together in the future. It is my earnest desire that we all try to do this. [Correspondent] Prime Minister, ever since your inauguration you have advocated consumer-oriented policies and politics geared toward the people. However, this time we have the impression you have been turning your attention to Nagata-cho [a district in Tokyo where the Diet building is located] and Kasumigaseki [a district in Tokyo where government ministries and agencies are located]. Does this not run contrary to your principles? [Hosokawa] I feel taxes are certainly an issue that draws strong public interest. However, as I have repeatedly said, I question whether it is correct to maintain a tax system which deprives people of their desire to work while in the prime of their lives. In order to construct an aging society which is full of vitality, I think everyone of us needs to share necessary burdens. Otherwise society as such will cease to exist in the future. In this regard, we have to say things which people do not want to hear, though of course it is true that sovereignty resides with the people. We must all have a common understanding and determination to construct a new society. I believe politicians should say this to the people in a straightforward manner. [Correspondent] Do you not think that a willingness to discuss this with the people is important? [Hosokawa] That is correct. [Correspondent] Do you not think that the people disapproved of your unilateral announcement, and that the manner in which you made the announcement was the issue of debate? [Hosokawa] Regarding that point, as I have said before, I feel a thorough discussion has not been held. However, the tax commission is an organization which consists of experts representing the people. I asked the tax commission in early September -- 3 September -- to study how to establish a tax system that is well-balanced regarding consumer capital and income. Moreover, I had parties hold discussions on the issue within their respective intraparty organizations. Therefore, I feel a certain amount of time has been spent on studying the issue. However, I also agree that more time should be spent on it. [Correspondent] Looking back at recent movements, we get the impression that the Ministry of Finance holds strong power within the government. You have launched various reform plans, and now it seems you will have to start changing the ministries and agencies. We are uncertain about your reform plans. [Hosokawa] I often hear that. However, it is not correct. Needless to say, the financial authorities have their own ideas. But even during the recent events, the financial authorities have hardly had a chance to talk to me directly, except yesterday or the day before when I asked the minister of finance and other financial authorities to come to the official residence. I instructed them to listen to the opinions of the coalition parties and cooperate with them in ironing out our differences. The Ministry of Finance did not insist on their demands or try to steamroll us. In a sense, it is natural for them to say no to what they cannot accept; their stance is natural. Otherwise they cannot fulfill their responsibilities as financial authorities. I think the important thing is for politicians to take the lead or give guidance to the financial authorities, while also giving consideration to their opinions. [Correspondent] You have mentioned several times the government's Tax System Research Council as an example that you have spent enough time on discussions. But the Tax System Research Council is a government organization, and its members were not elected by the people. When it came to tax issues while it was in power, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] spent forever on discussions with the party. To the bureaucrats, it might have appeared a very inefficient process of flattering and pacifying the voters by merely listening to their complaints. However, this time the process of discussion was reported by the media, so the people were able to pinpoint the problems. They were able to think along with the politicians. Prime Minister, do you think the LDP's endless discussions within the party were inefficient? [Hosokawa] Well, I do not know. As I said earlier, the coalition administration is still in the stage of trial and error, and is trying to find an ideal way of carrying out discussions not only on the tax issue but also on other matters as well. I also said there may be many points which we need to continue to improve. The Policy Board is studying the tax system. We are also talking about the possibility of forming an organ which is similar to the LDP's Tax System Research Council. We will try to form such an organ after reaching a consensus among the coalition parties. Any more questions? [Dean of Press Corps] Do you have any more questions?
