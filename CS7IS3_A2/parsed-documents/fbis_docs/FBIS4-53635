Pointing to the scheduled start of the Rimpac manoeuvres, he says: "The Naval forces of the United States, Japan and the South Korean puppets plan to form the first unified fleet ever in history and stage a joint operation against fleets of other countries. "This is a military action which must not go unnoticed in view of the arms buildup the United States is forcing in South Korea while seeking 'sanctions' against the DPRK over its fictitious 'nuclear issue.' "The joint operation is going to be staged by a unified fleet this time while the military bosses of the United States, Japan and South Korea are holding aggressive confabs repeatedly against the DPRK, visiting each other frequently. This is a vivid proof that the three-way military alliance with the United States as the axis, which was formed long ago for stifling the DPRK and other Asian socialist countries, is stepping into the stage of practical action. "We cannot but be alerted against the United States bringing into the open through such joint operation its intention to force the military action against the DPRK, come what may. "The Korean people are not afraid of anyone's military action but are prepared to counter the U.S.-orchestrated multinational military action. "The dangerous military situation created in and around the Korean peninsula today proves the validity and opportuneness of the overture of the DPRK for negotiations to establish a durable peace arrangement that will replace the military armistice machine in Korea and urgently demands its early realisation. "The United States must know that it is a reasonable act either in view of the interests of the United States itself or in view of the guarantee of regional peace to respond to the peaceful overture of the DPRK, instead of taking adventurous military actions against it with the mobilisation of its satellites. "Otherwise, the DPRK will no longer be able to discharge its duties under the Korean Armistice Agreement, and the United States must know this."
