In issuing a party statement, Michihiko Kano said the Diet must enact a bill to delineate constituencies during the current 150-day regular session, which may be extended past the June 29 deadline in order to pass it. New Party Mirai's statement countered calls from both the ruling and opposition parties for an early dissolution of the House of Representatives for a snap general election even under the existing multiseat constituencies. Kano and four others quit the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) last month amid political unrest sparked by then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's April 8 announcement to resign. They formed the new party on April 18.
