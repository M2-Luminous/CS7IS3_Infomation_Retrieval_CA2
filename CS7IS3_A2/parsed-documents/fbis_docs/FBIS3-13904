The sources say that the Iraqis have for some time been considering taking a "dramatic" step to open the land road between the Iraqi border and the Turkish border, a major part of which is controlled by Kurdish gunmen. That road is of considerable strategic and economic importance to Iraq. The sources revealed that the Iraqi Government had some time ago raised this matter with the Turkish Government and that Ankara was very enthusiastic about it on the following grounds: 1. Opening that road would lead to Turkish economic recovery and would mean that Turkey would be the only or almost the only state with access to the Iraqi markets. It is known that Turkey and some other states neighboring Iraq are paid for their exports to Iraqi markets in crude or refined oil for local consumption. 2. Joint Iraqi-Turkish control of that road and border areas in general would ease some of the military burdens resulting from the presence of elements of the Kurdish Workers Party of Turkey in that area. The same sources speak of increasing Iraqi military activity in recent days on the northern front and in the direction of the road. They do not rule out a sudden and swift Iraqi military action to open the road as quickly as possible and present the Western alliance and the whole world with a fait accompli. It is generally believed in this connection that Baghdad is convinced that the atmosphere at the UN Security Council following the positions taken by France, Russia, and China would preclude military action against Iraq, particularly if the action the latter threatened to take was only confined to reopening the land road with Turkey. More than one concerned party believes it to be unlikely that Iraq would go beyond this limited "tactical" step, and they also believe that Baghdad is not about to take any military action in the direction of the south on the border with Kuwait and that the most it might do there is send a few hundred Iraqi peasants back to the land taken from them under the amended border demarcation and let them stay there as a form of open sit-in. An Arab diplomat working in Baghdad, however, believes the Iraqi people and the Iraqi Government no longer have any will to fight and that President Saddam Husayn's mention of the possibility of "retaliation" if the embargo continued was misunderstood, did not imply any military threat, and was only a call on the Iraqis to be patient and to rely on the time factor.
