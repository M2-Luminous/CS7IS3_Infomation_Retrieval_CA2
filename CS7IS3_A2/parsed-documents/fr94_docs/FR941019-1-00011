FR941019-1-00011 FR941019-1-00001 Regulatory Analysis The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis 6 for this proposed rule that examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered. This analysis is documented in a report entitled, ``Regulatory Analysis in Accordance with 10 CFR 50.109: Requirements for Shutdown and Low-Power Operations at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, N.W. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained from Kulin Desai, Division of Systems Safety and Analysis, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001, Telephone: (301) 504&hyph;2835. 6 The current regulatory analysis only addresses the LCO and SR Option for controls for specific equipment relied upon during shutdown and low-power operations, whereas the proposed rule allows for incorporation of controls including technical specifications limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) and (3), or plant procedures required by technical specifications administrative controls pursuant to 10 CFR 50.36(c)(5). The staff plans to revise the regulatory analysis to incorporate consideration of other alternatives as appropriate for equipment controls during shutdown and low-power operations. In addition, the staff will consider the following in the revised regulatory analysis: (1) insights gained from the recent NRC PRAs for shutdown and low-power operations at Surry and Grand Gulf; (2) industry improvements made in outages; (3) comments received from ACRS, CRGR and the Commission; and (4) specific industry comments on the draft regulatory analysis documented in a letter from NUMARC dated January 11, 1994, in a letter from NEI dated March 28, 1994 and in a letter from CEOG dated April 8, 1994. The Commission requests public comments on the proposed rule, draft Regulatory Guide, ``Shutdown and Low-Power Operations at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and the draft report documenting the regulatory analysis, entitled, ``Regulatory Analysis in Accordance with 10 CFR 50.109: Requirements for Shutdown and Low-Power Operations at Nuclear Power Plants.'' Regulatory Flexibility Certification In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that, if promulgated, this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule would affect only the licensing and operation of nuclear power plants. The companies that own these plants do not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities'' as given in the Regulatory Flexibility Act or the Small Business Size Standards in regulations issued by the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR Part 121. Backfit Analysis As required by 10 CFR 50.109, a backfit analysis has been performed for the proposed rule. The backfit analysis on which this determination is based is included in the report entitled, ``Regulatory Analysis in Accordance with 10 CFR 50.109: Requirements for Shutdown and Low-Power Operations at Nuclear Power Plants,'' dated December 1993. The backfit analysis approach emphasized a qualitative estimation supplemented by a quantitative analysis for bounding conditions as reflected in the regulatory analysis. The backfit analysis and the regulatory analysis will be revised based on comments received from the public. The Commission has determined, based on this analysis, that backfitting to comply with the requirements of this proposed rule will provide a substantial increase in protection to public health and safety because it would: (1) reduce the frequency of events caused by poor planning and control of activities during outages; (2) ensure availability of key safety functions during shutdown and low-power operations at all plants; (3) ensure that a method of decay heat removal remains viable in the event of a fire in any plant area during cold shutdown or refueling conditions; and (4) provide accurate instrumentation for PWRs to use when draining the reactor coolant system to a midloop configuration to avoid air binding and eventual loss of residual heat removal pumps. The Commission has further determined the cost of implementing the new requirements is justified for PWRs in view of the increase in protection attributable to the proposed backfits but plans to specifically reassess BWRs following consideration of comments on this proposed rulemaking. List of Subjects Antitrust, Classified information, Criminal penalties, Fire protection, Intergovernmental relations, Nuclear power plants and reactors, Radiation protection, Reactor siting criteria, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons given in the preamble and under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended and 5 U.S.C. 553, the NRC is proposing to adopt the following amendments to 10 CFR Part 50.
