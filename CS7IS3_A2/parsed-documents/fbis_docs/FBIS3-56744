The personal mutual understanding between Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov has clearly broken down, and taking account of the major tactical disagreements between Gaydar and Gennadiy Burbulis, this points to a serious split within Russia's Choice. It was natural and inevitable that political relations would have to be clarified after the blow of the 12 December election results. Russia's Choice is now becoming what amounts to a constructive opposition to the government, and is entering new and very complex relations with the president. A key role will be played in Viktor Chernomyrdin's new government by professionals with centrist views, close to directors' circles. In a new spiral, and in different conditions, a government of experienced managers is being set up which is ideologically related in many ways to the Ryzhkov-Abalkin cabinet. Only one person is left in the government today from the government of the first Yegor Gaydar cabinet of two years ago -- Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State Committee for the Management of State Property. Anatoliy Borisovich, you have found yourself in proud and romantic isolation, alone among strangers. What will you do in a government without Gaydar and Fedorov? [Chubays] Well, first of all the decision on Fedorov has not yet been adopted, so I would not draw such unequivocal conclusions, let us wait a little. Second, I do not entirely agree that Chubays has been left alone in the government, it must be said that I have been working with these people for more than a year now. Relations have certainly not always been simple, and there are serious difficulties as well, but nevertheless there has been real work on privatization with these people in this government, and everything that has been done on privatization has been done in this line-up. So we have experience of work in a friendly environment, a not entirely friendly environment, and an entirely unfriendly environment. [Svanidze] How is the environment now? [Chubays] I am ready to answer that question as soon as the new government line-up is announced. [Svanidze] Anatoliy Borisovich, do you see yourself now more as deputy prime minister or as a member of the Russia's Choice bloc? [Chubays] Both, to an identical degree. Furthermore, I think it is important that Gaydar's actions too -- I think it has not yet been fully understood, but they must be regarded not as the actions of Yegor Gaydar personally but as the actions of the leader of a major political bloc. I remind you, by the way, that today Russia's Choice has the most seats in the State Duma, significantly more than either Zhirinovskiy or the Interregional group. Gaydar as an individual perhaps might have followed some other line, but as leader of the bloc, he is acting as a leader should act. [Svanidze] Anatoliy Borisovich, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is a firm man. How do you find working with him? [Chubays] I don't think it would be proper for me to assess my own actions, but I have worked and work in the government only as long as I follow the line which I consider to be the right one, which I can answer for. That means that I have followed that line until today, and it is that line which I can answer for. [Svanidze] So the character of the leadership does not worry you in this instance? [Chubays] No, why do you say that? The character of the leadership is very important for me, and I think that the premier of the government has to be a firm man, that is his duty. Otherwise there is nothing underpinning you, otherwise it is simply impossible to work. [Svanidze] In that respect Viktor Stepanovich's personal qualities suit you? [Chubays] From the point of view of the firmness of his character, undoubtedly. [Svanidze] Anatoliy Borisovich, we have a triangle here: Viktor Chernomyrdin and his government, President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, and the reformist party bloc. Which of them do you plan to be guided by the most? [Chubays] Things have worked out in such a way that the job I do would be impossible without the president's personal support. It would be impossible without the personal support of Gaydar, and everything Gaydar did back in the first government from 1990. It would be impossible without the present government as well. Relations have been quite complex within the government, but in spite of that, the line has been maintained, and I remind you that my version of the privatization program was adopted at a session of the government a month ago. Therefore it is, if you like, the work of several authors -- the president, the government, and the Russia's Choice bloc, probably to varying degrees. [Svanidze] You are answering about your work, but I am asking about you, whom do you as a politician intend to follow? After all, the president, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and the reformers, let us say in Russia's Choice, do not occupy the same positions on all issues. [Chubays] I intend to follow the fulfillment of those duties which I personally as a member of the government took on before the people when I began the issue of privatization checks on 1 October 1992, and I am compelled to discharge these duties in full, all the more so as our program is fully supported by Russia's Choice, and in the Russia's Choice program there is a whole section on privatization, which I wrote myself. [Svanidze] What stance do you think the president should now be adopting: father of the nation, the supreme arbitrator, or a person persistently following a definite line? [Chubays] Undoubtedly the president is unable to choose some kind of black or white position for himself. So it is a question not of either one or the other, but of finding correlations between degrees or measures. I am convinced that the president will remain president as long as he remains the guarantor of reform in Russia. [Svanidze] But for how long will he be the guarantor of reform in Russia, if we are talking about Yeltsin? At the moment it is a question of whether he should weigh up all positions, like the statue personifying justice, or whether he should have political preferences of some kind. [Chubays] He must undoubtedly have political preferences and be guided by the reforms, but at the same time, he must of course weigh up the balance of political forces. [Svanidze] But he must demonstrate preferences? [Chubays] I think so. [Svanidze] Thank you. I remind you that you were watching Anatoliy Borisovich Chubays live on Russian television on the "Details" program. Goodbye.
