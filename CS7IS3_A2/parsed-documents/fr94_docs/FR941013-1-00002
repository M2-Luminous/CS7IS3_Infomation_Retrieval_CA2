FR941013-1-00002 FR941013-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;22&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Aircraft Limited (Formerly British Aerospace, Regional Airlines Limited) Jetstream Model 3101 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM); Reopening of the comment period. SUMMARY: This document proposes to revise an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), which would have superseded AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01. That AD currently requires the following on Jetstream Aircraft Limited (JAL) Jetstream Model 3101 airplanes: revising the maximum speed for flaps at 50 degrees from 153/149 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) to 130 KIAS; and limiting the maximum flap extension to 20 degrees anytime ice is present on the airplane. The previous notice proposed to provide the option of incorporating a flap system modification that would eliminate the requirements of AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01. Since publication of that proposal, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has re-examined all information related to this subject, and has determined that the flap system modification should be made mandatory rather than optional. The proposed actions are intended to prevent sudden pitch down of the airplane during icing conditions, which could lead to loss of control of the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 16 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;22&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, holidays excepted. Service information that applies to the proposed AD may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft Limited, Manager Product Support, Prestwick Airport, Ayrshire, KA9 2RW Scotland; telephone (44&hyph;292) 79888; facsimile (44&hyph;292) 79703; or Jetstream Aircraft Inc., Librarian, P.O.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;22&hyph; AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;22&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Discussion A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain JAL Jetstream Model 3101 airplanes was published in the Federal Register on July 8, 1992 (57 FR 30174). That action proposed to supersede AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01 with a new AD that would (1) retain the flap system operating revision and limitation currently required by AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01; and (2) limit the applicability to only those airplanes that do not have the flap system modified in accordance with British Aerospace (BAe) Service Bulletin 27&hyph;JA 910541. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. One comment was received in agreement with the proposed AD and no comments were received concerning the FAA's determination of the cost upon the public. Since issuing that action, the FAA has re-examined all available information on this issue, and has determined that the limitation of maximum flap setting of 20 degrees in icing conditions presents an unsafe condition in certain circumstances. The Jetstream Model 3101 airplane has a feature known as ``lift dump'', which allows for proper deceleration by automatically extending flaps from the 50 degree position to the 70 degree position when the nose wheel strut is compressed during landing. When landing with a flap setting of 20 degrees, ``lift dump'' is not normally available, which can make deceleration more dependent upon propeller reverse or manual selection. Propeller reverse is utilized in normal operation as an aid in reducing landing roll distance. The other option is manually selecting flaps from 20 degrees to 50 degrees immediately after touchdown while the airplane is traveling at a higher speed. When the operator selects the 50-degree position with all ground logic constraints satisfied, the flaps will extend to the 70-degree position. This technique can result in high aerodynamic loads upon the flap, which could cause structural damage that, if not detected and corrected, could result in loss of airplane directional control caused by failure of the flap system. Also, there is a temporary increase in wing lift when manually extending the wings from 20 degrees to 35 degrees, which could result in the airplane becoming airborne or a reduction of directional control and braking force. Because ``lift dump'' is available with the flaps at the 35-degree position during landing, the FAA has determined that (1) the flap system modification that allows the use of flaps at 35-degrees with ice visible should be incorporated; and (2) AD action should be taken to prevent sudden pitch down of the airplane during icing conditions, which could lead to loss of control of the airplane. Since incorporating the 35 degrees flap modification into the notice of proposed rulemaking specifies additional procedures that go beyond the scope of what was originally proposed, the notice has been revised accordingly and the comment period has been reopened to provide additional time for public comment. The proposed AD would supersede AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01 with a new AD that would (1) retain the flap system operating revision and limitation currently required until the 35-degree flap system modification was incorporated; and (2) eventually require incorporating the 35-degree flap system modification in accordance with the instructions in Jetstream Aircraft Limited SB No. 27&hyph;JA 910541, which consists of the following pages: ‚ê£ 1Page Nos. 1Revision level 1Date 2, 5 through 30 and 33 through 45 Revision 1 November 11, 1991. 31 Revision 2 February 4, 1992. 1, 3, 4, and 32 Revision 3 November 16, 1992.
