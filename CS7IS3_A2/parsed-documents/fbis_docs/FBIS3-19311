By agreeing to this decision, Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer (Alliance 90/Greens) gave in in the dispute with Federal Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer (Christian Democratic Union). The ministry in Wiesbaden stated that the decree issued 11 days ago after a fire in the reactor can be lifted. According to the decree, preparations for a renewed operation of the reactor had to be stopped after the regular revision. It was also announced that the evaluation of the expert reports commissioned by Fischer and Toepfer, which came to different conclusions, did not reveal any findings that would have required a closure of the plant.
