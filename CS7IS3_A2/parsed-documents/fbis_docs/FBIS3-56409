Four Russian submarines are destined for that country's metallurgical plants in the near future. The submarines in question are SS-60's, known in the West by the designation "Foxtrot." These diesel-powered torpedo-armed submarines were constructed in the Soviet Union in the 1960's and have already completed their intended service life. Of the 40 or so submarines of this class which remain in the Russian Navy, some are still used as training vessels. The rest, however, are permanently laid up and are quietly poisoning the environment at naval bases. Navy commanders have been authorized to sell off these decommissioned vessels on their own initiative. Because Russia lacks adequate production capacity suited to preparing warships for melting down, and also because the country's economic position boosts the attractiveness of freely convertible currency, foreign buyers naturally have priority rights. The contract to sell four decommissioned submarines to North Korean buyers was signed by the Russian Pacific Fleet command. The Japanese newspaper TOKYO SHIMBUN has conjectured that, having obtained the submarines, North Korea will carry out repairs and put them into service in its navy. In the opinion of Russian specialists, however, it would be economically disadvantageous to carry out a complete overhaul of the "Foxtrots." Moreover, under existing rules all armaments and guidance systems will be dismantled before the submarines are dispatched to North Korea.
