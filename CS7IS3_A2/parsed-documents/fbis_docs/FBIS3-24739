Members of the subcouncil are: Lt. Col. P. N. Bohlolo (United Peoples Front), Adv Peter Gastrow (chairman) (Democratic Party), Mr M.S. Gininda (Inyandza National Movement), Lt. Gen. L. Malan (SA Government), Mr Sydney Mufamadi (African National Congress), Adv Gert Myburgh (National Party), Mr Krish Naidoo (NIC/TIC) [Natal Indian Congress/Transvaal Indian Congress] Maj. Gen. P.J. Nembambula (Venda Government) 2. Objects of the subcouncil: See the copy of Sections 3 and 15 of the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] act annexed hereto. (not attached) The subcouncil has, inter alia, dealt with the following matters: 3. The establishment of a National Police Inspectorate: The subcouncil has agreed on the details of a National Police Inspectorate which is to be established in terms of Section 15(1)(a) and (b) of the TEC Inspectorate, which is to consist of a national component (five civilians, four SAP [South African Police] officers and four officers from other police forces) and nine regional inspectorates, one each for the nine regions demarcated in the interim constitution, which will each consist of one civilian, one SAP officer, one officer from any other police force operating in that region. A civilian is to be appointed director of the inspectorate. The task of the Inspectorate is to assist the subcouncil to monitor police activities relating to the elections and the maintenance of a free political climate and to ensure that its decisions are properly acted on by the different police agencies in the RSA, self-governing states and TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] countries. The inspectorate will also monitor the deployment and control of police resources in relation to the policing of "political" violence and election activities. It is proposed that the Inspectorate, which will be accountable to the subcouncil, will be established once all the parties represented in the TEC have had an opportunity to submit nominations for the civilian posts and once the various police forces have nominated police officers for the various positions. 4. The establishment of a national independent complaints mechanism: The subcouncil has reached agreement on a new independent complaints mechanism envisaged in Section 15(1)(c) of the act. A credible and effective complaints mechanism is essential to the improvement of police-community relations in South Africa. This mechanism will come into being once ratified by the TEC, and the subcouncil proposes that it resorts under the Goldstone Commission. It will receive and investigate all complaints lodged by members of the public about alleged misconduct by members of the different police agencies. In order to ensure that there is one effective complaints mechanism during the period in which the TEC operates, it is proposed that: (a) The Goldstone Commission also be tasked with the investigation referred to in Clause 3.2.4.1 of the National Peace Accord; (b) The police reporting officers appointed in terms of the National Peace Accord should be assigned to the Goldstone Commission to staff this mechanism; (c) Experienced investigators from the "complaints investigation units" or equivalent units of all policing agencies should be seconded to the mechanism, ie the Goldstone Commission, in order to assist with investigations; (d) The TEC request the minister of justice not to proceed with the implementation of the provisions of the security officers Board of Enquiry Act of 1993 until this act is discussed by the subcouncil and the TEC and duly amended. This act also aims at establishing a complaints mechanism but reservations have been expressed about some of its provisions. It is envisaged that the Goldstone Commission will appoint a suitable civilian as director of the independent complaints mechanism and that the commission will be at liberty to appoint local and foreign police or civilian experts to assist with the investigations. The complaints mechanism will be empowered to investigate complaints about police conduct relating to, inter alia, election related issues, serious and minor criminal offenses, contraventions of the National Peace Accord code of conduct, misconduct and infringements of regulations issued by the subcouncil or the TEC. 5. The establishment of a committee of experts: In terms of Section 15(1)(e) of the TEC Act, the subcouncil has the power to establish a committee of experts to evaluate or monitor any aspect of policing relevant to the objectives of the TEC. The subcouncil has decided that the police board, established in terms of the National Peace Accord, provides an established and credible capacity for expert advice. For a number of practical and cost related reasons the subcouncil has decided not to establish a "standing committee" but to rather draw on the expertise of police board members and others and appoint them to a short-term committee of experts to investigate a particular issue as and when the need arises. Proposals in this regard are to be forwarded to the TEC for ratification. [Text] 6. Rules and code of conduct for the police: In terms of Section 15(1)(j) of the TEC Act the subcouncil is empowered to issue a new or amended code of conduct which shall be applicable to all members of all policing agencies. The subcouncil is further empowered under Section 15(7)(a) of the TEC Act to issue rules aimed at ensuring uniformity of conduct of members of all police agencies. The subcouncil took into account that the existing standing rules and orders of all the police agencies are virtually identical and has agreed on some additional rules which complement the existing ones. These rules focus mainly on promoting good police-community relations, on ensuring impartial and apolitical policing during the election and on the need for the police to ensure that no intimidation takes place. The subcouncil agreed that the security forces code of conduct, contained in Chapter 4 of the National Peace Accord, should also remain the code governing the conduct of members of all police agencies. It is further provided that police officials shall accept the certified results of the election. The rules and code of conduct for the police will be forwarded to the TEC for ratification before being implemented. 7. The co-ordinated control and command of different police agencies In terms of Section 15(7)(a) of the TEC Act the subcouncil has, in co-operation with most other police agencies in the self-governing states and TVBC countries, agreed on the establishment of a "Transitional Policing Committee" which will ensure that co-ordination and uniformity exists amongst all policing agencies in the execution of their duties for the purpose of the TEC Act. A senior police officer from each of the policing agencies will serve on this committee which will meet once a week and report to the subcouncil. The Transitional Policing Committee will also have the task of formulating joint strategies to prevent intimidation, to ensure impartial policing of public political activities and to generally deal with the policing of the run-up to, and the election itself. The proposals with regard to the above committee will be forwarded to the TEC for ratification before implementation. 8. The position of the Ciskei, Bophuthatswana and KwaZulu: (a) Ciskei Police: The Ciskei has been co-operative and has responded to requests by the subcouncil to submit information and suggestions. It has been agreed that representatives from the Ciskei Police will form part of the substructures of the subcouncil once they formally become members of the TEC as required by the TEC act. (b) KwaZulu Police: Despite requests the KwaZulu Police has not submitted any names of police officers to serve on the various sub-structures of the subcouncil. Requests for information, co-operation or proposals have met with the response that legal advice is being sought or that the relevant officer is not available and that a reply will be sent as soon as possible. There has therefore been no co-operation from the KwaZulu Police and the matter has been referred to the TEC for its attention. The subcouncil regards it as essential for the KwaZulu Police to co-operate in the same manner as other police agencies are doing in order to ensure effective and accountable policing to take place in the Natal/KwaZulu region during the election period. (c) Bophuthatswana Police: There has been no response from the Bophuthatswana Police to requests from the subcouncil to supply information or to participate in its activities. The subcouncil is keen to involve the Bophuthatswana Police in all its structures and activities as it would assist in promoting free political activity in that country. The legal situation appears to be that, in terms of South African law, Bophuthatswana is an independent state and South African law does not apply in that state unless Bophuthatswana law so provides. The TEC Act does create the possibility of the TEC having jurisdiction in Bophuthatswana provided that the latter becomes a participant of the TEC. As this has not happened the TEC has no jurisdiction over Bophuthatswana. 9. Instability in northern Natal: At the request of the TEC the subcouncil submitted a memorandum to the management committee of the TEC about the security situation in northern Natal. The subcouncil recommended inter alia that the SAP be urged to review the situation with a view to increasing the number of static reporting points in northern Natal in order to make their presence in the area more accessible to the community and that the SAP be urged to continue to liaise with the SADF [South African Defense Force] in order that the SADF provide manpower and logistical support as the situation warrants. The subcouncil receives a weekly report from the SAP about the state of political violence in northern Natal. 10. Instability in Katlehong: The violence in Katlehong, including statements emanating from Self Defence Units in the area, was raised in the subcouncil. At the initiative of the management committee of the TEC and others the whole matter of political violence and instability on the East Rand is being comprehensively addressed by a task group at national level and the subcouncil will await their recommendations before addressing the matter further. 11. Position of Captain Craig Kotze: The subcouncil made representations to the minister of law and order about the undesirable situation of a police office acting as spokesperson for the political head of the SAP and thereby becoming involved in political controversy which affects the police force as a whole. The minister informed the subcouncil that Captain Kotze terminated his services in the SAP on 5 January 1994 and that since 6 January he has been employed as a consultant by the Ministry of Law and Order with the task of acting as spokesperson for the Ministry of Law and Order. 12. Violence and transport problems in the Western Cape: The subcouncil discussed a request by the transport forum of the Western Cape regional peace committee to intervene in the transport dispute and the resultant violence in Kayalithsa, Gugulethu and Nyanga by securing protection by security forces for buses and their passengers. The subcouncil decided to acquaint itself with the issues first hand and to send a delegation from the subcouncil together with two civilian members of the police board to Cape Town in order to meet with the relevant role players in the area. A meeting will take place on Thursday 3 February. [signed] Peter Gastrow, chairman [dated] 28 January 1994
