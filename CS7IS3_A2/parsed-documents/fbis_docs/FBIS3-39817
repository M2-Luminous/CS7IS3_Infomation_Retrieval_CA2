This text is a more readable, coordinated, and renumbered version of the old constitutional texts and includes the changes introduced by the St. Michel agreements. It was adopted definitively by the Senate on 3 February and issued in a special edition of the MONITEUR, published yesterday afternoon. Liberal MPs, both French-speaking and Flemish-speaking, did not take part in the ceremonies surrounding the signature of the new text. For the PRL [Republican Party of Liberty]-FDF [Radical Liberal Party--Democratic Front of Brussels French speakers] Federation, yesterday was a "black day for Belgium and a day of mourning for French speakers." Their MPs point out in particular that, in their eyes, the new institutions will encourage the separatist current in Flanders and organize the division of the French speakers.
