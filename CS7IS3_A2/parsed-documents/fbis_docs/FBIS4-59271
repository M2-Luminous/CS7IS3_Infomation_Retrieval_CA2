The so-called self-rule agreement signed by 'Arafat, Rabin, the U.S. secretary of state, and the Russian foreign minister is aimed at giving complete legitimacy to the Zionist occupation of the occupied territories in return for giving the Palestinians some powers to administer their affairs. This agreement seeks to make the treacherous and rejected occupation a legitimate authority acceptable to the Palestinian people. Therefore, this festival is one of fraudulence attended by several foreign and Arab false witnesses. It is a crime committed against the land, man, and history. They want us to believe this is the long-awaited peace. We ask: Where is the sovereignty? Where are the rest of the rights? What is the fate of the detainees? What is the fate of the rest of the occupied territories? What is the fate of the millions in the diaspora? What is the fate of Jerusalem? What is the fate of all Palestine? Where is all this in the agreement? Nothing, nothing. There is nothing now or even in the future, because 'Arafat has accepted the bare minimum to enable the Palestinian people to establish a state on even a part of their land in the future. It is a new treason with widespread Arab blessing. The fraudulence in Cairo was preceded by two ceremonies in Muscat and Doha celebrating peace and cooperation with the enemy. We urge the sons of the Palestinian people and the sons of our nation to realize the dangers of this new plot and to use all means to undermine the prospects of the plotters and foil their schemes by rejecting all projects presented under the banner of a promised peace and future for the Palestinian people and the region's nations. These represent the worst link in the chain of moves to destroy and seize the region. This new plot will not pass, regardless of its potentials and supporters and regardless of the extolling headlines. Our nation will be lying in wait and will not allow some ostracized people to exploit our nation in order to serve their interests and threaten our nation's interests. Certainly, it is a day of mourning and grief for the Palestinian people and the sons of the Arab and Islamic nation to see that the Palestinian people have become an isolated community in a state where the authority of the Jewish usurpers is being legitimized.
