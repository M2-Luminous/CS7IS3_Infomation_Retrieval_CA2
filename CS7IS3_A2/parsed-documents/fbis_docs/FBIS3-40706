The recent chart depicting the economic trends in different countries prepared by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank indicates that no noteworthy progress has been made in the economy of Bangladesh. Rather, the situation has worsened in certain sectors. It is unfortunate that the flow of foreign investment to this country is still very insignificant. Between 1986 and 1991, foreign investment worth $1.338 billion were made in India and $1.131 billion in Pakistan. In Sri Lanka, total foreign investment in this period totalled $297 million. During this period, foreign investment worth only $11 million dollars was made in Bangladesh. Other than clothing-related industries, no other industrial units were set up in the country during this five-year span. On the other hand, 3,000 plants were declared sick and subsequently closed. The industrial growth rate in Bangladesh during the past few years has been estimated at 5 percent. In other poor countries of Asia, the rate was between 7 and 8 percent. In 1970 the contribution of investment to the Bangladeshi GDP was 11 percent, but in 1990 it went down to 10 percent. The contribution of the manufacturing sector to the GDP is 20 percent in India, 24 percent in Thailand, and 16 percent in Pakistan. In Bangladesh it is only 9 percent. Apart from the poor industrial growth, losses in the industrial sector have become routine. In 1992, industrial units in the nationalized sector incurred losses amounting to 20 billion taka. The losses suffered by the industrial sector are partly responsible for the slow growth in direct foreign investment. This discourages foreign investors and impedes development. We are not only unable to attract overseas investors, but have also failed to protect the interests of foreign companies already operating in the country. Several foreign companies including Philips, Glaxo, Bangladesh Tobacco Company, ICI, and Dhaka Match Company have already concluded their business and left the country. Business circles have expressed dissatisfaction over the privatization move initiated by the government. They say that since the time of the Ershad government, it has been said that the Telephone and Telegraph Board will be converted into a holding company. So far the government has failed to do so due to threats by the workers' union. During the past three years, the government has failed to privatize even one large industrial unit from the nationalized sector. About a year ago, the state minister for textiles, Abdul Mannan, announced that 60 to 70 billion taka would be spent to set up about 1,000 industrial units in the textile sector. Nothing has been done so far. It has been learned that the government has not yet approved the proposal by the minister for the development of the textile sector. The government says that foreign investors are discouraged by the frequent strike calls. Foreigners believe that the deteriorating law and order situation and a weak administration are particularly responsible for scaring investors away. A similar sentiment was also expressed by Mr. Milam, the former U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh. In this regard, several foreign missions in Dhaka have cited the recent murder of an eminent industrialist named Humayun Zahir. Campus violence and killing has become routine. The labor union leaders do not hesitate to hold the mill managers hostage to press their demands. These factors not only deter foreign investors from coming, but also discourage local entrepreneurs. Due to this, there has been no development in the microeconomic sectors.
