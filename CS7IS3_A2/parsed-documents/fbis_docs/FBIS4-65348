How do you assess this achievement? [Rexrodt] As a breakthrough and a success. The Russians have promised that orders at a value of 500 million German marks [DM] will go to [DWA in] Ammendorf this year. This means that the jobs there will be secure. Good prospects are established because this makes it possible to bridge the time until 1996. Afterwards, it is to be expected that Western orders will take up more capacities in the factory. [Seher] What will happen in 1995? Your agreement says that orders are then to be issued at a lower level. At what level? [Rexrodt] The orders for 1995 must still be negotiated. For 1996 it has been agreed that we will enter close cooperation with DWA in Russia itself. This means that wagons will be built there and know-how will be transferred. [Seher] Thus, the 2,000 employees may stay for the time being. [Rexrodt] Detailed decisions about the number of employees will have to be made by the company management. But the imminent disaster has been averted. [Seher] Will there be Hermes guarantees to secure the orders? [Rexrodt] Yes, full guarantees. [Seher] German companies have explained that their investments are taxed too highly in Russia. Did this play a role in the negotiations? [Rexrodt] Not now. But it was a subject during my visit to Russia three weeks ago and of the talks that I held at the West-East conference in Warsaw. The issue is not just taxes but much more -- customs duties, methods of administration, the functioning of the banking systems. All this runs under the heading of investment conditions. They must be improved and made predictable. Indeed, there has been taxation on investments in Russia. It has been indicated to us that this will be abolished very soon, that everything was a misunderstanding. [Seher] During their visit to Germany, the Russian delegation complained about an insufficient opening up of the markets of the European Union [EU] and the West to Russian products. Are these complaints justified? [Rexrodt] No, I think they are not justified. As of next year the European Union will have completely open markets for Russia -- except for some steel products and some textile products and, of course, the agricultural sector. [Seher] It is said that Moscow has offered to pay its debt with goods, such as with Russian nuclear power plants and MiG-29 planes. Is this correct? [Rexrodt] I have never been told about nuclear power plants. But MiG-29 planes? Yes, indeed. This was said. We have rejected this. It does not fit in with our military and research policy considerations.
