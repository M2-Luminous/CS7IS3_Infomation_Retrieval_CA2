Samsung Electronics, Goldstar and Daewoo Electronics saw exports of electric home appliances and semiconductors to Japan soar an average 150 percent last year over the year before. Exports rose a further 50 percent last month, compared with 12-percent growth in January 1993. The industry attributes the brisk exports to a strong yen that has weakened the price competitiveness of Japanese manufacturers. Samsung exported 350 million U.S. dollars worth of electronics to Japan, up 110 percent from 1992. Its exports of semiconductors were up 100 percent to 240 million dollars from 1992's 120 million dollars; Television sets, up 142 percent to 80 million dollars; and refrigerators, up 192 percent to 12 million dollars. Samsung said January exports grew 50 percent, compared with 12 percent a year earlier. Goldstar shipped 33 million dollars worth of television sets, up 65 percent from 20 million dollars in 1992, and 1 million dollars of microwave ovens, up 100 percent from 500,000 dollars a year earlier. Its January exports increased 33 percent to 16 million dollars, three times the 11 percent growth registered the year before. Daewoo saw exports skyrocket 116 percent to 218 million dollars last year with shipments of microwave ovens rising 56 percent, refrigerators 45 percent and video cassette recorders 29 percent in January.
