This act was interpreted on the Albanian side as "yet another repressive act of the authorities, a smothering of the right to authentic culture," while the Serbian authorities saw it as a manifestation of the law-governed state, that is, implementation of the decision under which the KANU is a branch of the SANU [Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts] and under which the title of member of the academy is obtained by the standards of the parent academy in Belgrade. If the dispute between the directly opposed sides is viewed from outside, this creation of an "academy of the deaf" seems like cynicism. Life in Kosovo, however, does not take place between those two signs. It is in them. Albanian life, which is manifested above all in education, the socialization of one's own life, sports, and business, and Serbian life--personified in administrative authority, the police, financial oversight agencies, and the economy, which is mainly in the socialized sector and dead. The stories about the "divided corso in Pristina" are old and pathetic. The Serbs and Albanians promenade in their own sections of the city--the former in the center, the latter in Capi (in Serbian--Neck). What they have in common is garbage, which seems surreal, there is so much of it. And no one is collecting it. Operating in parallel, the self-proclaimed Albanian Republic of Kosovo (recognized only by the state of Albania) and the Republic of Serbia give the appearance that they are functioning and are legitimate, and, one would say, they are making an effort to preserve those illusions. In order to protect their proclaimed exclusive sovereignty on this territory, the Serbian authorities have not terminated the fiscal policy of the republic of Albanians, which requires every Albanian private operator to pay into the budget 5 to 10 percent of his net income, but by way of sovereignty it also collects the tax. In the Sami Fraseri High School, teachers are not sure whether their work is legal or illegal, and the same dilemma seems to be bothering the police, who 100 meters away from the school watch the river of children returning from school. The Law-Governed State "The law-governed state is functioning, Kosovo is increasingly stable, public peace and order are better than at any time up to now, anarchy has been averted," says Dr. Milos Simovic, president of Kosovo Okrug. At the same time, he also says that "the Albanians are boycotting the entire system" and that "they are internationalizing every problem they have." "The Albanians have conquered Kosovo and Metohija [Kosmet] economically. Time is on their side, and we are happy that there is no shooting here, that we can say that Kosmet is an integral part of Serbia," says Tomislav Sekulic, people's deputy and one of the most distinguished Kosovo Serbs, who is dissatisfied. Typically for Kosovo Serbs, both Dr. Simovic and Sekulic would say that Kosovo is not lost, but what every Serb shrinks from is Albanian capital, which, again "typically for their nationality," they estimate at 95 percent. "We had an economy in our hands and we gambled it away," Sekulic says. "Trepca is not operating, it has turned out that it could operate in the hands of the English before the war, in the hands of the Germans during the war, in the hands of the Albanians after the war, but for all practical purposes it was shut down by the Serbs. In actuality, incompetent Serbs." Since a state of emergency was declared by the Republic of Serbia, economic facilities in Kosovo have died. Trepca was producing 100,000 metric tons of lead in ingots, 40,000 tons of electrolytic zinc, about 100 tons of silver, 30 tons of bismuth and cadmium.... Depending on the situation on the London Exchange, it was earning between $100 and $150 million a year. The economy and the infrastructure, in which, according to Sekulic, nearly $10 billion were invested between 1965 and 1990, are going to ruin. Kosovo abounds in fenced-off lots in which there are only watchmen for the construction cranes which do not operate, structures that look like empty stables.... "When what was needed was intelligence, the profiteering spirit was operative," says Sekulic, who sees the devastated Serbian government-owned economy as a victim of private appetites, which are gnawing it away. In the process of ownership transformation in more than 100 of the largest Serbian enterprises in Kosovo over the last three years, the Fund for Development of Serbia, without any additional investment, has transferred the majority share of public capital to the fund or related firms in Serbia, and in all the transformations the fund or firms have become majority owners. And in a meeting of the fund held in Pristina last November, it was concluded that "the technological level of installed capacity in Kosovo exceeds the quality of equipment of firms in Serbia and exceeds the needs of the Kosovo economy." In that meeting, there was an initiative to "move" the technological equipment from Kosovo to a "defined space." Since control over Kosovo's economy was taken over, more than 100,000 workers of Albanian nationality have been discharged from the government sector on various grounds, according to Albanian estimates. Which is why the Albanians are not so careful as Sekulic in separating the honest from the dishonest Serbian government- appointed enterprise directors. They are more inclined to say: "See how the Serbs are running the economy!" The private sector in Kosovo--about 10,000 firms--is mainly in the hands of Albanian citizens. According to unofficial, but competent sources, last year that sector possessed 8.33 percent of the total capital committed in the Kosovo economy and produced about 30 percent of the total gross product and realized about 45 percent of the total earnings of the Kosovo economy. In none of these figures do we see the one about 95 percent of the capital being Albanian; however, workers abroad have been contributing to overall Albanian wealth. Depending on tactical political needs, the number of Albanians living and working abroad varies in political statements between 250,000 and 500,000. According to Naif Zeka, Ibrahim Rugova's adviser for the economy, with the 3-percent linear tax which these workers pay the so-called Republic of Kosovo, they are furnishing 35 percent of budget revenues. Aside from the budget, they are supporting or helping members of their household who have remained in Kosovo. Naif Zeka says that 22,000 families have been receiving regular social assistance and 36,000 occasional assistance. Nevertheless, most of the money is going to the schools. According to the figures of Dr. Dzavid Ahmeti, Dr. Rugova's adviser for education, the parallel Albanian-language educational process involves 274,000 elementary children, 64,000 high school students, and 16,000 university students studying under about 20,000 teachers. Settlement The financial superiority of the Albanians is offered to the "naked eye" in the form of luxury cars, elegant restaurants, exclusive shops, and white satellite antennas which irritate the Serbs as they were once irritated by the traditional white Albanian skullcap. They say that they were installed to receive the satellite broadcasting from Albania. And probably that was the motive for buying the antennas, but aside from two hours of Albanian programming, the Kosovo Albanian is offered another dozen West European channels, whose influence is noticeable in the school, on the street, and probably in the home. Demographic growth is the other fear of the Kosovo Serbs. The estimates of both Serbian and Albanian demographers, which are that in 50 to 60 years the two nationalities will be numerically equal in the Republic of Serbia--encourage the one and frighten the other. That is why the topic "settlement of Kosovo" is the most frequent one among Serbs. The Serbian national bloc is seeking a solution by speeding up settlement and financial incentives for returnees. In the Statistical Bureau in Pristina, we were not able to get a figure on migration, because the bureau no longer has jurisdiction over that. The last figure on the number of those moving in and moving out was recorded by Jedinstvo of Pristina at the end of the first quarter of last year. "Incoming" was one (1) greater than "outgoing." Dragan Icic, president of the Association for Settlement of Kosmet, is announcing a rally for collective settlement. "Immense money has been spent to build 184 housing units for returnees, but there are neither the housing units nor the returnees," Icic says angrily, adding that the closest relatives and friends of "the powers that be in Kosovo" have moved into those housing units. The president of the association says that the demonstrators at their rally will seek accountability for many things. Among them, who sold to the Albanians the housing units that were purchased and who does not like the program for settlement of Kosovo and why? At the entrance to Pec from the direction of Decani, a lad has slung a semiautomatic on his back. In his hands are a duffle bag and boots. He obviously has just been issued that equipment. From the way in which he wears it--nonchalantly--in the overflowing suburb, he obviously believes that he has found the right weapon against the Albanian demographic bomb. However, Ismailj Redzepi, member of the Presidium of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo, does not believe in the demographic forecast most frequently presented. "The Albanians are moving in other directions, and the demographic growth is settling down, but demography is a good thing for short-term political manipulation," he says. "The thesis about a demographic intersection of Serbs and Albanians in Serbia in the near future is mentioned in every connection, but I would say that false conclusions are being drawn from false premises, because no one knows for certain how many Albanians there are in Serbia," is the opinion of Dr. Dragisa Velickovic, professor of the theory of economic development in Pristina. On the basis of the drastic difference between the 1961 Census and the later ones in 1971 and 1981, he doubts the validity of the latter. He considers it a mistake to project the growth of the Albanian population at present rates, because, he says, "the Albanian population is just ending the transition phase, and in 10 years at the latest that population will have a growth rate between 1 and 1.5 percent." Velickovic explains his forecast in terms of the Europeanization of the former communist oligarchy, which has become an entrepreneurial oligarchy, and the desire of young Albanians employed abroad to become entrepreneurs; previously, they invested their capital to build large houses for communal living, but now they invest in private business. Dr. Velickovic goes on to say that the space of Kosovo-Metohija is overpopulated, and more striking than the demographic figures is his datum that the streams which Kosovo possesses allow it to "maintain" two and a half million people at the most. No one has as yet made public the "frustrations over water supply." Aside from the Albanian superiority in money and population, the Serbs are also disturbed by the military power of the West, which they fear might help the Albanians, and the Albanians are disturbed by the Serbian military power. Azem Vlasi, former politician, who is now a lawyer, says that the logic of force is the only logic of Slobodan Milosevic, and he is disturbed not so much by that logic as the fact that the "president who arrested him" is unable to govern without problems. In the Serbian political bloc, no one believes in war as a solution. Dr. Simovic, who heads the okrug, finds the reason for this in the fact that the Serbs and Albanians have never waged war directly with one another and the fact that the latter would never dare to destroy their population and capital. This way of thinking is typical of the Serbs. "Last year, I issued them 130 permits to open gasoline stations. These are all facilities worth between 250,000 and several million marks, and when someone opens one, he certainly is not preparing for war," says Milan Jocic, director of the Provincial Fund for Water Resources. The Serbs do not think that they could be the ones to blame for war, nor do they believe that the Albanians would start it. The latter, meanwhile, think that after Croatia and Bosnia and in the international situation, which is not inclined toward Serbia in the least, it has had enough of war-making adventurism. However, the two sides have not found a way to communicate even that little bit to each other officially and publicly. There is no dialogue, as if this were a curse of the newly opened "academy for the deaf." In the meantime, two national councils, both of them closed, are continuing to live alongside one another, and they cannot agree even to collect the garbage.
