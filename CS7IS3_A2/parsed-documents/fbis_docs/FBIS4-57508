Jaime Crombet, vice president of the National Assembly of the People's Government (parliament), told National Television's channel six that all officials who have any responsibility whatsoever in the social development process must attend the neighborhood assemblies. Crombet said that "we do not want monologues or useless meetings" and added that the meetings to discuss daily problems will be attended by everyone from representatives of administrative organizations in each neighborhood to directors of schools, hospitals, clinics, and stores. He admitted that things are not working the same everywhere, thus the government must place greater emphasis on the big cities to handle difficulties expeditiously. The first assembly of District 40, located in the Havana municipality of Santa Cruz del Norte, was held today. Initiatives were proposed at the meeting to improve the community. District Deputy Mario Rios commented on his experience at the assembly and said he presented problems to the community so solutions could be found collectively.
