There are other issues that are above financial considerations. [Reporter] Do you then believe it is something related to moral values? [Caldera] Fundamentally, all of the problems we are experiencing in the country originate from the moral crisis we have been confronting. [Reporter] With respect to the reforms needed within the judicial branch, what are the initiatives you have proposed? [Caldera] [words indistinct] [Reporter] With respect to the reforms needed in the judicial branch, could you explain what your proposals will be? [Caldera] Well, at this point in time it would be impossible to explain all of the reforms that have been proposed. It would be necessary to first start by reforming the Constitution. A general constitutional reform entails several proposals which, by the way, would include recommendations by Supreme Court Vice President Alirio Abreu Burelli -- recommendations similar to those made last year by Magistrate Josefina Calcano de Temeltas in an address in which she proposed the creation of a constitutional court. In addition, there are numerous other opinions that include reforming the Constitution, laws, and related administrative orders. These proposals are currently being received favorably because of something that is quite true, and that is this: All Venezuelans are convinced that we are facing a very difficult situation. The next administration and government will face a very complicated situation, but it is necessary for us to begin now, because the moment is fundamental if we expect to reach the 21st century under the best conditions for democracy. [Reporter] In terms of the value-added tax [VAT], at this time there are eight annulment appeals that... [Caldera, interrupting] There you go, dragging me into the VAT again! [Reporter] Of course, this the issue the people are most interested in. [Caldera] That is alright; it really does not matter. My position with respect to the VAT is quite clear. Now, I would not like to venture and express a judicial opinion at this time and place. Of course, out of respect for the Supreme Court of Justice, I am forced as a private citizen to... [Reporter, interrupting] Mr. President, right now there are eight annulment appeals to repeal this bill. What can you say about this? [Caldera] I can only say that this issue must be decided as quickly as the previous appeals were resolved. [Reporter] What are your final proposals? [Caldera] I am committed to struggling to eliminate the VAT in a way that will also reform the tax system, establish a tax on those groups that are living in better conditions and can afford to pay, and not increase the tax burden on the less privileged sectors. [Reporter] Anyway, in your opinion, what actions should be... [Caldera, interrupting] That is enough for now.
