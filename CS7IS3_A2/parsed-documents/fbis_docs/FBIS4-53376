The EAGP is an economic cooperation of 12 focus areas in the East ASEAN region. Its main aim is to promote trade and investment in the region through mutual and beneficial endeavors that include shipping, transportation and communications, agriculture, fisheries, agro-forestry, industries, and tourism. With a total land area of six million hectares, primarily composed of agricultural and forest lands, South Sulawesi occupies about 42 percent of the Sulawesi Island. Its main source of livelihood is agriculture, fishery, and agro-forestry. An annual economic growth rate of 5.6 percent has made South Sulawesi one of the most attractive investment areas in the East ASEAN region. A high rate of productivity has made the province a leading exporter of rice. In 1991, it recorded 1.4 million tons of rice surplus. However, the agriculture sector lacks the facilities for agri-processing that can transform harvests into high-value goods. But the high potential remains in the non-traditional crops like coffee, cocoa, cashew nut, candle nut, crude palm oil, and others. The fishery sector also poses a high potential area for investment particularly in prawn production, frozen shrimp, and cuttle fish. Again, processing of these products is needed to further boost the fishery industry. Livestock production shows great potential particularly cattle, goat, sheep, hog and poultry raising, both for domestic and export consumption. Export of forest products has likewise a big potential because of the abundance of forest resources in this Indonesian province, covering about 3.6 million hectares.
