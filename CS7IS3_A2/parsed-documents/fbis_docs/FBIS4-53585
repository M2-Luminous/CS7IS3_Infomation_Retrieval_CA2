Singapore's Chief of Army, Brigadier-General [BG] Lim Neo Chian, and the Philippine Army's Commanding General, Major-General Romulo Yap, jointly officiated at the closing ceremony at the Safti [Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute] live-firing area, after witnessing the assault. The live firing was the climax of the week-long combined land exercise involving the Singapore Armed Forces [SAF] and the Philippine Army, held under the Anoa-Singa series of exercises. It was the first bilateral army exercise between the two countries to be held in Singapore. Anoa-Singa 2/94 is conducted under a Memorandum of Understanding the two countries signed earlier this month. It provides for regular joint exercises between the two armed forces. A 200-strong Philippine Army contingent took part in the exercise, with 600 SAF personnel from the 1st and 2nd Battalions, Singapore Guards. Speaking at the closing ceremony, Maj. Gen. Yap said that the exercise had forged closer understanding and cooperation between the two armies. He said that it had also provided the Philippine Army with its first opportunity to train with a "fellow Asian". Its previous army exercises have been with only the United States. Maj. Gen. Yap added that Singapore's Total Defence concept was useful to note at a time when the Philippine Army was itself strengthening its reserve force. On the Singapore end, BG Lim said that the SAF troops found the lectures given by their Filipino counterparts on psychological operations beneficial. Major James Lim, the Commanding Officer of 2nd Guards, said that the exercise gave the troops the chance to familiarise themselves with each other's doctrines and operating procedures. He said the live-firing exercise was a display of mutual trust and respect for the skills of the soldiers of both armies. The exercise, a battalion attack mission, went smoothly, although the soldiers carried it out with men whom they were not thoroughly familiar with, he added. He said: "The element of trust comes in because live rounds are being used. The exercise requires the soldiers to depend on others who give support fire with artillery and tanks. "Doing it with your own men requires trust, what more, doing it with soldiers from another army whom you don't know as well." Maj. Lim said that the battalion live firing was also a show of respect by the soldiers for their counterparts' professionalism and skill. Soldiers going into a live-firing exercise must have a high level of individual skill before they take part. He said: "Obviously, the soldiers saw for themselves how proficient the Filipinos were. "I think they felt the same way about our SAF soldiers too, after interacting with us." The most important outcome, Maj. Lim said, was that after practising and going through the live firing together, the men have come out better friends. The next bilateral exercise between the two armies is scheduled to be held next year in the Philippines, at the Fort Magsaysay training area.
