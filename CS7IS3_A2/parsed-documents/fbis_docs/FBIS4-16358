The two presidents discussed the possibility of resolving the issue in stages. The first stage could be to relocate the fleets to different bases, while the second stage could include setting up a base for Ukrainian naval forces on the Black Sea coast. In Kravchuk's opinion, the main problem is that there are no documents regulating the stationing of foreign naval bases on the territory of Ukraine.
