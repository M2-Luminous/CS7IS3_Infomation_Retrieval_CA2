FR940627-0-00088 FR940627-0-00015 9. The Commission affirmed its tentative conclusion that broader interconnection requirements to facilitate access competition are in the public interest. In accordance with this finding, the Commission required Tier 1 LECs (except NECA pool members) to provide signalling information from equal access end offices so that third parties may install their own tandems to provide tandem-switching services. Third parties may collocate at LEC end offices and provide their own tandem-switched transport between those end offices and their tandems, or they may purchase LEC transport to their tandems. We do not require LECs to provide signalling information for tandem-switching from their tandems since we find that the record does not support the establishment of such a requirement at this time. 10. The Commission concluded that the availability to third parties of signalling information needed for tandem switching could provide significant public benefits. It would facilitate broader access competition by enabling interconnectors to offer competitive interstate tandem-switching and transport services. In addition, it would increase opportunities for small IXCs to gain economies of scale by sharing direct-routed transport facilities and providing their own tandem-switching. The Commission found that as it stated in the Notice, broader access competition should exert downward pressure on tandem-switched transport rates, while fostering more efficient provisioning of these services by new competitors and LECs. The Commission also concluded that in addition, competition should encourage innovation and investment in new technologies and could offer increased network reliability through route diversity and redundancy. IXCs would benefit from greater competition in the tandem-switched service market. Small IXCs would especially benefit because they tend to rely more heavily on tandem-switched transport than larger IXCs. The Commission also stated that in addition, by promoting competition in tandem-switched transport services and facilitating the use of direct-trunked transport by small IXCs, these measures should help ensure more rational cost-based pricing relationships between direct-trunked and tandem-switching transport services, thereby lessening the need for regulatory controls and fostering more efficient use of these services. All of these benefits should contribute to economic growth_by enabling IXCs to use more efficient transport arrangements, by fostering better, more reliable, and more rationally priced access services, as well as by creating new market opportunities for interconnectors. 11. The Commission also concluded that LECs can make signalling information available from their end offices at very little cost. Indeed, the record indicates that the costs to LECs of providing such information from end offices may well be de minimis, involving only a simple change in the end office routing table. The Commission stated that while a few LECs baldly assert that the costs of providing signalling could be significant, these LECs do not substantiate their allegations with cost estimates or data. Nor do they distinguish between end-office generated and tandem-generated signalling information. The Commission found that moreover, no party has shown that the necessary modifications to LEC billing systems would be unreasonably costly or burdensome, or that the asserted need to change industry standards to accommodate the passage of CIC and OZZ codes over Feature Group D represents a significant barrier to the implementation of this proposal. The Commission concluded that any such measures could be accomplished without undue burden or cost. 12. The Commission stated that it was not persuaded that competitive tandem switching services would require assignment of CICs to IXCs. The record fails to indicate that any entity would actually seek to offer or use that kind of routing dynamic. Even without additional CIC assignments, IXCs would be able to designate a primary route and an overflow route for their traffic, thereby securing the benefits of both route and carrier diversity. Moreover, IXCs could vary routing between a LEC and third party tandem on an end-office-by-end-office basis or, perhaps, based on OZZ codes_thereby designating one as primary for a particular type of traffic and another for a different type of traffic. No IXC indicates that these options are insufficient, at least for now. Therefore, the Commission found, no additional CIC code assignments would have to be made to accommodate competitive tandem-switched networks. 13. The Commission also found that the record belies any contention that third parties do not really want signalling information and that IXCs do not really want to use competitively-provided tandem-switching services. The Commission found that the vast majority of parties, including IXCs, CAPs, users, and some LECs, argue that unbundled signalling information would allow development of alternatives to LEC tandem-switched transport services and they urge us to make such information available. The Commission stated that even if the measures that it now takes do not produce an immediate change in the access market, they will be beneficial in the long-term. By eliminating barriers to competition in the provision of tandem-switched services, this action will pave the way to a more competitive access market in the future. The Commission also stated that the availability of signalling information to third parties could, in itself and even without actual entry into the market by competitive tandem-switching providers, subject LEC pricing to some additional competitive pressures. Since the costs of providing signalling information from equal access end offices are so small, the Commission concluded, these benefits are well worth the costs. The Commission also stated that LECs should be required to offer signalling information from equal access end offices is not based on application of the test that governs LEC BSE offerings since signalling information is not a BSE, but that, nevertheless, its conclusion was based on the same type of cost/benefit considerations.
