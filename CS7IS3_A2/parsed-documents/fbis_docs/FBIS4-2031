Luo Zhiling, vice minister of the State Planning Commission, gave an explanation on the general framework of the state grain risk funds system at the conference. He said: The grain risk fund is the first special macroeconomic regulation fund established specifically for a commodity that bears heavily on the state of the national economy and people's well-being. Starting from the 1994 grain year, the central government and the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government must establish well-stocked grain risk funds. Capital for the central grain risk fund will be supplied by the central treasury. Capital for local grain risk funds will come from subsidies from the central government and appropriations from local budgets. Capital needed for the funds must be raised within the year. He urged the localities to pool their limited financial resources so that grain risk funds at the central and provincial levels can be set up as quickly as possible, thus creating a rather effective means for exercise regulation and intervention. Luo Zhiling emphasized that the grain risk fund is a special- purpose fund. It is forbidden to use grain risk funds for other purposes, like helping the poor or social welfare and relief. The funds should not be used to make up for regular operating losses of grain enterprises or to subsidize the expenses and interest incurred from regular stock turnover. Departments concerned at all levels must not withhold, divert, or pocket subsidies due the peasants.
