Below is the full text of the statement: Statement by the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation Deputies of the State Duma express deep alarm in connection with the news of the air strikes in the area of Gorazde in Bosnia- Herzegovina. In spite of the position of Russian members of parliament, which has been expressed more than once in official documents and deputies' speeches on the danger of using military force in solving the conflict, a decision was adopted to utilize military aviation, and furthermore without preliminary consultations with Russia and other members of the UN Security Council. The use of NATO aviation has led to fresh casualties among the Bosnian civilian population and has dealt a significant blow to efforts aimed at solving the conflict by peaceful means. The worsening of the situation in the area of Gorazde testifies to serious inadequacies in the mechanism for adopting and implementing decisions during the implementation of UN peacekeeping operations. Peacekeeping operations should not be used for the implementation of military actions on a bloc basis. We are extremely concerned by NATO's continuing policy of using force as a means for solving the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. In light of what has happened the State Duma: 1. Condemns unilateral NATO acts of force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 2. Demands the immediate convening of the UN Security Council to discuss the situation that has arisen as a result of NATO's military interference in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to take measures to avert an escalation of this explosive situation. 3. Calls on all the warring sides to end immediately the bloodshed and to open negotiations on a total cease-fire. 4. Deems it essential that UN forces be urgently deployed in the vicinity of Gorazde and that every measure be undertaken to prevent provocations by any of the sides. 5. Demands that the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry elaborates an active position on the creation of effective machinery for the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions so as to prevent in future the adoption of forcible measures without the opinion of Russia being taken into account. 6. Recommends that the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, the State Duma Committee on Defense, the State Duma Committee on Geopolitical Issues and the State Duma Committee on Security submit proposals that take Russia's interests fully into account in the elaboration of the position of the State Duma on the concept for Russia's interaction with NATO.
