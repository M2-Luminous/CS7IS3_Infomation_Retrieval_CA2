Cheng Kejie, NPC deputy and regional chairman, Lei Yu, vice regional chairman, (Hong Huzhou), director of the regional Planning Commission, and (Shuai Liguo), mayor of Beihai City, answered questions from Chinese and foreign reporters. [China Huayi Broadcast Company reporter] Guangxi provides the most direct passageway to Southeast Asia. In 1992, the central authorities stressed that it was necessary to give full play to Guangxi's role as a sea passageway in the southwestern region. Over the past few years, with this objective in mind, Guangxi has strengthened infrastructure construction projects and basic industrial projects. Could you tell me the progress of these projects? [Cheng Kejie] In 1992, the central authorities decided to build Guangxi into a sea passageway in the vast southwestern region. Over the past two years, with the help of the central authorities, we have done a lot of work. First, we have grasped infrastructure projects well, including transportation, energy, telecommunications, and so on. We have built or expanded five airports. The Guilin Airport project started last year and is expected to be completed in October 1995. We are currently building Liuzhou and Wuzhou Airports and these two projects will be completed this year. In addition, we have expanded Beihai and Nanning Airports. We are currently building five railroads: The Nanning-Kunming Railroad, Yulin-Wuzhou railway, Lihang-Zhangjiang Railroad, Qinzhou-Qinzhou Port Railway, and the Qinzhou-Beihai Railroad. The Nanning-Kunming Railroad is expected to be completed in 1997. In addition to this, we are building two super expressways: The Liuzhou-Guilin totally enclosed four-lane expressway and the Nanning-Qinzhou-Huangcheng-Beihai six-lane expressway. Power supply in Guangxi has been insufficient but efforts are being made to speed up hydropower and thermal power plant projects. [China Central Television reporter] Over the past two years, Guangxi has imported foreign capital and run foreign-funded enterprises. The number of such enterprises has increased. Where did the money come from? What are the prospects for the future? [Lei Yu] With regard to efforts to promote exports to earn more foreign exchange, in 1992, Guangxi's total export volume reached $1.108 billion, an increase of 33 percent over 1992. In 1993, total export volume increased to $1.325 billion, up 19.6 percent. As far as using foreign capital is concerned, at the end of 1991 there were 559 foreign-funded enterprises in Guangxi and a total of $63 million in foreign capital was actually used. At the end of 1992, there were 1,870 foreign-funded enterprises in Guangxi and $246 million worth of capital was actually used, an increase of 272 percent. At the end of 1993, there were 4,368 foreign-funded enterprises and $1 billion worth of foreign capital was used in that year, an increase of 305 percent. The use of foreign capital has been characterized by great increases in recent years. In addition, there are four other characteristics: First, investment fields have been expanded; second, investment areas have been widened; third, the number of investor countries and regions has increased; and fourth, there are more big financial groups and large projects. [VNA reporter] Since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations, how have relations between Guangxi and Vietnam been? What reasons does Guangxi have to conduct further consultations with Vietnam? [Cheng Kejie] Since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations in 1991, the development of friendly economic contacts between the two countries has been healthy and this has benefited the peoples of the two countries. We can have better cooperation with Vietnam in many fields, such as trade and negotiations on economic projects. Both sides can promote their cooperation on the basis of mutual benefits and concessions. [Lei Yu] With the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations, economic cooperation has developed considerably. I believed that, encouraged by the two governments, economic cooperation between Guangxi and Vietnam will be strengthened. [XINHUA reporter] Not long ago, many experts predicted that from the end of this century to early next century, international cities will rise in the area of the Gulf of Tonkin. It was reported that Beihai City has made some plans and studies in this regard. I would like Mayor Suai to tell us something about this. [Suai Liguo] Beihai is a sea passageway in the vast southwestern region. The city has eight strong points with regard to its natural resources, in particular, tourism and ports. Beihai City has invested a large sum of money in infrastructure and energy projects. We have built Tieshangang Highway and more than 10 city highways. We have also constructed an airport. We are creating the best investment environment to attract investors to come to Beihai to join local construction or make investments. We are making efforts to build Beihai into an influential and new city. Cheng Kejie, Lei Yu, Shuai Liguo, and Hong Huzhou also answered the following questions raised by reporters: How would Guangxi strengthen its economic cooperation with the United States? How would Guangxi deal blows at activities of illegally selling guns? How would Guangxi support the impoverished? How would Guangxi develop its electronics and automobile industry? What are Lee Kuan Yew's investment intentions in Guangxi?
