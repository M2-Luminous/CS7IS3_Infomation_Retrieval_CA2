It should be soberly noted, however, that there are problems in further development. The stress of our future rural work is to be put on deepening rural reform, effectively developing the rural economy, raising peasants' incomes, and maintaining social stability. Liu Jiang today made a report on the current situation in agriculture and the rural economy at a reporting meeting sponsored by the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, the Work Committee for Organs Under the CPC Central Committee, the Work Committee for Organs Under the State Council, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee. He said: With the implementation of policy measures taken by the party Central Committee and the State Council to support agricultural production and protect peasants' interests in the past year, the rural economy maintained a good momentum of development; grain output has topped 450 billion jin, an all-time high; the output of most cash crops, except cotton and oil-bearing crops, went up; products related to the "vegetable basket" project continue to increase; village and town enterprises developed rapidly, with better economic performance; peasants's incomes continue to rise, and their burdens were reduced to some extent; and rural reform continued to deepen, and market forces played an increasingly important role in the rural economy. On problems in the development of agriculture and the rural economy, Liu Jiang considered the following to be major problems: 1) The effective supply of farm products is not stable enough. With scarcity of land and a large population, our country's increased agricultural production is offset by an increase in the population. The average per capita consumption of farm products is low, and the distribution of farm products in areas and the structure of their varieties are uneven. Prices sometimes fluctuate rather sharply. 2) The increase of peasants'incomes has been slow in the past few years, which has affected their input into agricultural production and the expansion of rural markets. 3) The pressure of rural surplus manpower for employment has increased. He said: Conscientious efforts should be made to solve institutional or deep-seated problems in the development of the rural economy, such as insufficient investment, the increasing disparity in prices between industrial goods and agricultural produce, backward scientific and technological education, and unsound rural management and operation systems. Liu Jiang stressed: The major tasks in future rural work are to deepen rural reform, effectively develop the rural economy, raise peasants' incomes, and maintain social stability. He said: To effectively develop the economy, it is necessary, first of all, to do a good job in cotton production, make the "vegetable basket" project a success, stabilize grain production, and ensure the effective supply of farm products. Peasants' incomes are one of the crucial issues in rural work in the 1990's. Without a steady increase in peasants' incomes, their input into agriculture cannot possibly increase, nor can rural markets expand. The basic way to raise peasants' incomes is to deepen reform, accelerate the development of the rural economy, and increase their incomes with increased production. He emphasized: For rural areas, it is essential to lighten peasants' burdens, help them free themselves from poverty, vigorously rectify various unhealthy trends about which people have a lot of complaints, strengthen the building of basic-level rural organizations, and gradually narrow the gap between the eastern and western regions of the country in order to maintain social stability. Liu Jiang: We should step up our work in five aspects to develop agriculture and the rural economy: 1) We should further improve our policies to protect and support agriculture. 2) Keeping in mind the goal of establishing a socialist market economic structure, we should further deepen rural reform, particularly improve the grain purchasing and selling policies and the basic rural management system, guide the sound development of the cooperative share holding system, and deepen the reform of the rural banking system. 3) We should promote scientific and technological progress in rural areas and develop agriculture through the development of science, technology, and education. 4) We should clearly define our responsibilities and vigorously implement policies. 5) The whole party should pay close attention to agriculture, and society as a whole should concern itself with it.
