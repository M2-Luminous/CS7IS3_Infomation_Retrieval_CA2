But it takes little imagination to picture, within a few weeks, new excited discussions about a further hike in the interest rate--possibly soon--with all its concomitant phenomena such as temporary distortions on the international interest rate markets. The problem of U.S. monetary policy is in its concept, difficult for the outsider to understand. Hardly any analyst at present can recognize in the U.S. economy any signals of an increase in the inflation rate. For years the Federal Reserve in Washington has no longer attached great importance to intermediate targets such as the money supply. Instead, it has based its decisions on the course of the economic cycle, and lately also on the exchange rate. That, however, is a two-edged sword, because a monetary policy based on the business cycle or the exchange rate can be afflicted with great uncertainties. The U.S. example demonstrates well how a monetary policy, hardly comprehensible to outsiders, can cause uncertainty on the markets. This may serve as a warning to all those who recommend that the Bundesbank, for the sake of a short-lived economic effect, deviate from its policy based on the longer term.
