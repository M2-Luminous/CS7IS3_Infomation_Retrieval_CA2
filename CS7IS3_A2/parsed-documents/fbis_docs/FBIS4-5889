The commission said Japanese petrochemical firms generally negotiate with customers on prices for domestically produced naphtha by taking into account the average price for imported naphtha over a three-month period. Although the practice was formed based on a Ministry of International Trade and Industry "administrative guidance" in 1982, it seems to be a problem in terms of promoting fair price competition in the industry, the commission said. In addition, the practice of setting prices for domestically produced resin higher than those for imported resin is also a problem, it said. The situation stems from reasoning that domestic firms provide after-sales service. The commission also said joint sales ventures should be disbanded because they appear to hinder competition. There are seven such ventures at present, set up by petrochemical firms for sales of general-purpose petrochemical products. The commission, however, said that since the autumn of 1992, prices for five petrochemical products, including naphtha and ethylene, had appropriately dropped along with import prices for the products' raw materials. The drops reflect the yen's rise against the U.S. dollar on foreign exchanges during the period.
