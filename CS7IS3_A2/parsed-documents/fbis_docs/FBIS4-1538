It has increasingly demonstrated the radiance of its truth and has made clear that it is a great theory for consolidating and developing socialism. An Epoch-Making Contribution to the History of the Development of Socialism Lenin once said: "Our judgment of historical achievements is based not on whether the history-makers have provided us with the things which we need now, but on whether they have provided something new which previous generations had not provided." The epoch-making historical achievement of the work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" lies precisely in the fact that it contributed a new scientific conclusion and solved an enormous and pressing problem in the practice of socialism. This theory adhered to thoroughgoing Marxist dialectics and propelled Marxist doctrine on social contradictions to a new stage. It completely refuted the point of view that regarded contradictions within socialism as heresy, promulgating the need to scientifically recognize contradictions in socialist society and illuminating the role of correctly handling these contradictions as a motive force driving the advance of socialism. Thus it has opened the new line of thought that the correct handling of social contradictions will promote social progress. Moreover, it has promulgated and expounded on the two kinds of contradictions, different in nature, which exist objectively in socialist society, and this has charted the course to the concrete recognition and handling of all contradictions under conditions of socialism. If we say that, due to Stalin's error of denying contradictions in theory and mixing up contradictions in practice, the great pursuit of socialism initiated by Lenin gradually sapped the vigor of socialist development and subsequently led the development of socialism to a certain crisis, then we can say that Comrade Mao Zedong's theory has injected vigor into socialism and given a great impetus to its development. The Overall Theme of Domestic Political Life in the Primary Stage of Socialism In 1957 Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our objective, what we wish to build, is a type of political setup which is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, which has both unity of purpose and individual ease of mind, and is lively and vigorous. This will be beneficial to socialist revolution and socialist construction, help us overcome difficulties, speed up the construction of our country with a modernized industry and agriculture, promote the consolidation of the party and the nation, and help us to withstand trials and tribulations. The overall theme of this is the correct handling of contradictions among the people and contradictions between the enemy and ourselves. We will go about this by seeking truth from facts and following the mass line. "Practice in the years following 1957 showed how correct and far- sighted he was to grasp this overall theme. It is no simple feat to grasp clearly and without wavering this overall theme from beginning to end, and once having grasped it, to do a good job of it. The crucial point lies in having a profound and intrinsic understanding of China's national conditions. The second-generation leadership body which emerged after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core, summed up historical experience and lessons, studied the new situation and the new problems under the new historical conditions, and soberly recognized that our country is at present, and will be for a comparatively long historical period to come, in the primary stage of socialism. This has made us all the more keenly realize the scientific nature of this overall theme of correctly handling the contradictions among the people, and raised our consciousness of the need to grasp it tightly, and consequently, our scientific understanding of the special nature of the social contradictions in the primary stage of socialism. First: The large-scale and leading nature of contradictions among the people. Of all the contradictions in the primary stage of socialism, "class struggle is no longer the principal contradiction." None of the various social contradictions existing on a large scale in our country belongs within the scope of class struggle. Of course, class struggle, within certain parameters, will survive for a long time, and under certain conditions may even intensify. This situation of contradictions demands that we not only avoid glossing over still-existing class struggles of an antagonistic nature, but that we fully recognize the dominant position of widespread social contradictions among the people. Second: Contradictions among the people are diverse and complicated. In the primary stage of socialism, due to both historical and modern factors, uneven development among districts, industries, departments, nationalities and groups lead to differences in benefits. These differences in benefits lead to contradictions. In the conditions of reform and opening, and especially after undergoing new adjustments -- and even frictions and collisions -- in the course of the changeover from the old to the new structure, these contradictions take on an very complex character. For instance, the scissors gap between industry and agriculture, the widening gap in the development level between the coastal and inland regions, the growing gap between managers and workers in many economic sectors, and the unfair social distribution -- all these have exacerbated the difficulties in distinguishing the contradictions and made it more urgent to find a new way to handle them. Third: The contradictions in people's thinking and understanding are long-term and frequent. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a creative social systems engineering project. In the course of exploration and opening up in the face of divided opinions on the advantages and disadvantages which crop up, divergence in people's understanding is inevitable. This is not only because there are different interest bases, but also because there are different levels of understanding of the theory of knowledge. This divergence in understanding needs to be cleared up by means of discussion, comparing notes, and exchanges, but more importantly, it should be gradually solved in the deepening of the reform. Fourth: The contradictions in the party-masses relationship and the cadres-masses relationship have become an increasingly important aspect of the contradictions among the people. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Our people's government is a government which genuinely represents the people's interests. It is a government which serves the people. However, there are also certain contradictions between it and the masses of the people. These contradictions include those between the state's interest, the collective interest, and the individual interest, those between democracy and centralism, those between the leaders and the led, and those between the bureaucratic style of work of some government functionaries and the masses." The key to solving these contradictions is to rectify the party's style of work, strengthen the building of clean government, and "persist in our efforts to restore the traditional style of work of our party characterized by hard work, plain living, and close relations with the masses." The problem of work style of a party in power is a life-or-death concern of that party. Only if our party can correctly solve this contradiction and further consolidate and strengthen the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the masses will it be possible to attain the type of political situation described by Comrade Mao Zedong and only then will our party be able to stand up to any storms and stresses. Fifth: The multisphere, multilevel nature of contradictions among the people demands a versatile method of handling them. As contradictions among the people in a socialist system can be alleviated and solved through self-regulation and self-improvement, it is imperative for us to give full play to the superiority of the socialist system in handling contradictions. In resolving the dynamics of contradictions we must find the most appropriate plan, effective for a given period of time. It is unrealistic to be blindly self-satisfied, metaphisically refusing to recognize contradictions or mechanically applying one pattern to approach many contradictions. There is, and can be, no universal panacea -- we must exercise the party's and the government's subjective dynamism, starting from reality in everything. Raising the Ability To Correctly Handle Contradictions Among the People Is an Important Duty of a Party in Power A great work is only such if it cleaves to its main theme without wandering off the track and solves well the transition from paragraph to paragraph. This great piece of writing on the correct handling of contradictions among the people not only has to adhere closely to its main theme, but has to be seriously organized and coordinated. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh CPC Central Committee, not only has our party gained a profound understanding of the main theme of contradictions among the people, but in the course of practical explorations has accumulated rich experience in the handling of contradictions among the people. --The objective of getting a firm grasp on the correct handling of contradictions among the people is to unite all the positive elements, transform all the negative elements and serve the construction of a powerful, democratic, and civilized modern socialist country. Therefore, when we handle various types of contradictions among the people, we must start from this overall interest and work to promote the realization of our nation's stability and unity, the development of its productive forces, and the overall progress of society. We must coordinate in an organic way the country's long-term development with the actual demands of the masses of the people, and the interests of the country as a whole, with the interests of the regions, departments, and individuals. However, we must recognize that while the multitude of contradictions among the people are all rationally clamoring to be solved, they can only be solved step by step. Some contradictions cannot be solved all at once, while others can only be eased to a certain extent. In all this, people must take the overall situation into account. --Gather tightly around "one center" to handle the various contradictions among the people. The large number of contradictions among the people in the primary stage of socialism, whether they are differences of interest or divergence of understanding, in the final analysis must be solved through development and reform. Many problems can be comparatively well solved as the economy develops, the wealth for social distribution increases, the reform advances, mechanisms are enlivened, and social vigor increases. For this reason, in handling any contradiction we must obey and serve "one center" and gradually solve them in conjunction. --Synthesizing a variety of methods and applying them in a coordinated way is the basic channel for handling contradictions among the people. Contradictions among the people touch upon the fields of economics, politics, ideology, and culture. As such, they all have their individual peculiarities, but they also have mutual relationships. Therefore, in handling contradictions among the people, not only must we provide concrete solutions to concrete questions, but we must refrain from judging by appearances. We must combine democratic discussion, persuasion and education, legal regulations, moral restraints, and administrative and economic methods, and apply them in a synthesized and coordinated way. Contradictions of different natures call for different handling methods, i.e., the method of "unity-criticism-unity" should be applied in the case of political and ideological problems; in the case of relations between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, the method of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision"; and in the case of science and culture, the method of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." In the case of economic benefits, it is necessary to make overall plans and take all factors into consideration. In the new circumstances, contradictions have taken on a complicated and many- sided character, facing us with the necessity of finding even more new methods to solve them. In the past few years, in the course of handling the contradictions and clashes that have emerged between the interests of the masses and the interests of the regions, we have gained some good experience, i.e., we should tell the people to recognize that, for a certain period of time, differences in benefits are unavoidable, and to encourage some regions and some people to push ahead with development through hard work and scientific management. At the same time, while advancing toward common prosperity, we must coordinate benefits in a multilateral way and make sure that differences will not be so great as to threaten social stability. -- Carefully distinguish between two different types of contradictions, and resolutely use dictatorial methods to handle the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves. In the primary stage of socialism, class struggle still exists to a certain extent. The contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and the contradictions among the people are so intertwined that they are sometimes not immediately distinguishable. This calls for the utmost prudence. But in cases in which there is conclusive evidence that a contradiction is one between the enemy and ourselves we must tackle it head-on, for it is only by resolutely battling the enemy that we can safeguard the people. --Conscientiously handle contradictions within the party. Contradictions within the party fall into the category of contradictions among the people. The correct handling of contradictions within the party is very important for a ruling party in its efforts to build unity, cohesion, integrity, self-discipline, and conscientious administration on behalf of the people. The correct handling of contradictions within the party contributes to solving contradictions among the people. At the same time, if contradictions within the party are not handled correctly, their negative elements will have an adverse effect on solutions to contradictions among the people. When leading groups at all levels of the party shoulder the important task of handling contradictions among the people, their very persons become a unity of contradictions, and the correct handling of contradictions among members of the leading groups of the party and the proper building of unity and cohesion is an important task which must not be neglected. We are now in the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The correct handling of contradictions among the people is a great undertaking which must be tackled throughout the primary stage of socialism. There is an endless series of new conditions and problems. The whole party must make more efforts to correctly handle contradictions among the people in order to promote the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
