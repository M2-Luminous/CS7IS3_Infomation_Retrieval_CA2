FR940722-0-00019 FR940722-0-00003 A requirement for preparation of a ``Summary Compensation Table'' (table) was added to the final regulation to enhance the comparability of the compensation disclosures. Commenters indicated there was a need to improve the consistency of reporting compensation information and suggested the regulations stipulate a format for disclosure. In response, the general definition of ``compensation'' was eliminated and replaced by the more descriptive table and corresponding instructions. For purposes of reporting compensation information in the table, compensation is divided into two main categories: (1) ``Annual;'' and (2) ``Other.'' The separation is to distinguish normal annual compensation from compensation that is unusual, infrequent, reflects special circumstances, or is earned during the fiscal year but is not usually available to the senior officer until a later date. The components of ``Annual'' compensation include salary, bonuses, deferred compensation and perquisites. Amounts shown as ``salary'' and ``bonus'' are to reflect the gross amounts earned during the fiscal year before any reductions for amounts contributed during the fiscal year to a 401(k) plan or similar plan. If, for any reason, the exact amount of salary or bonus earned in the fiscal year is not expected to be known in time for its inclusion in the report, the institution is to include in the report its best estimate of the compensation amount and provide appropriate footnote disclosure with the table. Amounts shown as ``deferred/perquisites'' will include such items as deferred compensation, perquisites, and any other significant personal benefits customarily paid, earned or received on an annual basis. With respect to deferred compensation, this amount should reflect all forms of deferred compensation earned during the fiscal year, whether or not paid in cash. For example, if the deferred compensation was earned during the period but payment in cash was voluntarily deferred by the senior officer to a later period (e.g., upon retirement) the amount earned must still be included in the current period's compensation amount. Consequently, cash payments under deferred compensation arrangements where the amounts were earned in previous periods would not be included as part of the current period's compensation. The category depicted as ``Other'' in the table includes amounts not appropriately characterized as components of annual compensation. Section 620.5(i)(2)(i)(E) specifies two forms of compensation that should be included in this category: (1) Compensation in the form of payouts due to a senior officer's resignation, retirement, or termination from employment; and (2) contributions by the institution on behalf of the senior officer to a defined contribution plan for which cash payments from the plan are typically not available to the senior officer until a later date. Any form of compensation in this part must be specifically identified and described in a footnote to the table. The FCA received a mixed response to proposed ยง620.5(i)(2)(iii), which would have required FCS institutions to provide a general discussion of compensation plans of its senior officers. While many commenters supported the proposed requirement, others believed that the disclosures would be too burdensome to compile. The FCA Board continues to believe that such discussion would be beneficial in providing explanations of compensation plans to the readers of the report. For the most part, the final regulation retains the requirements in proposed ยง620.5(i)(2)(iii) that FCS institutions provide a description of the compensation plans of all those senior officers covered by the regulations. Proposed ยง620.5(i)(2)(iii) (F) and (G), which would have required institutions to discuss the amounts paid under the plans, were dropped from the final rule because the final rule requires these comments to be disclosed in the table. The remaining compensation discussion requirements are now contained in ยง620.5(i)(2)(ii) in the final rule.
