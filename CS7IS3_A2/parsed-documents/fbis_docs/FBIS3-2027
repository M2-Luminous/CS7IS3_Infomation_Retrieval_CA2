Speaking to the press after returning from a visit to Moscow, Karadzic said the Serb side would do all it can to maintain peace on all fronts, so that the new round of peace talks would be held in a possibly good atmosphere. He also stressed that the alliance between Muslims and Croats should not be allowed to hurt the Serbs. "It is no good for the United States to replace the role of the United Nations and other international institutions," he said. The Bosnian Muslims and Croats reached an agreement this week in Washington to set up a federation. The United States was the arranger of the talks for the agreement. Karadzic also said that since Washington has hosted the talks on Bosnia, why should Moscow not host other talks? He said that Russia's participation in peace efforts in Bosnia has a "decisive meaning" and would establish a balance of power in the international scene. In another development, the UN Secretary general Butrus Butrus-Ghali told the UN Security Council on Thursday that the four Galeb combat aircrafts shot down by NATO forces on February 28 took off from Serb-controlled area in Croatia.
