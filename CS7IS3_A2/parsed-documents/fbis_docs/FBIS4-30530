Attending it were Toshio Nejima, secretary general of the National Liaison Council of Trade Unions, Hiroshi Wakabayashi, secretary general of the Japan Committee for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, and other public figures and citizens, more than 200 in all. Japanese lawyer Shigeru Tokoi at the meeting roundly exposed the illegality and injustice of the search of the Osaka and Kyoto prefectural organisations of Chongnyon by the Japanese police and denounced it as a political crackdown designed to collect information for the destruction of Chongnyon and enact "an emergency law". An appeal was adopted at the meeting. The appeal said that the Japanese Government must immediately express apology and repentance to Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. "The governmnt's policy must not be sanctions against the DPRK but the establishment of Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations and postwar compensation," it said, strongly demanding an early apology by the Japanese Government.
