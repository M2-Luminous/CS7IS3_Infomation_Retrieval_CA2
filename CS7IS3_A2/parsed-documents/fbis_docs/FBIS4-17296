Train Tickets, and Everything Else Along With Them, Become More Expensive"] [Text] The overall index of inflation for the week was 102.7 percent, and since the beginning of the year it has increased 50 percent. From 5 through 12 April the inflation rate was 2.7 percent. The increase in charges for paid consumer services continued to considerably outstrip price increases for food products and industrial goods. Food and nonfood product prices went up 1.2 and 2.4 percent respectively. On the whole paid consumer services, mainly because of a twofold increase in the cost of railroad travel, became 18.4 percent more expensive. The biggest increase in prices for goods and services was noted in the cities of the Urals, East Siberia, and the Far East. They changed least of all in the Northwest and Volga-Vyatka Economic Regions. Food prices increased without any particular surges -- slowly but surely. Vegetables prices went up 5.1 percent and fruit prices went up 4.3 percent, which was not to the same extent as before but still more than other things. The price of salt continued to increase -- by 4.1 percent. Hulled and pasta product prices went up 2.7 percent, bread and flour product prices went up 2.3 percent, and the price of flour went up 2.1 percent. Prices for dairy and fish products, butter and vegetable oil, eggs, and sugar changed by less than 1 percent during the week. Vodka became 1.6 percent cheaper than a week ago. The biggest price increases were for food products in the Volga (2.3 percent) and North Caucasus (2.2 percent) regions. In the North Caucasus region the biggest increases were for fruit and vegetable produce -- 12-14 percent -- and bread and flour products -- 3 percent. In the Volga region fruit prices went up by 11 percent and prices for dairy products and butter went up 5-8 percent. As of 12 April the average cost of the basket of the 19 most important food products was 46,000 rubles [R] calculated on a monthly basis, an increase of 1.1 percent during the week and 50 percent since the beginning of the year. This basket cost R44,400 at official trade prices and R57,500 at unofficial trade prices. The Far East Economic Region is still the most expensive in terms of the basket's cost -- R80,900. The Central Chernozem Economic Region has been the cheapest for two and a half months at R35,200. On 12 April the basket cost R50,000 in Moscow and R49,700 in St. Petersburg. Moscow is in 33d place and St. Petersburg is in 36th place in terms of high prices in the list of cities being monitored. Industrial goods went up in price more than food products. Prices for certain types of fuel and medicine continued to increase -- by 8-10 percent during the week. The average price increase for wallpaper was 4 percent and that for knitted articles, synthetic detergents, and matches was 3 percent. Prices for tobacco products and cultural and domestic goods went up 1 percent. Besides fuel, in the past week knitted and sewn articles have become considerably more expensive in the Far East region. At 3.6 percent the increase in prices for industrial goods in the Central Chernozem region was higher than the average Russian increase. For a long time now there has been a large gap between the maximum and minimum prices for identical goods in various Russian cities. Thus, since the beginning of the year there has been a fivefold to sixfold difference in footwear prices, a fivefold difference in tobacco product prices, and a threefold to fourfold difference in television prices.
