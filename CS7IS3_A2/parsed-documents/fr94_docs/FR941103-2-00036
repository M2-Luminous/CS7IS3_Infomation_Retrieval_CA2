FR941103-2-00036 FR941103-2-00024 [Docket No. RP95&hyph;18&hyph;000] Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Notice of Transition Cost Recovery Report October 28, 1994. Take notice that on October 26, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing a Transition Cost Recovery Report pursuant to Section 24 of the General Terms and Conditions of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, approved by the Commission's September 17, 1993, order in Docket No. RS92&hyph;16, et al. FGT states that the Transition Cost Recovery Report filed summarizes the activity which has occurred in its TCR Account and Order 636 Account through October 31, 1994, and includes $4,850,000 of recoverable transition costs not previously reported. Because the currently effective surcharge rates are at the maximum levels permitted by FGT's tariff, no tariff revisions are required as a result of this filing. FGT states that copies of the report were mailed to all customers serviced under the rate schedules affected by the report and the interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before November 4, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
