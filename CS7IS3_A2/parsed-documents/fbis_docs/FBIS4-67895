The Institute of Advanced Studies (IEAv) at the Aerospace Technical Center [Centro Tecnico Aeroespacial--CTA] in Sao Jose dos Campos is already producing uranium 235 through the method of separating isotopes with laser beams via atomic vapor. The separation of uranium isotopes is an activity that currently demands heavy investment. Colonel Hugo Pereira Chaves, director of IEAv, says that among all the methods currently known (gaseous diffusion, ultra centrifuge, molecular) for uranium enrichment, the atomic process is best from the economic point of view. This method, he adds, is also best from the ecological point of view, given that the radioactive waste may be recycled and treated. The most widely used fuel element for nuclear reactors is uranium, whose natural composition is as follows: 99.3 percent is made up of an isotope with an atomic weight of 238, and 0.7 percent of an isotope with an atomic weight of 235. Most of the existing nuclear reactors need ``enriched'' uranium. This means increasing the 235 isotope content, which is radioactive, to a concentration of greater than 3 percent. The physical principle of the atomic separation method is based on the different abilities of the 235 and 238 isotopes to absorb light from well defined frequencies, that is, light of specific colors. The atomic process works with uranium in its metallic form. The separation of 235 and 238 isotopes undergoes three stages. The metallic uranium is placed in a container heated to 3,000 degrees [scale not specified]. The uranium vapor generated by the high temperature is absorbed by laser irradiation at a frequency that attracts the 235 atoms to a metallic plaque, from which they are extracted. According to Col. Pereira Chaves, the IEAv has attained a level of 50 percent uranium enrichment during the process of exciting the 235 molecules. Extraction of uranium, however, has yet not been possible at such a level, he said. He did not reveal the level of enrichment already attained by the IEAv, as it is an industrial secret. The United States Col. Pereira Chaves reported that the United States has already managed a 30 percent enrichment in its tests--of which very little is known. The industrial development of this process is still not known in any other country of the world. The Americans have already decided that the atomic separation process with laser beams must be adopted by the United States on a commercial scale in the next century. Atomic separation, Pereira Chaves said, will replace the current gaseous diffusion process that is underway. ``Between 1972 and 1988 the United States invested $700 million in the atomic process. An industrial scale demonstration will require an additional $946 million,'' he added, according to IEAv estimates. The IEAv, according to Pereira Chaves, has allotted only $71 million to its uranium enrichment program with laser beams since 1981. Part of these resources, nearly $41 million, were financed by the Aeronautics Ministry, and the rest came from the National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), the Funding Authority for Studies and Projects (Finep), and the Strategic Affairs Secretariat. For the project to develop satisfactorily, Pereira Chaves said, the institute would need something between $1.5 and $2 million per year. In the past three years, however, the institute has been receiving less than $1 million per year for the maintenance of its entire project structure, Chaves said. Molecular Process In addition to the atomic process, the IEAv has concentrated its research on uranium enrichment by laser beam through the molecular method. The molecular method, according to Chaves, uses uranium hexaflouride gas (UF6) mixed with a lighter gas (carrier gas). The mixture is accelerated in a supersonic (high speed) pipe, and is then cooled to a temperature of minus 190 degrees Celsius. ``Under those conditions UF6 molecules that have the uranium 235 isotope absorb laser radiation of a different frequency than that absorbed by the molecules of uranium 238,'' Chaves said. The molecular process, according to the director, is also being studied as one of the alternatives that could be adopted by Brazil for the industrial-scale production of uranium 235. ``The advantage of the molecular separation method is that there is a facility in Resende (Rio de Janeiro), which was built under an agreement signed with Germany in 1979,'' he said. Another advantage is that researchers are already familiar with the entire corrosion process caused by UF6, which they have learned to control. The metallic uranium corrosion process (used for atomic separation) is still unknown to them. Lower Cost Research with the atomic separation method, however, is at a more advanced stage, as it has succeeded in separating uranium 235, though at a laboratory level. Production costs, according to the IEAv, are 23 percent lower than those for traditional enrichment processes. ``Until 1985, a total investment of $9.7 million was considered necessary for the operation, maintenance, research, and development of the atomic separation method,'' Chaves said. The figures, according to Chaves, are included in a study made in the United States and published by the NUCLEONICS WEEK newspaper. Based on the study, the United States invested in the expansion of its uranium enrichment capacity through the laser separation process. In Brazil, uranium 235 is produced at an industrial scale by the ultracentrifuge method, which is based on the mass difference between isotopes. The Navy Ministry has a research center that specializes in producing uranium through this method.
