FR940630-2-00153 FR940630-2-00119 Pilot Briefings Concerning VFR Operating Procedures in the Boston Class B Airspace over the ``Thunderfest 1994 Powerboat Race'' AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of meeting. SUMMARY: This notice is announcing pilot briefings concerning Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operating procedures in the Boston Class B airspace over the Thunderfest 1994 Powerboat Race. The race is scheduled for July 30, 1994, in Boston Harbor, Boston, Massachusetts. The race start time is scheduled for 1:00 p.m. and is expected to last approximately 2 hours. In the event of inclement weather on July 30, the race will start at the same time on the following day (July 31). The race course is located adjacent to Boston-Logan International Airport, within the Boston Class B airspace. Because this event will take place in close proximity to the Boston-Logan International Airport, the FAA will conduct mandatory pilot briefings for those pilots who would like to observe the event. Due to the limited airspace surrounding the race course and the possible need to conduct search and rescue operations, the number of aircraft that will be permitted to operate in the vicinity of the race course will be limited. Receiving one of the briefings will make a pilot eligible to enter the Class B airspace encompassing the race course, but will not guarantee that a clearance to enter the area will be granted. TIMES AND DATES: The meetings will be held at 10 a.m. on July 21, 1994; and at 1 p.m. on July 27, 1994. PLACE: New England Regional Office, Third Floor Conference Room, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, Massachusetts.
