Section 771.18 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(1)(ii) to read as follows: §771.18 General License GIFT; Shipments of gift parcels. * * * * * (b)␣*␣*␣* (1)␣*␣*␣* (ii) Normally sent as gifts, and in quantities normally given as gifts between individuals, as follows: (A) For Cuba, the only gifts that may be included are the following items from Supplement No. 7 to Part 773 of this subchapter: food, vitamins, seeds, medicines, medical supplies and devices, hospital supplies and equipment, equipment for the handicapped, clothing, personal hygiene items, veterinary medicines and supplies, fishing equipment and supplies, soap-making equipment, and in addition receive-only radio equipment for reception of commercial/civil AM/FM and short wave publicly available frequency bands, and batteries for such equipment. (B) For all other destinations, goods eligible for GIFT shipments include all items described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section as well as all other items normally sent as gifts. Gold bullion, gold taels, and gold bars are prohibited as are items intended for resale. Example. A watch or piece of jewelry is normally sent as a gift. However, multiple watches, either in one package or in subsequent shipments, would not qualify for GIFT because the quantity exceeds that normally given between individuals. Similarly, a sewing machine or bicycle, within the dollar limits of this general license, may be an appropriate gift. However, subsequent shipments of the same item to the same donee would not be a gift normally given between individuals. (C) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, clothing is appropriate, except that export of military wearing apparel to Country Group Q, S, W, Y, or Z under this general license is specifically prohibited, regardless of whether all distinctive U.S. military insignia, buttons, and other markings are removed. * * * * * Dated: August 25, 1994.
