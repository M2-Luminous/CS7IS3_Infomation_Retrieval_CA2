The Fuzhou Railway Subbureau is in charge of the railway network within Fujian, which has a total length of nearly 1,100 km, an annual freight transport capacity of over 20 million tonnes, and an annual passenger transport capacity of more than 17 million passengers. The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, the main railway artery in Fujian, has been electrified. The construction of the Nanping- Hengyang Railway, Fujian's second railway to other provinces, is in full swing. The province will build seven more new railways before the end of this century. The Fuzhou Railway Subbureau is located at the southeastern tip of China's railway network, and there is no transit transport by means of railways managed by the subbureau, so it is convenient for the subbureau to carry out reform in isolation. It has been learned that the Fuzhou Railway Subbureau will take two steps to transform itself into a company. The first is to change from its existing state of having assets invested solely by the state and the reality of unified operation and administration of the entire network into a limited liability company solely owned by the state. The second step is to absorb other investment entities and to develop into a shareholding limited-liability company with state capital holding controlling shares.
