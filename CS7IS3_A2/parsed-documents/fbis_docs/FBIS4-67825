Joining Vienna and Paris conventions entitles Estonia also to certain international rights and enables the country to apply for help in case of accidents, Tarand said. He also stressed that these conventions would be a basis for negotiations if anything should happen when Russia removes its nuclear training reactors from Paldiski, a former submarine training base for the Soviets.
