He claimed that our country has one of the most modern laboratories in the field of expert and criminal investigation services on the American Continent. During the course to update forensic chemical analysis of narcotics and psychotropic substances, given by specializing officials from the Attorney General's Office [PGR], the French researcher admitted that our country already has gained experience in this field. He noted, however, that since all nations have areas that should continue to be developed, an international records system on drugs, for example, might possibly be created. This would enable the various nations to compare statistical data and drug samples, so as to locate the centers for narcotics and psychotropic substances. Addressing the PGR's general director of expert services, Miguel Oscar Aguilar Ruiz, and investigators from our country's various attorney generals' offices, Christopher Chaboud declared that Mexico has a vast knowledge and a history of its own regarding the investigation of, and the battle against the drug traffic. He said that, therefore, other nations should view its experience as an example. He indicated that Europe has a different type of experience in this field, but admitted that, in any event, there is just one battle and the problem is the same internationally. Hence, exchanges of views and information will help to accrue better results in the fight against the drug traffic on all its levels. Elsewhere in his remarks, the French official emphasized that Mexico and France have mutual cooperation agreements (the latest one ratified this year). Through them, both nations have promised to exchange information for the purpose of curbing the dreadful phenomenon of drug addiction and trafficking which, unfortunately, is afflicting the two countries. He stressed that Mexico has a real, strong commitment to the rest of the world in this respect and, although admitting that each country has its own policy for fighting the drug traffic, he said that Mexico would continue to be an example in this area for both Latin America and Europe.
