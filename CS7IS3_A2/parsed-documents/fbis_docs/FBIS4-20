FBIS4-20 "cr00000021194001" 9 April 1994 FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-048--RUSSIA RUSSIA: TRIAL OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS SCIENTIST RAISES SECRECY RUSSIA: TRIAL OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS SCIENTIST RAISES SECRECY ISSUES The controversial decision of the Moscow City Court to try Vil Mirzayanov for blowing the whistle on possible chemical weapons violations in 1992 played into a much wider debate in the Russian media over providing necessary protection for state secrets while avoiding old-style censorship. Although the charges against Mirzayanov were finally dropped, recent actions by the Russian Government to define state secrets continue to prompt concerns over freedom of the press. MIRZAYANOV ARTICLE In September 1992 an article by Professor Vil Mirzayanov, published in MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI (MOSCOW NEWS), claimed that the Ministry of Defense was continuing to develop and produce chemical weapons in violation of international agreements made by Russia and in violation of orders from both former President Mikhail Gorbachev and President Yeltsin. The article created a major scandal at the time, not only over the alleged violations, but because it was originally seized prior to publication from the weekly newspaper ARGUMENTY I FAKTY by Ministry of Security officials, thus raising serious constitutional questions about freedom of the press. The article, "Poisoned Politics", was later acquired and published by MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI (MOSCOW NEWS). Mirzayanov and coauthor Dr. L. Fedorov were arrested, held briefly for questioning, and charged with violating Article 75 of the RSFSR Criminal Code "revealing state secrets." Then they were released on their own recognizance until an investigation could be completed and a determination made whether the case should be brought to trial. (For complete details of the case see FBIS Foreign Press Note: "Russia: Chemist Involved in Development of Chemical Weapons Arrested, Released;" FB PN 93- 019, 13 Jan 93.) ARREST AND TRIAL On 25 December 1993, investigation of she case was completed and submitted to Moscow City Court No. 30 for trial. A subpoena ordered Mirzayanov to appear for a hearing on 6 January. Because of the illness of Mirzayanov's lawyer, the session was postponed until 24 January (MOSCOW NEWS, 4-10 Feb 94). Meanwhile, the issuance of the subpoena was made public, and it immediately provoked protest actions and a highly critical press campaign. Mirzayanov initially refused to cooperate with the court, claiming that the trial was illegal because the charges against him were based on a secret list of state secrets that had never been published. According to Article 15, Point 3 of the constitution, "no legal acts concerning the rights, freedoms, and obligations of individuals can be applied if they have not been officially published. The court rejected Mirzayanov's arguments and ordered him to return the following day, 25 January. Mirzayanov said he would not return (INTERFAX 24 Jan 94). When Mirzayanov did not appear for the next session as ordered, the Moscow City Court issued a warrant for his arrest and scheduled a hearing for 3 February. Mirzayanov was detained at his Moscow apartment and later taken to Matrosskaya Tishina Prison (Radio Rossii 27 Jan 94). The 3 February hearing was also postponed, however, this time because the guards accompanying Mirzayanov to the Moscow City Court Building were unable to get through a crowd of picketers and reporters with television cameras. They returned Mirzayanov to prison. (INTERFAX 3 Feb 93) The court met again on 7 February. At that session three "experts" testified that Mirzayanov "did not reveal information that constituted a state secret" (Radio Rossii 9 Feb 94). On 11 February, Prosecutor Leonid Pankratov asked the court not to render a verdict, but to return the case for additional investigation. The court acceded, and on 22 February Mirzayanov was released from prison "on the condition that he would not leave Moscow while his case was being reexamined." Commenting on the prosecution's decision and the "unsatisfactory conclusion" of the case, IZVESTIYA writer Valeriy Rudnev noted that "cases like Mirzayanov's do not go to court a second time--they are buried in the procuracy forever" (Russian Television 23 Feb 94; IZVESTIYA, 16 Feb 94). Dissatisfied with the court's failure to render a decision, the press began lobbying to have the trial brought to a conclusion. Finally, pressure was brought to bear from the highest levels. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that President Yeltsin wished to see the "unfortunate episode closed on lawful foundations and without further delays" (INTERFAX 3 Mar 94). On 11 March, the Prosecutor General's Office announced that it had decided to drop the case altogether because Acting General Prosecutor General Aleksey Ilyushenko "was unable to find a corpus delecti in the chemist Mirzayanov's actions" (IZVESTIYA, 12 Mar 94). PRESS, PUBLIC REACTION Protests about the Mirzayanov case began as early as 4 January, when a group of well-known Russian public figures published a statement in MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI criticizing the Moscow City Court's secret hearings and demanding that they be stopped. "The far- fetched nature of the accusations and the secrecy of the trial are symbols of a bygone era. Silence in this situation means solidarity with lawlessness." Organizations protesting the trial included the Russia's Choice voters association, the Russia's Choice faction in the State Duma, (SEGODNYA 2 Feb 94), the Democratic Union of Russia (INTERFAX 10 Feb 94), and the Human Rights Committee of the Russian Federation Union of Lawyers (INTERFAX 2 Feb 94). Civil rights activists held several news conferences, claiming that the trial was "purely political" and that it represented the most serious attempt by the Russian special services and military-industrial complex in recent years to suppress dissidence" (IZVESTIYA 28 Jan 94). The Russian press also gave the trial much publicity and criticized it severely. IZVESTIYA, in its lead editorial, called the case absurd, noting that the charges were leveled by the Ministry of Security, which no longer exists. No one seemed to know who was insisting on the prosecution of the case. IZVESTIYA said the failure to find a "specific addressee" is clear evidence of a "slide toward despotism" (IZVESTIYA 29 Jan 94). ITAR-TASS reported that according to President Yeltsin's national security advisor, Yuriy Baturin, Yeltsin too was displeased, because he believed the case to be unconstitutional. Baturin said Article 6 of the criminal code states that charges may be dropped if circumstances change. The new circumstance is the new constitution which guarantees everyone the right to "look for, receive, transmit, produce and distribute information by any legal means. The list of information comprising state secrets is determined by federal law. The list of state secrets has not been published yet. Therefore criminal charges can be dropped." (ITAR-TASS 4 Feb 94) PRESSURE FOR INCREASED SECRECY The Mirzayanov investigation and trial took place against a background of pressure on the government to take action to protect state secrets and prevent what is perceived as the detrimental transfer of secret technology to the West and Japan. Over the past two years, numerous articles have appeared in Russian newspapers criticizing the "cheap sale" of Russian technology and warning of the dangers of Western S&T aid programs. In 1992, for example, several articles appeared criticizing the U.S. Department of Energy's nuclear research contract with the Kurchatov Institute, because the United States was "getting Russia's best nuclear scientists" for a "very insignificant amount" (RADIKAL, Aug 92). Similar criticism was doled out over a 1992 high-power laser deal made with Lawrence Livermore Laboratory (IZVESTIYA, 3 Nov 92). Russia's space program has also received an enormous amount of criticism for not getting an adequate return on its technology and services. For example, the $7.5-million sale of Russia's Topaz-2 nuclear reactor is regularly cited as a "technology giveaway," which, because of its alleged SDI applicability, is also a threat to Russian security (ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 9 Nov 93). In 1992, Russian Space Agency Director Yuriy Koptev claimed that Russia was losing over a billion rubles a year due to the leakage of information or technology sales (RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, 13 Nov 92). Although most articles stress the economic aspect of technology transfer, the problem is also seen as a national security issue. According to an article by two analysts at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of International Economic and Political Research, "national technological security is an integral part of national security," and the "undermining" of national technological security" is becoming uncontrollable. The two scholars warned that "detailed knowledge regarding our potential enables the West to identify the most promising lines of research and the most qualified and productively working scientific personnel for their later use in the interests of the development of Western science and technology and the Western economy as a whole." The article went on to say that aid given to Russian scientific institutions "provides the West with the possibility of destroying a substan- tial portion of Russia's scientific-technical potential." It claimed that many scientists and whole collectives are ready to sell S&T achievements for practically nothing, warning that this is "especially dangerous in the sphere of the military-industrial complex, since it is directly related to the weakening of the country's defense potential" (ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, 20 Oct 93). SECRECY ACT, OTHER MEASURES Several measures undertaken by the Russian Federation Government over the past year suggest that it is aware of these concerns and is acting upon them. In September, the text of a state secrecy act was published which President Yeltsin had signed into law on 21 July 1993. The law, which was passed by the Supreme Soviet shortly before its dissolution in October 1993, defines what is and what is not a state secret. It also creates procedural and administrative mechanisms for protecting state secrets, specifies classification/declassification authority, provides for the declassification of state secrets, and assigns penalties both for unauthorized disclosure of classified information and other security violations (ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 21 Sep 93; full translation appears in JPRS Report: CENTRAL EURASIA, FBIS-USR-93-127, 1 Oct 93). On 10 March, the Interdepartmental Commission of the Security Council of the Russian Federation on Information Security met to discuss "realization of the Law on State Secrets adopted in 1993 and creation of up-to-date mechanisms to protect state secrets." The commission approved "recommendations for speeding up the state program for the comprehensive modernization of the state secret protection system." Representatives of the Russian Government, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and ministry and department leaders participated in the session (ITAR-TASS 10 Mar 94). President Yeltsin also abolished the Information Resources Administration (IRA), an organization tasked with "rapidly providing all Russian territories down to the rayon level with information on events in the country and abroad." The IRA installed high technology information systems, which it acquired from Western companies, in order to transmit news agency reports, official information from federal authorities, and Foreign Intelligence Service analytical materials to chiefs of administration at all levels. Officials in the Security and Communications ministries were concerned that Western special services had enlisted the aid of these companies to install special equipment making it possible for them to secretly monitor Russian Government communications. With the abolishment of the IRA, the system was dismantled and all of the IRA's functions were transferred to the Federal Government Communications Agency, alleged to be the former telecommunications service of the KGB (SEGODNYA, 30 Jul 93; MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, 5 Feb 94; KOMMERSANT-DAILY, 23 Feb 94; IZVESTIYA, 24 Feb 94). According to General Nikolay Golushko, former director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, Yeltsin issued an edict reorganizing the service on 5 January 1994. The document detailing the structure and functions of the reorganized service have remained classified. Golushko said that although he recommended that responsibility for the protection of state secrets be devolved to the organizations directly concerned with them, his recommend- ation was apparently not accepted. Ultimate responsibility continues to reside with the Counterintelligence Service (IZVESTIYA, 2 Mar 94). On 11 February, President Yeltsin signed a directive which invested officials of 38 ministries, state committees and federal services with the authority to classify information as a "state secret". The directive was severely criticized in a long IZVESTIYA editorial. IZVESTIYA was willing to concede the necessity of giving this authority to defense organizations and organiza- tions dealing with sensitive technologies, such as the Ministry of Atomic Power, but questioned why it was needed by the ministries of agriculture, health, and environmental protection. Only seven ministries out of 23 were not given classification authority--the ministries of justice, labor, the social protection of the population, cooperation with the CIS states, educa- tion, culture, and affairs of nationalities and regional policy. IZVESTIYA said that, in addition to abuses which could occur with such a widespread distribution of classification authority, the nation would suffer enormous financial costs as well. IZVESTIYA said that it was unable "to understand the logic of the president's document." Contrary to those who have com- plained about the revelations of "state secrets," IZVESTIYA warned that "by 'closing' and 'making secret' our scientific research institutes and 'hush-hush' institutions, by fencing ourselves off from each other with a barrier of departmental instructions and special sections, we drastically delayed the development of our own science and technology" (IZVESTIYA, 26 Feb 94). Similar sentiments were expressed by Viktor Loshak, chief editor of MOSCOW NEWS, the paper which originally published Mirzayanov's article in 1992. "The bureaucratic stratum between the men of power on one hand and readers and television viewers on the other is becoming wider and wider." "When such things are happening, secrecy is paramount. One wants to avoid public attention, but at the same time to be in a position to define the dosage and truthfulness of information and to shape public opinion." "Secrets must be guarded closely. It takes more than just Lubyanka (KGB prison) to do this. Where are you masters of Glavlit [Main Administration for Safeguarding State Secrets in the Press]? A censorship order has come in" (MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, 20-27 Feb 94). According to ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova, journalists are already complaining about infringements of their right to information in contraven- tion of the law on the press. The Judicial Chamber on Information, a new office of the president, discussed the issue at its first meeting on 17 February. According to the Judicial Chamber's president, Professor Anatoliy Vengerov, the "refusal to supply journalists with information that does not contain state secrets may be the reason for legal proceedings (ITAR- TASS, 17 Feb 94).
