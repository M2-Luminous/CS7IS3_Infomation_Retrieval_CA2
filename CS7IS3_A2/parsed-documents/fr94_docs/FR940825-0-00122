FR940825-0-00122 FR940825-0-00020 NMFS disagrees with the contention that the Councils' decision was not based on the best available information. The Councils considered several apportionment ratios for the east coast-west coast allocation, including the preferred alternative, based on the best scientific information available. The Councils concluded, and NMFS concurs, that the 50/50 apportionment is supported by the best available information. Also, the NMFS Science and Research Director, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, has certified that the scientific information contained in Amendment 7 is the best available. NMFS also does not agree that insufficient time was allowed for public review and comment on alleged new data presented to and considered by the Gulf Council at its March 1994 meeting when it voted to support the 50/50 west/east coast allocation. Representatives of the South Atlantic Council presented landings data to the Gulf Council, although in a different form, that had already been the subject of public review and comment and were part of the public record for a substantial period of time prior to the meeting. The same data presented to and considered by the Gulf Council at its meeting were available previously to the public as monthly landings from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, NMFS, and the Councils. Reliable landings estimates of the most recent fishing year (1992&hyph;93 season) were available to the public by mid-1993, 7 to 8 months before the Gulf Council's March 1994 meeting. Comment: The SBA commented that the IRFA does not comply with the RFA because it fails to contain an examination of other management alternatives as required by the RFA. Specifically, SBA indicated that the IRFA did not include an examination of alternatives that might further protect and enhance the coastal migratory pelagic fisheries of the Gulf of Mexico without unduly burdening small businesses. Response: NMFS concurs. Consequently, NMFS has included such analyses in the FRFA. Changes From the Proposed Rule In §642.2, the address in the definition of ``Regional Director'' is corrected. In §642.4(m)(4), the proposed rule specified that initial requests for gillnet endorsements on vessel permits must be postmarked or hand delivered ``during the 45-day period commencing on the first day of effectiveness of the final rule implementing this measure.'' In this final rule, the quoted language is replaced with, ``not later than October 31, 1994.'' Advance notification has been given to the limited number of fishermen affected by this new requirement for gillnet endorsements. Accordingly, NMFS believes that the cutoff date of October 31 provides fishermen with adequate time to submit requests for endorsements. As discussed above, a measure and related prohibition are added at §§642.28(b)(2)(iii) and 642.7(u), respectively, to allow vessels with gillnet endorsements to retain king mackerel in or from the EEZ in the Florida west coast sub-zone only when harvested with run-around gillnet gear. Additional Changes Proposed Under the FMP's framework procedure for adjusting management measures, the Councils have proposed changes in the total allowable catch for the Atlantic groups of king and Spanish mackerel and changes in the commercial trip limits for Gulf group king mackerel in the eastern zone. Preliminary notice of these changes was published on August 9, 1994 (59 FR 40509). Effective Dates The gillnet endorsement procedural requirements (§642.4(m)) and incorporation of the OMB approval number for the collection-of-information requirement associated with applications for gillnet endorsements in the table of OMB Control Numbers for NOAA Information Collection Requirements (§204.1(b)) are made effective immediately in that they are not substantive rules subject to a delay in effective date under section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act.
