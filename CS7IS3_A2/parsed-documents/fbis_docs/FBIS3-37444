The academicians' program, which, for want of any better ones, was printed in many periodicals, has proved to be one of many. The theses of four more reports aspiring to the role of programs and also the data of statistical reports characterizing the state of the economy were made public yesterday in parliamentary hearings in the State Duma. According to a report by the chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Statistics, over the past year retail prices increased 900 percent, and wholesale prices 840 percent. The federal budget deficit stood at 17 trillion rubles [R]. Profits amounted to R40 trillion. Some 17 percent of enterprises worked at a loss over the year. Mutual nonpayments amounted to R17 trillion. Industrial production fell 15 percent compared with the previous year. In the military-industrial complex it fell 29 percent. Capital investments fell 15 percent. Of 652 capital construction projects, just 193 were commissioned. Grain production fell 7 percent compared with 1992. How do economists in opposing camps rate these results, and what prescriptions for the future do they propose? Yakov Urinson, first deputy minister of economics, who submitted an extensive report for the parliamentary hearings to Sergey Glazyev, who chaired those hearings, declared that the results of the economic year are contradictory. "Inflation has fallen, and the population's monetary incomes have increased. Enterprises are coming to a halt, and yet unprofitable enterprises are continuing to work, devouring resources. Some R12 trillion has gone on expenditure which was not provided for, and this when the state has a debt of R4 trillion to the military-industrial complex and the agrarian complex." Ya. Urinson proposed a prescription for curing the crisis in the economy along the lines of the economic policy of Gaydar and Fedorov: not to change the tax policy for two years; to abolish tax breaks; to toughen up control over the expenditure part of the budget; to monitor the effectiveness of subsidies, capital investments, and subventions. To continue privatization, which, after completing the voucher stage, is to enter the stage of forming the "efficient private owner." To pursue a selective policy, reducing the number of priorities. Targeted support is needed for enterprises and particularly important sectors. This is the forecast result: a budget deficit of 5 percent, a lowering of inflation to 2-3 percent, and an increase in unemployment from 3.8 to 7 million. Deputies were not delighted with the plans of the leader of the Ministry of Economics. The discussion between them and Urinson was conducted in various languages. The deputies mostly used rally language, while Urinson employed economic concepts. Boris Fedorov, now a member of the Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances, delivered a brief speech which once again dotted the "i's" in the submitted summary of the program. In his speech Fedorov chiefly carried on polemics with Academician Shatalin and other admirers of "reforms with a human face." Briefly, concisely, and wittily, as always, Fedorov remarked that economic prosperity cannot be achieved just by printing money. He drew attention to the fact that we are already living in a market economy whether we want this or not and whether we call this market a bazaar or are moved by it. All the measures that were needed to create the market have already been taken, the former minister of finance said. Now it is only necessary to remove the inflationary tax. Fedorov remarked that there is no longer any need at all to write any programs. The government must adopt decisions every day in accordance with the principles of market economics. And, above all, the principles of financial discipline. Sergey Glazyev, who submitted to the hearings a serious report which certainly does not categorize his economic views as socialist, emphasized that the main principles of future economic conduct are the reduction of preferential credits granted out of the state budget for purposes of funding the national economy and a ban on their use to fund trade operations. Particularly to acquire imported goods. The theme of protecting the Russian economy against the pernicious influence of competition with the Western economy loomed large in Glazyev's report. Glazyev believes that the monetarists have achieved only an outward similarity with a market economy. That in the course of the reforms they failed to form a sensible structural policy. As a result of the policy of radical liberalization a spontaneous structural restructuring is taking place, consisting in the destruction of processing industry sectors and in the preferential development of raw material sectors. Thus, the potential of future growth is lost, and the economy goes over to depressed functioning as a raw materials periphery. Glazyev believes that it is necessary to encourage exports of commodities with a high proportion of VAT, not raw material goods. Yevgeniy Saburov, who held the post of vice premier in Ivan Silayev's government, called the report by the academicians under Shatalin's leadership "good but not technical" in that it urges people to live well but does not say "how." He called Fedorov's report "technical" but said it does not inspire confidence that the prescription will lead to anything good. In the conference lobby Yevgeniy Saburov explained his viewpoint: Only changes in the financial sphere are being made quickly and easily. But in the sphere of changing production and of new technologies there are no quick results. As a result of getting carried away with measures merely of a financial nature, we will get mass unemployment in addition to inflation. But even Saburov said words to the effect that a moderately tough credit policy is necessary. At the same time he pronounced some words which at first did not take appropriate shape in economic terms -- "accord with the people." But soon he got away from populist terminology and said that he had in mind cartel agreements among industrialists. Lvov, corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences, had the biggest success with deputies. This was evidently because he put things in a manner comprehensible even to those deputies who have not mastered the subtleties of unadapted economic slang. But most likely it was because he pronounced out loud an intimate secret: The country will be ruined by disregard for the high-tech military-industrial complex and by enthusiasm for the fuel and energy complex. In our country the sectors of the latter produce 30 percent of the profit, and machine building just 1 percent. Lvov called VAT a powerful factor for whipping up inflation. He proposed making rent the basis of a new system of taxation, as it does not have to be taken any further along the whole manufacturing chain but is levied just once, as well as a tax on pollution of the natural environment. So there is diversity among the programs. There is even a certain similarity among them, at least on one question: a moderately tough credit policy. At the recent congress of the Association of Russian Peasant and Private Farms I also heard from peasants that more than half the credits are embezzled by banks and by commercial structures associated with them. Understanding of this question, at least, is growing in society. But there are few prescriptions for treating the crisis of nonpayments, unemployment, and hopelessness for high-technology Russian industry. This is why the document entitled "Recommendations of Parliamentary Hearings on the Economic Situation in the Country" mainly contained bitter words about the present state of the economy. It recommends that the government adopt an anticrisis program within three weeks clearly indicating the substance of the measures, the deadlines for fulfillment, and the expected results. The State Duma is recommended to include draft laws in the plan of priority legislative work according to application. Still to come is a "roundtable" with the participation of members of the Federal Assembly, the government, political parties, and public movements for the purpose of reaching public accord on the main areas of socioeconomic policy. It is sad that no more than 25 deputies were left in the hall by the end of the session. To all appearances, the economy is of far less concern to them than purely political altercations. Deputy Fedorov left the hall as soon as it had heard his own speech. So Mr. Lvov spoke without his most important opponent being present.
