In a 105-minute meeting with al-Shar', Kakizawa urged Syria to join the multilateral talks, Japanese officials said. Al-Shar', however, told Kakizawa that Syria will be pleased to join the talks if peace is achieved. But the talks will be vulnerable if peace is not achieved, al-Shar' was quoted as saying. Al-Shar' hinted at Damascus' position to demand a complete return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The Syrian foreign minister also argued that Mideast problems must be settled in line with UN Security Council resolutions that stipulate the inviolability of territories for all Mideast countries, the officials said. Al-Shar' offered his "personal support" for Japan's bid to obtain a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, saying that he will recommend the Syrian government to show support. Kakizawa flew to Damascus from Amman on Friday.
