Disillusionment follows the honeymoon, which was rather long. However, the crash is all the more violent now: They reveled in the honeymoon for two years, then they promised each other that a divorce was not what they wanted. Well, if big powers love each other, then their situation is different from that of small people. Only a short meeting took place in Vladivostok, but it was special: For the first time, it was dominated by the prosaic bridging of rifts. Quite a lot has to be mended. Spies are moving around. Russia is now pursuing a domestic policy course that is rather different from what Washington wants and Kozyrev, who has been so obsequious so far, even states now that one does not want to be a junior partner in foreign politics. Moscow is looking askance at NATO's Partnership for Peace, it interferes unasked in Bosnia, and it again remembers insolently that the Middle East talks are under its auspices. This catalogue of sins is remarkable. But the following is strange: Although there is trouble in this marriage, the world has not deteriorated. On the contrary, as long as Washington decided alone, little good was achieved. Now this is different -- at least partly. In Russia, where the crash cure was mitigated, the situation is no longer so explosive. There is some hope in the Balkans and the PLO is again prepared for talks. The cooling down of relations is normally a gloomy affair. Sometimes, however, it can be beneficial, even if one lives together with someone without being married.
