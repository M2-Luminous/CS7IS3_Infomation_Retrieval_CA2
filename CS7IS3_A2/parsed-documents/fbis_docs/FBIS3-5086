[Hata] Once someone talks about it, everyone talks about it, and then you have disagreements. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Why have a reshuffle now? [Hata] It is true a reshuffle is being discussed. If things are left as they are at the moment we will be criticized. People will complain that we are in disarray. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You have said your basic position is that a cabinet should not be reshuffled on a regular basis. [Hata] Yes, but the coalition government is still in its early stages, and its composite parties sometimes find themselves in peculiar circumstances. Besides, the parties did not come to power because they won the election, so the situation we have now is somewhat unusual. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Some people have said you might become the new chief cabinet secretary. [Hata] I have not heard of it. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you still believe a party leader should not be chief cabinet secretary? [Hata] This is not an issue because of Masayoshi Takemura, but about the post of chief cabinet secretary. We should not have believed that anyone within the coalition could be chief cabinet secretary. We must think about personnel matters more carefully. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] If there is to be a cabinet reshuffle, do you think we will have a clearer picture of future political reorganization than we have now? [Hata] If you are asking me whether there is common agreement among the parties of political realignment, I must say that is not the case. There are questions to be answered. Should all the parties be dissolved and merged into one, new group? Or should they become two groups? If they are divided into groups, will they function well? I personally prefer the idea of two major forces. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You mean the coalition forces should become one force? [Hata] Yes. They have gone through many difficulties to come this far. It is important to hold on to this framework, even though there will be difficulties in organizing them into a single party. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Does this concept find common ground with Prime Minister Hosokawa's concept of a "single floor group." [Hata] His concept is one of the choices. After all, can we face the election divided? It would be very tough. The next general election will be held under the single-seat district system. We will have difficulties even with our forces combined. Dividing them will have an adverse impact on the election as far as proportional representation is concerned as well. If both groups are interested only in assuming leadership after the election, they will never be able to compromise in an election campaign. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] We understand there is an idea that Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] merges with the Japan New Party first of all. [Hata] That is one choice. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] One of the reasons for discord within the coalition is said to be the discontent about the wish of Shinseito and Komeito [Clean Government Party] to lead the coalition. [Hata] I do not know why people want to talk about that so much. In order to handle so many difficult issues in such a short time, strong leadership was necessary. It was impossible to take time and take it easy. I have never seen any reactions myself, though I can understand the positions of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger Party]. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Don't you think the basic issue of the structure of the future political system is being confused with the strategic issue of how to fight the next general election? [Hata] The issue concerns one party remaining in power too long. The basic point remains that we must find a way to make a change of government possible. I do not see much contradiction between the two issues. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] So the fight in the future will continue to be one between reformists and nonreformists? [Hata] No, that will no longer be possible. Even among those called conservatives, there are people who are changing their thinking. There are now people who are moving toward the creation of a new system, in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] as well as the coalition parties. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, said he could work with Shinseito. [Hata] I do not want to say anything which might cause ripples. Until now it has been debatable whether they were really at the same venue when it came to discussing this issue. But I think we can now openly talk about reform issues, even with the LDP. That is important.
