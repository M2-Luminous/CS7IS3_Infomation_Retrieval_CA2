FR941128-2-00034 FR941128-2-00024 Availability for Exclusive, Partially Exclusive, or Nonexclusive Licensing of a U.S. Patent Concerning a Shaping Apparatus for an Explosive Charge AGENCY: U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, DOD. ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: In accordance with 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i), announcement is made of the availability of U.S. Patent 5,323,681 for licensing. This patent has been assigned to the United States of America as represented by the Secretary of the Army, Washington, D.C. ADDRESSES: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Waterways Experiment Station, ATTN: CEWES&hyph;CT&hyph;C, Vicksburg, MS 39180&hyph;6199. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jack A. Little, (601) 634&hyph;3175. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The invention provides a shaping apparatus for an explosive charge to be used with an Explosively Formed Penetrator (EFP). The shaping apparatus comprises a nonmetal mold in the form of a frustrum of a cone with a latch and hinge attached thereto. The mold is hand packed with a plastic bonded explosive to form an explosive charge. Current EFPs are limited in performance due to poor projectile formation partially caused by nonuniform application of the explosive into the rear portion of the EFP. This invention discloses a design of an explosive shaping apparatus which provides uniform application of the explosive on to the EFP, resulting in improved EFP slug formation and flight characteristics. The EFP standoff range is increased by as much as 400%. Standoff munitions, like the EFP, have wide potential application for military use, including demolition of bridges and bunkers and off-road mine use. Additionally, the EFP could be used by the mining industry to clear rock jams. Under the authority of section 11(a)(2) of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;502) and section 207 of title 35, U.S. Code, the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, Waterways Experiment Station wishes to license the above United States Patent in an exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive manner to any party interested in using the technology described in the above mentioned patent. Any interested party is requested to submit a proposal for an exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive license. The proposals for using this technology will be evaluated using the following criteria: technical capability, size of business, and developmental plan. Kenneth L. Denton, Army Federal Register Liaison Officer. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29136 Filed 11&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3710&hyph;PU&hyph;M
