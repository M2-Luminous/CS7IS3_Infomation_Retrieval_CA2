Ma Xiuhong, a senior official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade & Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said yesterday that the ministry was examining how to modify the preferential treatment to meet the requirements of GATT and its successor the World Trade Organization (WTO). "Apparently, some of the preferential policies go against the GATT rules and should be modified appropriately. However, there will be some phase-out periods, as shown by current GATT members, which could still give preferential treatment to foreign investors," Ma, the deputy director-general of the ministry's foreign investment administration, said. China hopes to join GATT this year before it is replaced by the WTO. Foreign investors who operate in China enjoy lower customs tariffs, more tax incentives, and longer tax holidays than the domestic enterprises, among other forms of preferential treatment. The situation is further complicated by the fact that foreign-funded ventures in the Special Economic Zones and Economic Development Zones enjoy even better treatment. Meanwhile, Ma said that she was confident that China would get the renewal of the most favoured nation [MFN] trading status from the U.S. "I believe that the Sino-U.S. business relationship will continue but there will still be quarrels in the future." The U.S. President, Bill Clinton, must decide before June 3 whether MFN status, which gives China the lowest tariffs for its goods, should be extended. To illustrate growing confidence, Ma announced that China would hold a large-scale trade and investment conference that starts next Monday in Hong Kong, the largest of its kind to be held in the territory. The conference, which lasts four days, is jointly organised by the ministry and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. A team of 160 trade officials from four Chinese ministries and 24 provinces and cities will seek foreign investment on 800 projects involved in industries from transportation to electronics. The Hong Kong conference comes after China staged a similar large-scale conference in the United States last month to drum up support from U.S. businesses for the renewal of MFN. During the conference, senior officials from the nine ministries--including MOFTEC, the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China, and China Securities Regulatory Commission -- will make presentations. China has become the favoured destination for foreign investors. Last year it approved 83,265 foreign-funded projects, with the contract value of foreign investment at U.S.$110.85 billion (about HK$864.64bn) and a total amount of U.S.$25.76 billion actually invested.
