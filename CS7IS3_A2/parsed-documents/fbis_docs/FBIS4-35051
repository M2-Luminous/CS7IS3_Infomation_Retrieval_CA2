Spokespersons for the ruling National Convergence, the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS), and the opposition workers Radical Cause Party expressed their support today at Miraflores Palace for the government's "emergency" measures and requested tighter controls on the banking system. One-third of the country's banks ended up in state hands due to the liquidity crisis at nine institutions. The opposition Social Christian Party, Copei, and the social democratic Democratic Action Party did not express their position on the new official measures of Caldera, who began his second government term on 2 February. The 78-year-old president will address the country on a television network tonight to announce the new measures. As a reflection of the severe situation, the dollar has jumped from 117 bolivares (national currency) in late April to 200 last Thursday. The government has availed itself of a prolonged banking holiday that began on Friday to draft the new measures. According to commentators, the Venezuelan state provided assistance "without sufficient guarantees" to new banks in crisis on the order of $4 billion. This "financial crack" began last January with the intervention at Banco Latino, until that time considered the country's second most important bank. The state intervened at eight other banks two weeks ago.
