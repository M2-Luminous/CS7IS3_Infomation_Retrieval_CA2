He said that most of the 158 major projects planned for this year are ones that have already been started, and 42 of them are expected to be completed and go into operation within the year. As a result, he said, the province's generating capacity will increase by 840,000 kw, coal production will rise by 900,000 tons, and the output of cement is expected to reach 820,000 tons.

The output of refined oil and gas will hit 800,000 tons and 1.03 million cu m daily, respectively. Gong said the province would keep its economic focus on optimizing the investment climate. The construction of five new highways leading to other provinces and cities will start this year, he noted, and the pace of port expansion in Qinghuangdao on Bohai Bay will be accelerated. To ensure sufficient funds for building major projects, the official said, the province will also introduce the stock system. It has been decided to use more overseas funds to upgrade some 14 old industrial enterprises and to develop more than 150 new products this year, Gong said.
