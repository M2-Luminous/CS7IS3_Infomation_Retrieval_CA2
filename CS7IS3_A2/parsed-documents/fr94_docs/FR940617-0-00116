FR940617-0-00116 FR940617-0-00026 (2) The engine is regulated under section 111 or section 202 of the Act, regardless of size; or (3) The engine is located on a trailer or other platform attached to (not an integral part of) a nonroad vehicle or is otherwise not an integral part of a nonroad vehicle and the engine has an output greater than or equal to 175 hp. EPA received numerous comments in response to this NPRM definition. The vast majority of commenters opposed all or part of the proposed definition. The primary reason cited by commenters for their opposition to the proposed definition relates to the use of a horsepower (hp) cut-off point as the means for determining which internal combustion engines are classified as nonroad engines. The commenters asserted that the use of a horsepower cut-off point would allow engines used in mobile applications to be regulated as stationary sources, and would allow stationary engines to be regulated as mobile sources, solely on the basis of engine size. The commenters noted that this would result in identical sources being regulated in a different manner based solely on engine power. Commenters further indicated that the use of a horsepower cut-off point is arbitrary and not reflective of the realities of portable or transportable equipment, which can be and are moved from one area to another and, therefore, should be classified as nonroad regardless of horsepower. According to these commenters, an engine should be classified on the basis of its use as mobile or stationary, rather than on its horsepower. In other words, the determination as to whether an engine is a nonroad engine should depend on whether the engine is either used in equipment that is mobile (that is, self-propelled, portable or transportable), or in equipment that is in fact used in a stationary manner at a particular location for an extended period of time. Industry commenters indicated that to do otherwise could result in costly and unnecessary administrative burdens for manufacturers. According to these commenters, such administrative burdens would result from engines and equipment that would be wrongly subjected to a myriad of different mobile and stationary source regulations in states and local air quality management districts. The commenters also indicated that regulation by a multitude of regulatory agencies could result in restricting the geographic operating range of certain engines and equipment. In addition, commenters indicated that it would be contrary to the intent of the Act. In support of this position, these commenters noted that Congress did not establish a horsepower cut-off point in the Act for distinguishing between nonroad and stationary engines, and did not require that nonroad vehicles be self-propelled to fall within the nonroad definition. The comments from state and local air pollution control agencies also opposed the use of a horsepower cut-off point for determining whether internal combustion engines would be classified as nonroad engines. Local air pollution control agencies noted that they are currently regulating stationary engines under 175 hp and would lose the authority to continue regulating these engines under the proposed nonroad definition. For a detailed discussion of the comments regarding the nonroad definition initially proposed see the Response to Comments in the docket. 2. Revised Definition of Nonroad Engine In response to the comments received regarding the nonroad definition proposed in the May 17, 1993 NPRM, EPA revised the nonroad engine definition. The revised definition was published in the Federal Register on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51595). The comment period was reopened until October 25, 1993, so that interested parties could provide comments on the following revised definition of nonroad engine: (1) Except as discussed in (2) below, a nonroad engine is any internal combustion engine: (i) In or on a piece of equipment that is self-propelled or serves a dual purpose by both propelling itself and performing another function (such as a mobile crane); or (ii) In or on a piece of equipment that is intended to be propelled while performing its function (such as lawn mowers and string trimmers); or (iii) That, by itself or in or on a piece of equipment, is portable or transportable, meaning designed to be and capable of being carried or moved from one location to another. Indicia of transportability include, but are not limited to, wheels, skids, carrying handles, dolly, trailer, platform or mounting. (2) An internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if: (i) The engine is used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition; or (ii) The engine is regulated under section 111 or section 202 of the Act; or
