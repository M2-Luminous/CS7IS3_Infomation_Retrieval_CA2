If the CSU achieves only a relative majority instead of an absolute one and, if on the other hand, a coalition with the Greens and the Free Democratic Party is impossible, the SPD would be ready to form part of the government if only to prevent a coalition between the CSU and the Republikaner. At an SPD regional congress in Roding, Schmid called on the CSU to define its stance as a prerequisite for a coalition. The CSU, he said, must show that it is no longer the former Strauss party that could afford one scandal after another.
