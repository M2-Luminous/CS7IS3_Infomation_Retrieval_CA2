ACTION: Notice of availability of an amendment to a fishery management plan and request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS announces that the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 9 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP) for review by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary). Written comments are requested from the public. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before June 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments must mailed to the Southeast Regional Office, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive, St. Petersburg, FL 33702. Requests for copies of Amendment 9, which includes a regulatory impact review and an environmental assessment, should be sent to the Council, 5401 W. Kennedy Boulevard, suite 331, Tampa, FL 33609&hyph;2486, FAX 813&hyph;225&hyph;7015. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Sadler, 813&hyph;893&hyph;3161. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that a council-prepared amendment to a fishery management plan be submitted to the Secretary for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an amendment, immediately publish a notice that the amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider public comment in determining approvability of the amendment. Amendment 9 proposes to: (1) Authorize the collection of historical red snapper landings data needed to evaluate red snapper effort management alternatives and to identify individuals who may qualify for initial participation in a red snapper effort management regime; and (2) Extend the current moratorium on reef fish permits and the red snapper endorsement system, including its associated trip and landing limits, through December 31, 1995, unless replaced earlier by a red snapper effort management system. Red snapper commercial landings data for 1990, 1991, and 1992 would be collected from vessel owners or from operators of permitted vessels for which the permit was based on the earned income qualification of an operator. Data would also be collected to identify ``historical captains'' in the red snapper fishery and to obtain information on their landings of red snapper and their share arrangements with vessel owners. Proposed regulations to implement Amendment 9 are scheduled for publication within 15 days. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: April 21, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
