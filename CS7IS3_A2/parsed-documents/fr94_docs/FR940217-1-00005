FR940217-1-00005 FR940217-1-00003 This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other de Havilland DHC-6 series airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket for cracks, and replacing any cracked center hinge bracket. The proposed action would be accomplished in accordance with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of de Havilland SB 6/512, dated October 25, 1991. The FAA estimates that 169 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1 workhour per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $9,295. This figure only includes the cost for the initial inspection and does not include replacement costs if a center hinge bracket was found cracked nor does it include repetitive inspection costs. The FAA has no way to determine how many center hinge brackets may be cracked or how many repetitive inspections each owner/operator may incur. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new AD to read as follows: De Havilland: Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;52&hyph;AD. Applicability: Models DHC&hyph;6&hyph;1, DHC&hyph;6&hyph;100, DHC&hyph;6&hyph;200, and DHC&hyph;6&hyph;300 airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category. Compliance: Required within the next 250 hours time-in-service (TIS), unless already accomplished, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 1,200 hours TIS. To prevent separation of the elevator control support from the airplane as a result of a cracked horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Inspect the horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket for cracks in accordance with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of de Havilland Service Bulletin 6/512, dated October 25, 1991, except that where dye penetrant inspections are specified, accomplish visual inspections with a strong light source and 10X magnifying glass. If any cracks are found, prior to further flight, replace the center hinge bracket in accordance with the referenced service bulletin. Note 1: The repetitive inspection requirement of this AD still applies if the center hinge bracket is replaced. (b) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with 14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the initial or repetitive compliance times that provides an equivalent level of safety may be approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, 181 South Franklin Avenue, room 202, Valley Stream, New York 11581. The request shall be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, New York ACO. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the New York ACO. (d) All persons affected by this directive may obtain copies of the document referred to herein upon request to de Havilland, Inc., 123 Garratt Boulevard, Downsview, Ontario M3K 1Y5 Canada; or may examine this document at the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Issued in Kansas City, Missouri, on February 11, 1994. Michael K. Dahl, Acting Manager, Small Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Office.
