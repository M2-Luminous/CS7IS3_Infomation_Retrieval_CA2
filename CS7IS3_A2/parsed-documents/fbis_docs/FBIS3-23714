That was reported by the TANJUG agency, citing members of the U.N. forces' command who asked to remain unnamed. Information about this is contained in a report by an expert commission that has already been sent to U.N. headquarters in New York. The commission established that the shelling that resulted in 68 deaths and left about 200 wounded was carried out from the positions of the Muslim Army's Second Mountain Brigade--from a spot located approximately 1-1.5 km from the boundary line separating it from Serbian forces. Muhamed Secirbegovic, permanent representative to the United Nations of the Muslim government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, acknowledged the fact of the receipt of the commission's report at U.N. headquarters. In the opinion of Yugoslav military experts, such a powerful impact could not have resulted from the explosion of a single mortar shell, even a large-caliber one. What is most likely, they believe, is that a powerful explosive device packed with shrapnel was activated in the market simultaneously with the mortar explosion. They report that a powerful radial-action antipersonnel fragmentation mine capable of striking everything within a radius of 60 to 80 meters was developed at a military plant in Bugojno that is in the hands of the Muslims. The POLITIKA EKSPRESS newspaper has also reported the name of the person who organized the clandestine action--a certain Mirza Khadzijamakovic, who back before the war underwent training as an explosives expert in the former Yugoslavia's Ministry of Internal Affairs. Obviously, a provocation on such a scale could not have been carried out without the knowledge of the highest-ranking Sarajevo leaders. Of course, the fact of the Muslim authorities' blame for the tragedy in the Sarajevo market does not mean that the siege of Sarajevo should not be lifted. However, the persistence with which NATO is insisting on bombing precisely the Serbian positions raises questions concerning that organization's objectivity with regard to a Yugoslav settlement. In the past, one-sided threats against the Serbs under the pretext that Bosnia "is a victim of aggression" have resulted only in inflaming the conflict. Even British Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind was forced to admit in a recent interview on London television that "the United Nations' presence has unquestionably prolonged the war." Thus, if the North Atlantic alliance, in seeking a more active role in Bosnia, really wants a prompt end to the civil war, Brussels should take the United Nations' mistakes into account. If an ultimatum is to be presented, it should be presented to all three warring sides, and not to the Serbs alone. Yet Washington's proposal to demand that the Bosnian Serbs withdraw their artillery and tanks from Sarajevo under the threat of air strikes suffers from one-sidedness. Such an approach will probably be interpreted by the other side in the conflict as covert support.
