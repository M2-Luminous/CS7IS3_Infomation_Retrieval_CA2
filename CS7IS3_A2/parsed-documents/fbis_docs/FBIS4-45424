FBIS4-45424 "jptdd026__l94010" JPRS-TDD-94-026-L JPRS Narcotics 7 June 1994 LATIN AMERICA BRAZIL Names of Traffickers Arrested in Major Cocaine Bust Released Names of Traffickers Arrested in Major Cocaine Bust Released PY0706162394 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 0025 GMT 7 Jun 94 PY0706162394 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO Portuguese BFN [Text] Guarai, Tocantins, 6 Jun (AE) -- Federal Police have captured 10 of the 11 drug traffickers involved in the operation to transport 7.3 metric tons of cocaine to the United States. This has been the largest seizure of drugs worldwide so far this year and the largest in Brazilian history. For security reasons, the 10 prisoners will be transferred to Brasilia on 7 June, in accordance with decision by Silvane Parfieniuk, acting judge of Guarai County Court. The prisoners were arrested after an intense shootout during which Colombian drug trafficker Humberto Vasquez was wounded. He has been hospitalized in Araguaina, Tocantins State. Federal Police had been preparing the operation for a month, and were assisted by investigators from Sao Paulo, Parana, and Amazonas States. Police were able to arrest the drug traffickers and seize the 7.3 metric tons of cocaine through information from an informer. Federal Police Inspector Sergio Sakon said: "We do not have crystal balls." The cocaine was to be taken to Santos Port, Sao Paulo State, and then shipped to the United States. The head of the gang--Lebanese-born Nasrat Mohamad Jamil Rossauz, who has Brazilian citizenship--is married and lives in Foz de Iguacu, where he has an electronic appliance store. Also arrested were Colombians Marcelo Rodrigues, Mario Alberto Graca, and Gilberto Wigando Scholze, as well as Brazilians Herbert Gouveia Barcelos, Jose David Hadad, Jill Sandro Mimikoski, and Carlos Henrique Barcelos. Thirty Federal Police agents are chasing Colombian Vicentico [Vicente Wilson Rivera-Ramos], the gang's big boss. He is the son of drug trafficker Vicente Gonzalez Rivera, who is being sought by police in several countries, including Brazil. According to Federal Police, Vicentico still is at large and must be hiding somewhere in Tocantins State. Operation The 7.3 metric tons of the drug were hidden in two trucks rented by the gang and concealed in the middle of a tobacco leaf cargo. The gang created an export company to take the tobacco to the United States. Federal Police, however, did not reveal the company's name. Inspector Sergio Sakon believes that the dismantling of this gang in Brazil will result in several arrests in the United States, Colombia, and other countries involved in the drug trafficking route. A consortium of 14 processing laboratories was established to process the drug cargo. Sakon still does not know whether the cocaine came from the Cali or Medellin cartel. The drug was packed in one-kilogram bricks and had tags with the name of famous brands such as Platino, UFA, Polar, Zorro, Coca-Colo, and Professional. According to estimates by policemen who participated in the operation, after being mixed with other products the cargo would yield 55 metric tons of cocaine, i.e., 55 million one-gram cocaine doses. On the market, the drug would be sold for a total of $130 million. Nasrat, however, did not want to comment on how much he would be paid to transport the drug. "I will only testify before the courts," he said. The 7.3 metric tons of cocaine will be transferred to Brasilia on 7 June to be burned. Sakon asserted that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration did not participate in any stage of the operation. "The operation's success is due entirely to the Brazilian Federal Police," he said. In the operation, Federal Police also seized AR-14 rifles, machine guns, and grenades, in addition to a large quantity of ammunition. The police questioning will take place in Brasilia. The drug traffickers have been arrested under Law No. 8072/90, the hideous crimes law. These crimes have no bail. After being tried, each person can be sentenced to a maximum of 30 years in jail. Except for Vicentico, no other member of this gang had been arrested previously by Brazilian police.
