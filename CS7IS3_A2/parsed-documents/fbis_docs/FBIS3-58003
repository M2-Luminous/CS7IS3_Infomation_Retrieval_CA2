There is concern that this requirement will delay the GSM launch whilst one party or another makes the undertaking to pay the cost for the decoder system, a cost estimated at around 100 million Dutch guilders. PTT Telecom was informed earlier this year by the ministry that it wanted to have the ability of intercept, decode, and monitor calls on the GSM network, yet PTT Telecom said it was not willing to pay for the developing of applications to decode calls. The Dutch Government has the right to eavesdrop as set out in draft legislation. This legislation will end PTT Telecom's monopoly oN mobile communications services in the Netherlands and will prepare the ground for a second GSM network operator. The proposed legislation obliges operators of GSM networks to co-operate with any "special order to monitor data," though it does not specify who will be responsible for paying for the necessary decoding systems. The financing question will be clarified by a separate piece of legislation currently being drafted. Eavesdropping technology on GSM networks has not yet been developed, and PTT Telecom says it is not prepared to finance its research. The PTT does provide the Ministry of Justice with the facilities for monitoring calls on the PSTN [public switched-telephone network] and on the NMT [Nordic Mobile Telephone network]-based ATF [car telephone network] analogue cellular networks. Additionally, the Dutch Government intends to issue a competitive tender for another GSM licence before the end of the year. Unlike the recent trend for "higher bidder" GSM licence auctions, the second Dutch GSM licence is expected to be awarded to the "best application." PTT Telecom is still a state-owned monopoly, and the government wants to fatten up the firm for a financial slaughter before privatisation. Major investment in GSM may heavily deplete finances and the issue of security and concern for international drug baron activity, though important, may all be a diversionary tactic for ulterior motives.
