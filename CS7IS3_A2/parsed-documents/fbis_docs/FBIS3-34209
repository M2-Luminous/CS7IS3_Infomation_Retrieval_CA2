The authorities have summoned Israeli Ambassador in Cairo David Sultan and handed him an official letter of protest, demanding an apology by his government. Rabin's remarks came in a meeting with Israeli thinkers and writers the day before yesterday. Rabin said he is not sure Egypt could remain committed to the peace treaty should the "terrorist" groups take power. The Egyptian Government received detailed reports on Rabin's remarks from the Egyptian Embassy in Tel Aviv. The Egyptian Labor Federation issued a statement in Cairo the day before yesterday calling on its members not to meet an Israeli Histadrut delegation and confirming the continuation of the Egyptian federation's boycott of its Israeli counterpart.
