FBIS4-51757 "dreas085_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 North Korea Alleges `Unreasonable Demands' Alleges `Unreasonable Demands' SK0305153394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1527 GMT 3 May 94 SK0305153394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["If IAEA Secretariat Refuses To Accept Our Reasonable Proposal, We Will Have No Other Alternative But To Replace Fuel Rod, Spokesman of DPRK Foreign Ministry" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- If the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] Secretariat carries the situation into the extremities despite our utmost magnanimity and good will, we will resolutely counter it, warned a spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK in his answer to a question put by KCNA today concerning the replacement of fuel rod at the 5-megawatt experimental nuclear power station. He told KCNA the DPRK did not delay the issue of entry visas to five inspectors selected by the IAEA side so that they may be present at the place of the replacement of fuel rod and verify the non-diversion of nuclear material to non-peaceful purposes. This notwithstanding, the IAEA Secretariat is raising an unreasonable demand for selecting, preserving and measuring some fuel at the time of the replacement of fuel rod, the spokesman said, and added: This can never be allowed because it means routine and ad hoc inspections ignoring the DPRK's unique status following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]. It is crystal clear that, if we allow the selective measurement of the fuel rod, the agency Secretariat will find a new pretext for a pressure on the DPRK. If the agency Secretariat refuses to accept our reasonable proposal and persists in its unreasonable demand, we will have no other alternative but to replace the fuel rod according to our operation plan. Whether the IAEA inspectors are present or not, the spent fuel rod counter, the thermo-luminescence detector and monitoring apparatuses installed by the IAEA at the experimental nuclear power station are operating continuously, and this means that our replacement of fuel rod is carried out strictly under the surveillance of the IAEA. We can no longer allow the IAEA Secretariat to use our "nuclear problem" as a political expedient.
