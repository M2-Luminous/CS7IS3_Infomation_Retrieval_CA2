Analysts say the talks may face some difficulties, because rumors are going around that UNITA intends to derail the negotiation process. Joao Ligio, our correspondent in the Zambian capital, is on the telephone to give us more details: [Begin Ligio recording] It is three days now since Mulungushi Conference Hall has seen any activity in connection with the Angolan peace process. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye closed the hall's doors and left for Luanda on yet another charity mission. However, his absence has not meant that the government and UNITA teams have been idle. Instead, they have been working at finding consensus concerning the operation of the future National Police. To keep the talks going, before leaving, the UN special representative handed over to the negotiators the theoretical formulas that are contained in a document regarded as the final draft in a bid to reduce the gap between the two sides. Without meetings and without Blondin Beye constantly summoning them, the two sides now have more time to learn about the general situation (?in Angola), where the specter of war continues to loom large. Within this context, reports have been reaching Lusaka about certain developments on the battlefield. The effect of those reports has been to undermine the optimism that had marked these talks at one stage. It is known that the UNITA leader has called an emergency meeting of the UNITA Political Commission. That meeting began on 21 January and it is not being attended by any of the officials in the team to the Lusaka peace talks. (?He) has also issued a communique in which Cubans and Russians are accused of holding talks with the Angolan Government concerning a return of Cuban military forces to Angola. That communique adds that UNITA will not make any concessions in connection with the Riot Police issue. Such developments are in clear contrast with what a reliable source in the Black Cockerel movement has said: He asked journalists here in Lusaka not to mix the country's internal developments with developments at the talks. According to that source, the main obstacles concerning the specific principles that will govern the future National Police have been overcome and the next 24 working hours could see an end to the existing deadlock over the percentages of men from both sides that will join the Riot Police. Should this be true, it will signal the end of discussions relating to point one in the second round of the Lusaka peace talks. The UNITA communique came as no surprise to the Angolan Government team, whose officials believe that UNITA constantly resorts to such ploys when discussions concerning a point on the agenda are drawing to a close, particularly if the mediator is absent. When asked whether the talks might break down as a result of these new developments, officials on both sides said they did not believe that would happen. Nevertheless, UN Special Representative Blondin Beye will have to work very hard to restore optimism to the talks, when he comes back. [end recording]
