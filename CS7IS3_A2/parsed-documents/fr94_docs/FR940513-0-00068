FR940513-0-00068 FR940513-0-00018 F. Unlikely Losses and Deductions The requirement that a loss or expenditure not be reasonably foreseeable to qualify as unlikely has been revised in response to concerns that were voiced. To qualify as ``unlikely'' under the final regulations, a loss or deduction must have a low likelihood of occurring, taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances. In addition, the final regulations clarify that the types of events described in the regulations are not per se unlikely. They merely illustrate possible situations giving rise to allocations to which the exception for unlikely losses and deductions applies (if they have a low likelihood of occurring taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances). In response to a comment, the discovery of environmental conditions that require remediation has been added to the illustrative list of potential relevant events. Contrary to a commentator's request, the final regulations do not sanction pre-funding of a loss or deduction. Generally, pre-funding is incompatible with a conclusion that a loss or deduction is unlikely. G. Changes in Partnership Allocations The final regulations retain the rule that changes in partnership allocations resulting from transfers or shifts in partnership interests will be closely scrutinized, but generally will be relevant only on a prospective basis. However, the final regulations provide taxpayers with more specific guidance. The scope of the scrutiny relates to the determination of whether the transfers or shifts stem from a prior agreement, understanding, or plan, or could otherwise be expected given the structure of the transaction (e.g., a situation where the structure and economics is such that it could well be anticipated that a sale of an interest would occur at some particular phase of the partnership's (or transaction's) life). This approach bears some similarity to the approach of ยง1.704&hyph;1(b)(4)(vi) (relating to the scrutiny given to amendments to partnership agreements). H. De Minimis Exceptions In response to comments, changes were also made to the two de minimis rules. One commentator asked for clarification on the exception for de minimis interests. In response, the rule has been slightly clarified and an example has been added to illustrate the rule's application. The nature of the comments received with respect to the de minimis allocation exception indicated that the exception was viewed differently than had been intended. The intent of this exception was to provide relief for what would otherwise be minor inadvertent violations of the fractions rule. One example would be a plumber's bill that is paid directly by a taxable partner, or that is paid by the partnership but is overlooked until after the partnership's allocations have been computed and then is allocated entirely to the taxable partner. It was not intended that this provision be used routinely by partnerships to allocate some of the partnership's losses and deductions. Consistent with the intent underlying this provision, the final regulations limit the total amount (rather than the amount allocated to the QO partner) to which the exception applies to the lesser of $50,000 and one percent of the partnership's total losses and deductions. I. Anti-Abuse Rule At least one commentator suggested that the anti-abuse rule in the proposed regulations was vague. To address this concern, the final regulations provide a more complete statement of the purpose of the fractions rule, which largely tracks the wording of the Conference Committee Report accompanying the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1987. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 495, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 957 (1987). J. Tiered Partnerships The rules regarding tiered partnerships were well received and remain largely the same as in the proposed regulations. However, some changes were made. First, the final regulations clarify that the relevant partnerships (as opposed to individual QOs) must demonstrate that the relevant chains satisfy the requirements of the regulations under any reasonable method. Also, although the same three basic examples contained in the proposed regulations continue to illustrate the application of this rule, a number of changes were made to those examples. Most of the changes to the examples are stylistic or clarifying. One clarification is that tiered partnerships may not simply be used to achieve results that could not be achieved in the absence of a tiered-partnership structure. For example, the facts in the second tiered-partnership example (relating to the entity-by-entity approach) now state that each of the upper-tier partnerships has been established for the purpose of investing in numerous real estate properties independently of the other upper-tier partnership and its partners. Thus, the tiered-partnership rules may not be used simply to apply the fractions rule on a QO-by-QO basis instead of the regulation's generally applicable overall partnership basis. The facts in the second example also now contain a statement that neither of the upper-tier partnerships have outstanding debt. The reason for that statement is that in some cases, debt might be used to attempt to achieve allocations that would not satisfy the fractions rule if, for example, the lower-tier partnership had incurred the debt. The inclusion of this added fact should not be viewed as flatly precluding the existence of debt at any level other than the lower-tier partnership. The absence of debt was added as a fact to obviate the need to complicate the example by addressing the precise effect of debt, in what likely would have been a fact pattern that would have been of limited value in analyzing other debt arrangements. Accordingly, the existence of debt at a level other than the lower-tier partnership should be viewed as something to be taken into consideration in determining whether a partnership can demonstrate that the requirements of the regulations have been satisfied. It should also be noted that the existence of debt at the partner level might also be relevant in situations where tiered partnerships are not used.
