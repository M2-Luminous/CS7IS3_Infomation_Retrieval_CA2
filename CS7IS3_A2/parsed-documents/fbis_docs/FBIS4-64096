Following their talks, Mr. Enache made the following brief statement: [Begin Enache recording] In my assessment, the talks I held with President Mircea Snegur were substantial and positive. We approached, in a constructive spirit, the relations, on the whole, between Romania and the Republic of Moldova. Basically, we expressed our readiness, and even more, I would say the necessity to genuinely revive the ties between our states, to amplify our contacts and the furthering, on all planes, of our sincere opinions regarding our bilateral ties, as well as the finalization of a number of concrete economic actions of mutual interest. We also emphasized the need to maintain a continuous dialogue between the state power institutions of the two countries. Concretely speaking, a new conference is to take place soon in Galati regarding the traffic of passengers over the border crossing points on the Prut River, intended to better satisfy the needs of our economic companies and our citizens. Similarly, there is a possibility to organize, under good circumstances, a conference of the inter-ministerial committees in Chisinau, with the support of the leadership of the Republic of Moldova. Similarly, significant political contacts are being anticipated at top level, at government level, besides other working meetings. During our talks President Mircea Snegur expressed the sincere wish of the leadership of the Republic of Moldova to further relations with Romania, thus contradicting certain opinions according to which a certain coolness could be perceived lately in the relations between our countries. Personally, I remain optimistic with respect to the rapprochement and the cooperation between our two states, as it is quite obvious that the things that unite us are stronger than certain more or less aleatoric circumstances.
