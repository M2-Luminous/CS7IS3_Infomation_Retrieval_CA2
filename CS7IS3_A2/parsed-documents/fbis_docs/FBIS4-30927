Crvenkovski emphasized that Berlusconi had promised that at the next EU meeting on Corfu, he would express the Italian stance in relation to the Greek embargo, in front of the Greek government representatives. The Macedonian Prime Minister expressed satisfaction with what Macedonia displayed on a cultural plan within the framework of the manifestation "Macedonia in the Honor of St. Cyril," but also on a political plan, after the realized contacts with the high-ranking officials of Italy and Vatican. Branko Crvenkovski underlined that a particular emphasis in the talks was placed on Italy's economic participation in Macedonian and the East-West project, which, together with its sub-projects, such as the gas line and the traffic route, offers possibilities for a joint appearance of construction workers from both countries on the Albanian market.
