Palestinian sources said Monday the policeman had been killed by unidentified gunmen as he patrolled close to Netzarim. "From the inquiry we carried out, it appears that Khalil Abu-Hamzah, 23, was killed immediately by a bullet fired accidentally by one of his colleagues," the police chief said. On Tuesday the fundamentalist Islamic Jihad accused Israeli settlers of having killed the officer. It is the first accidental shooting of a police officer by his colleagues since Israeli troops redeployed in the Gaza Strip to hand over to the Palestinian police, following the Israeli-PLO self-rule accord signed on May 4. Two police officers died in a car accident shortly after they arrived on the Gaza Strip on May 18.
