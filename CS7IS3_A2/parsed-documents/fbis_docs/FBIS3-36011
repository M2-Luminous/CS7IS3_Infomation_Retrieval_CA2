The telephone conversation was described by Meshkov as "well-wishing and calm". The meeting will be held on February 4 in the Ukrainian capital where Meshkov will go right after his inauguration in Simferopol. In the words of Meshkov, "there are no reasons for any complications. The image of pro-Russian politician Ukrainian nationalists are trying to make has nothing to do with me. But this has provoked certain watchfulness of the Kiev authorities". Meshkov noted the need for a stable Russian-Ukrainian union, referring to historical experience of both states. "The time of Mazepa -- striving for isolation -- has gone, the epoch of Bogdan Khmelnitsky returns," the Crimean president told ITAR-TASS.
