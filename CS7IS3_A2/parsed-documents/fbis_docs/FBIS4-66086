The agreement aims to provide a solid global framework for the development of deeper relations between the two parties. In October 1992 the EC Council of Ministers adopted negotiating directives for the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with countries of the former Soviet Union. In the course of 1993 and 1994, two rounds of negotiations with the Republic of Kazakhstan were held on the basis of these negotiating directives. The negotiations have now been concluded. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will replace the Trade and Cooperation Agreement of 1989 between the EC and the Soviet Union as far as the Republic of Kazakhstan is concerned. The agreement covers in particular the following areas: - political dialogue; - trade in goods; - provisions affecting business and investment, including labour conditions and establishment and operation of companies; - cross-border supply of services; - payments and capital; - intellectual, industrial and commercial property protection; - economic cooperation in many areas. The general principles of the agreement state democratic values, respect for human rights and market economy principles as essential elements of the partnership established by the agreement. The general principles also state that the parties consider it essential for the future prosperity and stability in the region of the former Soviet Union that regional cooperation should be continued and strengthened. The agreement foresees an intensive political dialogue, including the possibility of meetings at the highest political level. Trade in goods will take place on the basis of most-favoured-nation treatment with a general rule curbing quantitative restrictions in line with the Community's new commercial defence policy. Specific agreements will be negotiated in the case of coal and steel products and as regards trade in nuclear materials. An agreement on trade in textile products is already in force. In terms of labour conditions the agreement calls on the parties to prevent discrimination between legally employed workers. As far as conditions for the establishment and operation of companies are concerned, the agreement establishes a liberal regime with Kazakhstan offering full national treatment for establishment and operation of community companies. The agreement stipulates with limited exceptions a free flow of capital payments in particular those related to trade in goods and direct investments. The agreement provides a timetable for the rapid development of intellectual, industrial and commercial property protection in Kazakhstan equal to the level of protection in the EU. In the field of economic cooperation the agreement lists agreed principles and areas of future possible cooperation in the following fields: Industrial cooperation, investment promotion and protection, public procurement, standards and conformity assessments, mining and raw materials, science and technology, education and training, agriculture and agro-industry, energy, the civil nuclear sector (including cooperation on the effect of the Chernobyl disaster), environment, transport, space, telecommunications, financial services, money laundering, monetary policy, regional development, social cooperation, tourism, small and medium sized enterprises, information and communication, consumer protection, customs, statistical cooperation, economics and drugs. Cooperation in these fields may, as appropriate, be supported by technical assistance from the European Union through the TACIS [Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States] programme, which finances moves to economic reform in the former USSR republics. The agreement finally establishes an institutional framework for future cooperation, including a cooperation council that will meet at ministerial level once a year, as well as a parliamentary cooperation committee.
