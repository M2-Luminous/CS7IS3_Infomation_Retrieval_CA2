BILD heard: Before his death, brutally slain Silvian Becker was in a coma for four weeks. His wife was trampled to death. The German Embassy only heard of the deed 14 days later. The latest speculation in Bonn is that the Beckers were slain by Libyan agents because they had been on the trail of 25 Germans who produce poison gas for al-Qadhdhafi.
