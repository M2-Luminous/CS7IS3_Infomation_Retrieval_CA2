He made the statement on Thursday in an interview with INTERFAX. According to Panov, Russia's stand concerning the possibility of international sanctions is unchanged: Moscow stands for political methods to be used first. If the talks between the United States and North Korea have deadlocked, let's come to an international multilateral consultations. If it fails, there first should be a warning on the possible introduction of sanctions, and only after that sanctions, said Panov. He said that during the telephone talk on Wednesday between Presidents of Russia and South Korea, Boris Yeltsin confirmed the position, which was told to Kim Yong-sam during his recent visit to Moscow. Panov believes the introduction of sanctions now that North Korea began to show a more favorable attitude to the Russian proposal on the convocation of an international conference, would be illogical. The diplomat said the interests for the conference was growing since this is a realistic way out of the situation. Now practically no one stands against the conference. The differences are only in time limits, he said. Some people believe the conference should be held after sanctions are introduced against Pyongyang. But this is a strange approach. What conference could we talk about after the sanctions are introduced? Panov believes that the initial stage of the conference could be held swiftly. First we should reach a consent in principle. If so, it would be possible to come to agreement on what conditions the conference will assemble. North Korea and the United States, for example, could assume some commitments after which experts would start working over the conference program and procedure items, he said. He said that the question on the conference venue had been discussed. We believe the conference could gather in Geneva and later pass in turns in Pyongyang and Seoul, he said. According to Panov, Russia stands for the convocation of a conference not because it is against the talks between the United States and North Korea. We stand for the use of all means. It is possible to use the Moscow-Pyongyang talks if it is still possible, if it will really be fruitful. Now the channel is blocked, said the diplomat. According to him, Beijing believes otherwise and continues staking on further talks between North Korea and the United States. We do not rule out the importance of the channel. We believe it works no longer, said Panov. He said that no one confirms yet that North Korea has a nuclear bomb. The International Atomic Energy Agency has not yet concluded that North Korea created nuclear weapons. According to the statement by the Agency it cannot guarantee that North Korea did not take steps to develop Plutonium. This is the essence of the problem, said Panov. He said of principle for Russia is the preservation of the nuclear weapons non-proliferation. It is outside our interests that in the Far East, near Russian borders, there appeared another nuclear power, said the diplomat. To the question about the treaty between North Korea and the former Soviet Union, of which Russia is the successor, Panov said that now the treaty does not exist in full measure. The treaty must change depending on the situation and circumstances. Now we unilaterally interpret the first article of the treaty. Now Moscow must not help North Korea under any circumstances, he said. The diplomat answered favorably to the question on the possible unification of the two Koreas. This has always been a single state and a single people. The unification is possible, of course. It is quite another matter how things will pass and how much time this will take. Much time, I believe, said Panov.
