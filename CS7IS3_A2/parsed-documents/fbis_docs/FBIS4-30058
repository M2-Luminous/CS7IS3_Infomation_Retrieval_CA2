The LDP decided to submit the motion during its Executive Council meeting Wednesday, saying the government has not made sufficient efforts to clarify former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's suspected personal financial irregularities. If the lower house approves the motion, Hata must either resign en masse with his cabinet or dissolve the house for a snap general election. But it is not clear whether the LDP will have the support from the second largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) needed to muster a majority of votes to pass the motion. The SDP, which split from the ruling alliance in April, indicated earlier it may join the LDP in pushing the motion but displayed willingness Wednesday to mend frayed ties with the coalition. Hata and SDP head Tomiichi Murayama were scheduled to meet later Thursday to discuss a possible realliance. The LDP and the ruling coalition are courting the SDP since both sides are short of a majority in the Diet. The LDP urged the SDP earlier Thursday to hold a meeting of the two parties' leaders to discuss a plan to set up a new government. The current Diet session ends next Wednesday.
