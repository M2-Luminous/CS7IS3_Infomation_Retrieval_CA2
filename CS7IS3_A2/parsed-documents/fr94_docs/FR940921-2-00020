In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Commission's Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed a non-capacity related amendment of exemption for the McMillan Hydroelectric Project, No. 6952&hyph;005. The McMillan Hydroelectric Project is located on the North Fork of Little Cow Creek in Shasta County, California. The application is to revise the project description to reflect several changes between the authorized and as-built project features. An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared for the application. The EA finds that approving the application would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
