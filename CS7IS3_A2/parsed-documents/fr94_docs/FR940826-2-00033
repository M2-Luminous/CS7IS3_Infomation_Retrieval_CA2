FR940826-2-00033 FR940826-2-00025 Office of Energy Research Notice of Availability of Management Plan for the Conduct of Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial Application of Energy Technologies AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of availability and request for comment. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy is today giving notice that the Management Plan for the Conduct of Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial Application of Energy Technologies (the Plan) required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the Act) is available for public comment. As required by the Act, the Plan will be made available for public comment for a 90 day period. Written comments provided during this period will be considered in the formulation and issuance of the final Plan. DATES: Parties wishing to comment on the Plan should do so in writing to the address given below by November 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments are to be submitted to: Dr. Ehsan Khan, Office of Energy Research, U.S. Department of Energy, Room Number 3H&hyph;049, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20585. A copy of the Plan will be placed on display at the Department of Energy Reading Room, Room Number 1E&hyph;190, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585. The Reading Room is open from 9:00 a.m to 4:00 p.m Monday through Friday, except for federal holidays. A copy of the Plan may also be obtained from Darlene Roberts at 202&hyph;586&hyph;7170. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Ehsan Khan (202) 586&hyph;4785, fax (202) 586&hyph;7719. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy in compliance with the provisions of Section 2304 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is developing a Management Plan for the Conduct of Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial Application of Energy Technologies. The Plan is being developed in consultation with the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board that serves as the Energy Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial Application Advisory Board, as called for in the Act. The Plan provides an inventory and status report of technologies to enhance energy supply and to improve the efficiency of energy end uses. The inventory and status report includes fossil, renewable, nuclear, and energy conservation technologies which have not yet achieved the status of fully reliable and cost-competitive commercial availability, but which the Secretary projects may become available with additional research, development, and demonstration. The inventory and status report provides, for each technology_ (1) An assessment of its_ (A) Degree of technological maturity, (B) principal research, development, and demonstration issues, including_ (i) the barriers posed by capital, operating, and maintenance costs; (ii) technical performance; and (iii) potential environmental impact; (2) the projected time frame for commercial availability, specifying at a minimum whether the technology will be commercially available in the near-term, mid-term, or long-term, whether there are too many uncertainties to project availability, or whether it is unlikely that the technology will ever be commercial; and (3) a projection of the future cost-competitiveness of the technology in comparison with alternative technologies to provide the same energy service. Dated: August 22, 1994. Dr. Martha A. Krebs, Director, Office of Energy Research, U.S. Department of Energy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21129 Filed 8&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
