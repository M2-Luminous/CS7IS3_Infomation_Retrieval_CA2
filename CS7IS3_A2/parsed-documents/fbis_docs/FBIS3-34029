Dr. al-Majali was out of the country when his Health Minister Dr. 'Abd al-Rahim Malhas went on record to expose his own ministry and food and medicine wholesalers, and to point a finger at Dr. al-Majali himself two weeks ago. Dubbed as the "Malhasgate scandal," it created national hysteria, and deputies demanded a special session to hear the Government's reply to accusations made by a cabinet minister. On Wednesday, Dr. Malhas marched into the House carrying an 800-page file said to contain names and figures documenting serious violations concerning food and drug imports. The file also implicates former officials, who had allowed the import and distribution of certain food products when Government laboratories had indicated that they were not fit for human consumption. Dr. Malhas, who delivered the Government's reply, defended his press statements and said that Jordanians are victims of greedy food and medicine merchants. In his 70-minute speech, Dr. Malhas attacked the "whales" who imported food not fit for human consumption, and medicines that do not meet international standards. He said he had documents that prove some medicine importers are making over 300 percent in profits, and some as high as a 1000 percent profit on certain medicine shipments. He added that these companies had threatened to stop medicine imports if the Government did not agree to price increases. He went on to say that certain medicines that are available in Jordan do not meet international standards, while others do not even meet the standards of the countries where they are manufactured. Dr. Malhas added that most of the imported meat, foodstuff and cheese is transported into Jordan in unrefrigerated trucks in temperatures reaching 35 degrees, and that the ministry had destroyed some of these because it was not fit for human consumption. After Dr. Malhas' speech, deputies asked for copies of his file, while the Speaker of the Lower House asked the deputies not to pass the documents to the press so as not to interfere with the legal measures that are expected to be taken against those implicated. The file is kept under police guard and its distribution is restricted to deputies until the House decides what to do with the case. The House will start to deliberate on it in the next session on Saturday. In an attempt to take Dr. al-Majali off the hook, Dr. Malhas told the deputies that the ministry of health, with the support of the Prime Minister, took immediate measures to enforce health regulations and to fight what Dr. Malhas described as international food gangsters that sell bad foodstuff. Dr. Malhas said there were gaps in regulations that allow medicine importers to import medicine into Jordan without getting approval from the ministry. He said the US Congress had passed legislation permitting US drug companies to export products which are otherwise banned in the United States. He added that a number of drugs available in the local market are not registered with the ministry and called for establishing an authority to monitor foodstuffs and medical products. Dr. Malhas again warned of the greed of the so-called "whales", a few wholesalers who make their fortune by importing expired foodstuff into the country. Dr. Malhas also mentioned cases where expiry dates have been changed and health certificates forged so that food could be allowed into the country. He said his file documents names and incidents of many of these cases. He said the ministry had shut down over 16,000 factories, shops, bakeries and restaurants for health violations. Al-Ramtha deputy 'Abd-al-Karim al-Doughmi supported Dr. Malhas's position, while Irbid deputy 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Rawabidah accused him of negligence. The Islamists did not take a position, but sources said they might oppose the minister after they received counter information from the president of the Pharmacists Association and IAF member Husam Musmar and a number of wholesalers who are also IAF members. The fact that Dr. Malhas has provided evidence documenting serious health violations will undoubtedly shift attention from the Government to the so-called corruption cases. Meanwhile, innocent traders and local pharmaceutical companies continue to suffer as a result of Dr. Malhas' initial statements. So far, Sudan and Tunis have suspended drug shipments until more information on the status of Jordan-made food and drugs become available. Dr. Malhas last last week said that Jordanian medicines are of high quality and that they were not included in his list of violators.
