The draft protocol is to be submitted to the 17th session of the Gatt Working Party on China in Geneva. The meeting could be a watershed in the prolonged negotiating process if it can clinch a comprehensive draft protocol on China's rights and obligations in the world trade body. Gatt Director General Peter Sutherland has said the draft protocol must be available by June if China wants to rejoin Gatt and become a founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) before January 1, 1995. "We're pleased that at long last we will have a comprehensive document to work on, said Long Yongtu, Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec). "This by itself is a breakthrough in the negotiations," he said. China applied to rejoin Gatt in 1986, when the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks were launched. But a comprehensive protocol has failed to be shaped so far, due to argument over what steps China would need to take after re-entry. Some Gatt members have demanded that China fulfill all Gatt rules before rejoining the world free trade body. But Peter Sutherland described the request as unrealistic and unreasonable. A positive signal came recently when the United States submitted its version of a draft protocol to Gatt following one by the European Union earlier this year. The move is described by Long as helping to clear the way for preparing a comprehensive text to be discussed in Geneva. The U.S. has taken note of China's demand for a transitional period during which it could fully meet Gatt requirements. Long said China will try to be as flexible as possible in the coming rounds of negotiations. "We will accept demands (from other Gatt members) only if they comply with the gradual process of China's economic reforms and its current economic level," he said. During a round of Sino-U.S. negotiations in Washington earlier this month, the U.S. made many requests which included expanding Chinese market access concerning trade in services and allowing more companies to deal in foreign trade in China. Long said China will consider them and accept those that are reasonable. He insisted re-entry to Gatt is only part of China's economic reform plan. And he said China wants nothing that would risk economic development and social stability He said if Western nations come down too hard on China, progress towards a market economy will be disrupted. Long praised Dorothy Dwoskin, the U.S. assistant trade representative, and her team for their hard work in Washington earlier this month to narrow the differences between China and the U.S. over the terms for China's re-entry. He said the bilateral talks were positive and constructive, as they were free from political interference after U.S. President Bill Clinton decided on May 26 to renew China's most-favoured-nation status and delink it with human rights. But Long said future difficulties may arise in the negotiations. "So long as we have good will and a realistic approach, we can overcome many more difficulties," he emphasized.
