Much indicates that the effects of this measure have been positive so far. The companies group mine clusters by the criterion of contiguity of mining land according to land registers. (In accordance with that criterion, the so-far single-mine autonomous Bogdanka joint-stock company has been established.) A stronger export standing: It was possible, more so than in the preceding years, to mesh the structural and seasonal slump in domestic sales of coal with a commensurate increase in export shipments, as illustrated by the tabulation below of sales (in millions of metric tons) in the years 1989, 1992, and 1993. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1Coal Sales in Millions of Metric Tons | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1989 |1992 |1993 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |To power plants |57.2 |39.0 |37.2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |To coking plants |21.7 |14.4 |13.0 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |To other domestic |98.7 |54.1 |57.2 | |customers | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Exports |28.9 |18.7 |23.8[.sup]1[/] | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |[.sup]1[/]plus 1.4 million metric tons from the stocks of Weglokoks | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Receiving credit for their coal exports enabled the mines to meet their most urgent obligations and especially to disburse wages. The nightmare of spreading coal dumps vanished. At year's end, the coal-storage areas were empty. The following coal companies rank foremost among coal exporters (tonnage exported and proportion of exports to total sales in parentheses): Jastrzebie (7.1 million metric tons, 47 percent), Rybnik (4.9 million metric tons, 33 percent), Katowice (4.4 million metric tons, 19 percent), Gliwice (3.9 million metric tons, 22 percent), Ruda (1.5 million metric tons, 11 percent), Bytom (1.4 million metric tons, 10 percent), and Nadwislanska (0.8 million metric tons, 3 percent). Concentration of mining operations. These operations became less extensive, reflecting a more selective concentration of extraction at mine levels and galleries and assuring a more efficient utilization of machinery and personnel. The overall length of extraction walls dropped to 79 km (compared with 112.4 km in 1989), and the number of active extraction walls dropped to 440 (compared with 640 in 1989). While the volume of extraction was the same as in 1992, employment in mining companies declined by 19,000, and productivity, as measured by the number of metric tons of coal extracted annually per employee, increased by 6 percent and reached 415 metric tons. The maximum productivity--greater by a factor of 1.5 than the average--was attained by the Lublin Coal Company. Decline in the real extraction cost of coal. This is due to lower operating expenses (other than wages), which in dollar terms decreased by $2.6 per metric ton, to $14.10 from $16.70--i.e., by 18 percent--compared with the preceding year. Of these expenses (in dollars per metric ton): - The cost of materials and energy decreased by 10 percent, to $6.20 from $6.80. - The cost of outside services decreased by three-fifths, to $2.70 from $4.60. - Depreciation, owing to, among other things, greater sales, decreased by 10 percent, to $1.70 from $1.90. The expenditures on wages and salaries, on the other hand, increased by $0.30 per metric ton, to $16.2 from $15.9, of which direct wages increased to $11.50 from $11.40 and the cost of fringe benefits to $4.70 from $4.50. During the year, the value of the dollar rose, and the zloty [Z] was devalued by a factor of 1.3 times. The mean annual currency exchange rate amounted to Z18,300 per dollar, compared with Z13,600 in the preceding year. Altogether, the real production cost of coal dropped to $31.20 [per metric ton] from $32.60--i.e., by 4 percent. What problems were encountered by the coal companies during the period in question? First, there was the price "Rubicon." It was quite explicit, as shown by a comparison of domestic and export prices of coal. In domestic sales, coal prices increased in real terms (by 8 percent after a year) to $29.90 from $27.60 per metric ton, of which, for lump coal, by 13 percent, to $52.50 from $46.40; for coal breeze used by power plants, by 13 percent, to $22.40 from $19.80; and for coking coal, by 18 percent, to $41.20 from $34.80. As for the export prices, there was a big slump in export sales owing to the decline in the prices of crude petroleum. As a result, in real terms, export prices plummeted by 18 percent, to $30.30 from $36.0 per metric ton, of which the decreases were: for lump coal, by 9 percent, to $58.20 from $62.90; for coal breeze used by power plants, by 27 percent, to $21.6 from $29.60; and for coking coal, by 11 percent, to $33.00 from $37.20. Viewed in this light, reflections on the so-called import parity have to be qualified. To domestic customers, only lump coal is cheaper (almost $6 per metric ton) than to foreign ones, whereas they have to pay more (almost $1 more per metric ton) for coal breeze and coking coal ($8 more per metric ton) than foreign customers. Thus, on the whole, the average price optained for exported coal has become only slightly higher ($0.40 per metric ton) than the domestic price, while the differences in quality remain considerable. In the preceding year, the situation was much better because then the average price obtained for exported coal was $8.40 per metric ton higher. These proportions were averaged over the year and do not quite reflect the actual variations. Price movements in the first three quarters of last year were moderate, so most of the increases in domestic prices of coal occurred during the last quarter. That was needed to balance income with expenditures, but it adversely affected the costs of fuel (lump coal, coke), electricity, and heat--hence the increases. arket capacity. The domestic market for [black] coal is shrinking and will continue to shrink owing to competition by the cheaper brown coal (used by power plants) and the more convenient natural gas used in the households not connected to the heating mains. Each year the gas industry is gaining 200,000 new customers, of which 100,000 are for gas heating of homes. An export offensive on the West European market might afford us an opportunity. Another, more long-term opportunity is presented by Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic countries. As for overseas markets, freight cost is too high to make exports to them profitable. Last year, imports by the West European countries were about 130 million metric tons, of which 90 million tons were of power coal and 40 million tons of coking coal. That was 17 million tons less than in 1992. Owing to the recession, purchases by power plants declined by about 10 million tons, and by coking plants by about 7 million tons. In that situation, exporters, including Poland, benefited from the withdrawal of Russian coal (12 million tons in 1992) from the market owing to the government-ordered soaring increases in the cost of Russian rail freight. Among coal exporters to the West European market, Poland ranked fourth, with about 18 million metric tons, after South Africa (about 34 million tons), Australia (about 30 million tons), and the United States (about 2 million tons [as published]). It would be vain to expect a resurgence of coal demand in West Europe, despite the continuing decline in extraction in Great Britain, Germany, and France. It remains for us to continue an obdurate struggle to retain our beachheads in competition with such low-cost "tigers" as, chiefly, South Africa and Australia, not to mention a turnaround toward the "East," considering that, under the barter system, coal and coke, for example, are swappable for Krivoi Rog ore and iron nodules. Financial performance of the coal companies. The closing balance sheet for last year was somewhat negative (sales declined by $1.60 per metric ton compared with a decline of $5 per ton in 1992), although by December it turned positive (sales increased by $4.80 per ton). Table 2 illustrates the performance of individual coal companies for 1993 as a whole and for December 1993 alone. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2Financial Performance of Coal Companies in 1993(in dollars) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1993 |December 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bytom Coal Company |- 2.7 |+ 2.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ruda Coal Company |- 3.1 |+ 4.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gliwice Coal Company |+ 1.5 |- 1.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Katowice Mines |+ 0.1 |+ 4.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nadwislanska Coal Company|- 1.2 |+ 3.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rybnik Coal Company |- 2.2 |+ 2.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jastrzebie Coal Company |- 1.6 |+ 6.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bogdanka, Inc. |0 |+ 7.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The principal wish for the future is that the coal companies improve their performance on their own rather than at the expense of the consumer and the currency devaluation. Miners' jobs depend on this.
