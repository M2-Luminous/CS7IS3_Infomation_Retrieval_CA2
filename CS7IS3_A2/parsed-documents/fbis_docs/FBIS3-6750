He demanded that the United States withdraw the unreasonable preconditions. Reinaldo Tefelvelez, first vice-chairman of the National Assembly of Nicaragua, in a statement March 8 said that if the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is to be settled, the United States must withdraw its nuclear weapons from South Korea, withdraw its unreasonable preconditions in the implementation of the steps of simultaneous action agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. contact and sincerely approach the talks. If the United States is really interested in dialogue, it must prove this in practice and stop the anti-DPRK campaign, first of all, he urged. The French committee for recognizing the DPRK in a statement March 15 said the United States must not abuse the International Atomic Energy Agency and the international community for justifying its sinister policy of stifling socialist Korea. The statement strongly demanded that the United States refrain from seeking a sinister political purpose with unilateral demands to the DPRK.
