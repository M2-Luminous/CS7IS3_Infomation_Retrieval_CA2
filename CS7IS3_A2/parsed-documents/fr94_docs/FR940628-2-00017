FR940628-2-00017 FR940628-2-00010 COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION Proposed Amendments Relating to the CME's Domestic Stock Index Futures Contracts AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ACTION: Notice of Proposed Contract Market Rule Changes. SUMMARY: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has submitted proposed rule amendments to the opening price limit provisions in its domestic stock index futures contracts. Under the proposal, each domestic stock index futures contract's opening price limit would not be in effect on any day when the closing price of the preceding Globex trading session is outside the price range that would be permitted under that contract's opening price limit provisions. 1 1 The affected CME domestic stock index futures contracts are in the Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Price Index (S&P 500), the Standard and Poor's MidCap 400 Stock Price Index, the Russell 2000 Stock Price Index, and the Major Market Index. In accordance with Section 5a(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act and acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation ยง140.96, the Director of the Division of Economic Analysis (Division) on behalf of the Commission has determined that publication of the proposal is in the public interest and will assist the Commission in considering the views of interested persons. On behalf of the Commission, the Division is requesting comment on this proposal. DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons should submit their views and comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW, Washington, DC 20581. Reference should be made to the amendments to the CME domestic stock index futures contracts. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Contact Stephen Sherrod, Division of Economic Analysis, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW, Washington, DC 20581, telephone 202&hyph;254&hyph;7303. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The overnight Globex session in the S&P 500 futures contract ends at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time. 2 The following regular trading session begins at 9:30 a.m. The price limit in effect at the end of the Globex session is 12 S&P 500 points above or below the previous day's settlement price. (Twelve S&P 500 points are equivalent to about 100 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).) The opening price limit in effect at the beginning of the regular trading session is five S&P 500 points above or below the previous day's settlement price (equivalent to about 40 points in the DJIA). This price limit remains in effect until 9:40 a.m. Thus, the price limit in the S&P 500 futures contract during the preceding Globex session is wider than that in effect during the open of the following regular trading session. 2 In general, both the current and proposed provisions in the other CME domestic stock index futures contracts are analogous to those in the S&P 500 futures contract. The CME proposes that the S&P 500 futures contract's opening price limit not be in effect on any day that the closing price of the preceding Globex trading session is more than five points above or below the previous day's settlement price. According to the CME, this proposal will improve coordination between the opening and Globex price limits on days when the closing price on Globex exceeds the opening price limit. Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581. Copies of the proposed rule amendments can be obtained through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the above address or by phone at (202) 254&hyph;6314. The materials submitted by the CME in support of the proposed amendments may be available upon request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR Part 145 (1987)). Requests for copies should be made to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff of the Office of the Secretariat at the Commission's headquarters in accordance with 17 CFR 145.7 and 145.8. Any person interested in submitting written data, views, or arguments on the proposed amendments should send such comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW, Washington, DC 20581 by the specified date. Issued in Washington, DC, on June 22, 1994. Blake Imel, Acting Director.
