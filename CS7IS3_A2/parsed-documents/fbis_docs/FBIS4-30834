This is demonstrated by the numerous bilateral talks -- with Cyprus, Malta, China, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Italy, Greece, Angola, Tunisia, Kenya, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Morocco. [Begin Foreign Minister Granic recording -- not introduced by announcer nor identified by screen caption] I have used my time in Cairo to hold a number of bilateral talks with countries from Europe, Africa, and Latin America primarily about the peaceful reintegration of UN Protected Areas [UNPA's] into Croatia's legal system. As has been announced, Croatia will demand that the UN General Assembly discuss an additional item at its session in September -- the UNPA's and the problems of their reintegration. We received firm support on this from many countries and a high degree of understanding from all countries for Croatia's just demands. I also discussed the establishment of diplomatic relations with Angola and Kenya. I had very important talks with the heads of the Greek and Italian delegations, where we discussed problems between Italy and Croatia which must be resolved in a good-neighborly manner, without any tension. Italy reiterated its position on the inviolability of borders. I believe that the prime ministers and foreign ministers will meet during the conference of the Central European Initiative in Trieste in mid-July. As regards Greece, we expect that as the country currently chairing the European Union [EU], in the next few days it will reply to Croatia's demand to have talks with the EU on economic cooperation and on joining the PHARE program.
