[Mikhnevich] Andrey Alekseyevich, many people are explaining the reasons for the present crisis by the shift in priorities in the government's activity. Some are saying that we should have started with financial stabilization, others, with the structural reorganization of the economy, and yet others believe that we should generally have increased subsidies to industry and not have embarked on dangerous experiments. What do you, a person at the very epicenter of the struggle for reform of the economy, think? [Nechayev] The latter assertion I do not consider serious in the least. By the time the Gaydar government had assumed office, the country had long been living beyond its means and was on the very threshold of a most severe financial crisis. As far as the first two are concerned, these are essentially two sides of the same coin. Gaydar understood this, but the government began with a policy of financial stabilization and liberalization of the economy bolstered by privatization. The release of enterprises from strict state tutelage combined with free pricing, taking account of real outlays, made it possible to distinguish both the viable enterprises and sectors and those that are either not in a position to survive at all or that could do so provided that production is reprofiled or reorganized. The structural reorganization of the economy was to have been the aim of the second stage of the reforms. At this stage it was contemplated, on the basis of the limited possibilities of the budget, supporting viable industries and providing for the most painless possible winding down of the inefficient ones. But we did not reach the second stage. Under the severest pressure of the sectoral and regional lobbies expressing the interests of potential insolvent enterprises, the Supreme Soviet initially messed up the well-proportioned, interlinked program, tearing it apart bit by bit, and then, with its support, the Central Bank gave a boost to the inflation spiral, granting the enterprises large-scale, unsupported loans, essentially signifying the injection into the economy of an enormous supply of wholly unbacked money. The start of the structural reorganization was impeded by another step also--it was in fact blocked by the adoption of the Bankruptcy Act. The stream of demagogy from high platforms did the economy a bad turn. The burst of inflation that followed immediately after hit most strongly at both the manufacturers and the public, inflaming the atmosphere even more and making ways out of the crisis more difficult. The ailment, which was driven inward, has once again come to the surface, but this time in a more serious form. I believe that there is no other solution to the crisis for the government today than to operate simultaneously in two directions--undertaking strict financial regulation and active structural reorganization. [Mikhnevich] In other words, the present government is faced with doing what, formerly, Gaydar did not venture, when the situation was less explosive. A contradiction arises: strict financial regulation with a very meager budget will deprive the structural reorganization of the necessary investments. On what reserves can the government count in this situation? [Nechayev] First, we need to create conditions that stimulate as much as possible all potential investors (banks, enterprises, commercial structures, the public) for the long-term investment of resources. It would be expedient for this, in particular, to exempt from taxes funds channeled into investment and permitting enterprises to pursue a flexible depreciation policy, and the commercial banks, to lower the rate of reserve holdings in the Central Bank, provided that the resources thus released are channeled into long-term credit. It is necessary also to devise as quickly as possible a package of documents regulating collateral relationships, mortgages included. Thus, the task is to stimulate as much as possible, using limited government resources, the attraction of nongovernment funds. Of course, the state will always have obligations connected with defense capability, the environment, and development of the infrastructure and social programs. There is no escaping nonreturnable funding here, although these resources also could be spent more efficiently--via competitive bids, tenders, and the use of contract relations between state clients and contractors. The resources, on the other hand, which are channeled into the support of industry and other sectors of the production sphere, which will ultimately produce direct returns, should be allocated mainly on a returnable basis. [Mikhnevich] Have such tactics been discussed at the government level? [Nechayev] Back in 1992 the Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation had prepared a draft that proposed the abandonment if only of some nonreturnable budget investments, substituting for them commercial investment credit at a preferential rate of interest. They were to have been issued on a competitive basis to specific enterprises on the strength of particular projects, which had undergone comprehensive expert appraisal, with a relatively short cost-recovery term. Following completion of the project, the principal and interest would be returned to the creditor, that is, the state, and could once again be used for investments. There has in this way been an increase in the demands made on the efficiency of the projects and a broadening of the opportunities for future investments. I have to say that even at that time there was no shortage of interesting proposals--the reforms emancipated initiative, and people understood that in realizing efficient projects good money could be earned in the future. The government is now returning to this idea and developing it. A corporation's proposals were recently discussed by government and banking experts, and it was deemed expedient to differentiate between the use of budget resources for investments, initially allocating approximately 20-30 percent of the 21 trillion rubles [R] determined by the budget for capital investments for the granting of loans on a commercial basis, and also for the realization of another part of our proposals--the use of government resources for investments in share capital in combination with private investments. These tasks, specifically, will be tackled by the Russian Finance Corporation. [Mikhnevich] Thus, if I have understood you correctly, we are talking about the appearance of fundamentally new investment and financial institutions under our conditions essentially pursuing government policy, but simultaneously acting the part of transactor operating independently. Is this, after all, a state organization or a private organization acting in the interests of the state? [Nechayev] The status could change in the future, but we are at this time a state structure operating on the principles of financial autonomy and acting as the agent of the government, to which it entrusts the administration of a part of the budget resources. Such institutions operate successfully, for example, in the United States, Germany, and Italy. Budget support for the development of the most promising directions in scientific research and new technology and the stimulation of exports and private investments and other areas of vital importance for developing the economy and for maintaining high competitiveness on the world market are being realized with their help. The task with us is more modest as yet--attracting to the economy new investments and accelerating capital turnover. [Mikhnevich] Have you already devised a mechanism? [Nechayev] Of course, although, naturally, it will probably have to be refined with reference to the situation on the investments market. There are entirely specific areas in which, we believe, companies like the RFK [Russian Finance Corporation] should operate. Their functions are portfolio investments, allocating loans and putting together around these government resources nongovernment capital and concluding agreements with bankers and borrowers. It is nonsense when the Ministry of Finance concludes direct credit agreements with enterprises! How will such companies operate? There is, for example, a large number of projects that their potential participants are not in a position to finance in full. There are, then, two options: either the government provides investment credit or participates directly in this project and acquires its share of the stock. If the project is realized and becomes profitable, the price of the shares rises. The government could at any moment sell them at a profit and allocate the money for new investments. All Western investment banks operate according to this format. Acting on behalf and at the behest of the state, the RFK will attract primarily private investments. This format, roughly speaking, is as follows: the state invests R1 in a specific project and thereby declares its support for this project and its readiness to share the risk, but on the strength of this support commercial structures should invest, say, R3. Our estimates show that such interaction with commercial structures is perfectly possible, inasmuch as they have an interest even today in the profitable investment of their capital not only in trade or currency transactions. There is also a number of other ideas, on which, owing to the lack of space, it is not worth dwelling on in detail at this time. [Mikhnevich] Nonetheless, as experience shows, investors are attracted not so much by verbal as by actual guarantees, and in terms of the degree of investment risk, Russia is today superior only to countries that are at war. Can the government provide such guarantees? [Nechayev] We also consider this matter extremely serious. Our viewpoint is such: we need an insurance or guarantee fund, not only ruble but foreign currency also, what is more, which would help attract foreign investors also. It is necessary, partially, to allocate budget monies for its creation. Management of the fund could be assumed by state structures of the RFK type. We are also engaged in an active dialogue with OPIC [Overseas Private Investment Corp.]--the agency performing similar functions in the United States. Its guarantees are in fact guarantees of the U.S. Government, on the strength of which any Western bank instantly allocates credit. I hope that we will manage to obtain from OPIC resources both in the form of guarantees and in the form of direct credit. Without reciprocal guarantees on the part of the Russian Government. We hope that we can persuade American investment banks to invest their own capital in our projects in combination with resources granted by OPIC. If this happens, this will be a great success. [Mikhnevich] Will your activity on the securities market be confined merely to stock transactions? [Nechayev] We contemplate issuing on behalf of the corporation special ruble bonds at a relatively low rate of interest with compensation in the form of their owners being granted on the part of the corporation services pertaining to expert project evaluation, the attraction of capital, consulting, and so forth. It is also contemplated issuing foreign currency bonds, the price of which will change in accordance with the current price of the dollar at the prevailing interest rate in the West. It will thus be possible to accumulate additional resources for investments. Further, at the behest of the Ministry of Finance, the corporation will conduct transactions with internal currency bonds. We are talking about bonds issued in exchange for the "frozen" currency accounts in the Vneshekonombank [Bank for Foreign Economic Activity]. We have enlisted a number of banks with whose participation we intend to make these bonds relatively liquid. We have also established contacts with Western investment institutions, which are prepared to purchase these bonds. Our quotations, that is, the prices that we are offering the enterprises when purchasing the bonds, are higher than those of our competitors. Another direction which could be of interest to our enterprises is the allocation of currency loans with these bonds being used as collateral, proceeding from their market value. And, finally, the third direction--participation in risk-sharing. The foreign currency or part thereof paid to an enterprise will be placed on deposit in one of banks at a good rate of interest. In the event of an increase in the market price of the bonds, the profit will be shared with the enterprise. The proposed ideas would be profitable for the holders of the bonds, I believe. They would not have to wait for many years for redemption of the bonds and would immediately obtain "live" money, which could be invested in business. The corporation and the banks take the risk. If the price of the bonds (thanks to the attraction of foreign purchasers included) rises, they will be the winners also. [Mikhnevich] How do you intend to monitor the operation of the banks, considering their predilection for first turning over a time or two the money they have received and only then entering it into clients' accounts? [Nechayev] We will, most likely, refuse to grant the banks credit and will do business directly with the borrower, opening a line of credit for him. The bank's function will be confined merely to servicing the movement of the money. [Mikhnevich] If in the future the regions manage to defend their independence (the trend toward separatism is being manifested even now), will this be reflected in the activity and plans of the corporation? [Nechayev] On the contrary, we believe that it is our regional branches, which the RFK is actively creating, which will bear the brunt of the burden, inasmuch as there is much that is seen more clearly at the local level. The majority of investment projects should be worked out and realized at the regional level with regard for local specifics. [Mikhnevich] How do you see the future of structures like the RFK? [Nechayev] Their appearance and development ensue directly from the logic of reform. Whether we like it or not, the development of market relations will force us to use in the investment space forms and methods accepted and well honed by world practice. Our corporation is today a pioneer to a large extent, but it is hardly destined to operate alone--others, which will compete with one another, owing to which the investment climate will only get better, will appear also.
