With the induction of this German designed Type-1500 submarine built at the Indian Naval Dockyard, the number of submarines in the Indian Navy has gone up to 19, but India's submarine capability will continue to decline from next year. To compensate for the expected shortfall and to maintain strike capability, the Indian Navy has prepared a 15-year plan, but there is no possibility of implementing the plan due to a lack of financial resources. At the end of the seventies, the Indian Navy had acquired eight Foxtrot class submarines from the Soviet Union. These submarines are more than 25 years old now, meaning end of their life span. One of these submarines was retired last year. Now these Foxtrot class submarines are in line for retirement one after another. Thus, all Foxtrots will be retired in the next five to six years. If no new submarines are added, the number of submarines India operates will be reduced to 12. Other than the Foxtrot class of submarines, the Indian Navy has eight 'Kilo' class submarines from Russia. These submarines were acquired by the end of the eighties. During the same time, two German H.D.W. Type-1500 submarines were directly purchased. An agreement with Germany was reached where it will assist in the design and building of four such submarines for the Indian Navy. India has already built two of these submarines, but the Indian Government has not taken any decision to build the other two because of lack of finances. It costs four billion rupees to build a submarine and in the current year only 27.38 billion have been allocated to the Navy out of the defense budget -- about 13 percent of the total defense budget. It is paradoxical for the Navy that it not only has to fix funds for the new submarines to replace the retiring Foxtrots from this limited budget, but it also has to goad the government into giving a green signal for the construction of a new aircraft carrier to replace the retiring air craft carrier Vikrant. The construction of an aircraft carrier could cost 10 billion rupees. The Navy also has to find financial resources for the timely completion of some other now under-construction modern warships. These are all top-priority plans for the Navy and it cannot shirk the responsibility of implementing them by describing one plan as less important than another. Now the onus rests with the government to take new initiatives to maintain the submarine capability. Indians have acquired the unique experience of submarine construction under German license at the Mazagaon Naval Dockyard, which has given the confidence to the Indian scientists that they can build indigenously designed submarines. Meanwhile, the Indian Government retains the right to build two more submarines under the German license. Although Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, while handing over the submarine INS Shankul to the Navy at the Mazagaon Naval Dockyard in Bombay, said that more budget will be allocated for the Navy in view of the immense sea challenges posed to it, he gave no hint as to when the construction of the next submarine will commence. It looks like the capability acquired by the Indian Naval Dockyard will remain unutilized. The director general of the Mazagaon Dockyard also urged the prime minister to direct the dockyard to build more submarines to use the acquired facilities. The first submarine under the German design was built two years ago. This makes it clear that it takes up to two years to build a submarine. So, even if India gives an order now to build another submarine, it will be two years before a new submarine is inducted. Obviously, India now will have to pay special attention to maintaining its submarine capability during the transitional period. In fact, in view of the possibility of retiring Foxtrots one after another, the Defense Ministry should have ordered the construction of new submarines long ago to maintain continuity in the submarine building process. With this option unavailable now, it is feared that the Indian Navy's submarine capability will continue to decline in the coming years. According to naval experts, the Foxtrot series of submarines will prove ineffective in the modern naval warfare scenario. Moreover, these submarines remain in dock for maintenance and repair work more than half the time. Naval sources say that these submarines have become so old their maintenance is proving too costly for the Navy. That is why they cannot be considered effective for strategic reasons. While the Indian Navy's submarine capability will continue to decline in the coming years, the Pakistan Navy is restless to acquire three most sophisticated submarines. For the time being, Pakistan has eight submarines and this number will go up to 11 or 12 with the induction of new submarines. Pakistan soon is going to purchase three 'Agosta' series of sophisticated submarines from France. Pakistan also is going to receive P-3-C Orion aircraft, which are used for antisubmarine search and destroy operations. With the help of three such aircraft, Pakistan can render the Indian Naval fleet ineffective. Other than Pakistan, the Chinese Navy is also a cause of serious concern for India because its submarines have been seen strolling in the Andaman Sea in the name of cooperation with the Burmese Navy. China at present has more than 100 submarines, out of which 20 are nuclear powered. China's 'Xia' class of submarines can even fire long-range ballistic missiles. In view of the submarine capabilities of China and Pakistan, the strong possibility of declining Indian capability is a cause of strategic concern.
