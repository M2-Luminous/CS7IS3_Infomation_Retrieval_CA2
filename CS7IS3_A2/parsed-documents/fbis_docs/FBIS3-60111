Freiburg police reported on Monday [10 January] that more than 100 persons were arrested in several cantons and are now helping police with inquiries. The investigations have been coordinated by the Addictive Drugs Section of the Federal Public Prosecutor. The investigations have been going on for 17 months. They began with monitoring a Nigerian drug dealer who "directed" a branch of the huge international trafficking ring from Freiburg. He lived in a hotel and carried out his activities under a false name. The man was arrested, together with two other persons, in April 1993. He alone will have to stand trial for selling more than 20 kilograms of heroin and cocaine.
