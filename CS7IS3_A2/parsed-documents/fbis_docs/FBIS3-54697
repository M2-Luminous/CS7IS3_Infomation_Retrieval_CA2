What Will It Be?"] [Text] At the Rome session of CSCE Foreign Ministers Council, the Russian delegation raised the question of giving a legitimate status within the CSCE framework to the peacemaking efforts of the Russian Federation and the CIS. While recognizing the existence of the real threat to international security emanating from the interethnic conflicts which are erupting in the former USSR and giving de facto approval to the actions of the Russian Federation, the Council of Ministers was nevertheless reluctant to give its forces the status of CSCE "blue helmets." The Russian side's argument did not meet with understanding from a whole series of delegations, first and foremost Ukraine, a number of East European countries, Canada, and Norway. At the session, the opponents of the legitimation in international law of the actions of the Russian Federation's peacemaking forces raised the hypothesis of the revival of Russian "neoimperialism" and accused Russia of trying in this way to mask its true intentions with regard to the new division of the Eurasian continent. It goes without saying that Russia, like any great power, has zones of traditional geopolitical interests and regions to which it gives paramount attention. Our approach in this regard is dictated not by an imperial ideology but by perfectly understandable pragmatic considerations. It is obvious that the creation in Russia of a successfully functioning market economy mechanism is impossible without ensuring that market's normal interaction. Russia's prime interest is in a normalization of the situation in the neighboring former Union republics not only in a military sense but also economically. It was considerations such as those which has motivated Russia's diplomatic efforts in New York, Rome, Brussels, and at other international forums where it formulated practical steps on peacemaking questions. The charges of neoimperialism are groundless even if only because Moscow, by bearing on its shoulders the full burden of peacemaking in the post-Soviet area, is certainly not seeking to operate in isolation. On the contrary, collective actions are no less necessary in Nagorno-Karabakh, for example, than they are in Yugoslavia. Russia operates in the "hot spots" not only in its own interests but also in the interests of the whole world community. That was confirmed at the 48th UN General Assembly [UNGA] session and formed the main theme of the decisions of the CSCE Foreign Ministers' Council. It is obvious now that there are no alternatives to increasing and strengthening Russia's peacemaking efforts in the area of the former USSR. For Russia, the question is not whether to engage in those activities or not. The question is how to make those efforts more effective by utilizing UN experience in regional conflicts and elaborating joint positions with the CSCE. Incidentally, the latter need was tacitly recognized by the participants in the Rome forum when they acknowledged the CSCE's failure to convene a peace conference on Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia's peacemaking forces can offer evidence of the considerable, albeit not absolute, success of its actions in the Dniester region, Tajikistan, Ingushetia, and other regions. The creation and strengthening of Russia's peacemaking structures is being effected with the participation of the supreme councils of the CIS member countries. Incidentally, the CIS countries' joint peacemaking actions are carried out both on the basis of bilateral and multilateral interim accords and of the recently adopted "Agreement on the Groups of Military Observers and Collective Forces for the Maintenance of Peace in the CIS." Our peacemaking efforts also have an enormous "humanitarian" advantage. Russians know best the specifics of the political situation, are able to understand the genesis and dynamics of a conflict, and are ready to effectively promote the long-term stabilization of the situation. Russia, furthermore, is acquiring its own unique "fire-fighting" experience. For example, as distinct from the existing rules of the CSCE, it is becoming the practice here to enlist the opposing sides' forces in operations, and for our armed contingents to use military force, although it must be said not for the purpose of crushing the opposing sides in a conflict but for self-defense. This of course does not mean that Moscow is trying in some way to crowd out potential foreign peacemakers. On the contrary, the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry memorandum on enhancing the CSCE's effectiveness in the peacemaking sphere proposes preparing and concluding a treaty on the principles of planning and implementing the kind of operations which would envisage the formation of a joint paramilitary rapid reaction corps and would create a common material base for operations. While expressing full gratitude to the CSCE observers working in the conflict zones in Ossetia, the Dniester region, and Abkhazia it has to be acknowledged that the existing CSCE structures, geared as they are to the prevention of conflicts and the maintenance of peace by means of preventive diplomacy, cannot always give an adequate and rapid response to the challenges of the present day. The search for the optimum combination of the efforts of the CSCE and Russia, the elaboration of the status of operations, and giving material expression to that status will all take considerable time. Unfortunately, that is what we do not have. That is why at the 48th UNGA Session and the Rome session Moscow's delegation raised with particular persistence the question of giving priority to easing the financial burden which the Russian Federation is bearing in connection with the implementation of peacemaking actions. Clearly it has to be realized that in the specific post-Soviet area purely Russian peacemaking actions cannot be replaced by international financial support, no matter how extensive it may be, or by the participation of any group of countries in them. That view, it seems, is meeting with a certain understanding among the leading Western countries.
