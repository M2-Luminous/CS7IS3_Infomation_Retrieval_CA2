FBIS4-13888 "drnes079_k_94010" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 IRAQ Saddam Addresses Group Saddam Addresses Group JN2404112594 JN2404112594 BFN [Editorial Report] Baghdad Republic of Iraq Radio Network in Arabic at 2007 GMT on 23 April, as part of its scheduled 2000 GMT newscast, carries a 24-minute recording of the "text" of a speech delivered by Iraqi President Saddam Husayn when he received a delegation from the al-Ta'mim Governorate comprised of tribal chieftains, notables, and clergymen of various denominations, who pronounced the "oath of total allegiance" to the Iraqi leader, reiterating their loyalty and allegiance to "the people's loved one and the architect of modern Iraq," and underscoring their willingness to sacrifices their lives, and all that is dear in defense of Iraq and its unity and sovereignty. President Saddam Husayn begins his speech by saluting the delegation members, saying: "I do not want to address the recent past," but notes that "foreigners" want to make sure that no other nations become powerful. He says they "do not want to see a hill or a mountaintop on the earth they are treading," but does not elaborate. He begins to speak about the past in general terms, and recognizes the "dear sacrifices" the Iraqis offered in this past. He likens the history of nations to that of men. He argues that the history of a nation documents the hardships they undergo. Elaborating on this, Saddam addresses the al-Ta'mim delegation, saying: "The standing of your people and state is commensurate with the magnitude of the sacrifices they make in defense of right and justice. We have repeatedly said that we do not deem ourselves superior to anybody on the globe, given our age-old and rich traditions, and our true Islamic religion, which holds all human beings equal in their human worth. However, if anybody deems himself superior to us, we become dutybound to rectify such a transgression. This has been our situation from the outset, and will remain so. We do not transgress against anybody. But, whoever transgresses against us must calculate the consequences. You have long pledged to vindicate Karkuk. The attendees are all noble figures representing various denominations, faiths, ethnic groups, and tribes. You are all the sons of a single people. Karkuk is your city, just as Baghdad is yours. Of course, Karkuk is also special. Evildoers, and those benefiting from evil, be they near or far, are well aware that evil cannot be entrenched, and thus become threatening unless Karkuk turns evil. This is an established fact of which we were well aware before 1968, when the revolution took place. That is why we place Karkuk on an equal footing with al-'Azamiyah and al-Karkh. The law enforced in al-'Azamiyah and al- Karkh will also be enforced in Karkuk. There can be no other law." [applause] Saddam notes the experiences Karkuk has gone through at the hands of "unrestrained outlaws," and underscores the need for people to learn from past lessons. He urges the delegation members to view themselves as a close-knit family, as "sons of a single country." He adds: "You have to deem the wrongdoers pardoned by the state as part of you. This should remain the case unless they remind you of their old mischief. Then, you must punish them for the old and new mischief that they carried out. Your state cherishes a host of habits, of which you are well aware. These habits reflect the values you cherish and the principles you uphold." Saddam preaches tolerance among residents of all Iraqi governorates. If an Iraqi hailing from Baghdad wants to settle in al-Ta'mim, he must cherish the traditions and values the al-Ta'mim residents treasure. But if an Iraqi means mischief, he must be confronted firmly, Saddam argues. He says that the true Iraqi identity is manifested in "good citizenship and patriotism." Iraqis, Saddam argues, should respect the views of the majority of the people. Saddam acknowledges the possible emergence of differing views on national issues, particularly with regard to economy. However, he states that there can be no various interpretations when patriotic sentiments are at stake. He adds that whoever chooses to abandon his patriotic sentiments cannot be called an Iraqi. He goes on to say that the Iraqi state, just like Iraqi tribes, cherishes certain values, and detests others. Freedom, he argues, cannot allow a person to engage in mischief against neighbors. Saddam urges his audience to enlighten their children, sons, and daughters about the past, and about the misery they experienced in the past. He adds that work, dutifulness, and conscientiousness have promoted the Iraqis' lot. He goes on to say that the pursuit of such an approach establishes a firm course on which one can build. He notes that the regime that does not pursue a firm course cannot have firm loyalists defending it. Saddam notes the problems facing marriageable young women, saying: "I have been informed that when some girls are proposed to by cousins, relatives, neighbors, or acquaintances, they say that they want bridegrooms who are equal to their fathers in stature. Well, do you know how your fathers were in the past? Your fathers are now almost 50, or 60 years old. You see that his house is covered with marble. You must realize that this prestige has been achieved after 60 years of efforts. When your father was 20-years old, he did not have this property. This means that fathers have not enlightened their daughters as to their true state of affairs 20 years ago. This spoils daughters, because they would have unrealistic aspirations and ambitions. They need to get married to new graduates. How can these graduates own a house, a car, etcetera? Can ownership be realized by anything other than work?" Saddam urges Iraqis to cherish sublime values, contending that car ownership should not turn into a form of ostentatious behavior. The same goes for camel or cattle ownership, he says. Saddam argues that Iraqis and Arabs always "viewed money as a means to a higher end." He urges Iraqi parents to enlighten their children about the kind of life they led 20 years ago. He also notes that "some boys are also exceeding the proper bounds." He expresses the conviction that had the boys been enlightened by their parents, they would not have "exceeded the proper bounds." Saddam adds: "You are the men of al-Ta'mim. Judging by your conduct, one can say that the entire population of al-Ta'mim is good. We do not have any concern about al-Ta'mim, nor do we have any concern about al-Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, or Dahuk. This is because normalcy will eventually prevail." [applause] Saddam adds that the situation brought about by external factors will become a thing of the past, from which the Iraqis can learn lessons. He adds: "We will exercise amnesty when God allows us to." Then, the good-natured men and women will take charge, he notes. Saddam goes on to say: "We have no fears about Karkuk or Baghdad. We are full of faith that this country is as firm as God wants it to be, and as God wants the faithful community to be." Afterward, Saddam wishes the al-Ta'mim delegation a bright future.
