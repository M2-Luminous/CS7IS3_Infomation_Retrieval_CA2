She made this statement after Thursday's talks between the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, and his Armenian counterpart, Vahan Papazyan. The same day Kozyrev conferred with the Foreign Minister of the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, Arkady Gukasyan. According to Sidorova, the main goal pursued by Moscow is to sign an agreement on a cease-fire and halting military actions in Nagorno-Karabakh. "Russia fears that the conflict may further destabilize the situation in the region," she pointed out. "The negotiations are progressing with difficulty," Sidorova said. "Each of the warring sides has its own claims. It's a long conflict, and each side is apprehensive about taking some wrong step," she stressed. In the meantime, as the chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Press and Information Department, Grigoriy Karasin, said at Thursday's briefing in Moscow, the results of the talks held by Kozyrev with Papazyan and Gukasyan, as well as with the head of Azeri diplomacy, Gasan Gasanov, two days ago "show that the warring sides' attitudes to the possibility of signing an agreement on ceasing hostilities altogether have somewhat softened."
