FBIS3-27712 "dreas020_m_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-020 Document Type:Daily Report 31 Jan 1994 Thailand Minister Welcomes U.S. IPR Inspection BK3101081794 Bangkok Radio Thailand Network in Thai 1200 GMT 30 Jan 94 BK3101081794 Bangkok Radio Thailand Network Language: Thai Article Type:BFN [Text] The United States has postponed until early next month the decision about Thailand's status on its Priority Watch List, or PWL, because an assistant of the U.S. Trade Representative will arrive here first to observe Thailand's handling of piracy against intellectual property rights [IPR] and its copyright law. Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon told newsmen that it is good that the U.S. official will make an on-the-spot observation to see that Thailand is serious about suppression of intellectual property right violations and has adjusted its copyright law, making it closer to the international standard in order to benefit international trade. [Begin Uthai recording, in progress] ...who will inspect trade related to the issue of copyrights or intellectual property rights here. In my opinion, this is good because he will see with his own eyes and then be able to use that information as criteria for the U.S. decision. Regarding the decision to be made in January, the United States has informed us that it will first send an official to make an assessment of the situation. A decision will be made after that. I thanked them. This is good because they will be able to see for themselves what is going on here. They will be able to see that we are serious about solving the problem. We realize that the measures taken will also benefit our trade. If our own people do their business properly, this will be an incentive for others to come here and do business with us. We only stand to lose if we think only of copying others' products. By so doing we are only blocking the chances of new products and new technologies arriving in our country. By copying products we have also deprived ourselves of the chance to allow new products and new techniques to gain access here; moreover, we have deprived ourselves of the use of high quality products because their owners are afraid of imitation here. This is a disadvantage which only a few of us realize. [End recording]
