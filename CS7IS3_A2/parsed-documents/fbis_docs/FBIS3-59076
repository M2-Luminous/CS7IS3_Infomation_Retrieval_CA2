FBIS3-59076 "drweu017_k_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-017 Document Type:Daily Report 26 Jan 1994 PORTUGAL * PS's Guterres, PCP's Sa Interviewed on Alliance 94P20254 94P20254 Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] Socialist Party (PS) leader Antonio Guterres and Communist Party (PCP) official Luis Sa provided their views on an alliance between their respective parties. In an interview with Guterres by Jeronimo Pimentel and Raul Vaz published in the 3 January Lisbon daily PUBLICO, the interviewers pointed out that since the PS failed to "crush" the communist electorate during the recent municipal elections, a leftist majority cannot be achieved without the support of the PCP. Denying that the PS intended to "crush" the communists, Guterres replied that his party's goal was to defeat the governing Social Democratic Party (PSD). In addition, he argued that since the PS won 39 percent of the vote, close to a majority, it is "perfectly normal" that the "useful" vote penalize the PCP in favor of the PS. Asked how the PS will attract the traditional PCP electorate's "useful" vote, Guterres answered this can be done by providing a credible alternative to the PSD government, not through an alliance with the PCP. The PS, he said, will run alone in the next legislative elections. Guterres also refused to speculate whether he would ask the left for an "understanding" if the PS failed to achieve an absolute majority. When the interviewers stressed that rejecting an alliance with a PCP that openly desires an alliance is telling the communists their vote is not "useful," Guterres replied he would explain to the communist electorate that "the best way to defeat the PSD is to vote for the PS." The interviewers also noted that Guterres seems to be addressing one of the PS's "great anxieties," the direction in which the party will grow. Asked whether it will be toward the center, Guterres replied that the PS's main objective is "to grow with the voters who chose the PSD two years ago because they believed this party would solve the country's problems, but now are disillusioned." Turning to the next presidential elections, the interviewers noted that the municipal elections produced two winners, Lisbon Mayor Jorge Sampaio and Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes, both "almost natural" candidates for the presidency. Asked which of the two men Guterres would choose, the PS leader said that both are "possible and strong" PS candidates who can defeat any rightist candidate, including Cavaco Silva. According to Guterres, the prime minister will gradually understand he has no strategy to solve Portugal's problems and choose the presidency as an "increasingly appealing solution." PCP official Luis Sa was interviewed by Leonidio Paulo Ferreira and Paula Sa in the 7 January Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS. Sa was asked whether he thought the statement Guterres made in his recent interview -- that "the PCP is not a credible partner for a government alliance"-- was "offensive." Sa replied that only the Portuguese people can determine if the PCP is a credible partner. The interviewers also asked Sa whether the PS's "obstinacy" in rejecting an alliance with the PCP stems from its fear of losing centrist voters. Sa pointed out that this was the PS's "pretext" for rebuffing the PCP for a long time; however, when an alliance was concluded for the Lisbon mayoralty race, the cooperation resulted in gains for the centrist vote. When Sa advocated a postlegislative election PCP/PS alliance to add credibility to a project and gain votes, the interviewers asked whether the PCP is being "masochistic" in always calling for unity on the left and projecting a "weak image." Sa replied that an alternative to a rightist policy is more important than the issue of alliances. As reported by Leonidio Paulo Ferreira in the 5 January DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, PCP luminary Carlos Brito expressed his belief that the Socialists' "blustering" on the possibility of their winning an absolute majority by eschewing alliances is both indicative of the PS's "arrogant hegemonic ambition" and an "incitement to civil war within the Left."
