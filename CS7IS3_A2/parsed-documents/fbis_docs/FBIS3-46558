Han Tok-su says in his message that the great leader, last year, too, with his outstanding and tested guidance, smashed the most blatant anti-DPRK racket of the imperialists at every step, resolutely defended the socialism of chuche and built a powerful military strength and laid a more solid foundation of the independent economy and, furthermore, brought about a rich harvest, thus displaying the grand appearance of the country of chuche to the world. It notes that the great leader personally initiated the excavation of the Tomb of Tangun last year, had wisely led this work and had a decision on properly inheriting and developing the national cultural heritage adopted at the Sixth Session of the 9th Supreme People's Assembly, thereby instilling national pride into the heart of our people. It recalls that the great leader worked out and published last year "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country", a great political charter common to the nation, and led the entire fellow countrymen to the accomplishment of the cause of reunification through confederacy in the '90s. Han Tok-su stresses the need to build up the Chongnyon organisation into a powerful patriotic unit rooted among the compatriots, defend to the end the socialist country of chuche centred on the popular masses, resolutely repulsing any form of suppression and persecution by the imperialists, in the New Year. He sincerely wishes Generalissimo Kim Il-song a long life in good health.
