Naturally, many of them have also discussed the establishment of a socialist market economic structure and the ongoing reform of the market structure. Whenever they touched on the topic of market, some deputies expressed their worries and uneasiness about society's misunderstanding of and prejudices against markets. At present, there is a representative view on markets: In a market economic structure, all things and all departments should move into the market; they will be judged by the market and their fate will be decided by the market. It seems that the market is omnipotent. There is another view: the greatest interest of the market is profit-making. It seems that the market will certainly lead to "money worshipping." Some deputies held that these two tendencies are wrong and that if allowed to develop, they may delay or even hinder the reform on the establishment of a market economic structure. We have suffered losses from failure to abide by the law governing the operation of markets. At a time when a market structure was put into operation for the first time, many people harbored illusions about markets, the nature of which were not familiar to them. To them it seemed that a market was like a magic wand which can solve all problems. In fact it is not true. A market also has its dead corner. For example, government actions, compulsory education, basic science research, and quality intellectual products.... It is difficult to use market prices and market demands to measure their value and functions. This means that there is something the market is unable to do. Deputy Li Jingwen said if government institutions also act as the main competitors in the market, the move will lead to the practice of trading power for money and the occurrence of corrupt phenomena. Deputies Tao Xiping and Pan Ji held that everyone knows the social benefits created by basic education and basic science research, the former is the foundation for raising the educational level of the Chinese nation and the latter is the mother of all types of applied research. However, it is difficult for the market to repay these achievements in the form of exchange or according to their production value. The state should assume protection of these areas. Citing ordinary reading materials and academic works as an example, some deputies from the cultural and theoretical circles pointed out that by comparison, the value of the latter is much higher than the former, but the judgment of the market is frequently the opposite. Therefore, the market should not be allowed to decide the fate of all things. The plight of symphony orchestras, ballet dances, plays, and other magnificent arts has invoked strong responses from all sectors of society. This situation reflects, to a certain extent, the imbalance brought about by allowing the market to regulate everything. As an economist, Deputy Li Jingwen said: Speaking from the angle of an enterprise, the purpose of a market economy is to seek maximum returns, but this is not the same as the profit-before-everything mentality. Speaking of the market economic structure itself, what it seeks is optimizing the allocation of resources, thereby gaining maximum returns. In a sense a market economy means a market governed by laws and regulations. It demands that maximum profits be realized through legitimate competition on equal terms, and what it stresses is reasonable; but the profit-before-everything mentality refers to seeking exorbitant profits by resorting to unscrupulous means or even fraud and swindling, and is entirely different from competition on equal terms. It is groudless to assume that a market economy will inevitably lead to money worshipping. That is a misunderstanding of or a prejudice against the market economy. Many deputies held that to eliminate people's misunderstanding of a market economy, the best way is to accelerate the pace of building the socialist market economic structure, deepen the reform of the market structure, and enable people to step into the market with an understanding of it and the laws and rules governing it. In this way, they will not reject or avoid the market, nor will they indulge in supersitions about the market. Speaking from the angle of the government, the government should render support for the "dead corners" of markets and for the areas in which it cannot fully get involved. To seek a balanced development in society, the government should have explicit policies on what should be decontrolled and preserved.
