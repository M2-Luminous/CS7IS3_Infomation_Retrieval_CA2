"Much has changed in the country in the past few months, political stabilisation is gaining strength, the disastrous state of dual-power has been overcome", Boris Yeltsin pointed out. He also informed the local heads about his work with the chairmen of the Federation Council and State Duma, saying that there "have been no disagreements so far".
