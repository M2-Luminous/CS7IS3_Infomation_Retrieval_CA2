For more than two weeks Britain and Spain have been blocking the admission of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway because of a difference of opinion about the size of the so-called blocking minority, that is, the number of votes necessary to veto decisions in the EU Council that have been approved by a qualified majority. HOSPODARSKE NOVINY asked Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana to clarify Madrid's position on this important issue. [Sklenka] Ten EU member states are of the opinion that the number of votes for the so-called blocking minority must be increased in a corresponding manner from the current 23 to 27 along with the enlargement of the Union. This would de facto maintain the present system, since, given the increase in the overall number of votes in the EU Council from 76 to 90, the 27 votes necessary for the minority blocking of decisions would mean the same as the 30 percent of all votes required until now. Why, then, are Madrid and London impeding this logical course of action? [Solana] A question devised in such a manner does not give a true picture of the overall problem of voting. Spain, in essence, agrees with increasing the size of the blocking minority to 27 votes. Nevertheless, it is necessary to take into consideration that the number of votes of the individual countries in the EU Council is determined by the size of their population. Therefore, at the same time, we are trying to stipulate that, if two so-called large countries and one small country join together and these three states reflect the opinion of at least 110 million people, the system of 23 votes should apply as it has done until now. [Sklenka] Spain has been strongly criticized for its national egoism, in view of its uncompromising stance on fishing, which twice held up the EU's negotiations with Norway, and its current unconstructive attitude toward voting rights. Madrid, along with London, is even being described as an obstacle to the creation of a new European architecture. [Solana] Our country has traditionally been one of the main supporters of a united Europe. Only a few states have done as much as Madrid for the formation of the European Union. Our aim is not to slow down the process of closer European integration; we are merely trying to ensure that, given it, Spain's national interests are not neglected. [Sklenka] Nevertheless, some of the world's media are saying, in connection with the negotiations on enlargement, that in order to create a functioning federal Europe, it will be necessary for the Union to ditch countries such as Spain and Greece, which are an intolerable burden. They do not contribute anything to the coffers in Brussels, and they only want greater support. What is your view of such criticism? [Solana] It is not true that we do not contribute anything to the EU budget. Spain is even a net contributor, that is, we put more into the communal coffers than we get back. [Sklenka] In the countries of Central and East Europe, which are interested in becoming fully fledged EU members in the near future, there are -- nevertheless -- anxieties about Spain's possible negative stance on expanding the Union eastward. [Solana] These anxieties are absolutely unfounded. Madrid generally supports the EU's gradual rapprochement with the East European states. The countries of this region must realize, however, that submitting the application itself does not mean anything. The admission of each country is conditional upon fulfillment of a whole series of political prerequisites and macroeconomic indicators. Membership in the Union also means giving up some national sovereignty and being subject to the criteria of the political, economic, and monetary union. Since this requires, among other things, the maximum possible liberalization of the domestic market and the granting of equal rights to domestic enterprises and their foreign competitors, each applicant has to work out in advance what he will gain by such a step and what he will lose by it. As far as the EU is concerned, it will be necessary to reform the institutional structures there further so that, given the larger number of members, the Union maintains its ability to function and operate. It is obvious, therefore, that the two sides have to prepare thoroughly for such a step and time it so that the actual admission of the East European states to the Union brings mutual benefits. The EU's premature expansion toward the east could do the countries there more harm than good.
