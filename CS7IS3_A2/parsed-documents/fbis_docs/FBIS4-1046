The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) had announced the capture of Byumba, about 35 kilometers (20 miles) north of the capital Kigali, the Mutura area in the northeast and part of the eastern Buganza area in radio reports. Pro-rebel Radio Muhabura also claimed that the rebels had made gains in Kigali and surrounded the northwestern town of Ruhengeri, where it said government troops could be "flushed out any time." A UNAMIR spokesman, contacted by telephone from Nairobi, said he could confirm the Byumba capture but there was not enough information to comment on the other claims. "Yes, I can confirm (Byumba), I have seen the reports of our observers," he said, adding that there had been sporadic artillery and small arms fire in Kigali Thursday morning in the eastern part of the city. The spokesman, who asked not to be identified by name, said sporadic small arms and mortar fire were continuing in the eastern party of the capital Thursday. The official Rwandan Army admitted earlier this week that a column of around 1,000 RPF reinforcements passing through the Byumba region had managed to link up with the 600 RPF soldiers stationed in Kigali under the terms of an earlier peace agreement.
