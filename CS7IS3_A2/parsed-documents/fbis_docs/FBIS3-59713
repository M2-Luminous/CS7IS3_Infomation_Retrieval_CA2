Planning Division Director Kuniyo Yamanaka of Aerospace Operation Headquarters, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, has been selected as an acting director of the office. The work began with several staff members beginning preparations for the development/manufacture program and basic design. Originally, the study of development of small engines for the 75-seat YSX was conducted by engine makers such as IHI under contract from Japan Aircraft Development Corporation (JADC). When MITI switched its role as a contractor to a supporter after FY91, JAEC ended up taking charge. JAEC has conducted a feasibility study on overall plans for engine design, cycle, and structure/weight, and has completed the small engine design concept. Intending to promote international efforts to develop the engines, JAEC presented their concept paper to major U.S. and European engine manufacturers for comment. JAEC has conducted market surveys in the United States and Europe and technical evaluation of engine performance and configuration as they pursued and upgraded the program, which started in FY91, in both FY92 and FY93. In addition, they have held discussions with engine manufacturers in the United States and Europe, as part of their effort to internationalize the development program. Decisions have been made on the technical concept and partner selection, on the other hand, on the airframe development program. The Preparatory Office was established to expedite development of the engine area to a level which corresponds to the progress made on the airframe program. MITI has requested Â¥200 million in the FY94 budget for the small engine development study. JAEC will assign the Preparatory Office to conduct a study in FY94 of the development/manufacture program and basic design.
