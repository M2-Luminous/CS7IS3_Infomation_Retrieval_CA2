He said that Shakhray was the only person in the Russian leadership who knew the situation in the regions, for example, in the North Caucasus. Until the last day in power Shakhray headed the Russian delegation at the talks with Chechnya. Avturkhanov believes that Shakhray's dismissal was done by the middle echelons of power in Russia, who are connected with President Dzhokhar Dudayev through oil products and arms. Shakhray was dismissed at the moment when Russia developed a more or less concrete position concerning the ethnic policies, for example, concerning the settlement of relations with Chechnya, said Avturkhanov. Meanwhile, the official Groznyy welcomed with satisfaction Shakhray's resignation. In an interview with Interfax, the Chechen president's aide Soltmurat Alazov said that this should have taken place long ago. The man whose unseemly role is vividly seen in the Ossetian-Ingushi conflict, could not occupy the post of minister for nationalities and regional policies for very long, said the aide.
