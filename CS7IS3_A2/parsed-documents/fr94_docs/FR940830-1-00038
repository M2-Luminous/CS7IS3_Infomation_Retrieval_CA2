FR940830-1-00038 FR940830-1-00005 Failure of the door opening/snubbing actuator, if not corrected, could result in the escape slide failing to deploy, which could delay and possibly jeopardize the successful emergency evacuation of an airplane. The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;25&hyph;0216, dated February 3, 1994, which describes procedures for replacement of currently installed door opening actuators of the off-wing emergency escape system with new, improved actuators. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require replacement of the currently installed door opening actuators of the emergency off-wing escape system on Model 767 series airplanes with new, improved actuators. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. The requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 to inspect the door opening/snubbing actuators of the off-wing escape slide, and modify and inspect the door latching mechanism of the escape slide compartment of Model 767 series airplanes have been retained in this proposal. However, accomplishment of the proposed actuator replacement would constitute terminating action for those requirements. Accordingly, the FAA will, in a separate rulemaking action, revise AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 to remove these requirements for Model 767 series airplanes from that AD. There are approximately 460 Boeing Model 767 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 173 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. The inspections and modification currently required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, and retained in this proposal, take approximately 12 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts cost approximately $510 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these inspections and modification on U.S. operators is estimated to be $146,250, or $1,170 per airplane. The proposed replacement would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $6,400 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed replacement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,126,230, or $6,510 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1.
