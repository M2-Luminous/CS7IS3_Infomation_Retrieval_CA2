The VRS for the time being has no new elements about the incident, in which, according to NATO, four planes were downed. VRS sources reiterated the categorical stand of the VRS General Staff that no VRS planes had taken off from Banja Luka airfield on Monday, and stressed that U.N. military observers had been deployed at the military base near Banja Luka, the only of its kind in the Serb Republic (R.S.) for quite some time. The duty of the U.N. military observers is in fact to monitor the implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolution banning flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina, the same sources recalled. An element which could help the effort to establish whose the four downed planes were could be the report carried by Muslim-held Radio Sarajevo on Monday that Croatian planes had fired missiles at targets in the area of Novi Travnik, central Bosnia, on Monday. The given time of the attack coincided with the time of the air incident given by NATO. Although the circumstances in which the NATO action was launched remain unknown, as does also the identity of the planes which NATO says have been shot down, foreign media rushed to accuse the Bosnian Serbs, alleging that the planes were theirs.
