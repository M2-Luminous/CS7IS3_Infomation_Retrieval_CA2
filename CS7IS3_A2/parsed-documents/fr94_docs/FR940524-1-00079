FR940524-1-00079 FR940524-1-00010 §84.182 Isoamyl acetate tightness test; respirators with replaceable filters; minimum requirements. (a) The applicant shall provide a charcoal-filled canister or cartridge of a size and resistance similar to the filter unit with connectors which can be attached to the facepiece in the same manner as the filter unit. (b) (1) The canister or cartridge will be used in place of the filter unit, and persons will each wear a modified half-mask facepiece for 5 minutes in a test chamber containing 100 parts (by volume) of isoamyl-acetate vapor per million parts of air. (2) The following work schedule will be performed by each wearer in the test chamber: (i) Two minutes walking, nodding, and shaking head in normal movements; and (ii) Three minutes exercising and running in place. (3) The facepiece shall be capable of adjustment, according to the applicant's instructions, to each wearer's face, and the odor of isoamyl-acetate shall not be detectable by any wearer during the test. (c) Where the respirator is equipped with a full facepiece, hood, helmet, or mouthpiece, the canister or cartridge will be used in place of the filter unit, and persons will each wear the modified respiratory-inlet covering for 5 minutes in a test chamber containing 1,000 parts (by volume) of isoamyl-acetate vapor per million parts of air, performing the work schedule specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. §84.183 Airflow-resistance tests. (a) Resistance to airflow shall be measured in the facepiece, mouthpiece, hood, or helmet of a particulate respirator (complete respirator) mounted on a test fixture with air flowing at a continuous rate of 85 liters (3.0 cubic feet) per minute, before each test conducted in accordance with §84.184. (b) The resistances for particulate respirators upon initial inhalation shall not exceed 30 mm water column height (1.18 inch) pressure and upon initial exhalation shall not exceed 20 mm water column height (0.79 inch) pressure. §84.184 Particulate instantaneous-penetration-filter test. (a) Thirty filters of each particulate respirator model shall be tested for instantaneous penetration efficiency against: (1) A solid sodium chloride particulate aerosol as per this section if solid particulate certification only is requested by the applicant. (2) A dioctyl phthalate or equivalent oil liquid particulate aerosol as per this section if both liquid and solid particulate certification is requested by the applicant. (b) Air-purifying elements of the respirators including the element's holders and gaskets; when separable, shall be tested for instantaneous filter leakage as mounted on a test fixture that incorporates the connector in the manner as used on the respirator. (c) Prior to penetration testing, all air-purifying elements of particulate filter respirators shall be taken out of their packaging and placed in an environment of 85 # 5 percent relative humidity at 38 # 2.5 ○C (100 # 4.5 ○F) for 25 # 1 hours. Following the humidity conditioning, filters shall be sealed in a gas-tight container until tested. (d) When the air-purifying elements are not separable, the exhalation valves shall be blocked so as to ensure that leakage, if present, is not included in the filter penetration evaluation. (e) For air-purifying respirators with a single filter, filters shall be penetration tested at a continuous airflow rate of 85 liters (3.0 cubic feet) per minute # 5 percent. Where filters are to be used in pairs, the test-aerosol airflow rate shall be 42.5 liters (1.5 cubic feet) per minute # 5 percent through each filter. (f) Powered air-purifying particulate respirators (PAPRs) shall be penetration tested while operating in their routine operational mode (with fully-charged batteries if they possess battery packs or at normal line voltage, if line-powered). Powered air-purifying respirators with loose fitting facepieces shall be tested in a free-flow mode. Powered air-purifying respirators with tight fitting facepieces shall be tested on a headform connected to a breathing machine operated at a rate of 24 respirations per minute with a minute volume of 40 liters and equipped with a workrate cam of 622 kp-m/min or equivalent breathing device. The airflow of a powered air-purifying respirator will be measured after each of the penetration tests and it shall meet the airflow requirements of §84.185 of this Subpart. (g) Penetration test aerosols. (1) When testing for filter leakage of solid particulate aerosols, a sodium chloride solid aerosol at 25 # 5 ○C (77 # 9 ○F) and relative humidity of less than 30 percent that has been neutralized to the Boltzmann equilibrium state shall be used. Each respirator filter unit shall be challenged with a concentration not exceeding 200 mg/m3. For nonpowered respirators, the penetration test shall continue until maximum penetration is achieved or until an aerosol mass of at least 200 # 5 mg has contacted the filter unit. For powered air-purifying respirators, the penetration test shall continue until maximum penetration is achieved or until a mass of at least 2,000 # 50 mg has contacted the filter unit. (2) When testing for filter leakage of oil liquid particulate aerosols, a dioctyl phthalate (DOP) or equivalent oil at 25 # 5 ○C that has been neutralized to the Boltzmann equilibrium state shall be used. Each respirator filter unit shall be challenged with a concentration not exceeding 200 mg/m3. For non-powered respirators, the penetration test shall continue until maximum penetration is achieved or until an aerosol mass of at least 200 # 5 mg has contacted the filter unit. For powered air-purifying respirators, the penetration test shall continue until a maximum penetration is achieved or until a mass of at least 2,000 # 50 mg has contacted the filter unit. (h) The sodium chloride test aerosol shall have a particle size distribution with count median diameter between 0.06 and 0.11 micrometer and a standard geometric deviation not exceeding 1.86 at the specified test conditions as determined with a differential mobility particle sizer. The liquid particulate test aerosol shall have a particle size distribution with count median diameter between 0.17 and 0.22 micrometer and a standard geometric deviation not exceeding 1.60 at the specified test conditions as determined with a differential mobility particle sizer. (i) The instantaneous penetration of the filter shall be monitored and recorded throughout the test period by a suitable forward-light-scattering photometer or equivalent instrumentation.
