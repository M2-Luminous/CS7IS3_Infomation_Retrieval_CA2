This was revealed by SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo in an interview with SANKEI SHIMBUN on 25 May. If the plan is realized, the party will ask North Korea to refrain from engaging in its alleged nuclear arms development program. It will also call for resumption of talks on normalizing Japan-DPRK relations. Although the SDPJ has been on friendly terms with the Workers Party of Korea, it has stopped sending formal delegations since last August when it joined the coalition as a member of the former Hosokawa administration. But since the SPDJ bolted the coalition and "there are no more restrictions as a ruling party" (according to a SDPJ official), the SDPJ is now holding informal negotiations with North Korea on a plan to send a delegation led by Secretary General Kubo as soon as meetings with President Kim Il-song and other leaders are arranged.
