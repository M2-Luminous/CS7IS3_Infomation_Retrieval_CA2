Before leaving Hanoi for Hue and Ho Chi Minh City on Tuesday 18 January, Gerard Longuet, who headed a delegation of 35 businessmen, said that Vietnam could become "a platform to reexport" French products in the region. French aid to Hanoi for 1994 is around 550 million French francs [Fr], including the Fr85-million contribution to the payment of the Vietnamese debt to the IMF. The rest is divided between Treasury donations and loans (Fr250 million), credits from the French Development Fund (Fr110 million in project contributions), and the cooperation package (Fr108.5 million). The funds allocated between 1990 and 1992 under the three previous financial agreements have been completely exhausted, and those provided by the fourth, signed in Paris on 8 November, should also be exhausted. During a visit to Vietnam from 11 through 13 January, Jacques Chirac expressed the Right's desire to "pursue and develop" the previous governments' Vietnamese policy. This desire to accept the Socialists' legacy is confirmed by the visits announced for the next few months by Jacques Toubon (culture and French-speaking affairs), Simone Veil (social affairs), Edmond Alphandery (economy), and perhaps Francois Fillon (research). Mr. Longuet wanted to give a pragmatic tone to bilateral relations, stating in particular that because of its remoteness, Vietnam could not form France's "backyard." He also stressed that because of the "colossal requirements" for restoring the country's infrastructures, there is room "for everybody" in a Vietnam which has two main advantages, the "will to succeed" and a "large and active" population.
