Attempts to arrange a meeting between the government and the five organizations yesterday at 1500, as well as today at 1200, failed to achieve joint solutions to the problems in the sector, despite calls for such solutions made by His Eminence Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the good offices of the president of the National Assembly, and the secretary general of the Sandinist National Liberation Front. In view of the position assumed by these groups, it is obvious that an internal struggle for leadership prevents them from reaching a satisfactory agreement with the government authorities. Consequently, the Government of the Republic has decided to inform the nation and each of these organizations of the following: 1. To encourage production in general and overall public transportation of passengers and cargo, the price of diesel is established at 7.15 cordobas per gallon, which is the price that existed in July 1993. 2. Prices of the following products are frozen at the current levels until 30 April 1994: regular gasoline, kerosene, butane gas, and diesel, in accordance with Point No. 1. Small trucks used for passengers and freight, as well as taxi drivers with active vehicles organized in legally established cooperatives, will receive a bonus of 1.15 cordobas per gallon of gasoline up to a maximum of six gallons per day. This bonus will be in effect between 1 January and 30 April 1994. The mechanism used to pay this bonus will be regulated according to what has been established in the September 1993 agreements. 4. [number as heard] There will be no charges added onto those currently established for the purchase of license plates, according to Decree 62-93. 5. The Construction and Transportation Ministry will form a commission with all sectors representing the transportation sector to draft a new general transportation bill before 30 April defining the characteristics and duties of the National Transportation Council.
