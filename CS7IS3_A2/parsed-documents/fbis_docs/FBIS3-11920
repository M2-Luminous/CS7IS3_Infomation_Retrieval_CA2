They have taken hostage approximately 30 staff members of the bauxite company Suralco, who were keeping the power station operational. The occupiers are demanding the resignation of the Venetiaan government. Their ultimatum will run out on Tuesday at 10 o'clock local time. The authorities in Paramaribo have not yet reacted to the occupation. The power supply could be cut off at any time, informed Suralco. The company supplies power to the Suriname energy company which provides Paramaribo with electricity. According to an anonymous spokesman for the group, a seven-mile stretch of the road to the dam has been mined. The dam is located on Lake Brokopondo, approximately 100 km from the Surinamese capital. In a telephone call made to a radio station in Paramaribo, one of the Suralco staff members among the hostages said that the occupiers were demanding "the decentralization of power and means of exercising power" and the resignation of the Venetiaan government. "If any weapons are pulled out, then the state will be responsible for the consequences," said the hostage. The "Suriname Liberation Front" is complaining about "economic abuses" and the bad situation regarding education and health care. The group wants the activities of the Canadian Golden Star company to be reviewed. Golden Star recently concluded a contract with the Surinamese Government for gold prospection in the area to the East of the dam.
