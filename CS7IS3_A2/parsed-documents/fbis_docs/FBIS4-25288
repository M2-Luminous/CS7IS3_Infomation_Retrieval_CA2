"Further steps will be taken in the coming days and weeks," said William Gray at a hearing of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. "No options have been excluded. Democracy in Haiti will prevail," Gray said, "neither we nor the Haitian people can long wait for this event." He stressed that the U.S. interest requires the restoration of the democratic process in Haiti and the return of the duly-elected Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Asked if a military intervention in Haiti is imminent, Gray said that "it is not imminent, at this time, that any is being planned other than those diplomatic actions which have been stated." [sentence as received] "Our policy right now is to continue to press with the international community on the sanctions" against Haiti, Gray added.
