"Certain political goodwill should be displayed not only by the Russian side. President Dzhokhar Dudayev should recognise that the Chechen Republic is a subject of the Russian Federation", Shumeyko said in an interview with the "TRUD" newspaper on Tuesday. "As soon as he does it negotiations should immediately begin", the speaker said. Dudayev's election as president of Chechnya was annulled by the former Russian Supreme Soviet. The maverick president proclaimed independence from Russia, however, now Yeltsin had authorised to hold talks with the republic and appointed Nationalities Minister Sergey Shakhray to head the negotiations. Shakhray believes Chechnya should follow suit of Tatarstan and sign a share-power deal with Moscow.
