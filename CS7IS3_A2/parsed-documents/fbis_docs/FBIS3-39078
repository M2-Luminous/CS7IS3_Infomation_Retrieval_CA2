This initiative will enable us to take part in joint military exercises and in NATO peace missions. As Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar stressed before departing by air for Brussels, it is important for Slovakia, within the framework of Partnership for Peace, to try to make the potential of its arms industry available to all-European cooperation. Departing for the Belgian capital with Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Prokes, and Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak, was our editor Agata Stanekova. Here is her first report: [Stanekova] The plane with the Slovak delegation on board landed at Brussels airport at 0900 today. Shortly after arriving at NATO headquarters, Vladimir Meciar and Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak met Sergio Silvio Balanzino, NATO first deputy secretary general. The official proceedings for signing the Partership for Peace document followed. The festive act of signing took place at exactly 1030. [passage omitted] Shortly before the treaty signing, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said that Slovakia is one of the youngest democratic countries in Europe. He said: As a state, you are therefore facing many political and economic changes. Your early decision to participate in Partnership for Peace is a clear indication that you are not limited by your independence. In the world of today, gains from independence can only come in cooperation with others. By signing this document, therefore, you declare that you have opted for cooperation in the name of peace and stability. As Vladimir Meciar said at a brief news conference, by its membership of Partnership for Peace, the Slovak Republic is not only giving but also taking. It is an opportunity to acquire rapidly the principles and methods of building NATO armies. On our part, we are interested in joint planning and in preparing a unit that could serve common actions, if necessary. We are offering our training areas, we would welcome a training center for officers to suit the needs of these units in Central Europe. We are offering our arms industry potential to build the future unified Army of NATO countries. As Vladimir Meciar said, Slovakia understands this plan as the beginning of its journey toward full membership in the alliance. Partnership for Peace guarantees security and opportunity for all and creates scope for preventing two Europes, Vladimir Meciar said.
