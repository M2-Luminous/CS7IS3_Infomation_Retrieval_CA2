Under the plan, licensed mechanics at auto repair shops would be allowed to overhaul and repair major auto components such as driving gear, the sources said. Currently, only government-designated repair shops are allowed to service such components. At the same time, auto repair shops would be encouraged to use generic auto parts, including imports, to end the trade custom of favoring Japanese manufacturer-supplied parts, they said. In Japan, 70 to 80 percent of the auto parts are supplied by Japanese automakers. The government will also consider sending its own inspectors to the United States to expedite inspections on auto imports, the sources said. The auto industry has also started figuring out ways to boost imports and local procurement of auto parts and components, industry sources said. Specifically, domestic automakers will draw up their respective plans to ensure more stable business deals with U.S. parts manufacturers and step up joint development of components with them. Moreover, they will study ways of increasing domestic sales of imported vehicles, the sources said.
