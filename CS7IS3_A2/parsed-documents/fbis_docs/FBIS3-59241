Norway's exports and imports from January to November 1993 have been compared with the figures for the first eleven months of last year. The figures embrace all types of goods, including oil and gas. The trend is that we are trading less with the Nordic area and EFTA [European Free Trade Association], of which we are a member today, and more with the EU [European Union], of which we have applied to become a member. Norwegian exports increased from 198 billion to 206 billion kroner, while imports rose from 147 billion to 154 billion kroner in the first eleven months of last year. In particular, there was no increase in exports to EU countries Britain and the Netherlands. By tradition we have never sold more to anyone than we have to the British, and last year there was an increase of over 3 billion kroner to a total of 51 billion kroner. Another large market for Norwegian goods is Germany. While we have bought a little more from Denmark, exports to Denmark fell by 2 billion kroner -- almost one fifth. Exports and imports to and from Sweden both fell by 1 billion kroner. The import of goods from Asia to Norway increased in value from 18 to 22 billion kroner. Trade with China increased markedly. Norwegian exports to the huge Chinese market almost doubled in a year. But we still buy almost twice as much from the Chinese as well sell to them.
