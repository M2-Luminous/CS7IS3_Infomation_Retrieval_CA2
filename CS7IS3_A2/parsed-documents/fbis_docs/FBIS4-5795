Leaders of three of the seven coalition parties met Thursday evening and agreed not to endorse a package of proposals adopted at an earlier meeting of the coalition's decision-making caucus made up of secretaries general, coalition officials said. The three parties are the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest coalition contingent, and its two allies -- the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and new party Sakigake [Harbinger]. At the gathering of the coalition executives, which Sakigake boycotted, they shared the view that the eight-month-old alliance might collapse if its components reject the agreement, the officials said. The agreement calls on all top leaders of coalition parties to decide by themselves to convene a meeting to discuss the makeup of a new coalition government and the selection of a candidate to replace Hosokawa, the officials said. It also included an accord to resume talks on policy matters toward establishment of the next administration and an appeal for Sakigake, a tiny component of the ruling union, to return to the negotiating table, they said. Sakigake, led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, convened a general meeting Thursday evening of all its 15 House of Representatives members, who unanimously agreed to reject the coalition accord on the reopening of policy talks, party officials said. Sakigake has contended that top party leaders, and not the secretaries general-level representatives, should contemplate a combination of political parties that would comprise the new coalition government and find a successor to Hosokawa. It is widely believed the party's stance is intended to prevent the coalition's main strategist Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), and his ally, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, from dominating policy-making on the choice of a new premier. Under the Hosokawa administration, the personal rivalry between Ozawa and Takemura flared up many times over such key policy issues as political reform, the partial opening of Japan's rice market, and Hosokawa's abortive attempts to impose a new value-added tax called the "National Welfare Tax" and reshuffle the cabinet. In a three-way meeting Thursday morning, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake's Takemura agreed that a forum of all coalition heads should seek a breakthrough in the selection process. The three parties earlier called for a meeting of the coalition leaders, but Shinseito, Komeito and Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) rejected the appeal. Following rejection of the package by the three coalition heads and Sakigake, the deputy chiefs met twice and agreed to allow the SDP and the DSP to take their time to fine-tune opinions within the parties, coalition officials said. The coalition executives will gather again on Friday afternoon, the officials said.
