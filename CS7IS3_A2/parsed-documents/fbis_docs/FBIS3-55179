This is reflected in his "Decree on the Citizens' Right to Information", received by ITAR- TASS on Wednesday [5 January]. The president instructed the commission for legislative proposals to prepare a bill "On the Right to Information", which would be presented to the new parliament as a top priority legislative initiative. Until the adoption of such a law, the decree establishes the duty of all government bodies, organisations, enterprises, public associations, and responsible officials to ensure freedom of information. In particular, the access to information which is of public or personal interest to Russian citizens is guaranteed. The decree stipulates that the essence of decisions taken by government bodies is to be explained more in-depth on radio and television programmes. The state television companies have been ordered to prepare a series of programmes which will explain the activities of federal bodies. One of the decree's points particularly declares that the work of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of power are to be given equal air time.
