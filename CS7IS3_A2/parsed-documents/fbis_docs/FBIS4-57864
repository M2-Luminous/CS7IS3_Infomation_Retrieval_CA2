During a news conference, Figueroa said that "during this phase, we are going to propose establishing a partnership with Mercosur that will allow us to make gradual progress, first within the framework of a broad agreement that will entail not only commercial variables, but also investments and services." Figueroa explained that this does not mean joining Mercosur, and reiterated that Chile cannot become a member of the mentioned bloc because, among other reasons, Chilean customs tariffs are much lower than those of Mercosur, which is composed of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay. Figueroa added that Chile's interest in establishing some sort of partnership with Mercosur is partly due to the importance Chile grants Brazil and Argentina, its third and fourth largest commercial partners respectively, after the United States and Japan. The minister asserted that within this context, it is necessary to perfect an agreement that will preserve the tariff advantages Chile currently enjoys with those two countries. Figueroa explained that in Buenos Aires, he hopes to start negotiations with his Argentine counterpart Guido Di Tella and also with the rest of the Mercosur member countries. The idea is to explore a form of partnership that will be advantageous for all. He added that President Eduardo Frei's government has made a political decision "and we have all received precise instructions to start working on it." Figueroa said Chile took this path after Brazil proposed creating a hemispheric free trade organization and receiving a similar invitation from Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo during his recent visit to Santiago. These proposals have opened a space for us to start working on a sort of partnership with Mercosur, said Minister Figueroa. He reiterated that Chile is all for bilateral and multilateral agreements as long as they contribute to opening trade and new markets and "not locking us into exchange inefficiency."
