Statement by the CPRF: Today, the situation on the Korean peninsula is on the verge of entering into the worst situation. The nuclear commotion being carried out by the United States and its following forces is trying to openly move it toward sanctions against us, and the endless threat and suppression continued by them is making the situation enter into the doors of war. What cannot be overlooked is that the South Korean ruling bunch, who are indiscriminately conspiring with the outside forces at a time when the nation is at the crossroad of life and death, are carrying out rash and thoughtless acts and are making the situation on the Korean peninsula a very acute one. We warned the South Korean authorities not only once or twice of what sanctions mean, which the imperialists are trying to force us into by finding fault with the nonexistent nuclear issue, and what danger it represents if we are involved in the sanctions. Nevertheless, the South Korean ruling bunch are standing at the forefront, more so than the outside forces, and are running amok by blowing the trumpet of sanctions against the fellow countrymen. The South Korean puppet clique that ignored the North-South dialogue and that clung to the so-called international cooperative system, recently all the more persistently begged for sanctions against the North before the masters in the United Nations, Washington, and Tokyo, and is crazily babbling the inevitability of sanctions in the empty sky whenever it opens its mouth. The South Korean ruling bunch is conspiring with the master for UN sanctions and multinational sanctions, and is even hurriedly putting forth its groundless antinational method of sanctions against the North. At the same time, it ordered the whole area of South Korea to be on alert and is unhesitatingly making provocative absurd remarks against us. Looking at all the facts, it is clear that the South Korean ruling bunch is throwing itself into becoming the shock brigade of the anti-Republic maneuver and a servant of war for the master with enthusiasm. Begging for sanctions toward the fellow countrymen to the outside forces means that it attaches greater importance to the allies than the nation. Bringing about a very dangerous situation of war which was not even carried out during the military fascist dictatorial regime before, can by no means be regarded as a civilian-ruled regime. It was all the more clearly revealed that the South Korean ruling bunch is a group of nation sellers entrusting the nation's fate to the outside forces through its acts, and a civilian-ruled fascist group pursuing war by wearing the mask of a civilian-ruled regime. We cannot but worry about the national misfortune and calamity which can be committed anytime by the crazy rascals running amok in accordance with the interest of the outside forces. This is not an issue limited to the North or the South, and also it is not an issue regarding the one side's ideology and system. This is an issue of the life and death of 70 million people transcending differences in region, ideology, and system of the North and South. If the nation's interest is put in the forefront and regards the nation's existence as the source, no one can gamble with this important issue, and must not make a foolish thought of trying to gain interest through this gamble. Sanctions mean war, and there is no mercy in war. There is no greater miscalculation to think that they will be safe if they carry out sanctions toward the fellow countrymen by conspiring with outside forces. With the least expectation, if Kim Yong-sam dares to move toward the road of adventure, this will mean his end. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must correctly know that the United States, its master, and the Patriot missiles, which it dragged in, cannot protect him, and act with discretion.
