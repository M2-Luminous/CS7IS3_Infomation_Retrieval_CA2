FR940727-0-00029 FR940727-0-00013 COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION 17 CFR Part 1 Risk Disclosure by Futures Commission Merchants, Introducing Brokers, Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors to Customers AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is amending Appendix A of CFTC rule 1.55(c) adopted by the Commission on June 28, 1994, to identify the United Kingdom and Ireland as additional jurisdictions whose relevant regulatory authorities have adopted the generic risk disclosure statement for specified products. This order is issued pursuant to the Commission's recent rulemaking amending, among other provisions, CFTC rule 1.55(c), 59 FR 34376 (July 5, 1994), to permit registrants to deliver to customers a two-page generic risk disclosure statement that may be used to satisfy the CFTC's risk disclosure requirements applicable to domestic and foreign commodity futures and commodity options, and which also is intended to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements of certain foreign jurisdictions. The Commission noted that it would on a periodic basis, update the listing of those jurisdictions that accept the generic risk disclosure document as meeting specified disclosure requirements. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jane C. Kang, Esq., Division of Trading and Markets, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581; telephone (202) 254&hyph;8955. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On June 28, 1994 the Commission amended rules 1.55(c), 33.7(a) and 190.10(c) to permit registrants to deliver to customers a generic risk disclosure statement contained in new Appendix A of CFTC rule 1.55(c), which satisfies risk disclosure statement requirements contained in CFTC rules 1.55(b), 33.7(b) and 190.10(c) as well as the special disclosure requirement related to futures-style margining of the options premium permitted on certain foreign exchanges. As the generic statement was developed in cooperation with various international regulators and is intended to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements of certain foreign jurisdictions who have implemented the language of this risk disclosure statement in their jurisdictions in accordance with their domestic law, Appendix A specifies those jurisdictions that permit the use of the generic risk disclosure statement and the products for which the statement may be used. The CFTC noted that it would amend Appendix A on a periodic basis to provide updated information in this regard. Subsequent to the publication of the generic risk disclosure statement in the Federal Register , the United Kingdom Securities and Futures Authority (``SFA'') and the Central Bank of Ireland (``CBI'') on July 11, 1994 confirmed the conclusion of applicable national procedures to permit the statement to be used to satisfy relevant risk disclosure obligations within their jurisdictions. The generic risk disclosure statement addresses, in the case of members of the United Kingdom SFA, commodity futures, options on commodity futures, options on commodities and options on securities, and in the case of members of exchanges whose rules have been approved by the CBI, financial futures and options on financial futures. Accordingly, the CFTC is amending Appendix A to reflect the addition of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland as jurisdictions in which the generic risk disclosure statement may be used to satisfy relevant risk disclosure requirements for the products specified. Finally, the Commission is clarifying the entry for the United States in Appendix A to conform the text in the entry to the text of the Federal Register preamble.
