Who Is To Blame This Time?''] [Text] The Kiev Kharkivskyy Rayon People's Court has begun to consider the case of violations of radiation safety rules and norms during the reburial in 1988 of radioactive waste from the territory of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Nuclear Studies Institute at a burial site that belonged to a special combine of a specialized production association subordinated to the former Ukrainian SSR Ministry of Communal Services (currently the Ukrainian state association ``Radon''). The cooperative ``Dozimetrist,'' which included scientists from the Nuclear Studies Institute, Kiev State University, and the city sanitary-epidemic station, acted as a mediator between the Nuclear Studies Institute and the special combine. As a result of the investigation, which lasted one year, it is believed that violation of rules during the transportation and burial of the waste created the threat of dangerous irradiation for Kiev's population. The former deputy general director of the specialized production association and the chief of the radioactive waste burial site are accused of these violations.
