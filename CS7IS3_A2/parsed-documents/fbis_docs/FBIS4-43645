Representatives of the Austrian Petroleum Corporation [OeMV] and GWH [expansion unknown] (the joint subsidiary of the OeMV and the Russian foreign trade organization for the sale of gas, Gazexport) signed a delivery contract worth approximately 30 billion schillings with Gazexport, a subsidiary of the partly privatized Russian gas concern Gazprom. Until 31 December 2012, 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas are to be supplied annually, which is to flow through Slovakia to the switching point in Baumgarten. The newly drafted delivery contracts I to III (contract IV covering another 2.5 billion cubic meters is drafted on a more long-term basis) will become effective on 1 July 1994. "The conditions have not changed basically," Christoph Hiller, who is responsible for gas supplies within the OeMV, stressed. Austria has been purchasing gas from Russia for about 25 years. Overall annual imports from Russia currently stand at about 5 billion cubic meters. To broaden the basis of imports, the purchase of Norwegian gas was started at the end of 1993. The initial quantity of 300 million cubic meters per year will triple to 1 billion cubic meters by the year 2002. Austria has an option for another 500 million cubic meters. [passage omitted]
