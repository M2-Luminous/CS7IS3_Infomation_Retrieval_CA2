FBIS3-53210 "drnes008_r_94007" FBIS-NES-94-008 Document Type:Daily Report 12 Jan 1994 India Clinton Letter to KAC Director Criticized BK1201111194 Delhi INDIAN EXPRESS in English 7 Jan 94 p 1 BK1201111194 Delhi INDIAN EXPRESS Language: English Article Type:BFN [By Bharat Bhushan in Washington] [Text] The Kashmir issue seems set to further strain Indo-US ties with a letter sent by President Bill Clinton to the head of a pro-Pakistan, pro-militant organisation of Kashmiri Americans referring to human rights violations in Kashmir and offering to work with them "to bring peace to Kashmir." The letter, written on December 27 to Ghulam Nabi Fai of the Kashmiri American Council (KAC), could not have come at a more inopportune time. It comes in the wake of Clinton's raising the Kashmir issue in the UN, the US flip-flop on the Instrument of Accession and the failure of the Indo-Pak talks. (India reacted to the letter by hoping the US would not ignore gross human rights violations committed by terrorists in Kashmir, aided and abetted by Pakistan, while thinking of peace in the Valley. "We are committed to strengthening the institutions relevant to the upholding of human rights in India," an official said). The Clinton letter seems to recognise Fai as an interlocutor in the Kashmir dispute. India would find this particularly objectionable as Fai's organisation is widely believed to be funded by Pakistan and is seen as promoting instability in Kashmir. Fai has made a career out of lobbying against India in US Congress and that is what he gets paid for as KAC executive director. India can, therefore legitimately ask why a US President should write to him that he looks forward to working with him. Fai speaks for people seen as terrorists by most Indians and this is bound to raise questions about where the US stands on terrorism when it does not threaten its own citizens directly. All the State Department would say about the letter was that it was consistent with the US policy of being willing to assist India and Pakistan on Kashmir. The US -- an official said reiterating the Clinton Administration's stand -- does not see itself as a mediator unless it is requested for by both nations. Clinton's letter should be seen in that context, he said. Before getting all hot and sweaty about the letter, it may be pertinent to take a few deep breaths and note that he does not even get to see the thousands of letters he receives and which are responded to with his name appended to them. A lot of people write to Clinton just as any other head of state and a number of them receive responses. The response to Fai's letter is fairly innocuous at one level and in all likelihood drafted by some bleeding-heart liberal in White House who has no intention of striking one more blow to Indo-US relations. But this is merely the mechanics of how the letter would have got written. When his name is appended to a letter those responsible for doing so have to be more sensitive about the contents. After Clinton's infamous reference to Kashmir in the UN and the brouhaha following Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel's statement on the Instrument of Accession one would have thought the US Administration would be more careful. In all fairness after the Raphel statement, the State Department took a reasonable public position. But the White House staff seems to work with its own agenda. And this letter is an example.
