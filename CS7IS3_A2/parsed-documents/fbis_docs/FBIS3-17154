The businesslike relations of military partnership between the Republic of Belarus and the United States began to take shape in 1992. The first steps on this path were taken during the visit to the United States by Alyaksandr Tushynski, first deputy defense minister of the Republic of Belarus. By then, an agreement on dealing with the aftermath of an emergency situation and the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction was signed between our two countries. Belarusian and U.S. military specialists are discussing the relative directions of military cooperation, including such issues as conversion, control over the export of radioactive materials, the training of servicemen, and the creation of working groups to coordinate military cooperation. William Perry was received today by Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Kozlovskiy and Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. Later in the day, the U.S. secretary of defense will visit the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. It is planned that the visit will result in the signing of a joint agreement on the principles of a Belarusian-U.S. committee for conversion.
