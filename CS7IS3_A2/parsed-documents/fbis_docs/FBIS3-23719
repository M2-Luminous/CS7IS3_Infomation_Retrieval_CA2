One of them is that [some of] our kindred, living in foreign countries, have returned home. We have also opened paths of communications and relationships with some [others]. Due to such possibilities, I returned to the Ile Kazakh Autonomous Oblast in the Chinese People's Republic. In fact, seeing with my own eyes was better than hearing about things there. In order to make known to people what came to mind there, I have written this article. I acquainted myself somewhat with the living conditions of our kinsmen in a neighboring country. Most were involved with individual enterprise. One receives gain according to how one works. The results are in one's own hands. They are dependent upon one another. There is no disorder. They began to move along that favorable road at the end of the 1970s. It is no secret that up until that time they witnessed unheard of things and suffered repeated difficulties, and we witnessed how they, exhausted, took weak steps towards a new life. Most of the marks of great suffering are still not wiped from their hearts. However, the Kazakh people who have survived all that and have left their suffering behind them, are not bad off today. There are sufficient numbers of rich Kazakhs raising large herds of horses and other fat livestock. Each person does the best they can. There are no limits to livestock raising and each raises as many as he can. The amount of land available for use decreases with each passing year. By law each person is to receive 2 mu of land. How is the term mu to be understood? I asked. In your terms there are 16 mu to a hectare. Thus eight persons must be fed from the products of a hectare of land. That is very little land. We are not made to suffer difficulty. Products of animal husbandry are numerous. We have our summer pastures and our winter pastures. They are unsuited for growing grain; they are mountain defiles and sloping areas. However, they are exceptional places for raising livestock. There are many places where the richest, most nourishing grass is abundant, thus, answered Qudaybergen Sarsenbayuly, a thirty-three-year-old relative of mine serving as a leader. Qudaybergen, after a pause, contined: if one sows seed in the proper time in the new lands and takes care of the crop, it will be completely adequate for no one even if harvested without loss. If one is inattentive and lazy, you will not have enough food no matter what, and you will be dependent on someone else. ...The dazzling crops around us waved like the ocean. The grains of wheat growing without weeds excited us involuntarily. Economical use and respect for the land had become a good tradition. At the time of the spring sowing and during the autumn harvest they are incomparable. However, they provide nothing whatever during the rest of the time. The festivals and the visiting go on during those times. During the years you see the good and the bad as a leading official (equivalent to the combined jobs of sovkhoz director and of a party organization secretary). What do you think of the current way of life? I asked again. Indeed, when I came on the scene it was a time of want and of poverty. The difficulty was not just mine, the entire people were suffering. Alas, our Kazakhs were in a sorry state! We were suffering completely intolerable difficulties. God willing, now the character of life has changed and things are easy for the people. In front of us there were more than a hundred horses and cattle and nearly a thousand smaller livestock. I think that our present way of life is good. It is a time when each person believes in his own honest labor. No one is trying to cheat or intimidate us. I now have nearly 70 horses and cattle, and something like 300 smaller livestock. Other than income [tax] paid to the government, I have no other loss. However, I was unable to get all of my livestock safely through the winter without loss. I know what the problem was. There is no one who can order me to increase my livestock to a thousand or to decrease their numbers. For that reason, I bought 30 head of horses and cattle and as many smaller livestock as I needed. One sets one's own level of profit. I see my labor solely in terms of productivity. Under the old system I herded the government's livestock, and for this purpose the government had to provide enclosures, hay, and a monthly salary. Transportation was given to the officials set over me, and I had to pay them a monthly salary. That is all gone today. The government expends no funds whatever for me. I myself prepare food for the livestock and build enclosures. He paused as if he was thinking about something else. Your situation is good. Your children have shoes, you have a livelihood. People notice when people are living well. A person still has his hopes. What is your hope now? I asked very directly. Indeed there is no one without his hopes. One thing, which is not just my hope but the hope of all Kazakhs, is returning to the homeland. If we can face Mecca [to pray] on the soil of our ancestors, all our hopes will be fulfilled. Thus saying, he stopped abruptly, his eyes filled with tears, and he wept loudly before finishing his words. The people, collected at the head of the table, went on droning a song mixed with tears as if approving of the words of some aqsaqal [Kazakh elder]. The songs were beautiful, the words pleasant. They are sufficient testimony to the longing for the homeland. The questions coming from all directions, the words of cheer pronounced to our kinsmen moved us profoundly. One was confused by the number of people invited without ceremony into their houses as guests. They went and got eighty-six-year-old aqsaqal Nesipbay mentioned at one point in the conversation. He was born in Taldyqorghan oblast, Sarqant Rayon, the present Energiya Kolkhoz. Calling to mind his country and the place where he had grown up, he wept loudly. He read a poem of 50 verses dedicated to President Nazarbayev and to the independence of our country and set many questions in motion. He was in service as an old man, and had seen a great deal of life. He was an aqsaqal capable of making an impression with words. He listened to some, and others listened to him. He said: We are not looking for land. If the two countries come to an agreement, we will move on our own and will have our own resources to return to our country. The education of all of us, old and young, has been his work. Work has raised us all. We will not cause the government any difficulty. We promise that we will flourish through our own labor. All we need is a place with water. Farming and livestock raising, those are our traditional occupations. We have no great interest in technology. What we believe in is the power of our own knowledge, he said, summarizing what was in the minds of many. All joined in these words. It had been some time since the law limiting childbirth had gone into force in China. Chinese women could give birth to one child, Uighur women up to two, Kazakh women up to four. The law was one thing. In connection with the law, it appeared that reduction in female births among the Chinese was leading to uncertain attitudes. Harm to our demographic numbers will be observed in the future with the implementation of the Internationalist policy. The Muslim people in China thought this aspect [of Chinese policy] a great danger. Everyone agreed that for a period of 10-15 years there has been no pressure or harm whatever inflicted on us. However, the future of our children's children will be restricted. Life itself has shown them this. During the middle 1960s there was little movement in the territory of the Ile Kazakh Autonomous Republic, but now the times are different. With each passing year the number of people in the interior areas is tilting in favor the Chinese, and the land is growing narrow, he said. In some areas Muslim graveyards have been completely destroyed and large villages build over the top. Thus, all these manifestations were greatly disturbing our kinsmen in China. The independence of the Republic was a great joy for them. If they did not rejoice more than we, they rejoiced no less. All those who came brought livestock for slaughtering. They were agreeable and wished us happiness. Their hope is that Kazakhstan prospers; that the dispersed Kazakhs will be able to return to their native land; and that they be allowed to walk in their native country. In this connection several words of complaint were uttered unintentionally. They said: We are all happy that relations between the two countries have been placed on a good basis. For some unknown reason it is extremely difficult to establish connections with our own country. The Chinese pass quickly. They get their documents in good order in no more than a month. We, on the other hand, get frozen in the ice, and it takes two-three years. And, if we do anything wrong, that is the end of it. Thus, our longing for our country becomes grief. Our attempts do not go forward. In truth, there are those of our countrymen who find their way going back and forth. However, if we compare their numbers to those of the Chinese, it is one ear of wheat in the barley [a drop in the bucket]. For the Chinese it is nothing special if 50-60 million go to Kazakhstan and then return. In their [the Chinese Kazakhs] view, there is great danger in the growth of Chinese numbers in Kazakhstan, and it seems that in three-four years there will be pressure to turn Kazakhstan into their [the Chinese] country. They [the Chinese] are a people who love to work, who endure hunger, and who do not care about where they live or sleep. If we do not stop the flood coming to Kazakhstan now, there is no doubt that they will overcome us in 10-15 years. Our kinsmen in the Ile Kazakh Autonomous Oblast and the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Rayon are now suffering this. They greatly emphasized one thing. Those who come exhausted and hungry recover and begin to get rich in one-two years. Leaving other things aside, the broad steppes, the rivers, and the lakes would be very convenient for them. The wild game and birds, the small animals of the rivers and lakes, all the various kinds of plants (weed or not) will be put to use by them without distinction. The steppe and the high snowy mountains will be ideal for them. For that reason, we must be very careful about this. There is nothing wrong with how they speak. They have kept the Kazakh language pure. The art of the aytys [poets contest] among them is amazing. Courteous young women and men use words correctly, and reply to each other with clever expressions. When they sing to one another it makes you want to listen and listen. The young people never passed directly in front of the old man. Whatever the circumstances, the place of honor belongs to the old man. The dedication of sisters and daughters-in-law, in particular, to the good of the adult males is completely natural. The policy for taking them into the Army is altogether different than with us. That is to say, the population is so large that only three-four persons among the inhabitants of a rayon enter the Army. Thus, there are quite a number competing for these positions, and the ones with the most potential are accepted. To draw some final conclusions, it is difficult to express in words the love of our Kazakh kinsmen in the Chinese Peoples Republic for Kazakhstan, their pride and faith in the future. They rejoice in our achievements and grieve with us in our failures. In addition to this, they are a people of genuineness and good intentions who place peace above everything. The primary hope is to return to their homeland. Ready to use every opportunity, thinking that their hopes are near fulfillment, they comfort one another as they send me on my way. May your hopes be fulfilled, I said returning home.
