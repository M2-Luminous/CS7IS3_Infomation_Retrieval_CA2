The number of projects launched this year is not likely to be much more than last year's 129, according to Chaiyot Santiwong, director of the Northern Region Investment Promotion Office. This is because of government policy, particularly decentralisation of growth to the provinces, and promotional privileges for the rural zone three. "Low interest rates, the plan to set up a new industrial estate in Phichit, economic cooperation with Thailand's neighbouring countries and low labour costs have boosted the economy," he said. Interest-rate levels and government stability have made the country more attractive to international investors, he said. The global economy is improving slightly, especially in the United States, and the economic and trade policies of former socialist countries have changed positively: Mr Chaiyot sees opportunities for public service infrastructure, hotel, residential building and environmental preservation projects in Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Lamphun and Lampang. In the lower northern provinces, promotional privileges will assist machinery, metal and other industries. "The establishment of a new industrial estate in Phichit is intended to stimulate competition in the lower North," he said. The Board of Investment's [BoI's] northern office forecast about 8 percent growth for the northern region this year, compared to 1993's 7.8-7.9 percent. Last year was seen as a golden time for investment in the North he said. The BoI-approved plans involved total investment of about 1,000 million baht. These created 25,038 jobs. In 1989, which was seen as a good year, there were 73 projects worth a total of 11,273 million baht. These created 18,208 jobs. In 1992, only 32 schemes were approved with a total investment of 4,267 million baht. These created 8,749 jobs. Last year, 100 projects (77.5 percent) were located in the upper North and 29 (22.5 percent) were in the lower North. Thirty-four projects were in Chiang Mai, 30 in Lamphun, 15 in Tak, 10 in Lampang and eight in Chiang Rai. Seven projects were in Nakhon Sawan and five in Phetchabun. Mr Chaiyot said 35 industrial projects, mostly involving mines, ceramics and metal production, had a combined cost of 2,688 million baht and created 4,388 jobs. These factories are in Tak, Chiang Mai and Lampang. Twenty-seven projects involved garments, textiles, shoes and ornaments with a combined cost of 597 million baht. These created 7,886 jobs and are mostly in Chiang Mai, Lamphun or Chiang Rai. Twenty-one projects were related to infrastructure and services, 19 were agro-industrial factories, 15 were electronics factories, nine involved metal production, machinery, equipment and tools, and three involved petrochemical industries paper and plastics. Promotional privileges were granted for projects costing a total of 1,795 million baht aimed at the export markets. These created 5,583 jobs. Mr Chaiyot said Thais spent a total of 7,138 million baht on 92 projects in the North last year. These created 18,777 jobs. Twelve projects involving foreigners cost a total of 753 million baht and employed 1,768 people. These factories were owned by Japanese, European, US, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korean interests. Twenty-five projects were joint ventures between Thais and foreigners. These cost 1480 million baht and created 4,513 jobs, Mr Chaiyot said.
