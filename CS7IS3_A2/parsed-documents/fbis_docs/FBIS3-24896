They said that those acquitted on Monday by Kampala's chief magistrate Yorokamu Bamwine included Uganda's former prime minister Abraham Waliggo, who then headed the state-owned Ugandan Airlines Corporation (UAC), two pilots Stephen Makyeri and Rogatiano Mugisha, and loadmaster David Nsubuga. But a fifth accused, Captain Jack Calnan, would continue standing trial for abuse of office. At the time of the incident, UAC officials denied that the plane, which had been leased from Aviation Leasing Groups (ALG) of Kansas City in the United States, "was on Ugandan Airlines business when it was caught smuggling arms to Yugoslavia and impounded by the Yugoslav authorities". The officials maintained that the ALG and UAC had agreed to temporarily suspend the lease between August 15 and October 15 because the Uganda flag carrier did not need the plane during that period. Under the agreement the Ugandan pilot Stephen Makyeri and his five compatriot crew members were to be retained by ALG during the period the lease was in suspension, the officials said. Consequently, the plane left Uganda on August 29, 1991 for Gaborone in Botswana, but was diverted to the nominally-independent South African homeland of Bophuthatswana, where a Canadian citizen of Yugoslav origin, Anton Ikac, who had a Ugandan Airlines ticket, apparently boarded the plane and arms were loaded, the officials recounted. It returned to Uganda's Entebbe international airport two days later carrying what was described as "technical cargo", taking off from Entebbe on the next day, but was forced to land at Zagreb in Yugoslavia, where it was found to be carrying 19 tonnes of arms and ammunition. According to the officials, money for refuelling the plane at Entebbe airport appeared to have been remitted to the Uganda branch of the British multi-national oil company, Shell-BP, from abroad, heightening suspicions here that senior officials of Uganda airlines were in on the deal. A South African arms maker denied having supplied arms to separatists in the Yugoslav republic of Croatia as had then been claimed in a report in the London weekly SUNDAY TIMES.
