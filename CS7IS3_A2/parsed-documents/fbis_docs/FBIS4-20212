But the latest Confederation of British Industry [CBI] quarterly industrial trends report showed a weakening in business confidence and investment intentions, and still more job losses to come in manufacturing industry. Government ministers will draw comfort from the CBl's evidence of continuing economic recovery and from the unusual statement by the CBI that business would prefer policy stability rather than any further cuts in interest rates -- particularly if they were small and likely to be reversed. The Treasury saw the findings of the April trends survey as encouraging, and in line with the general picture of an improving economy. Officials pointed in particular to positive signs on exports. They thought, too, that the 14-point slide in business confidence largely reflected the changed timing of the Budget and to some extent the impact of the April tax rises. But City analysts saw the CBI findings as disappointing, especially since April traditionally sees a seasonal surge in confidence. But the CBI stressed that the survey of 1,219 companies, accounting for about half the UK's manufacturing employment and exports, indicated continued recovery. The survey's main findings included: l. Confidence. The balance of firms declaring an increase in optimism fell back from 27 to 13 per cent. The usual April upturn did not occur for the first time in a decade. 2. Output. Expectations of increased output remain at a high level -- at a balance of 16 per cent, the fastest rate of increase since April 1989. The CBI said its figures pointed to a growth of 0.8 per cent in manufacturing output over the second half of this year. 3. Orders. Demand is expected to continue rising at its current rate; a net balance of 16 per cent of companies reported higher orders. 4. Exports. Export orders rose slightly more quickly than in the four months to January, and a balance of 18 per cent of companies forecast that they will continue to rise over the next four months. 5. Investment. The balance of firms planning to invest more slipped back from 7 per cent in January to 4 per cent. Kate Barker, CBI chief economics adviser, said: "The lack of strength in investment is worrying for the Government." The proportion of companies saying they are working below capacity is slightly up. 6. Jobs. Manufacturing firms are still pointing to a fall in employment, in contrast to government figures. CBI officials said a further 28,000 job losses were predicted for the second quarter.
