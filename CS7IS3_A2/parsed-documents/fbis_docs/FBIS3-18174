The new word coined a few years ago, which also means the "bloody extraction" of 5,000 drachmas from all passengers using Greek airports. The logic for levying this new tax was that its proceeds would finance the construction of new airports in Spata and elsewhere. However, as is common in our country, voices were raised, protests were made, but the "Spata-stamp" became a reality. Passengers no longer object--because airlines have dropped their prices in the competition war--and someone is collecting the money. Additionally, while the funds should have been used for the new airport, its construction is still "on paper." Indeed, the government is beginning to have second thoughts and is pondering whether to renegotiate the contract terms with the present bidders, announce a new bidding procedure, or undertake the financing itself. [passage omitted] However, today's problem is not the construction of the airport, but the fate of the "Spata-stamp" money. The question may be naive, for everyone is aware that the budget--or, rather, the "Black Hole"--swallows up everything. However, there is a small difference in the case of the "Spata-stamp." Who gets its proceeds? Is it the government, Olympic Airlines, income tax offices, or the Bank of Greece? And if the "Spata-stamp" went to cover the "Black Hole" of the budget, Greeks would reluctantly accept it, accustomed as they are to special taxes for "earthquake victims," the lack of water, or any other reason. But if the "Spata-stamp" disappears into the six "holes" of Olympic Airlines (read the six circles forming its trademark), then things are different, because the state is giving money to a bankrupt company; but this is money collected for a specific purpose. In plain Greek, a new tax is levied under the pretext of financing one project, when in reality it is intended to cover the losses of a state company. The futility of the obligation of all Greeks to pay taxes is demonstrated once again, since the tax is being diverted into something else. Greeks thus become a laughing stock, and politicians have the audacity to expect that people will pay their taxes. Pray tell us, dear minister of finance, why should we pay? To see our money swallowed up into the six holes of Olympic Airlines? Or pay for the civil servants who are dismissed and immediately rehired by the state? Especially at a time when the underground economy--condemned, at least verbally, by ministers and politicians alike--is laundering hundreds of billions into government bonds which, to make matters worse, are untaxed? Don't politicians--regardless of parties--and the mass media understand that if the state does not correct itself, stopping these games and lies, Greeks will not cease resorting to tax evasion? Of course, there are many who snigger because Greeks feel "euphoric" when they successfully avoid paying taxes. But this is a lucrative game! Unfortunately, though, the issue is not only the "Spata-stamp." The minister of energy recently revealed that 4,326 workers left the Greek Power Corporation (DEl) in the last three years, but 11,073 were hired; that is, 6,747 individuals were added to the payroll, mainly as "typists," "janitors," and "secretaries," at a time when coal mines lack technicians and specialized workers. As the minister put it, DEl is now burdened with an additional 20 billion drachmas for "redundant" workers. And of course, we shall soon be asked to pay higher energy prices. Let us hope that the mustachioed individual pretending to be a minister and savior of Olympic Airlines decides to inform Greek payers of the "Spata-stamp" of where the money is going, how much of it there is and which hole is swallowing it.
