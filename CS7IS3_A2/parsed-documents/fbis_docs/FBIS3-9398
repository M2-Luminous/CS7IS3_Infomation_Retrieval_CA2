The production should be launched this year. In this context, it is also advancing the offer of cooperation to the RDP [Research, Development, Production] Group, the association of Czech arms manufacturers. This transpired from an interview given by Peter Koncier, director of ZTS Dubnica nad Vahom, to a CTK correspondent yesterday. According to information provided by Koncier, ZTS Dubnica expects an overall increase of its special production this year. The increase will be secured by the production of a trial run of the 155-mm howitzer code-named "Zuzana," which conforms to NATO specifications. It will come, in part, also from the expected growth in sales of spare parts and from the modernized tank turret. The modernization of the tank turret, which has been virtually completed, concerns the control systems, the night-vision system, the firing-control system, and the like, Koncier said.
