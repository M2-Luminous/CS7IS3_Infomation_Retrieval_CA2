The following are the main points of his speech. Statistics According to Mr. Pasqua, from April 1993 to March 1994, the overall increase in crimes and misdemeanors in metropolitan France "was a mere 0.47 percent." Mentioning as an example car thefts and crimes on the public highway, he explained that the former "fell by 3.1 percent" while the latter "increased by a modest 1.1 percent." Furthermore, and "this is the first time it happens in 20 years, violent thefts went down 0.12 percent," he indicated. Mr. Pasqua said these figures were "encouraging if one looks at the 34 percent overall increase in crime in the years 1989-1992, a figure that reaches 54 percent for crime on the public highway and even 67 percent for armed robberies." In his view, this means that "the spiral is conclusively broken." Drugs Drug trafficking "decreased by four percent" over the last 12 months. To demonstrate "intensive police activity," Charles Pasqua indicated that 6,070 dealers, 55 percent of whom were foreigners, and 6,289 users-dealers had been arrested and subjected to legal proceedings. Last, "for the first time in France in 10 years, there was a decline in deaths by overdose: 454 compared with 499."
