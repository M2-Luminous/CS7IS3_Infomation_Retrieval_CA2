The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries a 1,000-word article by reporter Pak Tu-sik on page 3 which welcomes the ``simple and clear'' demand for North Korea's allowance of additional nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, made in the recent Seoul talks between the ROK and the United States. The article reports: ``It seems that, for the time being, the United States and the ROK will concentrate their efforts on creating an atmosphere for North Korea to allow additional inspections by the IAEA.'' The article reports that ``the United States will strongly demand that South and North Korea hold a dialogue on implementing the declaration on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula'' and conduct bilateral nuclear inspection after the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks, ``which will likely be held in Geneva in May as soon as the IAEA inspection team enters North Korea if North Korea meets the IAEA demand.'' The article also expects that ``the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Committee will be held if the North Korea-IAEA and North Korea-U.S. dialogue is successfully held'' and that ``this will make progress in resolving the nuclear issue.'' The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries a 400-word article by Chong Pyong-chin on page 1 which reports that in the 18 April talks, the ROK ``asked the United States to propose a contact with North Korea first'' and that the United States said it ``will consider proposing to North Korea to hold a contact before the end of this week.'' The article concludes by noting that ``it is highly possible for North Korea and the United States to hold a contact in New York sometime this week.'' The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries a 900-word article by Pak Chong-mun on page 2 on the result of the talks between Robert Gallucci and ROK Government officials. While reporting that the ROK and the United States ``failed to make any clear decision'' on the nuclear issue, the South-North dialogue, and the U.S.-North Korea talks, the article notes as a ``tangible result'' of the talks that the ROK and U.S. authorities ``have shared the view that the U.S.-North Korea talks and South-North dialogue should be promoted in a harmonious way of complementary cooperation.'' Pointing out the ``inevitability of sharing a view on South-North dialogue between the ROK and the United States'' because of the linkage between South-North dialogue and the U.S. interests, the article stresses additional agreements on South-North dialogue must be reached between the ROK and the United States if North Korea allows additional nuclear inspections. The article expects no tangible result for resolving the nuclear issue from U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry's upcoming visit to the ROK, noting the ``flexible situation'' regarding this issue. The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO also carries reporter Kang Yong-chin's 1,000-word article expecting that a working-level contact will be held between the United States and North Korea before the end of this week. Citing an unidentified government official's remarks, the article reports that the United States will no longer allow North Korea to ``attempt to stall for time'' since, through repeated negotiations with North Korea, the United States is now able to easily grasp North Korea's intent.
