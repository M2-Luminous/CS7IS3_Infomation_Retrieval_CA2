The U.S. official arrived on 13 May (his visit is part of a trip that will take him to Brazil on 17 May and finally to Mexico). He also met with President Carlos Menem, Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, and with the Senate and Chamber of Deputies Agriculture Committees. Espy and Sola termed their talks as "excellent and fruitful." The Argentine official insisted on the global need to eradicate dumping [preceding word in English] and subsidies. "I told Espy that maintaining our share of the Brazilian market is our main concern," said Sola, adding: "We asked for political priority in sanitary and phyto-sanitary [sanitarios y fitosanitarios] fields." Sola indicated that on 6 June a "high level" U.S. delegation will visit the country to study the phyto-sanitary situation and the conclusions of this delegation will be decisive in the purchase of Argentine beef by the United States. [sentence as received] [passage omitted] Espy's remarks have a political interpretation because Argentina currently maintains a strong tug-of-war with the United States over the Pharmaceutical Patents Law. On several occasions, U.S. Ambassador James Cheek has supported a solomonic decision: Patents for subsidies. [passage omitted]
