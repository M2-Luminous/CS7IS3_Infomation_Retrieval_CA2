The implementation mechanism of the agreement's first nine items, signed by Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Saskavets on 30 April has, as a matter of fact, come into force. It provides, the press secretary underlined, for removal of customs duties on all types of Belarusian-Russian goods that represent more than 30 percent of their costs. Uladzimir Zamyatalin noted that Belarusian products will become competitive on the Russian and CIS markets if their costs are reduced by one-third. As early as May and June, orders received by enterprises and sale of products that jammed warehouses will tangibly influence the Belarusian economy. "According to commitments stemming from the agreement," the press secretary said, "the Republic will soon receive from the Russian side 200 billion rubles in credits to stabilize the Belarusian financial system, as well as to level out prices and the average salary. With the first part of the signed agreement taking effect, the Belarusian Government can start improving a program designed to stabilize the national economy in 1994-95, and undertake a range of social protection measures. In particular, the decision allowing pensioners to ride suburban trains free of charge is a part of those measures."
