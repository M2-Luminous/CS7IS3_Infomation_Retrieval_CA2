It should be noted that so far only three branch plants of large state enterprises have been privatized. There was a time when the republic, having adopted the Law "On Privatization of Land," was in the orbit of economic reforms. At the time the foreign press wrote about the courage of the Republic of Armenia Government, about a radical turn in the national economy away from command and toward market methods. However, the reformist zeal gradually ran out, and now Armenia is bringing up the rear in this process. They have been talking about a market economy for four years now, but what market relations may there be in the absence of privatization and private property? Three hundred shops and other small facilities hardly make a difference. Speaking at the session, Chairman of the State Committee for Privatization Simon Konakhchyan stated that the privatization of more than 8,900 facilities is envisioned within the framework of the 1994 program--shops, enterprises processing agricultural products and manufacturing consumer goods, and facilities under construction. At present, the fixed capital of the republic is appraised at 12.5 billion drams. The plan for this year is to privatize property worth 2.3 billion drams. In the process, transportation, railways, nuclear power stations, and quite a number of other facilities are not subject to privatization. Supporters of the adoption of the government program believe that it will assist in setting in motion a new economic mechanism and embarking on a civilized path of economic development which will, of course, bring about favorable social changes within society. Many members of parliament, in particular the fraction of the Armenian National Movement (AOD), have come out in favor of the immediate approval of the program, pointing out that under these conditions in which the state lacks funds, bridges, roads, and residential buildings have ended up as facilities under construction. They may be commissioned within short periods of time upon being privatized with the help of foreign investment. The opposition did not have a uniform opinion on this issue. From the point of view of the Ramkavar-Azatakan Party (Liberal Democrats), privatization will make it possible to begin the formation in the republic of an owner class in the absence of which an amelioration of the economic situation is inconceivable. Some deputies (from the Dashnaktsutyun, the Communist Party of the Republic of Armenia, and the National-Democratic Union) called on their colleagues not to be in a hurry for two reasons: first, because of the absence of the necessary legal foundation, and second, because Armenia, which as a matter of fact is on a wartime footing, needs a maximum of control and centralization of all resources in the hands of the state. All the i's were dotted by the presentation of President Ter-Petrosyan, who pointed out that privatization is unavoidable and recalled that even the Declaration of Independence of Armenia passed in September 1990 referred to the need to establish market relations. Besides, small enterprises account for 61 percent of the facilities to be privatized. Therefore, in essence, the proposal was to approve the program of small-scale privatization. Thereafter, the program was passed by a majority vote.
