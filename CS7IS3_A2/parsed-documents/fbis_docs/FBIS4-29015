The spokesman said the suspension of trips has nothing to do with the tension fueled by the North Korean nuclear program. "The briefing room for tourists who come to see Panmunjom and nearby underground tunnels dug by North Koreans is very old and we need to repair it," said Kim Yong-kyu of the UNC. "That's why tours to Panmunjom have been temporarily suspended. They will resume Monday," said Kim. He denied a news report that the suspension of the trips was related to the existing tensions.
