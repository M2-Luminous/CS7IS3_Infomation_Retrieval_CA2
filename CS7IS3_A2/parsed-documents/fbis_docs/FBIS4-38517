The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has more than once spoken in favour of Ukraine's territorial integrity. The United Kingdom endorsed the tripartite statement in January of Ukraine, the United States and Russia, which guarantees Ukraine's present borders. We hope that the British public will share the same view on this complicated issue. The Republic of Crimea already enjoys considerable autonomy within the Ukraine constitution. It is not fair to blame Ukraine for delays in the division of the Black Sea Fleet, not least because the negotiations have not yet been completed. In spite of rather strong internal opposition to nuclear disarmament, Ukraine has never backtracked from its obligations to remove nuclear weapons and consistently fulfils them. Finally, Max van der Stoel, who is High Commissioner for National Minorities for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, stated in February that the situation of minorities in Ukraine can be regarded as exemplary, especially in comparison with some other areas in the former Soviet Union.
