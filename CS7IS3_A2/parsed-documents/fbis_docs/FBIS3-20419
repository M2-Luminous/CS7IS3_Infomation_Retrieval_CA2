At present, it is being explored in the preliminary development stage. We should firmly uphold positive and reliable policies and the principle of supporting the wishes of the masses. To ensure the stable and healthy development of this new endeavor, we must not engage in rigid uniformity. We must better handle relationships among the state, collectives and individuals; among rights and interests and risk; and between agriculture and nonagricultural industries. Published in this issue is Comrade Wan Baorui's investigative report (draft) on the cooperative shareholding system in Shandong rural enterprises. We hope it will enlighten readers at large. [end editor's note] Practice and Development Development of the cooperative shareholding system in Shandong's rural enterprises generally can be divided into three stages. First was the embryonic stage (1979-1983). The main form was joint household-run enterprises: Under the premise of voluntary participation, several families or households each invested certain funds, elected a leader, and cooperated in partnership to run an enterprise. They jointly engaged in production and operations, and split profits according to the ratio of invested funds. This organizational format contained the basic elements of the cooperative shareholding system even though it had neither perfectly scientific regulations nor normal management systems. It was the rudimentary form of cooperative shareholding. Second was the preliminary development stage (1984-1991). Shareholding cooperatives gradually expanded to village- and township-run enterprises, composed of multiple collective, mass organization and individual shareholding rights which not only commonly practiced the principles of "evenly divided shares, equal shareholder rights, profits divided according to shares, common stocks and interests, risk jointly borne, and benefits jointly enjoyed," but also established relatively standard enterprise regulations, organizational formats and management systems. Third was the tiered development stage (1992 and thereafter). After Comrade Deng Xiaoping's southern tour speech was published, various levels of the party and government put promotion of cooperative shareholding on the agenda. The ardor of rural enterprises and their workers to develop shareholding cooperatives increased. There was a relatively large leap in shareholding cooperatives, whether in terms of quantity, scale or normalization. Through April 1993, 9,919 Shandong rural collective enterprises implemented such systems; this accounts for 6 percent of all rural collective enterprises in Shandong. Bought shares totalled approximately 3.5 billion yuan. According to organizational form, rural enterprise cooperative shareholding systems are divisible into five basic formats: 1) Agricultural household joint stock format. Generally, with a capable person as leader, all shareholders are peasant households. It is characterized by joint labor and capital among peasant households, a cooperative venture format, profits divided according to shares, and to each according to his labor. 2) Enterprise worker stock format. Enterprises of this format generally have tripartite stock: originally rural collective investments are taken as collective stock; the enterprise's accumulation is taken as enterprise stock; shares are issued to the enterprise's own workers, constituting individual worker stock. The relationship between an enterprise's operations and workers' personal interests are more closely tied in that the enterprise workers are given to each according to his labor with profits divided according to share. 3) Social participation shareholding system. This is characterized by shares held by enterprise workers along with legal persons outside the enterprise, and shares tendered to a certain extent to the masses in society to form a multi-constituent, multi-format, multi-channel shareholding company limited. At present there are relatively few of this rather normal form of shareholding enterprise. It requires state approval by relevant sectors. 4) Legal entity (social group) jointly run shareholding system. Composed of two, or more than two, enterprise legal entities (or social groups) which mutually invest in shares, and have joint management and operations. Profits are divided according to investment shares. This format is only restricted to mutual stock among legal persons. It does not involve the matter of individual workers as shareholders. 5) Foreign businessmen stock format. This format both tallies with the basic characteristic of joint ventures without excluding the coexistence of shareholding by rural collectives, workers themselves, or individuals in society. Results and Issues Preliminary results have been obtained by nearly 10,000 Shandong rural enterprises implementing shareholding cooperative systems. One result is the establishment of the independent legal position of enterprises, realization of a division between government and enterprise and a reduction of administrative interference. Implementing shareholding cooperatives clarifies enterprise title relationships. Enterprises truly become independent legal bodies with greater potential for autonomous operations, responsibility for profit and loss, autonomous accumulation and autonomous development. The government changes from its former role with overall responsibility for everything into a common shareholder participating in enterprise management. A second result is diversification of investors and superior allocation of funds. Implementing shareholding cooperatives on the one hand turns some indidvidual consumption funds into production funds, promoting higher productivity, and on the other hand spurring on circulation of the factors of production. This creates diversification of investors, realizing superior allocation of funds to a certain extent under the role of the principle of the greatest benefits. A third result is an enhanced sense of worker as master and enterprise cohesion. Worker shareholders are both producers and owners, which clarifies the formerly murky awareness of worker as master and greatly strengthens cadre and worker responsibility and enterprise cohesion. The Nanguan Xinghua Clothing Factory in Gaomi County has had a trial shareholding system for more than four years. Workers on the average propose more than 100 rationalization suggestions per year, increasing benefits by nearly 100,000 yuan. Examples from two brick factories in the county illustrate the matter even better: workers in a village household cooperative factory braved a downpour to cover brick piles while workers from a collective factory ran inside to escape the rain. A fourth result is stronger encouragement and restraint mechanisms and stronger enterprise reserve strength. In enterprises implementing shareholding cooperatives, stocks are like a link forging tighter the interests of investors, operators and laborers, forming an inherent encouragement mechanism. The board of directors, supervisory committee, and shareholding representatives undertake their own decisionmaking and supervisory functions according to regulations. Such unified internal-external management supervision clearly strengthens an enterprise's restraint mechanism. In this way they overcome short-term behavior, responsibility for profits but not losses and other abuses which are difficult to overcome in the contract responsibility system. According to the analysis of a continuous three-year monitoring report of the entire Zibo village area, the accumulation of shareholding cooperative enterprises was higher by 19 percentage points than that of average levels of the entire region, and every one was in the black. Although Shandong rural enterprises have obtained notable results in implementing shareholding cooperatives, some problems still remain: one is ideological resistance. Summed up, there are three fears: Rural (township) leaders fear restraints, enterprise heads fear loss of authority and the masses fear risk, of which, the greatest resistance is by rural and village-level leadership. A second problem is the lack of complementary industrial and commercial management and taxation system reforms. In some areas, industrial and commercial administrative management sectors do not acknowledge civil elections, are not appointed to represent enterprise legal bodies or even do not issue operating permits. Taxation departments, based on the reasoning that an increase in value of stock assets will lead to an increase in depreciation which will influence income taxes, do not recognize the stock assets value increase portion of the tax estimate. A third problem is muddled collective stockholder title representation. Title to rural collective shares should be owned by the people of the entire village (town) but at present the government still is representive. This is the manifestation of incomplete reformation of shareholding cooperatives which should gradually become stocks of collective economic organizations. A fourth problem is that in dividing post-tax profits some enterprises have too low collective accumulation proportions. A fifth problem is the severe sluggishness of rural financial and bond market establishment, making it difficult to bring into full play the positive role of shareholding cooperatives. Thoughts and Suggestions I have the following understanding of Shandong's shareholding cooperative issues based on this investigation: The direction of rural enterprise reform and development is toward shareholding cooperatives. The shareholding cooperative system unites the shareholding system and cooperative system. It is another mighty creation following the broad masses of peasant households joined in the contract responsibility system. In terms of practical significance, the shareholding cooperative system is beneficial to delimiting and clarifying production relationships, promoting the separation of government and enterprises, implementing enterprise self-autonomy, and really turning enterprises into self-operating, self-restraining, self-developing production managers and main competitive entities in the market responsible for their own profits and losses. It is beneficial to enhancing the enterprise workers' consciousness of being masters and at the same time motivating the enthusiasm of producers, managers and owners in many respects. It is beneficial to fully utilizing idle social funds, attracting consumption funds to the production area and turning potential, scattered factors of production into real productivity. It is beneficial to breaking down barriers between higher and lower levels and between different departments and regions and to promoting the appropriate circulation and superior combination of funds, technology and talent resources. It is beneficial to attracting foreign investment, developing an externally oriented economy and approaching the international market. In sum, the shareholding cooperative system accords with the basic principles and needs of developing a socialist market economy. We should firmly uphold positive and safe policies in developing the shareholding cooperative system. Considered from a nation al perspective, at present the shareholding cooperative system is under exploration at the preliminary development stage. Thus, we must firmly uphold both positive and safe policies. On the one hand, we must enhance leadership work over the system and motivate its continuous development via ideological arousal, policy guidance, information exchange, models and examples and consulting services. On the other hand, we must pay attention to avoid and overcome profiteering, blind pandering and lopsided searches for quantity. In particular, we must from first to last firmly uphold the principles of the wishes of the masses. To ensure the stable and healthy development of the shareholding cooperative system, we definitely must not ignore objective factors and the wishes of the masses, engaging in "rigid uniformity." To develop the cooperative shareholding system we must handle well the three following relationships: 1) The relationship among the state, collectives, and individuals. In implementing the system, we must both guarantee the proper rights and interests of internal and external shareholders as well as prevent harming national and collective interests by giving "full dividends with nothing left." In practice, stressing the first and neglecting the second is relatively common. Therefore, regarding profit distribution, accumulation and retained ratios must be clarified. 2) The relationship between agriculture and nonagricultural industries. An especially noteworthy matter at present and in the future is to extend the cooperative shareholding system from industry toward the planting and growing and service industries according to funding priorities and market demands. We must guide shareholding cooperative enterprises toward developing synthesized agricultural, industrial, and commercial operations with unified production, supply and consumption to motivate coordinated development of various rural industries. 3) The relationship between rights, interests, and risk. Stocks unite rights, interests, and risk. Mutually enjoyed rights, interests, and risk commonly borne is a basic principle of the shareholding system. At the present stage, peasant awareness of risk is generally rather weak. In some places where peasants split profits and are allowed to rescind stock, this augments to a large degree their psychology of obtaining benefit without bearing risk. This is detrimental to developing the shareholding cooperative system. To resolve this issue, we must firmly uphold the nonreedemable nature of stock. The cash stocks that enterprises also issue cannot be rescinded. Rural enterprises practicing a shareholding cooperative system require the support of society and complementary reforms. Implementing such a system is a major change in the title relationships, organizational structure and allocation system of rural enterprises. It involves many things, is of a strong policy nature and requires the support of the entire society with complementary reforms to improve the environment external to enterprises. At the present stage we must stress resolution of the following issues: One, further improve knowledge at each sector and level of leading comrades, especially rural (town) leadership, and remove ideologial and work obstacles. Two, accelerate the transformation of government functioning and the reform of related industrial, commercial, taxation, and fiscal systems. Three, emphasize formulation of laws, regulations and operating methods suited to the development needs of the shareholding cooperative system, putting the system's development onto the legal track. Four, accelerate establishment of bond markets and rural financial institution reform.
