[passage omitted] But the government has been forced to postpone a major push against KR strongholds at Pailin and Anlung Veng because of a lack of ammunition and difficulties in adequately preparing field operations. KR, government and diplomatic sources agree that the government hopes to concentrate initially on a major assault on Anlung Veng, the northern headquarters of the guerrilla faction under the command of Gen. Ta Mok. The assault on Pailin has been put on hold for fears they would not be able to successfully capture the KR stronghold without more ammunition. "There is no panic. They are going on with their plans for the offensive as normal," said a western military source. "They are waiting for the ammunition and when they get it they will attack Anlung Veng. For Pailin, they decided to cancel their plans for the moment, they don't speak about Pailin anymore." Both sides acknowledge the imminent fighting is a test of strength that is designed to influence the leverage each seeks during peace talks over how to include the KR in the government and the army. [passage omitted] But both sides see the military push -- expected to begin this month -- as designed to gain political advantage and neither side contends that the offensive, no matter how successful, could wipe out the KR as a military force. What is clear is that peace has been postponed for at least another dry season in Cambodia and war is seen as inevitable, by both sides, to achieve their longer term political objectives. For the KR, this means a desire for a maximum power sharing role in the new government and the army. For the government the objective is to weaken the guerrilla faction to be in a position to give up less at the negotiating table. "No negotiation is successful at the negotiating table alone," one KR official said. "What we get depends on the fighting. Of course we want the maximum but it depends if we can defend ourselves." KR sources acknowledge they may be able to hold Pailin or Anlung Veng in the face of a well organized and equipped government attack. "They will fight, we will defend the territory but not at any cost. We may lose some areas during the dry season but we will take it back in the rainy season. At the end we will come out on top. If they want to try, let them try," he said. [passage omitted] Senior government and diplomatic sources say government officials have officially requested military aid from China, Russia, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos and North Korea but have come up mostly empty handed. Russia is said to have given ten million rounds of AK-47 ammunition and small token contributions from Malaysia and Singapore may have been acquired. China may also provide some equipment. "We want to start now on Anlung Veng but we are waiting for ammunition. We don't have enough, we hope we will have ammo in a few short days," said Gen. Toan Chhay in an interview on Jan. 7. He is the governor of Siem Reap province and military commander of the 4th Military Region which is in charge of the key provinces of Kompong Thom, Preah Vihear, Siem Reap and parts of Oddar Meanchey. It is here that KR commander Ta Mok, in control of 12 Divisions, has his headquarters. He is said to control at least 3,000 regular troops, plus militia and until recently was based at Anlung Veng. Government forces claim to have 16,000 men under arms in Military Region four. Gen. Toan Chhay outlined the strategy of the two sides in the coming weeks: "As a whole, the KR know we are about to launch the operation against Anlung Veng for our self-defense. In the meantime they want to occupy and capture the district at Choam Khsan in Preah Vihear to set up a bridge from a new headquarters near the tri-border area. "Once they capture Choam Khsan, they will launch to capture the whole of Preah Vihear... We want to attack Anlung Veng so that they will withdraw their troops, to draw them away from Siem Reap, Preah Vihear, Oddar Meanchey and Kompong Thom to defend Anlung Veng. If we leave Anlung Veng intact they will send their front-line further," he said. In Battambang province, the other major military theater, commanders spoke of similar problems. At the government Division 12 headquarters located along Route 5 near the Thai border, troops engaged in heavy clashes after attacking KR positions along Phnum Malai, north of Pailin. More than 100 people were killed or wounded in the first five days of the month, according to commanders. "We do not have enough ammunition. They said, maybe we will get more this week," said Gen. Em Saray, deputy commander of the 12th Division. "Our objective is to destroy the 450 Division but it depends on the weapons supply. Plans for the attack on Pailin are not clear yet. The general staff in Phnom Penh has not given us a clear decision yet." The first week of January also saw significant fighting in the area between Samraong and the Thai border in northern Oddar Meanchey province. KR forces captured the former FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] military base at Koam Chong and burned at least nine villages long under FUNCINPEC influence. Government forces recaptured the base but the "situation is not calm and remains unclear," said Gen Toan Chay. However, both government and KR sources say the fighting in this area reflects ongoing local anger over the government attack and capture of the KR base at Phnum Chhat last August. It is not part of the current, centrally coordinated government offensive. "It was a big mistake of the government to attack Phnum Chhat," said a senior government military official who asked to remain anonymous. "It made the local people very angry, not just the KR but the villagers." Phnum Chhat was the headquarters for KR Division 519 and served as a civilian base for diplomatic and other personnel and their families. Perhaps the most important battle theater may be in Preah Vihear province, which both government and KR sources say will be a focus of fighting. Ta Mok has established a new headquarters north of the border district of Choam Khsan, after abandoning Anlung Veng in preparation of the expected government assault. In an interview on Jan. 7, Preah Vihear governor and military commander Gen. Mean Sarin said his province was under daily attack by the KR. He said 500-600 KR have surrounded Choam Khsan, cut all roads and are "attacking us every day." He said the morale of the KR troops was strong and they were well armed. KR reinforcements had been brought from Kompong Cham, Kompong Thom and Preah Vihear to participate in the assault. "The KR really want to fight because they believe in their leaders. They are not new, but the old cadre," said Gen. Mean Sarin. He said 300 KR had defected in his area but they were mainly recruits from the 1980s. "The defections reflect their desire for peace. The old cadre are waiting for orders. Those that have been with the KR since 1970 are sticking to the position that the winner of the election should take control of the government according to international standards," said the general. "They say that the KR should get 20 percent of the army, FUNCINPEC 20 percent, CPP [Cambodian People's Party] 20 percent and the KP [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] 20 percent while 20 percent should be divided among civilian administration and state bureaucracy," he added. Preah Vihear is effectively cut off from government access by land, and 300 government soldiers are currently trying to open up Route 12 from Kompong Thom to Choam Khsan. Equipped with bulldozers, a single mine detector and earth moving equipment, the troops are clearing 36 kilometers of heavily mined road that military commanders say must be opened within a month to save Preah Vihear from KR capture. Gen. Toan Chay said: "We are trying to repair Route 12, otherwise we cannot save Preah Vihear. Our main objective is to defend Choam Khsan and Preah Vihear, not to capture Anlung Veng." Gen. Mean Sarin said he has 1,970 soldiers in Preah Vihear but currently they are lacking food, ammunition, medical supplies and other necessities. Government officials say the morale of KR troops remains high in the north. Gen. Toan Chay said: "Morale of their troops is still very good. They are united to defend themselves. If they are not united they will die together. In the field they are willing to achieve the orders from their commanders." "The KR are very confident," he said. "They are launching a political campaign designed to hang the government by the throat economically. They count only on their forces and finally no one loses, no ones wins. The suffering falls on the whole country." "For us to lose is very easy, to win very difficult and to maintain victory, even more difficult," said the general. While both sides agree the outcome of the fighting will be crucial to what is finally decided at the political negotiating table, it is not likely to deal a mortal blow to the KR militarily. The KR are prepared to give up fixed bases and have made contingencies to revert to guerrilla tactics if they lose their main rear sanctuaries. But more importantly, many analysts say the KR threat remains primarily a political one. Military assaults can only disperse them into large tracts of jungles and remote villages that are virtually impossible for the government to bring under central control by force. "Our military attacks are important as a demonstration of strength," said Gen. Toan Chay. "But it is not as important as economic development. We can spend millions of dollars on tanks and artillery to kill ten KR. Why?" More alarming to many officials in the government controlled provinces and other observers, is the deteriorating security because of crime, widespread corruption by military and local officials, and the difficulty in implementing rural economic development to improve the lives of the peasantry. They say the people had unrealistic expectations for change after the UN operation in Cambodia and the government conduct so far has done little to engender faith that things will improve soon. It is the KR who will reap the political benefit of continuing popular frustration, they say. A KR official said: "Politically and in terms of morale, they (the government) have no forces in the country side." "If we didn't have popular strength, they wouldn't even give us the time of day. But if we are weak militarily, we will never get anything at the negotiating table. But this is not about the military it is about politics. Despite KR confidence that they can withstand a government assault, people everywhere are afraid of what the faction really wants and hatred runs deep for the killings and suffering during the KR years in power.
