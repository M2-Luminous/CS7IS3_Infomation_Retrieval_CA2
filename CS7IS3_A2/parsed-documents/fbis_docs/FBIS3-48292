For life insurers, who cite an increase in loans for stable earnings assets as their priority policy, it seems a discouraging start. At one time, there had been criticism from the banking world about the interest dumping of life insurance loans, but the various major companies strongly denied it. Rather, they are troubled by the level of long-term interest prime rate that is less than the cost of liabilities. "No Dumping" "The scant demand for funds has been consumed by government affiliated financial institutions and life insurers who are waging an offensive with low interest as a weapon. There is no room left for us to enter." Thus laments a person in charge of loans at a long-term credit bank. According to the talk of those involved, the various major trading companies borrowed 50 to 100 billion yen from life insurers between this April and June. The term is 10 years, and the rate that was accomplished with callable terms (repayment midway is possible when interest drops) was according to their rating and sometimes yen-yen swap quotes, but on the level of LIBOR flat. It is said that even were some cases with minus 20 basis points. The cries rose from banks that "it is 40 basis points lower than the rate that can be offered by our bank." It is true that the various life insurance companies deny "suspicions of dumping" by the banking world, saying that "loans with interest lower than the long-term prime, which broke the record for lowest in the past, strangle our own necks. Even though the term of life insurance loans is longer compared to long-term credit banks and has the advantage, it is not greatly lower than long-term prime." (Meiji Mutual Life Insurance) Indeed, super excellent firms which have a high rating can select the interest that is the best bargain from diverse forms of interest such as long-term prime fixed, long-term prime variable, new long-term prime, LIBOR spread, and bond issue cost while looking at the trends of the swap market. Depending on the interest situation, it seems that there have been loans at interest lower than long-term prime rate (including fixed interest returned to LIBOR base) which life insurers "inevitably from the viewpoint of general transactions" (leading life insurer) consider their standard. It is true that the intense interest competition in loans to such super excellent firms is "reciprocal," including city banks, trust banks, and long-term credit banks. (A major life insurer) Conversely, they complain of the restrictions on life insurers, saying that "there is no concept of a spread loan in life insurance where the acceptance of liabilities can only be limited term buy backs and limited impact loans." (same) Moreover, Sumitomo Mutual Life Insurance considers that "firms to which LIBOR apply are basically an AA rating or above and the number of companies can be counted on both hands. Additions to LIBOR are over 30 basis points as a rule." Both on the point of scale and in the aspect of interest, they deny the prominence of life insurers. Start Was Favorable, But... The changes in balance truly indicate that life insurance loans are struggling the same as banks. The total amount of general lending at the end of July for 27 domestic companies was 50 trillion yen. It was a 7.2 percent increase over the previous year and seemed favorable compared to city banks and long-term credit banks, but these figures included deferred loans to banks for the second half of fiscal 1992. In the first half of this year when the acceptance of new deferred loans ceased, life insurance loans also were directly affected by the blow of the sluggish economy. The start in the first half (April, May) was favorable. Expectations were high for an economic recovery and while feelings of future higher quotations for long-term interest rates were rising, an increase close to 10 percent for the annual rate was realized as the result of "the demand for funds by firms which had held off borrowing from January to March being manifested centering on April and May." (Nippon Life Insurance) "Not much difference is seen in loan clients viewed by business sector" (Sumitomo Mutual Life Insurance), but in these times, the weight of funds of restructuring has been great in fund needs. In other words, they have been equity redemption funds and allowances for early repayment funds for borrowing in the period of high interest rates. However, when a yellow signal lit up in the economic recovery at the beginning of June and a feeling of future lower quotations for interest rates spread, the corporate demand for funds quickly cooled. Rather, repayments exceeded new loans, and the balance declined in June and July. It leveled off during August, had a slight increase during September, and it seems there will be a 1-2 percent increase in the total for the last half. "Would Be Good If It Were a Net Increase" For the past several years, many life insurers have clarified their position on the importance of loans. The share of loans in increased assets exceeded 60 percent prior to 1975. However, the share gradually dropped and fell to 10 percent in fiscal 1986 with the situation of life insurers in the background such as the invigoration of aggressive investment in designated money in trusts and investment in foreign bonds aimed at profits from a rise in stock prices due the external factors of the decline in demand for funds accompanying the shift to a period of low growth and shift by big corporations to direct procurement of financing. Afterward, while corporate demand for capital again became brisk in the bubble era, bank loans became subject to the introduction of BIS regulations, increases in them were curbed, and the loan share of life insurers recovered and in the past several years has progressed on the level of 40 percent. For life insurers who must stably employ long-term funds and earn a working profit (income gain) exceeding the assumed interest rate, it is said that "long term loans are the most appropriate as the portfolio." (major life insurer) Especially now that the myth of the upward slant of stock prices has crumbled and they have learned the bitter experience of investments in foreign bonds having suffered large exchange losses with the rapid rise of the yen, that idea is even stronger. Nippon Life Insurance, for example, in the period of the past three years has increased the staff of branches in charge of medium to small firms and individual loans from 100 to 150 people. Meiji Mutual Life Insurance developed "a total corporate service (TS system)" beginning in 1991. The corporate division, which handled only corporate insurance and corporate pensions also had a loan function along with the existing finance division. In April 1992, persons in charge were also assigned to branches in major regional cities, and "success has been achieved in cultivating new customers." With the increase in corporate bankruptcies, however, there also is a concern that "life insurers who do not touch daily fund settlement of accounts will be beaten by banks in safeguarding credit." Sumitomo Mutual Life Insurance is proceeding with a review of in-house financing regulations for thorough credit management of all their client corporate groups for this reason. Laments Amount of Drop in Long-Term Prime Rate For life insurers, who are bound by the assumed interest rate agreed upon with the insurance contractor, the prolonged low interest rate situation "has hit like a body blow." (Medium life insurer) Regardless of the fact that the assumed interest rate dropped from the 5.5 percent up to then to 4.25 to 4.75 percent beginning in fiscal 1993, overall liability costs are in "the mid 5-percent level." (major life insurer) Although it was settled by finally dropping the lowest guaranteed interest rate for pension funds and qualified pensions to 4.5 percent, application begins in April 1994 and it will remain at 5.5 percent until then. Looking only at long-term prime which is the base interest for loans, it has become a complete backspread. At the present time, there are no signs that major life insurers are relaxing in their position of emphasizing loans and at least they are not publicly talking of another drop in the assumed interest rate. However, the shadow cast by the prolonged sluggish economy is gradually becoming larger.
