[Al-Qudwah] Thank you. [Salamah] You have been following daily developments in New York in your official capacity. How do you explain the footdragging in passing a resolution? [Al-Qudwah] The reasons are numerous. One of these is that there are real differences between the Americans and ourselves on the wording with respect to Jerusalem as an integral part of the occupied territories, the protection of the Palestinian people, and the role of the sponsors of the peace process on the ground. Also, the United States wants to advance certain objectives in return for going along with a UN Security Council resolution. In any case, we believe we have not compromised any of the components of our position. [Salamah] What seems to be the sticking point? Is it the text of the resolution, or is it the international presence or guarantees? [Al-Qudwah] Personally, I think the text of the resolution has been settled, and that the United States may seek some way to get around its opposition to certain parts, specifically the one to do with Jerusalem. The United States may seek a separate vote on each item of the resolution. What remains to be sorted out is the wording of the part dealing with a general Middle East settlement. [Salamah] According to one report, there has been a suggestion that passage of the resolution will be linked to a resumption of the talks. How do you react to this report? [Al-Qudwah] We are against such linkage. At the same time, we have made it plain that we are not boycotting the peace process. Neither are any of the parties involved in the peace process. Our position is clear. Our return to the negotiating process and its success clearly hinge on creating new facts in the occupied territory, whereby the Palestinian people are afforded protection through a direct international presence and a package of measures that must be instituted by the Israeli Government. This includes disarming settlers, dismantling, at any rate, some of these settlements, and expediting negotiations over their final status within the framework of the agreement concluded with Israel. We want this resolution to create new facts that may facilitate a return to the negotiating table. [Salamah] You have spoken of the implementation of the resolution which you are expecting from the UN Security Council. What guarantees are you demanding to implement this resolution after your past experience with the previous resolutions, which remained mere ink on paper? [Al-Qudwah] Exactly. In fact, I have said the same thing many ties over the past few days. We said clearly that the main thing in this respect is not necessarily adopting the resolution. The main thing is implementing this resolution. No doubt, adopting the resolution will be an important step forward, but this is not enough. We want to move to the implementation immediately after the adoption. We have bitter experience in terms of adopting resolutions that are not applied. Therefore, we must transfer the weight of the political moves toward the implementation process directly after the adoption of the resolution. [Salamah] Mr. Nasir al-Qudwah, my colleague Joseph Samahah would like to ask you a question. [Samahah] Hello, Mr. Nasir. [Al-Qudwah] You are welcome. [Samahah] The question is if the resolution is agreed on without the issue of Jerusalem. [sentence as heard] Has there been agreement on the nature of the international presence, its type, tasks, and points of reference, the areas of deployment, and if this means intervention by the UN Security Council or merely an implementation of the PLO-Israel bilateral agreement, because this was also a bone of contention. How was it thrashed out? [Al-Qudwah] Brother Joseph, no doubt simply dealing with a general issue related to the Middle East and the Palestinian question is in itself an achievement and a change from the previous situation. We must remember that the UN Security Council has not discussed this question since the beginning of the Madrid process, except on two occasions. The issue in both cases was only the issue of deportation. At other times, the council was practically prevented from tackling this issue. Therefore, in principle there is an important change. As for the contents of the resolution, as I have said, the United States has a problem with regard to Jerusalem. We vehemently insisted that no change should be introduced in this regard. For them, the solution could be, as I said, demanding separate voting on paragraphs and abstaining from voting on this particular paragraph. This procedural solution will not change the final result, which is adopting the resolution by consensus [al-tawafuq] as is agreed so far, including, of course, the paragraphs that deal with our definite demands, particularly providing protection for the Palestinian people. [Samahah] But you have not answered my question on the international presence, its type, tasks, and points of reference, the areas of deployment. Is it in Gaza and Jericho, or in the entire West Bank and Gaza? Is it in accordance with the Declaration of Principles, or will it transcend it, being a Security Council resolution, or is it in implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement? The question is still there. [Salamah] Has this issue been thrashed out or not? [Al-Qudwah] This is clear from the wordage. The text reads that the UN Security Council demands measures to provide protection for the Palestinian people in all the occupied territory. These are the words. [Salamah] And it will be adopted in this form? [Al-Qudwah] Yes. [Salamah] And there is U.S. approval? [Al-Qudwah] In English, it says: "throughout the occupied territory" [preceding four words in English]. The singular form is used, which means territorial unity of these areas. [Salamah] Last question: How do you evaluate the other states' attitude toward the draft resolution? [Al-Qudwah] The vast majority of the other states were extremely responsive. This horrible massacre undoubtedly engendered general international sympathy toward the Palestinian cause and the just demands we presented to the council. There were really no problems with any state among the UN Security Council member states. Our negotiations were, in fact, with the U.S. delegation in the presence -- but not with the effective participation -- of the Russian Federation delegation. [Salamah] Thank you, Mr. Nasir al-Qudwah. [Al-Qudwah] Thank you, my dear brother.
