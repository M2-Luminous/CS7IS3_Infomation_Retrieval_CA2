FBIS4-36343 "drnes110_s_94011" FBIS-NES-94-110 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 Iran * AIDS-Infected Brazilian Diplomat Leaves * AIDS-Infected Brazilian Diplomat Leaves 94LA0166B Tehran KEYHAN-E HAVA'I in Persian 20 Apr 94 p 2 94LA0166B Tehran KEYHAN-E HAVA'I Persian CSO [Text] Tehran, 25 Farvardin [14 April] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News Service -- After it became known that he was infected with AIDS, the second secretary of the Brazilian embassy in Tehran was expelled from Iran. A Muslim diplomat in Tehran disclosed: Mr. Paulo Madrus, chief of the Commerce Section and second secretary of the Brazilian Embassy, had just arrived at his position in Iran and was hospitalized as an emergency case at one of Tehran's hospitals and his blood was tested. The test showed that his blood was infected with HIV, and this virus transmits AIDS. It is said that after it was definitely determined he was infected with AIDS, the Iranian Foreign Ministry asked the Brazilian Embassy in Tehran to send him back to his country as soon as possible. His expulsion took place seven months ago (last year). In a contact by KEYHAN-E HAVA'I with the Brazilian Embassy, an informed source in this embassy confirmed that Paulo Madrus, the chief of the Commerce Section and second secretary of the Brazilian Embassy in Iran, left Tehran seven months ago due to illness, but this source did not mention the nature of the diplomat's illness. The same source confirmed that since the return of the aforementioned diplomat to Brazil, Hinaldo Esturani, another Brazilian diplomat, has taken over as chief of the embassy's Commerce Section. In repeated contacts by KEYHAN-E HAVA'I with officials at the Foreign Ministry to determine if the report that the aforementioned diplomat was infected with AIDS and was expelled from Iran is true or not, they were unwilling to say anything about it, nor would they give any reason for their silence on the subject. The aforementioned Muslim diplomat criticized the Foreign Ministry's behavior in this regard. He said: Unfortunately, it is observed that the behavior of Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs towards the foreign diplomats living in Tehran, especially Western diplomats, is negligent, and this leads to insolence on the part of many Western diplomats. It is worth mentioning that last year also KEYHAN-E HAVA'I disclosed the infection of a Dutch diplomat with AIDS. It was known before this Dutch diplomat came to Iran that he had AIDS, but the Dutch Foreign Ministry sent him anyway. In an answer to KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, the Dutch Embassy tried to deny that the Dutch Foreign Ministry had knowingly sent a diplomat infected with HIV to Iran, but the Dutch Embassy's efforts were of no avail in the face of the sharp public opinion response in Iran. Based on information obtained from reliable sources, the Brazilian diplomat was also infected with AIDS before he was sent to his post in Tehran. The Muslim diplomat who gave us the report that the Brazilian Embassy's commercial attache was infected with the AIDS virus said he had no information on whether or not the Brazilian diplomat infected with HIV was sent to Tehran knowingly and with specific intention by the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. He emphasized that Westerners spread various diseases, including AIDS, with their careless behavior. He said: As a Muslim, I expect the Islamic Republic's Foreign Ministry not to deal passively with Western political leaders and diplomats and to make them understand the necessity to observe Islamic values. It is worth mentioning that many Iranian physicians and specialists in contagious diseases have expressed concern about the relations between foreign diplomats in Tehran and some Iranian families. These specialists and physicians believe that casual relations could lead to the spread of AIDS among individuals who have close contact with foreign diplomats infected with this virus, and these kinds of relations could involuntarily lead to the spread of the HIV infection through the country. Specialists in contagious diseases thus advise Iranian families to avoid contact and relations with foreign diplomats.
