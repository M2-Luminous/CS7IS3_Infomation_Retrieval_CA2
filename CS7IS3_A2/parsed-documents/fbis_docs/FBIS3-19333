During his recent private visit to Moscow, the 81-year-old proved once again he still has great knowledge of world politics. At the end of his visit he came to the conclusion that Russia will remain a great power whose interests will, however, not always be identical with those of the United States. This realization may sound very simple, but it was far from obvious over the past few weeks: The Ames espionage affair and Moscow's latest diplomatic initiative in Bosnia and the Middle East almost recreated the image of the aggressive Russian bear as the United States' more or less natural opponent. It is, therefore, all the more surprising -- and encouraging -- that Secretary of State Warren Christopher has now come to the same conclusion as Richard Nixon: Following his meeting with his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, Christopher stated that differences between Moscow and Washington are quite natural. They just have to be solved as soon as they arise. In Vladivostok, the Russians once again emphasized what is important to them. They want to be consulted, not taken by surprise by U.S. initiatives. This complaint contains the threat of starting their own initiatives that have not been agreed beforehand. This would mean a relapse into the Cold War. As long as Russia emphasizes its interest in a constructive partnership, it should be taken at its word.
