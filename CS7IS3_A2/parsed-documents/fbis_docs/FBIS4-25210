I would like to take this opportunity to give my cordial regards and highest respects to all the academicians of the two academies and all other scientists and technicians across the country who have made outstanding contributions to China's scientific and technological undertakings. The founding of the CAE is a major event in the engineering communities and is of great significance for China's socialist modernization drive. Engineering technology is the crystallization of the people's efforts to apply scientific theories in transforming and protecting nature. It plays an indispensable, important role during the course of turning scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces. At present, engineering technology is progressing vigorously at an unprecedentedly high speed, showing its great might in promoting economic and social development. Since the founding of New China, the vast number of Chinese engineers and technicians, displaying a spirit of patriotism and hard struggle and striving to raise the level of engineering technology and enhance their designing and engineering ability, have built a large number of important projects and infrastructure and made outstanding contributions to economic construction and national defense. During the course of practical construction, China has created unique engineering features and strength in certain fields, and trained a large number of engineers and technicians. The founding of the CAE, with outstanding experts in the engineering communities as its mainstay, will have an important impact on affirming the contributions of engineers and technicians, improving their social status, arousing their enthusiasm, giving play to their overall strength, and stepping up the country's development of engineering technology. The CAE is a most honorable, consultative academic organ in China's engineering communities. I hope the CAE will work according to rules and regulations, and give advice and suggestions at the government's request on the state's major engineering projects and programs, and on research and studies on the development of major engineering technology; and that it will make active contributions to uniting and leading engineers and technicians across the country in implementing the government's policies and principles on the work of science and technology, and to academic exchanges and cooperation at home and abroad. The CAS Scientific Council, the highest science and technology advisory organ of the state founded in 1955, has played an important role in formulating and implementing the major scientific and technological policies and plans of the state. To further facilitate international exchanges and embody the authoritative and honorary status of the CAS Scientific Council, the State Council has decided to rename the Scientific Council members academicians, while the academicians' system will also be carried out in the CAE. This is an important measure which conforms to the practice of the scientific and technological communities of the world, as well as the strong and general aspirations of the scientific and technological communities at home. This is the first academicians' conference of the CAS. However, we call it the seventh academicians' conference because it is the continuation of those conferences of the Scientific Council. During the current conference, the first batch of foreign academicians of the CAS will be selected, and they will yield a positive impact on opening China's scientific and technological field wider to the outside world, expanding international scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation, and promoting China's scientific and technological undertakings. During the course of socialist modernization, we should always adhere to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's guiding concept that "science and technology is the primary productive force" and uphold the principle that "economic construction must rely on science and technology, and science and technology must meet the needs of economic construction." We should strive to ensure three rational things -- meeting the major needs of economic construction, developing the high-technological industries, and stepping up basic research. Since the start of reform and opening up, China's scientists and technicians have made remarkable achievements in tackling important scientific and technological problems, utilizing and popularizing the use of scientific and technological achievements, promoting scientific and technological progress in enterprises and rural areas, conducting high-technological research, stepping up basic research, and building key construction projects. Remarkable progress has been made in implementing the state science fund system and the patent system, in building high-technological industrial parks, in carrying out "Program 863," "the Spark Program," and the plans for advancing agriculture and for helping the poor regions through the application of science and technology, and in commercialization and industrialization of scientific research results and new technologies. Reform of the management system for science and technology is being deepened to keep pace with reform of the economic structure. Reform of the management system for science and technology is for the purpose for establishing a new system that suits the development of a socialist market economy, accords with the law of science and technology, and builds a close tie between science and technology and the economy; and for the purpose of promoting scientific and technological progress, scaling scientific and technological heights, and achieving a comprehensive and coordinated development of economy, science and technology, and the society. At present, the trial of overall national strength based on economy and science and technology among countries is becoming more and more intense day by day. China's scientists and technicians are a very important force, enabling our country to achieve modernization and meet the challenge of international competition. The CAE and CAS, as the two top academic bodies of China's scientific and technological communities, should work hand in hand in close coordination to make greater contributions to the country's modernization drive. The academicians of the CAS and the CAE, as the distinguished representatives and the backbone of China's science and engineering communities shouldering a heavy responsibility, should unite and cooperate with one another, lead the scientists and technicians across the country in working hard with a will to make the country strong, forge ahead, strive to scale scientific and technological heights and surpass the advanced level of the world, and contribute wisdom and talents to building China into a great, powerful socialist country. Scientists and engineers are a precious wealth of our country. I hope that the party and government leaders at all levels will take good care of our scientists and engineers in terms of political treatment and working and living conditions, show concern for their work and their livelihood, and create the conditions for them to play an even better role. I wish the conference complete success!
