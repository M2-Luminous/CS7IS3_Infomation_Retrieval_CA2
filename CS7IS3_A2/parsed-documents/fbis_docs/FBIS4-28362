Instead of "bureaucrat-bashing" focusing on the individual behavior of bureaucrats, a cool diagnosis and prescription focusing on the system are necessary. 2. Among the suppliers of services, the government agencies are monopolists with power capable of forcing expensive and low-quality services on the consumers. Although they are monopolists who are difficult to control, a system to check their abuses is lacking, and the crux of the problem is the defenseless plight of the consumers. 3. It is necessary to demolish the systems that are not worth continuing, to promote deregulation and private management as much as possible, and to enhance transparency and increase scrutiny of work content in the remaining aspects. It is also important to change the traditional emphasis on generalists and to improve the quality of services in order to cope with increasingly complex tasks by stressing the use of specialists and promoting exchanges with the private sector. Problems in the System; Long Lines at Art Museums This spring, a number of events took place, including the rice uproar and the abrupt resignation of the prime minister. Others were hikes in public service charges and a seven-hour wait at the Barnes Collection exhibit at the National Museum of Western Art in Ueno. The successive hikes in public service charges were criticized as dashing hopes for a business recovery. However, let us focus on the evils of monopoly in that the incentive to reduce costs is weak, given the fact that cost can be transferred to price. The fear of being kicked around if one is off guard and being free from the pressures of competition are such evils and are not limited to public service charges. At the exhibit hall at the National Museum of Western Art, in addition to the standing frustration among people who can only attend on weekends due to their work, if there is such a great demand, why are the exhibit hours not extended into the evenings? With set costs of display items and the exhibit floors already paid for, the satisfaction of the users should be greatly enhanced by bearing the variable costs. In a normal enterprise, an all-night operation of a three-shift system would be considered in order to improve earnings by raising the rate of facilities operation. The reason for beginning the bureaucracy debate with these topics is because the focus should be on the circumstances and the system in which the bureaucrats are placed, rather than on the people called bureaucrats. We do not think that the bureaucrats as a whole are a special existence. There is a tendency for the bureaucratic debate to be called "bureaucrat-bashing" by focusing on concrete cases, but it is inappropriate. The focal point of examination is the system and not the individual members. Instead of lecturing the cat that ate the fish placed before it, the reason should be considered and an appropriate measure should be adopted. If the work of the bureaucrats is seen as providing services, the government agencies are not different from monopoly enterprises. What is different is the difficulty for private monopolies to provide effective abuse-prevention measures. Monopoly profits breed potential competitors and are not easy to maintain in the long term. They become subject to government scrutiny and regulation as in the case of public service charges. If stronger support is won from the consumers with reduced costs and the profits are boosted, they become incentives for increased returns and stable employment. Despite the recognition of regional monopolies like electric power companies, the first point is met by a contention that they should be open to new participants and strong criticism against regulation of new entry through a licensing system. Even in cases where regional monopoly is inevitable, the contention that a franchise system should be introduced with a limited time of several years to induct the principle of competition follows this trend. The introduction of a price-cap system which recognizes room for discretion by regulated companies within a given limitation responds to the third point. Such abuse-prevention steps are virtually nonexistent in the work of the bureaucrats. Also, virtually no learning effects are seen from the experience of a tragic end to an economy which placed the nation as a whole under a similar system. More satisfactory circumstances over a long term probably can be realized in the case of public service charges by the aggressive use of incentive functions, including the introduction of a price-cap system. The characteristics of the work of bureaucrats appear more directly than in the case of the exhibit. When the seven-hour wait was known, did they imagine the existence of any tasks to cope with other than the prevention of accidents? We should ask the purpose of those persons responsible. Was there anyone who considered improving the satisfaction of the people, including those who gave up waiting in line? Are there any offices that heard the complaints or considerd instituting such improvements? Were there any persons who incurred any losses because such great dissatisfaction was ignored? Does any system exist to reward any person who might have won plaudits by responding to such dissatisfaction? The case of the museum is merely a symbolic example. Why are the windows of the government offices open only during the daytime on weekdays? Why must the people take the trouble to go to the offices for their resident cards? It is necessry to recall the gripes which everyone once held. Dearth of Specialists; Resistance to Change The aim of the monopoly enterprise is acquisition of profit. Because of an incentive to offer quality services at low costs, the design of a system that uses such incentives is relatively easy. It is necessary to note that, in the work of the bureaucrats, the abuses become enlarged due to their potential use of the power of enforcement in addition to their monopolist position. The trouble and time to go to the windows, the annoying documents that are demanded, and coping with the almost abnormal concern with mistakes in the documents are serious costs for the users. In the case of museums, many people would probably give up the idea of going. This phenomenon will surface to an extreme degree in the case of many categories of licenses and permits. The problem is that no office exists which is strongly aware of the fact that such costs should be reduced and which will control them. It is necessary to note also that such dissatisfactions do not merge into a loud voice. There are probably many readers who saw dissatisfactions surface in concrete form in such cases as the Yamato Transport Co, E.K. Taxi, and Daiei Inc., and wondered why others in the industry did not express their frustrations. It is better not to voice them. In other words, if they are silently acquiescent because of the appeal of vested interests and the fear of authoritative retaliation, it is indeed serious. Of course, checks from the budget and accounting aspects for the prevention of swelling government budgets and squandering are not counted. It is also necessary to note the decentralized authority system symbolized by the famous statement by Professor Emeritus Junichi Kyogo of Tokyo University, who stated regarding jurisdictional matters that the responsible divisions of the main ministry represent the Japanese Government itself. Even the private monopolies that share a common goal called profit suffer from the abuses of decentralization called the "main enterprise disease." In the government agencies which lack a clear common goal, the independence and abuses of the various sectors were greater. The term of office of the responsible division director is a maximum two years, and it is difficult to expect the realization of a socially optimum services-supplying system that considers such costs. A newly appointed division director probably cannot even perform work similar to his predecessor without the cooperation of his subordinates and the representative companies under his jurisdiction. It is important because he will be demanded to set forth a new axis to make known his presence during his term of offfice, and to further contribute to the "ministerial interests." Be it a division or a more subdivided office, or be it a bureau or a ministry, the essential problem is that a supervisory role over the content and cost of the services is nonexistent, and that an incentive to establish a supervisory system is also nonexistent or has not yet been established. One instance is the emphasis on generalists since the Meiji era and the flip side of contempt for specialists. Financial administration led by securities administration has long been ridiculed in some quarters for its failure to establish a formation that is able to cope with the rapid changes and complexities of the industrial areas under its jurisdiction, and is barely able to recognize the changes within its scope of management. The reality is that the managers in electronics manufacturing companies are heard to say: "It is the same situation in our field also," so finance is not an exceptional case. However, it is cruel to say that they are inattentive to details. Under the present system, it is true that it is futile to pay close attention. Some say that "Japan's bureaucrats are superior" or that "Kasumigaseki" is Japan's largest think tank." However, although it may be true about the superiority of its hardware in terms of the speed of its reaction and the large size of its memory, it should be recognized that the computer is just an ordinary box without the proper software. Use of Outside Monitors for Overall Reorganization There is no all-purpose remedy to cope with the monopolist abuses of the bureaucracy. However, in the sense that there is no system with an aspect of using its authority to force its monopolist services, and scrutinizes and copes with the abuses, the first step in coping is to recognize that the decisive lack of cost-awareness is a conspicuous trait. The beginning of a cure is an understanding that one has a serious illness and is exposed to the danger of further aggravation. It is also a sign of illness to retort against concrete criticism with such wornout phrases as "it will not work simply like painting a picture on a white background" or that "steady and gradual is preferable to sudden reform," and think that the matter has been settled. There are various kinds of measures for coping. The first kind is the abolition of stations that have not produced benefits commensurate with costs in a broad sense. The second is the introduction of the principle of competition and a more aggressive use. The appropriateness of such expressions as privatization and private consignment aside, an example is their removal from the scope of the government office's work which is difficult to control, including a bold reexamination of the regulations. The third kind is the introduction of outside monitors on a constant or periodic basis for an overall reexamination of the system. This involves public disclosure of the more concrete content of the bureaucrats' work and a strengthening of surveillance by the people through the Diet, for example. As in the case of private enterprise, the use of outside monitors may be worth consideration. Clarifying and fostering the role of specialists and active exchanges with the private sector also constitute a part of the measures. It is not necessary to view the bureaucrats as a special breed of people, nor is it appropriate. The difficulty of controlling the quality of the services provided under the bureaucratic system and the cost levels should be frankly recognized, and a debate shold be started on the scope and design of an appropriate system. Many readers probably sensed a dissatisfaction which seemed unlikely to be remedied when they heard the statement by an official of the Food Agency around the time of the rice uproar that "the confusion would have been greater if we were not here." They would probably ask at least for some persuasive evidence.
