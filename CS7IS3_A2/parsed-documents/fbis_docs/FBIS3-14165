[Kamal] I have received no instructions from the Palestinian leadership about stopping negotiations today. I have received no such information from Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the negotiating delegation. As I understood from some sources, the point is that [PLO Executive Committee member] Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh said that last night's incidents in Hebron and their results will influence the course of negotiations. I agree with what Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh says. The subject is not marginal. Anger still rages and trouble is increasing. Our people are suffering daily blows from everywhere. So, this will certainly have an influence. But, negotiations are one thing and what happens in Hebron is something else. [Mu'addi] What is the present situation after the Tunis talks between the Israeli delegation and the Palestinian leadership? What subjects are on the agenda of today's meeting in Cairo? [Kamal] Based on my reports through last night, I think the Israeli side has positive tendencies that will be demonstrated today during the negotiations between Dr. Nabil Sha'th and Mr. Amnon Shahaq on interpreting the question of protecting the Palestinians in the occupied territories, starting with the dear city of Hebron, its honorable people, and its heroic steadfastness. Therefore, this question will be the test for the arrangements that will be agreed on by the Cairo negotiations. [Mu'addi] PLO representative in Cairo Sa'id Kamal, thank you very much. [Kamal] Thank you.
