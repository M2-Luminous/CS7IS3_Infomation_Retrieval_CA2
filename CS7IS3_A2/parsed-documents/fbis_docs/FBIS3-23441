This is the result of the Criminal Investigation Department's investigations so far and it reinforces the belief that Turkey's secret agencies planned the murder some time ago. The culprit used a semi-automatic gun or a small automatic gun using special technology. The Criminal Investigation Department is convinced that if the culprit has not escaped to the occupied areas, he could be located and arrested. But the hit man could have crossed the buffer zone five minutes after the murder. According to the same reports, the culprits could have escaped to the occupied areas even with a car. This afternoon, the police are expected to release the sketches of two people who were seen moving in a suspicious manner in a yellow Mercedes a few hours before the murder. The description of one of the men matches eyewitness descriptions of the man they saw approach and shoot Theofilos from a Vespa motorcycle. [passage omitted on background material] In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, Former National Guard Chief Dhimitrios Matafias confirmed that several Turkish press reports list him as a target of Turkey's secret services. Matafias reportedly met the Kurdish movement's leadership eight years ago and since then has supported the Kurds both financially and in other ways. Commenting on information that he will be the next Turkish target, Matafias said he believes the Turks use these methods to intimidate or make an impression and thus strangle every voice in support of the Kurds. He added that he must take some additional protection measures.
