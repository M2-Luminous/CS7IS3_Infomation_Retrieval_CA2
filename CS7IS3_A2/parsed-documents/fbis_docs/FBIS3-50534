After the ceremony, I approached Army General Raul Castro and asked him to speak to the Cuban people. Please listen to his words. I invite our listeners to keep them in mind. [Begin recording] To our entire people, especially to my FAR and Interior Ministry [Minint] comrades: I congratulate you on the 35th anniversary of the triumph of the Revolution. This congratulations is for struggle against all problems. The coming year will also be difficult. Everything is dependent upon our effort. To the FAR and Minint troops: We have faced difficult times before, even before the triumph of the Revolution; even earlier generations, beginning with the Mambises. We maintain that same spirit of never surrendering, of courageously facing all adversity -- objective and subjective problems. There are as many of one as of the other. This year, during the 35th anniversary, when television and radio play the national anthem -- which, as a matter of fact, they forgot to play a year or two ago -- please dedicate at least one moment to thinking about, internalizing thoughts: What has each one of us done? Not what have others done. What are our faults? What individual shortcomings have we? Begin with yourself and follow up with an analysis of the whole the Cuban people. I wish you happiness, which means: Continue the struggle.
