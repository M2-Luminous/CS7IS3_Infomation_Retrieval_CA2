Most of the members launched a strong attack against the government, accusing it of failure in its domestic policies to serve the citizens and alleviate the burdens they shoulder as a result of rising prices and lack of services. This, they claimed, has led to an increase in negative attitudes and unwillingness to cooperate with state policy, and has given terrorists the chance to carry out activities to destroy the national economy. Sa'd al-Shirbini, chairman of the People's Assembly Local Administration Committee, emphasized that terrorism is the fruit of indifference and negative attitudes among the people, who complain about prices and services and the spread of corruption in all state sectors. This is the reason for the rift between the people and the government. He called for administrative reform together with economic reform and for the removal of all reasons that have led to a negative attitude among the people. He also called for the genuine exercise of democracy involving all the parties, political forces, and the people without restrictions or prior conditions. He demanded that the retirement age must not be extended to give a chance to the young people to assume responsibility, prevent disappointment and despair, and have more effective participation in the process of development. Faruq Mutawalli (independent) called for the formulation of a foreign policy to confront the results from the establishment of a Middle Eastern market, the implementation of the GATT agreement on international free trade, and Sudan's plan to establish a new dam on the Nile, which could affect Egypt's share of the water. 'Abd-al-Fattah Diyab, from the National Democratic Party, noted that the development of the village has become a mere slogan, as there is no development in the villages. This is despite the fact that villages are the basis of development and production. The government should have given villages more importance but this failure has led to despair among the peasants, who are more committed to paying taxes and contributing to the increase in production. He also noted that telephone services in the villages are very bad. What the government did was to install old and dilapidated telephone exchanges and cables just to claim that it had introduced telephones to the villages. They would have been better without it! Diya'-al-Din Dawud (representative of the Nasirite Party) said: If no serious attempt is made to allow parties to exercise their activity among the people, there will be no political enlightenment and terrorism and extremism will always find a suitable climate to spread their subversive ideas among the youth. This is the responsibility of the government, because the security forces always restrict the activity of parties and prevent them from holding public meetings, forcing them to hold such meetings behind closed doors. He called on the government to work for Arab unity. I call on President Mubarak to exert personal efforts to convene an Arab summit to discuss the dangers facing the Arab world, he said. He asked: What has happened to Egypt's unifying role in the Arab world?
