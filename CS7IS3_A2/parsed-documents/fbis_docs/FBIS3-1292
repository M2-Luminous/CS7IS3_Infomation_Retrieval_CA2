At present, many MPs continue to hold the commercial jobs they held when elected, earning additional incomes as businessmen, lawyers, farmers and company directors. MPs currently earn a state income of R179,800 [rand] a year, comprising a salary of R90,800, a transport allowance of R55,000 and a daily expenses allowance of R34,000. Mr Niehaus said the restriction on other work would ensure MPs devoted their full attention to parliamentary duties. It would also minimise corruption. If the proposal is accepted by the ANC, there is a strong possibility it will be tabled in Parliament as a measure applying to all MPs. A National Party MP who did not want to be named said there were two reasons why MPs should be allowed to continue other work: it made them financially independent and so less vulnerable to corruption, and it gave them valuable practical skills that could be directed to parliamentary work. Whenever a commercial concern was discussed in Parliament, any MPs with links to it were obliged to declare their interests and recuse themselves from the discussion, he said. Although MPs' incomes looked high, there were many hidden costs; for example, they had to maintain two households, one in Cape Town where Parliament sat and one in their constituency.
