This, he added, falls within the context of the Arab states' demand to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons. In a news conference he held this afternoon at the Arab League headquarters, al-Shar' said that the Arab League Council had agreed on a unified Arab position when the time comes to renew the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, so that Israel may not be excluded from signing this treaty. He noted that weapons of mass destruction are dangerous to pan-Arab security and, therefore, it is natural for the Arabs to defend their interests. On the Arab position toward France following its recent agreement on military and security cooperation with Israel, al-Shar' said: We were surprised by the noticeable consolidation of French-Israeli ties recently and following the Israeli massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. It came at a time when we are discussing the peace process and despite the fact that Israel possesses a large arsenal of all types of weapons and is occupying Arab lands, he added. Al-Shar' emphasized that the matter had been brought up during the meetings of the Arab League Council, which unanimously denounced this step as one that does not serve the peace process in the region and harms Arab-French ties, which were marked by friendship and balance. The Syrian foreign minister noted that it had been agreed within the Arab League Council not to debate the issue of the Arab boycott of Israel during the current session. He stressed that the boycott cannot be lifted without Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. He added: The boycott is a law, and the law is indivisible. Besides, there is no Arab decision to lift the boycott, and if some states have made unilateral decisions in this regard, this has nothing to do with the Arab League. Discussing peace, al-Shar' said Syria rejects the step-by-step policy and seeks to achieve a comprehensive and just peace that will secure the Arabs' legitimate rights. He noted that Syria's stand stipulates that Jerusalem is part of the occupied Arab territories and Syria demands a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for a comprehensive peace. He said Israel has not yet agreed to this measure and he affirmed that, as long as the peace is not comprehensive, it will not lead to security and stability in the region. He pointed out that the Arab League Council discussed the water issue and expressed its support for the Syrian stance on the Tigris an Euphrates Rivers, two international rivers to which international laws and norms apply. He said the council asked Syria to present legal and political studies on this problem because water security is vital to the Arab countries. He added that the Arab League Council reviewed numerous problems facing the Arab countries, such as Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, Algeria, and Somalia. He noted that such discussion is a positive factor in openness among the Arabs to push things in the direction of Arab reconciliation. He said the Arab nation should not pause at the Gulf crisis and that it must work to remedy the current serious disorder.
