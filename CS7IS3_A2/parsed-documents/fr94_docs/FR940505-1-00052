FR940505-1-00052 FR940505-1-00012 These potentially significant measures are undergoing further revision at the local and regional level, in order to improve the design and quantification of the controls and confirm implementation responsibilities. This is particularly the case with respect to the only two measures to which substantial emissions reductions are assigned: FC&hyph;3_Employer-Based Trip Reduction (advances beyond existing Regulation XV), and FC&hyph;4_Additional VMT/VT Reduction Strategies. EPA hopes to receive these revised measures as a SIP submittal and will take action to approve or conditionally approve the controls at that time. The CO plan therefore lacks approvable measures that fulfill the section 187(a)(3) requirements for fully adopted contingency measures to be triggered if estimates of actual VMT exceed the plan's forecasted levels. EPA proposes to disapprove the plan with respect to this requirement. In separate rulemaking, EPA will propose as part of the South Coast ozone and CO FIP/SIP a substitute contingency measure to be implemented automatically in the event actual VMT excesses are monitored. i. Transportation control measures (TCMs) to offset growth in emissions from growth in vehicle miles traveled. Section 187(b)(2) of the Act requires ``Serious'' CO areas to meet a TCM requirement specified in section 182(d)(1)(A) for ``Severe'' and ``Extreme'' ozone areas. The Act provides that all such plans must include specific and enforceable TCMs to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT and numbers of vehicle trips, and to achieve reductions in mobile source emissions as necessary in conjunction with other measures to comply with the periodic emissions reduction and attainment requirements of the Act. EPA's preliminary interpretation of this requirement appears in the General Preamble, 57 FR 13521&hyph;13523 and 13533&hyph;13534 (April 16, 1992). As mentioned above, Table 6&hyph;6 of the South Coast CO plan includes 11 transportation and indirect source ``contingency'' measures. These measures and the plan's scheduled adoption dates are as follows: FC&hyph;1, Transit Improvements (to be determined by the implementing agency) FC&hyph;2, HOV and Bus Lanes/Roads (to be determined by the implementing agency) FC&hyph;3, Employer-Based Trip Reduction (1993) FC&hyph;4, Additional VMT/VT Reduction Strategies (1989&hyph;2000, with an SCAQMD backstop rule adoption in 1994, if necessary) FC&hyph;5, Traffic Flow Improvements (1989&hyph;2000) FC&hyph;6, Control Extended Idling (1993) FC&hyph;7, Encourage Removal of Pre-1980 Vehicles (1993) FC&hyph;8, Reduce Cold Start Emissions from Vehicles (1994) M&hyph;H&hyph;1, Environmental Review Program (1992) M&hyph;H&hyph;2, Trip Reduction for Schools (1993) M&hyph;H&hyph;4, Special Activity Centers (1993) While progress has been made in local and regional adoption and implementation of certain measures (e.g., FC&hyph;1, FC&hyph;2, FC&hyph;4, and FC&hyph;5), none of these important measures has been fully adopted and submitted at this time. Table 3&hyph;3 of the CO plan projects VMT and CO emissions for each year through the attainment year. This table shows that CO emissions will decline each year through the year 2000, despite the predicted VMT growth. As a result, the CO plan does not need to include TCMs to offset growth in CO emissions. As discussed above, the CO plan would meet the attainment demonstration and progress requirements of the Act if the State adopts and submits an approvable enhanced I/M program. Until the attainment and RFP deficiencies are cured, it is not possible for EPA to find that the CO plan includes specific and enforceable TCMs that are sufficient, in conjunction with other measures, to meet the progress and attainment requirements of the Act. EPA therefore proposes to disapprove the plan with respect to the TCM requirement. Approval of an enhanced I/M program in the future would allow EPA to change this section 187(b)(2) disapproval to an approval. j. Fully adopted and enforceable control measures. The attainment demonstration relies upon SCAQMD and CARB stationary, area, and mobile controls adopted before July 1, 1990, and three additional controls: (1) CARB's Low-Emission Vehicles (LEV) and Clean Fuels Program (adopted September 1990); (2) CARB's California Wintertime Oxygenates Program and Phase 2 Gasoline Specifications (adopted November 1991); and (3) an Enhanced I/M Program. Except for the enhanced I/M program, all of the measures included in the attainment modeling analysis are fully adopted and enforceable. The plan also includes a group of 18 supplemental measures (Tables 4&hyph;1 and 4&hyph;2). Most of these measures have not yet been adopted in enforceable form, and the attainment demonstration does not claim credit for the potential reductions associated with the controls. If the measures are submitted by the State in approvable form, EPA will propose to approve them and assign them credit in the attainment demonstration. k. Implications of EPA's proposed action. EPA is proposing to disapprove in part the SIP revision submitted by the State of California on December 31, 1992, for the South Coast CO nonattainment area. If finalized, this disapproval would constitute a disapproval under section 179(a)(2) of the Act (see generally 57 FR 13566&hyph;13567). As provided under section 179(a) of the Act, the State would have up to 18 months after a final SIP disapproval to correct the deficiencies that are the subject of the disapproval before EPA is required to impose either the highway funding sanction or the requirement to provide two-to-one new source review offsets. If the State has not corrected its deficiency within 6 months thereafter, EPA must impose the second sanction. Any sanction EPA imposes must remain in place until EPA determines that the State has corrected the deficiency. 2. Ozone Rate of Progress Plan a. Statutory provisions and General Preamble requirements. The requirements for the 15 percent rate-of-progress plans appear in section 182(b)(1) of the Act, which describes how ozone nonattainment areas must achieve an actual VOC reduction of at least 15 percent during the first 6 years after enactment of the 1990 CAA Amendments (i.e., up to November 15, 1996). The General Preamble provides an overview of EPA's preliminary policy interpretation of this statutory requirement (see 57 FR 13507&hyph;13510, April 16, 1992). EPA has issued detailed guidance documents on the plan requirements, including: Guidance on the Adjusted Base Year Emissions Inventory and the 1996 Target for the 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans (EPA&hyph;452/R&hyph;92&hyph;005), and Guidance for Growth Factors, Projections, and Control Strategies for the 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans (EPA&hyph;452/R&hyph;93&hyph;002). The CAA requires that the 15 percent rate-of-progress plan be submitted by November 15, 1993. The plan must show an actual reduction in typical ozone season weekday VOC emissions of at least 15 percent for the period 1990&hyph;1996. 20 The reduction must be calculated from the 1990 baseline of actual emissions, adjusted in accordance with section 182(b)(1)(B), and must account for any net growth in emissions. Section 182(b)(1)(D) provides that reductions from the federal motor vehicle control program (FMVCP) as promulgated by January 1, 1990, or from the federal 9.0 Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) gasoline regulation may not count toward meeting the 15 percent reduction target. Also excluded from credit are ``fix-ups'' to VOC RACT rules or I/M programs to comply with prior statutory and regulatory requirements. 20 For the initial progress period (1990&hyph;1996), the Act specifies that the SIP must ``provide for volatile organic compound emission reductions .␣.␣. of at least 15 percent.␣.␣.␣.'' Section 182(b)(1)(A). NO x emission reductions may substitute for VOC reductions in subsequent progress demonstrations, in accordance with section 182(c)(2)(C) of the Act.
