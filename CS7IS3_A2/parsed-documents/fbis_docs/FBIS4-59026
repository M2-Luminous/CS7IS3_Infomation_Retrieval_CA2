The Iranian Charge d'Affaires in London, Gholamreza Ansari was called to the Foreign Office and handed a protest note by British officials. The Islamic Republic has denied the British allegation. Regardless of London's objection and Iran's denial, and considering the fact that influential Irish-Americans are the main suppliers of arms and money to the IRA, the question which begs for an answer is whether or not Britain or any other Western country has the right to question Iran's actions regarding adherence to internationally accepted conventions? From the Iranian point of view, Western countries have repeatedly ignored the spirit of international conventions which regulate relations between individual countries. The 1961 and 1963 Vienna Conventions requiring the observance of mutual diplomatic rules among nations and emphasizing the reciprocity of action regarding Consular staff and activities, have been openly ignored by the West through their overt and covert support for Iranian terrorist groups residing in their countries. Western powers, Britain among them, can not plead ignorance when it comes to the terrorist nature of anti-Iranian groups they harbor in the West, because all they have to do is to instruct their embassies in Tehran to monitor anti-Iranian radios who teach their elements inside the Islamic Republic how to manufacture home-made bombs and slaughter innocent Iranian citizens. The government of the Islamic Republic has been under increasing domestic public opinion pressure which questions the wisdom of Iran's policy of not allowing Bader-Meinhof, Direct Action, or the IRA to have offices in Tehran, while anti-Iranian terrorist groups enjoy almost full diplomatic rights in Bonn, Paris, and London. The Iranian public is consistently questioning the government why it adheres to international conventions regarding aiding and abetting terrorists when Western countries so openly and flagrantly ignore the same conventions. The damage, both in human and monetary terms, caused by anti-Iranian terrorist groups harbored, financed, and armed by Western countries, are huge compared to those caused by the three above-mentioned Western terrorist organizations. This latest baseless British protest over the Iran-IRA contact is but a smoke-screen to hide the fact that Western-based anti-Iranian terrorists are providing materiel and personnel to the Iraqi-based terrorists to attack targets inside the Islamic Republic. The British protests are also meant to cover up the fact that Western intelligence sources are encouraging these same anti-Iranian terrorists.
