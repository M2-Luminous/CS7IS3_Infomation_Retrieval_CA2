The almost legendary technological dissociation of those production areas from the rest of the national machine-building complex has already stirred increased interest toward the sector among outside investors. That same attractiveness, however, is serving as sufficient justification for sector officials to shield the enterprises from voucher privatization, i.e., privatization that is actually free. In that vein, the presidential ukase that was issued this past weekend on the privatization of NPO Energiya was, in essence, an ultima ratio denationalization of the military-industrial complex -- the inability to totally block the process of privatization is compensated for by reserving as federal property the controlling bloc of shares. One could say that the scientific-production association [NPO] Energiya is the best-known space firm in the world -- before the other "mailboxes" of the sector were declassified, it was that enterprise that was synonymous with the Soviet space program overall. In addition, all the contracts for the flights of Western specialists to the Soviet (now Russian) orbital stations Salyut and Mir were concluded with that NPO. The special status held by Energiya in the Russian space industry enabled enterprise officials to have a relationship special to them -- in November 1992, a draft of a governmental decree on the privatization of the NPO was sent to Goskomimushchestvo, and in January of last year, Viktor Chernomyrdin signed that decree. The document called for the organization of a new joint-stock company in the form of a holding company that would be made up of the head design bureau (in Kaliningrad), the experimental machine-building plant (in Kaliningrad), and the Volga and Primorsk affiliates (in Samara and the city of Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast). Preliminary estimates put the authorized capital for the holding company at about 1 billion rubles [R]. But it's obvious that the government couldn't set the leading enterprise of the sector "free" completely -- Energiya plays a key role in the manned space program. Ironically enough, complete denationalization of the enterprise wouldn't suit Russia's Western partners, either -- especially NASA. In the fall of last year, at a meeting between the first vice-premier Oleg Soskovets and the leadership of that organization, the representatives of the American side complained about the lack of coordination between the positions of the government and the NPO in terms of collaboration on the development of the orbital station Alpha. Oleg Soskovets promised to "settle" that problem. Thus, the presidential ukase that came out yesterday buried, once and for all, the initial hopes of NPO officials that they would be able to "buy back" from the government 26 percent of the shares of the mother company -- for three years, secured as federal property are 51 percent of the shares of the S. P. Korolev Russian Space Corporation Energiya (that's the full official name of the enterprise). But privatization of Energiya (which is due exclusively to the persistence of its leadership) could be virtually the only exception in the entire trend associated with the setting up of Russia's rocket-and-space complex -- a more popular idea in the government is to create, at the leading enterprises of the sector, federal space centers that would be completely under the control of the state and could not be privatized (at least, for vouchers). [Box] Sphere of Activity of the Russian Space Corporation Energiya: - - Creation and operation of an orbital complex consisting of the permanently manned Mir station and the transport craft Soyuz-TM and Progress M - Creation of the reusable space transportation system Energiya-Buran (operation of the system has been mothballed) - Creation of "orbital towcraft" -- upper stages for launchers (units D and DM) - Production of household goods, plus prostheses for the disabled
