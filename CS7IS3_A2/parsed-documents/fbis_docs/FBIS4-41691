Kolosova, and others] [Text] Russia's Foreign Ministry does not rule out that the date for a second ministerial meeting on a settlement in Bosnia can be agreed at a Contact Group's session in Paris on Tuesday [28 June]. As a senior Russian diplomat reported to Interfax on Monday, Russia will be represented at the gathering by the Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin. He confirmed that the second ministerial conference would most likely take place in Geneva, where the first gathering had been held. "It is to put an end to three years of drama in former Yugoslavia, a drama that has exasperated everyone in the world community", Churkin remarked. In his words, the Contact Group will look at alternative world community responses to refusal by one or both belligerents to a plan for territorial division in Bosnia, endorsed at the previous Geneva meeting, and it is not ruled out that UN may leave former Yugoslavia," Churkin said. In keeping with the plan, the Serbs who now control 70 percent of Bosnia, are to get 49, and the Moslems and Crates [as received] - 51 percent of the territory.
