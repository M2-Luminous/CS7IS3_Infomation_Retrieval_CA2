I am referring to the regulations on electoral matters issued by the U.S. Government agencies that operate in our country, based on the Panama Canal Treaties of 1977. Well prior to receiving your esteemed letter, I took particular interest in the case. Learning that Panamanian citizens who work for the Panama Canal Commission [PCC], U.S. military agencies, or any other U.S. Government agencies operating in our country based on the 1977 treaties are barred by a U.S. law that regulates their status as U.S. Government federal employees from running for office in the upcoming 8 January elections was sufficient reason to conduct a necessary and profound study of the topic, as well as to begin a series of consultations with accredited diplomatic officials of that country and the PCC, specifically, His Excellency Deane Hinton, U.S. ambassador to Panama, and PCC Administrator Gilberto Guardia, in addition to the consultations conducted by Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero and Foreign Ministry legal advisers who are knowledgeable of matters pertaining to the Panama Canal Treaties. By virtue of the 1977 treaties, the Republic of Panama, as a sovereign territory, conferred on the United States the right to manage, operate, and maintain the Panama Canal, its operations, installations, and auxiliary equipment, and to provide what was necessary for the fluid traffic of vessels through that Canal. The United States accepted the concession of rights and pledged to exercise them in conformity with the treaties and related agreements. (See Article III, No. 1 of the Panama Canal Treaties of 1977.) In addition to the aforementioned and to carry out the previously mentioned responsibilities, the treaty grants the United States of America a long string of rights to fulfill the treaty's goals. Among others, the right "to regulate relations with United States of America employees" stands out. This point does not differentiate the employees' nationalities. Furthermore, the mentioned legal instrument stipulates that the United States of America will fulfill its responsibilities through a U.S. Government agency called the "Panama Canal Commission." This commission is constituted in accordance and adherence to the laws of the United States of America and is a federal agency under the U.S. Executive Branch. As of 1 January 1990, the treaty states and as, in fact, has occurred, a Panamanian citizen will be appointed to the post of administrator. The Panamanian administrator is proposed by Panama but appointed by the United States of America. (See Article III, No.'s 2 (e), 3, and 3(c) of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty.) In my opinion, the foregoing, which I am sure was already known to you, sets the fundamental legal framework to understanding the reason for the subject under study. The importance to Panamanians of the current electoral process and the holding of free and honest elections on 8 May, is a well-known fact. They are the first elections to be held in freedom and amid an undeniable political pluralism in the country, after 21 years of a dictatorial government and the unclear manner -- to say the least -- in which the electoral processes were held prior to 1968. Furthermore, the current transition period from the dictatorship which was in power until 1989 to the democratic system we have today, has had to confront enormous problems and attempts were made to resolve them amid very pressing circumstances from all sides. One of those problems and the one that can serve as an example of the military government's irresponsibility is the issue of the Panama Canal and the areas and installations that reverted to Panama based on the treaty. Undoubtedly, during the next five years of government, regardless of who wins the elections, we will have to continue establishing the bases to face the transfer of the Canal to Panamanian hands in a responsible and efficient manner. Excuse me for this perhaps lengthy but necessary introduction, because I think that the issue at hand is directly related to that inevitable obligation that all Panamanians have, without exception, to receive the Canal on 31 December 1999 and to continue administering it in an autonomous and responsible fashion, aside from party or electoral interests. From this stems my interest in studying the history of the U.S. legislation which governs, in general terms, all U.S. Government agencies, including the Panama Canal Commission and the military agencies of that country operating in Panama by virtue of the treaties. In my opinion, if Panamanian employees working for U.S. Government agencies operating in Panama may or may not run for office, causes me to distinguish the problem between one that is strictly juridical and one that is juridical-political. The first one, namely the juridical, outlines the simple analysis of taking the instrument called the "Hatch Act" and its modifications in 1993, and thus consider, in light of the same, that the electoral participation is applicable to electoral processes within the territory of the Republic of Panama, where by virtue of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty several U.S. Government agencies operate. Without delving deeply into this matter, I believe that in the strict juridical sense, this provision is not applicable. Obviously, it is a federal law of that country which was conceived in response to an aim strictly in keeping with the United States and U.S. citizens' interests. Legislative history, however, raises similar questions on whether civil rights of U.S. public servants are restricted or not. The second one, the juridical-political question, is from where I find the main basis for my opinion. It is important to stress that by adopting this viewpoint, I relate the "political" term with the interest and spirit of protecting, in this case, the total independence of party and electoral politics of the institutional life of our future Canal Authority, which will come under our control within six years. The Authority's absolute noninvolvement in politics must continue to be considered a main pillar of the merit system that must prevail in the rendering of services by the labor component. Whether we like it or not, the labor relationship currently in effect in the Panama Canal Commission responds to U.S. interests and the Panamanian officials who work there operate under that condition. This is established by the treaties, despite our personal views on the matter. However, in an attempt to be honest with myself and in light of the responsibilities of my official position and the national moment, I do not think it is prudent to separate the juridical analysis from the great national interest that we must preserve, which is to keep politics outside of the current Commission and future Panama Canal Authority. The certainly justified aspiration of a small group of Panamanian PCC employees to run for elective office is worth a review, taking into consideration the impact this may have on the future on that entity's nonpolitical stance. If this concept does not prevail, in view of the high regard with which we must assess our national interest regarding the Panama Canal, we may be sharing the responsibility for opening a door that may mean the beginning of the end of the professional management which based on merit governs that important institution. Seeking a parallel situation with respect to Panamanian laws that try to keep major institutions from becoming politicized, I found several that partially or totally deal with the political rights or participation in elective office of Panamanians. One of those laws, and it is related to the Panama Canal, is Law No. 5 dated 25 February 1993 which creates the Interoceanic Region Authority and adopts measures on reverted properties. When referring to its board members, Article 8 of said law states: "They may not run for elective office." One need not go into the merit that such limitations on the exercise of the rights of these citizens has within the context of the function that said entity must perform in this final transition period. On electoral matters, Article 25 of the Elections Code partially limits the rights of a series of public officials that have held certain posts or at any time are nominated to elective office up to a period of six months before the elections or the date in which they were nominated by a convention of the respective parties, provided the conventions were held prior to that six-month period. That is the case that currently governs ministers, deputy ministers, managers and deputy managers, directors and deputy directors of autonomous or semiautonomous state entities, Supreme Court justices, Electoral Tribunal magistrates, and others. One need not also mention or analyze the national interest that this partial restriction seeks to protect. Regarding judicial officials, Article 49 of the Judicial Code does not allow Judicial Branch employees, even if they are on leave or temporarily absent from their jobs for whatever reason: "2. To participate in politics, except to vote in official elections or referenda." On this matter, one need not say what the nomination of the administration of justice has meant in the recent past. [sentence as published] With these three examples I have wanted to compare a national legal reality where the exercise of clear civilian and political rights are prohibited as they are incompatible at a given time with a given public post. I acknowledge that we are not dealing with a national law -- in case that causes your concern -- but with a general situation that is applied to Panamanian citizens given their status as U.S. Government federal employees. This is legally based on the rights agreed upon in favor of that nation in the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty. Nevertheless, the future national interest -- which I believe is important to guard -- is to continue fostering the nonpoliticization of the current PCC and of the future Canal Authority. In light of the treaty, the interpretation given by the Canal Commission authorities and other U.S. Government agencies that operate in Panama is correct. The only restriction applied, in view of the aforementioned "Hatch Act," is that Panamanians who work there cannot be candidates to public elected posts while they are federal employees of those agencies. The other rights to participate in politics and to actively participate in political parties are not restricted, as long as this is not exercised during work hours or with that government's official resources. I must confess that I have thought over this reply a great deal and thought about the nonconformity it may produce in you and in other citizens or political groups of our nation. Nevertheless, my position as foreign relations minister, as a lawyer, and as a Panamanian forced me to analyze the facts with the care required under the circumstances. Above all, I hope that the position I am currently adopting, which may be criticized by many, will serve for reflection by the whole nation on the vital importance to Panama of keeping the Panama Canal removed from political party passions and decisions. This was the main cause of the absolute collapse of our republican institutionalization in the recent past, which we hope will never return to our nation.
