The paper says in its editorial today that the Lebanese Government first asked the Baghdad Government to lift the diplomatic immunity of the perpetrators of the crime so they could be brought to trial. When the Iraqi Foreign Ministry refused, Lebanon immediately announced the severance of diplomatic ties with Iraq. AL-AKHBAR adds that this incident reaffirms the Iraqi regime's continued involvement in terrorist acts and President Saddam Husayn's insistence on continuing to liquidate his opponents abroad. The incident also reaffirms that any attempt to improve ties with the Iraqi regime or to have confidence in it is useless. In conclusion, the paper says it is regrettable that the assassination of the Iraqi opposition figure in Beirut came at a time when some have been calling for Arab unity and Arab solidarity.
