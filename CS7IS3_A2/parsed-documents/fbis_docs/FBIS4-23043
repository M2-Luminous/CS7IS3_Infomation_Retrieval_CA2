Kofanov, Colloidal Chemistry and Hydrochemistry Institute, Kiev; UDC628.162] [Abstract] Micro-quantities of organo-chlorine compounds in river water, often exceeding the maximum allowable concentration, ends up in drinking water, since communal water treatment facilities are not designed to remove them. A major portion of these organo-chlorine compounds originate from pesticides, even those which have not been used for several years since they gradually wash out from the ground water and enter the system. A secondary source of organo-chlorine compounds in potable water is side reactions of chlorine in water with aqueous humus and organic substances entering river water from ground water deposits. These include chloromethanes, polychlorophenols, and chlorophenolic acid. Experience in France, Germany, England, and USA shows that the single most dependable means for eliminating organo-chlorine compounds from drinking water is filtration through an activated charcoal, such as Filtrasorb-200 (Calgon Corp.) or Chemviron (Belgium). Satisfactory results have been obtained from an anthracitic charcoal produced in Ukraine, Akant-Mezo, developed at the Colloidal Chemistry and Hydrochemistry Institute. In the present work data are presented on total specific surface, meso-pore specific surface, and distribution of specific mesopore surface at radius limits of 1-4 nm in activated charcoals used in water treatment, KAD, AG-3, AG-PR, activated anthracite AUA, Akant-Mezo, and Filtrasorbs 100-400. From all indications, Akant-Mezo meets the requirements for deep treatment of water. Filtration of clear river water and tap water contaminated with hexachlorocyclohexane in concentrations of 35-43 micrograms per liter through a 0.3 meter column of Akant-Mezo, lowered the hexachlorocyclohexane concentration 350-400 times. The residual concentration was ï¿½ 0.1 microgram per liter. This meets the most rigid European standards for PDK of organo-chlorine pesticides in drinking water. References 13: 4 Russian, 9 Western.
