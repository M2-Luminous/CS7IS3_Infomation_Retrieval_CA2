He said: Talks with President Bill Clinton were the most important stage of the visit and determined the prospects for the development of bilateral relations. An accord has been reached to take additional practical steps in order to promote these relations in many spheres. Signing of the charter on democratic partnership between Kazakhstan and the United States means a new stage of cooperation aimed at ensuring peace and stability in the entire Central Asian region. As the result of the talks, a number of other documents have been signed which regulate contacts in the fields of science, technology, defense and military relations, and nuclear safety, and open up broad access for foreign investment in the economy of our country. Nursultan Nazarbayev answered numerous questions from journalists. He stressed that in new Kazakh-U.S. relations, not a single step has been taken that contradicts previous agreements between the CIS states. This is what the president said when answering a question on what the United States will get from economic cooperation with Kazakhstan: [Begin Nazarbayev recording] I tell you again -- I have been saying this for three years -- nobody in the world, not a single businessman, not a single billionaire, will give a cent to anyone for nothing, besides, of course technical help, educational help, international funds, humanitarian aid and so on. Any person will come here only if he will earn more than he is earning in America. Is this [words indistinct] in the transition period we have to create favorable conditions for them so that they will come here. We will have to lose something in order to gain something. Some people in our country sometimes say that we are selling these resources and so on and so forth -- every state sells what it has. Kuwait is selling its oil and living normally, developing production. Saudi Arabia is selling its oil and living normally. Iran and Iraq are selling their oil and living normally. What we are planning now is for 100 years to come. I hope that in 50 years mankind will find a source of energy that will not pollute the streets with gasoline and [words indistinct]. Japanese cars are using batteries already. That is why it is not right to say that we have to save all these minerals. Who will need them? We must sell what is sellable now in order to get currency and to develop Kazakhstan, to build up living standards for all our citizens. That is what we must do. [end recording]
