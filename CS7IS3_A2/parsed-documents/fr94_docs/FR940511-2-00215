FR940511-2-00215 FR940511-2-00129 Part I&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a. Which members of the research group and/or institution will be responsible for contacting potential participants and for describing the study to them? What procedures will be used to avoid potential conflicts of interest if the investigator is also providing medical care to potential subjects? Part I&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b. Where will discussions or other means of informing individuals about the proposed study take place? Part I&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;c. How will the major points covered in Parts I&hyph;A through I&hyph;C of the Points to Consider be disclosed to potential participants and/or their parents or guardians in language that is understandable to them? Part I&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;d. What is the length of time that the potential participants will have to make a decision about their participation in the study? Part I&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;e. If the study involves pediatric or mentally handicapped subjects, how will the assent of each person be obtained? Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2. Informed Consent Document ``Investigators submitting human gene transfer proposals for Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee review must include the Informed Consent document as approved by the local Institutional Review Board. A separate consent document should be used for the gene transfer portion of a research project when gene transfer is used as an adjunct in the study of another technique, such as when the gene is used as a `marker' or when it is used to enhance the power of immunotherapy for cancer. ``Because of the relative novelty of the procedures that are used, the potentially irreversible consequences of the procedures performed, and the possibility that many of the potential risks remain undefined, the Informed Consent document shall include the following specific information in addition to any requirements of the DHHS regulations for the protection of human subjects (45 CFR part 46). Indicate if each of the specified items appears in the consent form or, if not in the consent form, how those items will be presented to potential subjects. Include an explanation if any of the following items is omitted from the consent process or document. Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a. General Requirements of Human Subjects Research Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(1). Description/purpose of study. ``The subjects should be provided a detailed explanation in non-technical language of the purpose of the study and the procedures associated with the conduct of the proposed study, including a description of the gene-transfer component. Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(2). Alternatives. ``The consent form should indicate the availability of other therapies, including the possibility of other investigational therapies and approaches. Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(3). Voluntary participation. ``The subjects should be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that failure to participate in the study, or withdrawal of consent, will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which the subjects are otherwise entitled. Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(4). Benefits. ``The subjects should be provided with an accurate description of the possible benefits, if any, of participating in the proposed study. For experiments which are not reasonably expected to provide a therapeutic benefit to subjects, the consent form shall clearly state that no direct clinical benefit to subjects is expected to occur as a result of participation in the study, although knowledge may be gained that may benefit others. Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(5). Possible risks, discomforts, and side effects. ``There should be a clear itemization in the consent form of types of adverse experiences, the relative severities, and the expected frequencies. For consistency of definition, side effects that are listed as mild should be ones which do not require a therapeutic intervention. Moderate side effects require an intervention. Severe side effects are potentially fatal or life-threatening, disabling, or require prolonged hospitalization. Rare side effects occur in less than one in one thousand subjects, uncommon side effects in less than 1% of subjects, common side effects in one to 10% of subjects, and frequent side effects are those which occur in more than 10% of subjects.
