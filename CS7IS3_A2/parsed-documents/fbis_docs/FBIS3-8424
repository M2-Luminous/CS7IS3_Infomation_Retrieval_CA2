Landsmanschaft Spokesman Franz Neubauer said in an interview for MLADA FRONTA DNES that Sudeten Germans must insist on their idea of collective compensation. "It is not all right for Prime Minister Klaus to try to provide compensation only on an individual basis," Neubauer said. "If we recognized the rights of individuals, the government would have to decide whether to provide compensation to Neubauer, for example. I do not believe that they would decide in my favor. This is why we want collective solutions." [Harantova] Klaus's concept is completely unacceptable to you, then? [Neubauer] We would be prepared to accept even this alternative if Klaus would waive, in his new concept, the condition for granting Czech citizenship being knowledge of the Czech language and five years of residence. Even this would always have to be connected with some administrative action on the Czech side, which would make the right to return more general. If this is not what Klaus meant, I do not understand why he spoke about his new concept. [Harantova] Let us suppose that, despite the individual solutions, we found a certain way and some Sudeten Germans wanted to settle here as Czech citizens and claim their property rights. What would happen then? [Neubauer] There are many fields without owners in your country. Some of them lie fallow and the rest are collectivized. My mother comes from a small village near Karlovy Vary. Certain houses have disappeared, and, in the rest, I saw some Gypsies. All of it belongs to a collective farm--that is, the state. [Harantova] The fields should be returned to their original German owners? [Neubauer] If they want them, yes. The remaining property, whose original owners were Germans, could be used to establish a fund. From this fund, compensation could be paid out to those people whose houses have been demolished or sold to Czech owners. Again, I am stressing, we do not want to expel anyone. This would not be the correct way to begin a new coexistence. It is impossible to reduce the entire problem only to property issues. First, we have to eliminate distrust and speak again. Why does your policy not have the courage to stand up to the communists? Why is it impossible to abolish the law of May 1946 whereby crimes committed against Germans and Hungarians after the war were amnestied? In fact, this would have little impact--those are affairs of 50 years ago--but it would be a nice gesture of goodwill. [Harantova] Do you consider the restitution of Jewish property to be a precedent? [Neubauer] The problem of restitution shows that the inflexible conditions given by your restitution laws are unacceptable. This has become apparent in the problem of church, Jewish, and Sudeten German property. From the legal point of view, these three problems are equal. Is it possible to consider only injustices that occurred during communist rule? What about injustice before the communists? Is injustice done by communists worse than other injustices?
