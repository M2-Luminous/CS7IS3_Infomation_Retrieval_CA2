Two colonels and two lieutenant colonels, representatives of the Argentine and Uruguayan Armies, concluded several days of meetings at Army Headquarters in Montevideo. During the meetings, they agreed to "cooperate between the two Armies" to train the future UN officers. The agreement put an end to a dispute between Argentina's Carlos Menem and Uruguay's Luis Alberto Lacalle, who were disputing the seat of an eventual regional school for the Blue Helmets' military training. The agreement includes the bilateral exchange of military trainers who will offer training courses to the Latin American Armed Forces officers assigned to UN peace missions. The training courses will take place in both Argentina and Uruguay. The Uruguayan Armed Forces have a unit of more than 1,100 men at the service of the United Nations in Mozambique, Western Sahara, Cambodia, Kashmir, and on the Egyptian-Israeli border, while Argentina has 1,200 men in UN Blue Helmet units.
