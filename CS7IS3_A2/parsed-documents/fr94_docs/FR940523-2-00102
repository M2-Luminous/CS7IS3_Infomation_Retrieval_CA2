FR940523-2-00102 FR940523-2-00057 [Docket No. 50&hyph;458] Entergy Operations, Inc.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;47 issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee) for operation of the River Bend Station located in St. Francisville, Louisiana. The proposed amendment would revise the technical specifications (TSs) by removing component lists from the TSs in accordance with NRC Generic Letter (GL) 91&hyph;08 and by removing the schedule for withdrawal of reactor vessel material specimen capsules from the TSs in accordance with GL 91&hyph;01. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? The proposed change will not result in any hardware or operating changes. The proposed change is based upon Generic Letters 91&hyph;01 and 91&hyph;08 and merely removes component lists, removes details relating to the component lists, provides clarifying information supporting the removal of the component listings, or removes details (which are considered administrative) that are no longer applicable to the Technical Specifications. The components listed in the affected Technical Specifications are assumed in the mitigation of accident and transient events. The removal of tabular component listings from the Technical Specifications does not impact affected component OPERABILITY requirements. Technical Specifications will continue to require the components to be OPERABLE. Action statements and surveillance requirements for the components will also remain in the Technical Specifications. The tabular component lists are relocated to the Technical Requirements Manual which will be in accordance with the change control provisions specified in the Administrative Controls Section of the Technical Specifications (Specification 6.5.2). Therefore, this change is administrative in nature and does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? The proposed change does not necessitate a physical alteration of the plant (no new or different type of equipment will be installed) or changes to parameters governing normal plant operation. The proposed change will not impose any different requirements and adequate control of information will be maintained. No new failure modes are introduced. Therefore, this proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? The proposed change will not reduce a margin of safety because it has no impact on any safety analysis assumption. The proposed changes do not alter the scope of equipment currently required to be OPERABLE or subject to surveillance testing, nor do the proposed changes affect any instrument setpoints or equipment safety functions. Therefore the change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involved no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
