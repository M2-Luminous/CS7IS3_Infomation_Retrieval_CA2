The week-long tour will take him to Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan. Talking to newsmen before his departure, he said Pakistan would offer Central Asian republics to open up their embassies in Islamabad to help boost bilateral cooperation. Pakistan has already concluded about 38 agreements with these states for strengthening cooperation in a number of fields. He said no progress could be made on the agreements due to lack of follow up, and during his current visit he would try to remove blockages and revitalize them. Special attention would be paid to matters relating to trade, transport, and communications. He said Pakistan and China have agreed to sign an agreement to make Karakoram Highway a viable road and there is a plan to open it up for Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in future.
