Sung and Rain Ren] [Text] The fate of Hong Kong's new airport hangs in the balance, with China virtually calling off further talks on the project following the government's decision to inject additional funds without Beijing's blessing. Xinhua News Agency local branch deputy director Zhang Junsheng warned yesterday there was little hope of resuming talks on airport financing, because Britain had breached Sino-British agreements on financing the project. The government will ask legislators tomorrow to approve a $1.6 billion cash injection which will give the go-ahead for urgent airport contracts, and allow the project to be completed by its mid- 1997 target date. China has labelled the move as a violation of the Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport (MOU), and accused the Hong Kong government of taking unilateral action on financing. Mr. Zhang hinted that the Airport Committee (AC) under the Sino- British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) was unlikely to resume talks on airport financing. "We wish the British side would handle the matter by strictly abiding by the principles of MOU," Mr. Zhang said. "However, the British always play tricks and give trouble in everything." Governor Chris Patten said last week China had not responded to calls for further talks through the JLG. But in a contradictory statement, a senior Chinese official said China had never refused Britain's requests to hold Airport Committee talks. "We may not agree to their funding proposal, but we have never refused to have meetings," the official said. In her first day as Acting Governor, Anson Chan said the government still held out hope that the Airport Committee would resume talks. "We hope to continue to have a dialogue with the Chinese, to come to an early agreement on the financing so that we can get ahead and build this airport that everybody says we need," she said. The JLG Airport Committee has not had a meeting since last August.
