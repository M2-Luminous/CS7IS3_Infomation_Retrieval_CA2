Debating with Left Democrat leader Achille Occhetto, his main electoral rival, Berlusconi was asked about a declaration from an imprisoned Mafia boss late in February who said Sicilian organised crime would be voting for Berlusconi. The Milan-based tycoon, who threw his hat into the political ring in January, first said he thought it was impossible to speculate if the Mafia would vote in any one way. When asked for an outright disclaimer, he then said he failed to see how a party entering an election for the first time could be accused of links with the Mafia; then remarked that "anyone can say they are going to vote for anyone else," leading Occhetto, a major figure in the Progressive Alliance fighting Berlusconi and the right-wingers, to comment: "I take note that, three times over, no response was forthcoming." The radio debate, a transcript of which was released yesterday evening, went on the air amidst allegations to Go Italy's left, from the moderate conservatives to radical leftists, that ancien regime figures and ties are being recycled in the new party's ranks, especially thanks to Berlusconi's long-standing relationship with ex-Premier Bettino Craxi and his discredited Socialist Party. At the same time, rumours began circulating yesterday evening that Marcello Dell`Utri, managing-director of Berlusconi's advertising arm Publitalia, and already under investigation in Milan with others for false company accounting, had been linked by a Mafia state's witness to organised crime bosses. Judicial sources would say only that Mafia boss Salvatore Cancemi had been questioned recently by prosecutors from various Italian cities, but refused to specify about what. The chief prosecutor in Caltanisetta, Sicily, Giovanni Tinebra, added today that the alleged links made with Cancemi's testimony were "absolutely gratuitous." Tinebra also joined the school of judicial thinking that takes Cancemi's disclosures with a strong pinch of salt. The turncoat, whose codename is Omega, has yet to be admitted to the official witness protection programme. Usually reliable judicial and investigative sources in Rome said, however, that questioning of other Mafia witnesses seemed to corroborate Cancemi's claims. Other reports from judicial circles in Palermo said that one line of investigation against Dell`Utri claims he was responsible for recycling Mafia drug trafficking funds. Allegations of links between Berlusconi, Dell`Utri and the Mafia date back to the 1980s. Testimony from Berlusconi in June 1987 confirmed that, in 1975, Dell`Utri got Berlusconi to give a suspected Mafia drug trafficker, Vittorio Mangano, a job as bailiff at his villa at Arcore near Milan. Other testimony from a financier, Filippo Rapisarda, reported conversations in late 1978 in which one Mafia boss, Domenico Teresi, visiting the office of Rapisarda's then partner Dell`Utri, told him Berlusconi had suggested he should enter a partnership with him in a private TV station, in an operation "worth 10 billion lire." 1978 was about the time when Berlusconi started building his TV and media empire. Fighting these and other allegations such that Sicilian branches of his department store chain, Standa, are run jointly with Mafia figures, Berlusconi, arriving for a Go Italy rally at Palermo's Mediterranean Fair, pledged that the votes his party receives "in Sicily, Campania, Calabria and throughout Italy" would all be votes against the Mafia. He also voiced his "deep appreciation" for churchmen whom he described as "heroes" in the front line against organised crime, a reference to yesterday's slaying of a priest near Naples. Over 7,000 supporters were reported as attending the rally for which Berlusconi's TV networks created a live nationwide tie-up. Figures released by the Berlusconi polling institute, Diakron, for March 1, before the publication ban on poll results, claimed about 30 percent of the vote for Go Italy and 40 percent in Sicily. Other polls have cited Go Italy at 20.25 percent nationwide. In other points, Berlusconi answered northern demands for federalism by saying that Italy will enjoy growth only if "North and South march together."
