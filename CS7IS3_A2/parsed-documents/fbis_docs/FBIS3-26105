Informed sources said yesterday Bishop Su Zhimin of Baoding, Hebei Province, had returned home last Saturday [30 January]. The sources said Trappist Father Placidus Pei Ronggui of Shijiazhuang and the clandestinely ordained Bishop Jia Zhiguo of Hebei had also "gone back home safely". Sources said Bishop Su, 62, was taken away by public security officers early last month after he had had a meeting with US Congressmen Christopher Smith. It is not clear why Chinese authorities detained Bishop Jia and Father Pei at about the same time, but sources believed their detention was related to contact with foreigners. The trio are well-known figures in the underground Catholic Church and their "disappearance" was an embarrassment to Beijing because it coincided with the visit by US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bensten to Beijing last month. Meanwhile, Chinese authorities confirmed yesterday to foreign diplomats they were keeping Catholic priest Zhang Li in a labour re-education centre in Hebei Province. Released in March last year, Father Zhang was rearrested in June. Catholic sources said he was serving a three-year sentence in a reform-through-education centre in Zhangjiakou in Hebei. The confirmation by Beijing is considered unusual because Father Zhang is apparently not on any foreign government's lists of political prisoners.
