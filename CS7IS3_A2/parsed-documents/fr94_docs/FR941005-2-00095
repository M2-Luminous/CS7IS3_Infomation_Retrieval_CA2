FR941005-2-00095 FR941005-2-00063 III. Background on the Navajo Nation's Certification of Coal Completion By letter dated May 4, 1994, the President of the Navajo Nation notified the Secretary that the Navajo Nation intends to reclaim all remaining eligible abandoned coal mines, including interim abandoned coal mines, as required by section 403(a) of SMCRA (administrative record No. NA&hyph;213). OSM is aware there are eligible abandoned coal mines on Navajo Indian lands yet to be reclaimed by the Navajo Nation. However, the Nation has sufficient AMLR funds in reserve to reclaim the remaining eligible abandoned coal mines. The Navajo Nation also submitted a grant application to OSM that, upon approval of the proposed amendment, will enable it to reclaim those mines. In addition, the Navajo Nation submitted a request for the Secretary's concurrence with its certification of completion of all known coal-related problems pursuant to section 411(a) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 875.13. The Secretary's concurrence with the certification was published in the September 27, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 49178). IV. Museum Funding Request Section 411 of SMCRA provides that once a State or Tribe certifies that it will address all remaining abandoned coal mine problems, and the Secretary concurs, then that State or Tribe may request funds to undertake abandoned noncoal mine reclamation, community impact assistance, and public facilities projects under sections 411 (b), (e), and (f), respectively. The Navajo Nation President and the Navajo Museum and Library Foundation, Inc., first expressed interest in obtaining OSM funds for the museum under section 411(f) in late June and early July 1993. OSM informed the Navajo Nation at that time and on a number of occasions since of the administrative requirements that the Nation must fulfill before OSM can consider a funding request under section 411(f) of SMCRA. Those requirements included: Revising the Navajo Nation's AMLR plan to include provisions authorizing NAMLRD to reclaim remaining eligible abandoned interim coal mines and to undertake projects under sections 411 (e) and (f); certifying that all remaining abandoned coal mine problems will be addressed; submitting an application for funds to reclaim all remaining eligible abandoned coal mine problems; and submitting an application for funds for the museum. Anticipating that those administrative requirements would be fulfilled, the Museum Foundation developed a grant application that NAMLRD submitted to OSM on January 21, 1994, requesting $3 million from the Navajo Nation's share of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to partially pay for construction of the museum. NAMLRD submitted the application because it is the recipient of AMLR funds from OSM for abandoned mine reclamation, community impact assistance, and public facilities projects pursuant to sections 411 (b), (e), and (f) of SMCRA. The Museum Foundation would be a subrecipient if the grant request for $3 million is approved. Under the provisions of section 411(f), the President of the Navajo Nation has determined there is a need for such a public facility related to the coal and minerals industry. According to the application, the museum will display Navajo crafts and culture materials in order to preserve the culture for future generations. It will include demonstration areas in the museum where traditional Navajo arts and crafts will be made. A children's museum and library will also be available. A visitor center will display art and photographs of historical and sacred places on or near the Navajo Reservation and an exhibit showing the impact of coal and minerals mining in the growth and development of the Navajo Nation. The total cost of the museum is estimated to be about $7.85 million. OSM's formal review of the grant application requesting the museum funding will be conducted in the context of the regulations at 30 CFR 875.15. Specific provisions applicable to the museum request include sections 875.15(e) (1) through (7). Those regulations require the application to specifically set forth: (1) The need or urgency for the activity or the construction of the public facility; (2) the expected impact the project will have on the coal or minerals industry in the State or Indian Tribe; (3) the availability of funding from other sources and, if other funding is provided, its percentage of the total costs involved; (4) documentation from other local, State, and Federal agencies with oversight for such utilities or facilities regarding what funding resources they have available and why this specific project is not being fully funded by their agency; (5) the impact on the State or Indian Tribe, the public, and the minerals industry if the activity or facility is not funded; (6) the reason why this project should be selected before a priority project relating to the protection of the public health and safety or the environment from the damages caused by past mining activities, and (7) an analysis and review of the procedures used by the State or Indian Tribe to notify and involve the public in this funding request and a copy of all comments received and their resolution by the State or Indian Tribe. In accordance with 30 CFR 875.15(f), the OSM Director must prepare a Federal Register notice regarding the museum funding request and provide for public comments. Section 875.15(f) further requires OSM to evaluate all comments received and to determine whether the funding meets the requirements of sections 875.15(e) (1) through (7) and if it is in the best interests of NAMLRD's program. If OSM concludes that the museum request satisfies all the requirements of section 875.15, OSM will approve the funding request at a cost commensurate with its benefits toward achieving the purposes of SMCRA. V. Public Comment Procedures In accordance with 30 CFR 875.15(f), OSM is seeking public comments on the museum funding request. Written comments should be specific and should pertain to the museum request in the context of the regulations at 30 CFR 875.15 and the provisions of section 411 of SMCRA. Comments should include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under DATES or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in OSM's final decision or included in the administrative record. Dated: September 29, 1994. Ed Kay, Deputy Director, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24608 Filed 10&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;05&hyph;M
