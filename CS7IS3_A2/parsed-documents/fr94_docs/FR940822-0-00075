FR940822-0-00075 FR940822-0-00021 (b) Volumes of appendages shall be included in the total volume. (c) Volumes of spaces open to the sea may be excluded from the total volume. §135.16 Measurement and calculation. (a) All measurements used in the calculation of volumes shall be taken to the nearest centimeter or one-twentieth of a foot. (b) The volumes shall be calculated by generally accepted methods for the space concerned and with an accuracy acceptable to the Commission. (c) The calculation shall be sufficiently detailed to permit easy checking. Subpart C_Warships, Dredges and Floating Drydocks §135.21 Warships, dredges and floating drydocks to present documents stating displacement tonnage. All warships, dredges and floating drydocks shall present documents stating accurately the tonnage of displacement at each possible mean draft. The term ``warship'' means any vessel of government ownership that is being employed by its owners for military or naval purposes and shall include armed coast guard vessels and vessels devoted to naval training purposes, but shall not include naval auxiliary vessels such as tankers, ammunition ships, refrigerator ships, repair ships, tenders or vessels used to transport general military supplies. (Approved by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control number 3207&hyph;0001) §135.22 Tolls on warships, dredges and floating drydocks levied on actual displacement. The toll on warships, dredges and floating drydocks shall be based upon their tonnage of actual displacement at the time of their application for passage through the Canal. The actual displacement of these vessels shall be determined in a manner acceptable to the Commission and shall be expressed in tons of 2240 pounds. Should any of these vessels not have on board documents from which the displacement can be determined, Commission officials may use any practicable method to determine the displacement tonnage for assessment of tolls. Subpart D_Transitional Relief Measures §135.31 Transitional relief measures. Transitional relief measures as specified in §135.13(b) shall be applied to a vessel which has made a transit of the Panama Canal between March 23, 1976 and September 30, 1994, inclusive, and has not had a significant structural change as defined in §135.14(c) since the last transit during the above period. Any significant structural change made after the granting of transitional relief measures shall disqualify a vessel for further relief, and the vessel shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of §135.13(a). Transitional relief measures are applied to the vessel during its entire active service life as long as the vessel does not undergo a significant structural change. Vessels subject to transitional relief measures shall present their existing Panama Canal Tonnage Certificate on their first transit after September 30, 1994. Vessels subject to relief measures shall not be required to present an ITC 69 or any other total volume certification. (Approved by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control number 3207&hyph;0001) Subpart E_Alternative Method for Measurement of Vessels §135.41 Measurement of vessels when volume information is not available. When an ITC 69 or suitable substitute is not presented or the certificate or substitute presented does not have an accuracy acceptable to the Commission, vessels shall be measured in a manner which includes the entire cubical contents as required by the definition of total volume and enclosed spaces. The Commission shall endeavor to determine an accurate total volume of the vessel using the best information available at the time of the determination. The total volume shall be calculated by generally accepted methods for the space concerned and with an accuracy acceptable to the Commission. §135.42 Measurement of vessels when tonnage cannot be otherwise ascertained. (a) Vessels without an ITC 69, a suitable substitute or documentation from which to calculate total volume shall be measured as follows: (1) The volume of structures above the upper deck may be determined by any accepted method or combination of methods. These methods include but are not limited to simple geometric formulas, Simpson's rules, and other standard mathematical formulas. If special procedures are used, they should be identified. In all cases, measurements and calculations should be sufficiently detailed to permit easy review. (2) The volume of the hull below the upper deck (UDV) shall be determined as follows: (i) The formula: UDV= { 0.91 × [(LOA × MB) × (D^SLD)]} + (SLDISP/1.025) Where: UDV=Total volume of all enclosed spaces below the upper deck in cubic meters. LOA=The Length overall, i.e., the length of the ship in meters from the foremost to the aftermost points, including a bulbous bow if present. MB=Moulded breadth in meters as defined in §135.12(c). D=Moulded depth in meters as defined in §135.12(b). SLD=Summer loaded draft (in meters), i.e., the maximum depth to which the vessel's hull may be immersed when in a summer zone. SLDISP=Summer loaded displacement, i.e., the actual weight in metric tons of the water displaced by the vessel when immersed to her SLD. (ii) If §135.42(a)(2)(i) proves unworkable, the total volume of the hull below the upper deck shall be determined by multiplying the product of the LOA, MB and D by the appropriate coefficient listed in the following table: ␣ 1LOA in meters 1Coefficient 0 to 30 .7150 > 30 to 60 .7250 > 60 to 90 .7360 > 90 to 120 .7453 > 120 to 150 .7328 > 150 to 180 .7870 > 180 to 210 .8202 > 210 to 240 .7870 > 240 to 270 .7328 > 270 .7453
