The Electronics Industry Ministry (MEI) describes China's integrated circuit sector as being about 15 years behind international standards. Without effective measures, they warn, China will fall even further behind. Last year, the country's 15 manufacturers produced 170 million sets of integrated circuits, only 0.4 per cent of the world total. Lacking capital investment, the industry has crawled along over the past decade, MEI officials said in a recent interview. By contrast, the United States, Japan, Western Europe, South Korea and Taiwan have all injected billions of dollars into their industries. Integrated circuits serve as the brain for most electronic projects. They are also the most difficult piece of electronics to manufacture. In 1990, the government realized the strategic importance of integrated circuits and worked out an ambitious development programme. The ministry hoped to invest 3 billion yuan ($345 million) to improve their technology and manufacturing capabilities. However, government officials acknowledge that the programme has not gone smoothly. Hi-tech equipment has been tough to import because of restrictions on the transfer of strategic Western technology imposed by the now-defunct Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control. The State has revised its strategy to rely more on producing integrated circuits domestically, officials said. MEI will try to spur industry growth by 30 per cent annually in the coming years. Its target is to produce 1 billion integrated circuits by year 2000. They noted that some factors favour the development of the industry. Integrated circuit production will be stimulated by the ministry's intensified efforts to develop programme-controlled telephone exchanges, video cassette recorders, fax machines, copy machines and mobile telephones. China is also proceeding with the three "Golden Projects" to form a national information network, which would create a massive market for integrated circuits. China will need about 2 billion to 3 billion integrated circuits by 2000. The ministry has set up 10 design and development centres and plans 30 to 40 more. With the recent demise of the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control, importing technology and equipment will be easier, officials said. In March, Huajing Electronics Company of Jiangsu Province signed a contract with American chipmaker Intel Corp to assemble 386 microprocessors. The ministry hopes in a few years to form some large companies each with annual production exceeding 100 million integrated circuits.
