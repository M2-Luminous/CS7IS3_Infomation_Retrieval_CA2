Tim Eggar, the energy minister, published the revised costs in a parliamentary answer yesterday, when most MPs had left for the weekend. Detailed engineering studies suggested that nuclear liabilities at UKAEA [UK Atomic Energy Authority], the former atomic energy authority, amounted to 8 billion pounds, Mr Eggar said. However, "the total cost could lie in the range 6 billion pounds to 12 billion pounds." The figures compare with decommissioning liabilities estimated at 3 billion pounds to 4 billion pounds in 1990. UKAEA has been divided in two, because ministers hope to introduce legislation to pave the way for a sale of AEA Technology, the engineering arm, in October. Decommissioning liabilities will stay with the UKAEA government division and be met by the taxpayer. Derek Pooley, the division's chief executive, said the unique nature of each research reactor posed problems that were greater than expected, and the rundown of the research programme highlighted maintenance costs previously ignored. UKAEA is responsible for decommissioning a host of experimental facilities, including reactors at Dounreay, Harwell, Windscale and Winfrith that have been used to produce fuel for nuclear weapons or as prototypes for electricity generation. Most of them were built between 30 and 50 years ago. "These facilities were built with not nearly enough thought about what you would do with them when you no longer need them," Mr Pooley said.
