This notice expands the amendment to include the following land exchange. The Bureau of Land Management proposes exchanging 120.00 acres of Federal Surface estate to the Meissner Ranches Incorporated for 125.27 acres of private land. The Public land is legally described as S1/2SE1/4 Section 19, SE1/4NE1/4 Section 20, T. 29 N., R. 7 E., P.M.M., Liberty County, Montana.
