[Sanin] After a complete collapse of the Berlin Wall, we do not have the proper political or legal instruments for a bilateral and multilateral relationship between Latin America and these countries of eastern Europe. [Arizmendi] What can you tell us about President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Colombia? [Sanin] He was interested in visiting Latin America, especially Colombia, but obviously every visit by a head of state has to be a productive step forward in relations. It cannot be just a visit to make a speech or a visit for protocol reasons. A visit of this type has to result in significant opportunities for improved cooperation. He asked me to prepare 15 agreements, and once they are prepared, he would be delighted to visit Colombia. [Arizmendi] What about the rest of the countries you visited, Romania and Hungary? [Sanin] Important processes are being conducted in the Czech Republic, for example. There is a great consensus on the political and economic reforms. The transformations being carried out in that country in a few years since the 1989 velvet revolution are impressive. It is impressive to see how the parliament, the president, the prime minister, the foreign trade minister, the foreign minister, and the people have united to transform their society. Shops are opening up every day. The arts are developing today more than ever. There is a different political education here. Freedom is in vogue and it is leading to the flowering of each one of man's expressions. It is marvelous to see this awakening. In Romania the situation is different. There is a little more controversy, but it is marvelous to see what President Ion Iliescu and his government are doing. The parliament is also working to achieve political and economic transformations as soon as possible. They are awakening to this new economic reality. Their privatization process is slower, but it is evident that their economy, political opportunities, and freedoms are opening up. In Romania, I stayed at the house where Nicolae Ceausescu used to live. It was quite impressive. [Arizmendi] Did spirits show up around you? Perhaps Dracula? [Sanin, laughing] Ceausescu's spirit may have been around us. We were scared. [Arizmendi] You are not easy to scare. Not even Dracula can frighten you. [Sanin] The spirit of Ceausescu can scare anyone. [Arizmendi] During your visit to Moscow, you made a historic achievement. You were able to get the Russians to condemn the armed struggle in Colombia. How important is the Russian position for the Colombian Government? [Sanin] It is very significant politically because, as we discussed it there, for many years Russia and the former USSR promoted the armed struggle in Colombia. It was a way of intervening in the internal affairs of other countries. Today, they recognize our democracy and they recognize opportunities for freedom. They have also changed to believe it is best to work through proselytism, regardless of what their ideology may be, than to resort to the use of arms. We all want revolutions and more just societies to meet the needs of the people. [Arizmendi] The Ibero-American Summit will be held in Cartagena on 14 and 15 June of the present year. Mrs. Maria Emma Mejia, the Colombian ambassador to Spain, had the opportunity to talk about the extent of this meeting the day before yesterday. What heads of state have already confirmed their attendance? [Sanin] All of them. All heads of state and presidents will attend the summit. Spanish King Juan Carlos I will also attend the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. I want to praise the efforts of the Colombian ambassador to Spain and the efforts of all embassy officials who worked hard for two and one-half months to show our works of art, science, and literature during a Colombian exhibit in Madrid. I also want to congratulate Caracol journalist Carlos Penaloza, who has made a great effort to demonstrate Colombia's real image in Spain and Europe. They are portraying an image that is not one of violence as is sometimes depicted by the media. They are demonstrating our country's values abroad.
