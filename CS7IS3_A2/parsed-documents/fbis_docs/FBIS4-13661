FBIS4-13661 "drnes078_c_94006" FBIS-NES-94-078 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 Egypt New Tensions Between Cairo, Khartoum Reported New Tensions Between Cairo, Khartoum Reported NC2204083494 Beirut AL-SAFIR in Arabic 15 Apr 94 pp 1, 12 NC2204083494 Beirut AL-SAFIR Arabic BFN [Excerpt] Cairo--Relations between Egypt and Sudan have tensed again following a statement by Sudanese President 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir, which Cairo considered harmful to its sovereignty and an intentional offense, and a strong Sudanese protest against a planned conference in Cairo to which rebel leaders from south Sudan have been invited. An Egyptian Foreign Ministry source told AL-SAFIR that the Sudanese president's statement to the magazine AL-MULTAQA that the Egyptian regime has no clear program concerning the Hala'ib region and that it always seeks to obstruct negotiations with Sudan is unacceptable. The source quoted al-Bashir as saying that "despite all the Egyptian acts and positions against Khartoum, the option of fighting our Egyptian brothers contradicts our position and policy, which reject the idea of sacred borders. This idea is one aspect of Arab weakness." Egypt rejected al-Bashir's statement and sent a cable of protest to Khartoum saying it flagrantly harms bilateral relations. The cable said Sudan always seeks to create tension between the two, whether through words, such as al-Bashir's statement, or deeds, such as appointing a Sudanese governor to Hala'ib and sending "terrorist elements" to the disputed region. The cable also considered al-Bashir's statement a violation of the unsigned agreement reached with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak in Cairo. The agreement says differences should not be discussed through the media. Egypt's refusal to stop a conference on minorities in the Arab world, which the Ibn-Khuldun Center for Political Studies intends to organize in Cairo, added to the tension. Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih on Tuesday asked that the conference be prevented from taking place because rebel leaders from south Sudan, including John Garang and Rick Mashar, are scheduled to attend. Diplomatic sources in Cairo said that on Wednesday, Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa sent a verbal message to his Sudanese counterpart telling him that Cairo rejects the request. He explained that the issue hinges on freedom of political and intellectual activity in Egypt and is part of free decisionmaking. No individual or state has a right to interfere in the sovereignty of another country, he said. The sources cited Musa as saying that Egypt is a politically open country and that the south Sudanese rebel leaders were invited in their capacity as Sudanese citizens. The aim was not to entrench separatism. Cairo's firm and principled position against any attempt to divide Sudan is well known, Musa said. AL-SAFIR learned that Khartoum may react by organizing its own conference. Egyptian political sources expect such a conference to include some Islamist leaders, something over which Cairo will not remain silent. [passage omitted]
