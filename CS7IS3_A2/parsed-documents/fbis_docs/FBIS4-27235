Reports presented at the conference revealed that during the period, 604 corrupt cadres received disciplinary punishment including 72 cadres removed from their positions. A number of directorate-level cadres, who had been prosecuted before but still remained in the party, have been expelled from the party. Law enforcement agencies are presently handling 321 corruption cases. Eleven corrupt persons received life imprisonment terms. There are, however, still some serious cases that have not been finalized as expected. During its 13th session held October 1993, the city People's Council urged authorities to finalize quickly 58 backlog cases. Nine of them remain unsolved. Among six major cases that had been reported to the government, only four were completed. Many other important cases such as the Go Vap State Pharmacy, which involved the former director of the finance office, or the case of the (?Sakefin) Food Staples Company, still have not been brought to court though the prosecution process started over two years ago. The rate of property recovered from corruption activities stays very low. In comparison with 151.7 billion dong, $857,737, and 824 taels of gold recorded as losses, the amounts recovered were 13.3 billion dong, $205,686, and 167 taels of gold.
