Filatov says that 81 decrees and instructions have been signed by the president over the past week. He elaborates on three of these -- the decree of 17 March on an increase in compensation payments for caregivers, the draft law on additions to the law on pensions, and the decree on citizenship status. The interviewer then asks the "question of the week" on media reports of a "coup d'etat" during the president's vacation and speculation on his health. Filatov says he doesn't regard these matters separately but sees them as links in a chain. It all began with the amnesty and the build-up of an opposition to the president and his policies. "This became particularly manifest this week by a whole number of factors after the president first presented his message on strengthening the state, and especially after the president came out with his major initiative -- one that we have been waiting for a long time -- the creation of civic accord, on the basis of which we would be able to embark clearly on normal economic reforms. Against the background of all this it was clearly necessary for some people to show their particular stand, their particular position, and I don't believe that this happened by chance." Asked about Yeltsin's health, Filatov replies: "Quite normal. I have already said that I think that these stores are not by chance. Reports have been coming in that the president has been up in a helicopter, and one could have shown him playing tennis, but, unfortunately, the weather stepped in and prevented it." Regarding the scenario of an alleged plot, Filatov says that some kind of new structure of a coalition, also calling for accord, is apparently being created, but there cannot be two "accords" in society. "If you look at it, then I think all of this has been organized by one center, one group -- an opposition group of course -- and one can see a certain attempt to create an unpleasant atmosphere of fear and mistrust, and I think one cannot love one's people very much to bring them to such a situation." The interviewer asks Filatov if media talk about possible early elections is all part of the same chain. Filatov replies that some sociologists are saying that this would be the best time for Rutskoy to become president. Filatov does not think that Rutskoy is ready to become head of state.
