FBIS4-29143 "dreas116aa_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS IAEA `Expecting' Confirmation IAEA `Expecting' Confirmation LD1506093194 Berlin DDP/ADN in German 0926 GMT 15 Jun 94 LD1506093194 Berlin DDP/ADN German BFN [Text] Frankfurt am Main (DDP/ADN) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is expecting written confirmation today of North Korea's withdrawal from the organization, IAEA spokesman David Kyd said on Hessischer Rundfunk radio today. At the same time, Kyd contradicted reports over the past few days that North Korea had threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. "North Korea has not done that," Kyd stressed. North Korea has been in a grey area after it announced in 1993 that it would leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but then withdrew this application at the last minute. "They are neither a member nor a nonmember of the treaty, but the community of nations considers North Korea still to be a member." Now we are concerned only with how the country will react in the future, he said. As things stand, it does not appear that North Korea wants to sell material suitable for the production of nuclear weapons, Kyd said, but they had to continue to follow developments. Despite reports from the secret services, it is still not clear whether North Korea has nuclear bombs. The only thing they are certain of is that the country has more plutonium in its possession than it officially admitted to, Kyd said.
