At a press briefing in Brussels, he stated: "We do not currently envisage taking any action outside of Kigali. At the moment, it is not possible given the problems of mobility that we are running into in Kigali itself." The head of the National Defense Information Service moreover said that the slowness with which Belgian Forces are acting is due to the coordination problems encountered: "It has taken a long time to coordinate the paratroops, the Belgian UN forces in the country, the Belgian Embassy, and French units." Colonel Van de Weghe further indicated that some French units are to remain in Rwanda until all Belgian nationals have been evacuated. One contingent, nonetheless, will be withdrawn, France having already evacuated all of its nationals (some 600 people). "An uneasy calm settled on Kigali on Monday afternoon," he said. Only a little sporadic gunfire could be heard, but "we are unable to say who is firing on who," Colonel Van de Weghe added. The Rwandan capital's airport is "safe at the moment," and aircraft "are landing and taking off normally." Colonel Van de Weghe said that in Gisenyi (in the northwest of the country, near the border with Zaire), the situation "seems to have calmed after initial problems." He denied reports that the seven Belgian military volunteers had been surrounded. "The commander has confirmed to us that the military volunteers are moving around normally and are helping to assemble civilians for transfer to Goma (BELGA editor's note: The closest Zaire border town)," he stressed. In the colonel's opinion, some 20 Belgians are still in Gisenyi awaiting transfer to Goma. The other Belgian nationals outside Kigali are assembled in Ruhengeri (in the northwest) and Butare (in the south).
