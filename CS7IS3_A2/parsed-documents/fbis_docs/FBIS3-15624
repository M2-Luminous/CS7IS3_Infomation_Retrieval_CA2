The Danish delegation will meet President Algirdas Brazauskas; Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas; members of the Seimas National Security Committee; National Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius; officials from the Ministry of National Defense; and representatives from the Voluntary Defense Service. The guests will also visit the port of Klaipeda where they will inspect the flotilla of the Lithuanian marine force. The main sphere of cooperation between the Lithuanian and Danish military structures is the training of officers of this country. Another sphere is partnership for peace. Denmark will help the Baltic states to set up peacekeeping military units. They are already introducing their methodology and giving assistance for the training of servicemen. It is thought that the first Lithuanian peacekeeping unit will leave for former Yugoslavia, together with the Danish battalion. Experts from Denmark are expected to arrive at the end of March. They will assess the Alytus military base where the joint peacekeeping unit of the Baltic states is to be trained. A treaty will be signed by the Danish and Lithuanian defense ministers during the visit. This will reinforce further the links between the two state institutions.
