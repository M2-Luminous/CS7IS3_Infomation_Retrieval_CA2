Taiwan has deported 25,299 Chinese immigrants since 1987, but it is holding another 2,346. Future repatriations have not yet been arranged with Mainland China, said the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC], which handles the government's contacts with Peking [Beijing]. The Mainland Chinese come to seek better-paying jobs in Taiwan. Council Vice Chairman [Shu Chi] told reporters who visited the Hsinchu detention center that some of them have stayed in Taiwan over a year all because of the mainland's lack of sincerity in cooperating with the repatriation operations. In 1990, the Red Cross Society of Taiwan and Mainland China agreed to repatriate the mainland illegal immigrants within 20 days of their arrest. Under the agreement, Taiwan sent the illegal immigrants to the island of Matsu near the Fuchien [Fujian] coast of south China for the pickup by Mainland Chinese boats.
