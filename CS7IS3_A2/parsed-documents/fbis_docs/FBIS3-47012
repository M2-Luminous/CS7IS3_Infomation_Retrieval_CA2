Officials said aichi made the remarks in talks with U.S. Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, who arrived Thursday for a three-day visit. Queried by Nunn on an upcoming review of Japan's national defense program, Aichi was quoted as saying, "just because the situation has changed, that does not mean (Japan's military strength) should be drastically altered." He said the strength of Japan's military is not intended to correspond to any particular external threat. Officials said Nunn, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, urged active Japanese commitment to United Nations peacekeeping activities to help offset U.S. costs. Nunn called peacekeeping an important aspect of U.S.-Japan cooperation, they said. Officials said Nunn also urged that Tokyo's host nation support for U.S. Forces in Japan be more "flexibly" spent on such things as repair of facilities. Defense Facilities Administration Agency Head Ichiro Yoneyama replied that funds can be allocated under the existing framework for such large-scale projects as repairs to runways. Nunn and Lugar, who is a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will leave Tokyo on Saturday for South Korea.
