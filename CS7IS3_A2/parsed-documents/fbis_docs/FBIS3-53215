The daily KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL said Central Asian Republics were aspiring to follow the heroism of the Afghans against the "Russian bear" and through cooperation make the region into a strong bastion of resurgent Islam. Unfortunately, it said, "the leaders in Afghanistan have turned out to be lesser beings with inflated ego, ready to infringe upon the rights of others and cut each other's throats at the behest of outside forces. "To make outsiders happy they are even indifferent to the plight of the innocent peace-loving populace whose hopes and aspirations after the end of communist rule, were soon dashed by the much acclaimed victors of the unequal war," the article stressed. However, commented the article, it is not too late to find a remedy to the blood-curdling bickerings for power, adding that the first thing the Afghan groups should realize is that national reconciliation and not un-Islamic rivalries for domination of the country is the need of the hour. "Time and again Iran has shown its brotherly intentions of healing rift, and in the spirit of true Islamic brotherhood likes to see a strong and stable Afghanistan as its neighbor," the daily noted. The paper concluded by saying it is now up to the warring factions to continue their "self-destructive dance" and feel accountable before God for the wanton devastation of a nation, or to regain their senses and strive in earnest in the interests of peace and prosperity.
