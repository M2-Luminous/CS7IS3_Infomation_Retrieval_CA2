PUK forces have called on members of the Islamic Movement to give up and said that they have smashed positions of the Islamic movement. However, according to sources close to the Islamic movement, they have pushed back Jalal Talabani forces from al-Tuwaylah region. According to the Islamic movement forces under the command of Mullah 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in overnight fightings, at least six PUK members were killed and five others were taken captive. No independent source has yet confirmed the reports. Meanwhile, mediatory efforts by leader of Iraq's Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK) Mas'ud Barzani to patch up differences between the rival groups have failed. The withdrawal of Barzani from the leadership council of Iraq's Kurdistan is a sign of his failure to end the hostilities. Other reports speak of fresh clashes between Talabani and Barzani forces in Irbil region, 20 kms southeast of al-Sulaymaniyah. In light of the recent clashes, political observers believe that none of the two main rival groups in northern Iraq are able to run an independent Kurdish government.
