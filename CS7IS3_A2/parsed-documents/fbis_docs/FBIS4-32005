Referring to the union claims and the dialogue of government and unions, Octavian Partenie said "that their claims reached us through media." He added that "many of the claims are already settled or in the process of settlement, some are to be negotiated as they can not be settled on the spot and other ones cannot be even discussed." In the unrealistic claims ranking, the official mentioned a 50 per cent salary increase, a claim which means that "if we proceed to a 50 per cent salary rise today, we will have tomorrow a 60 per cent price increase and followed by a new salary increase, unemployment increase rate and a population increase rate who cannot live a decent life...and again a spiralling inflation." At the end of his interview, Octavian Partenie expressed his confidence in a reciprocal wish for dialogue. "Only in a receptive and responsible dialogue can we find the proper solutions," he underlined, noticing that at the present stage unions should look towards the employers' organizations. "It is with the employers' organizations that they are conducting talks now and so it will be in the future too," said the Romanian official.
