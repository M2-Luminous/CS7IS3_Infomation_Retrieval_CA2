FR941005-1-00010 FR941005-1-00003 The present statutory and regulatory language applies to communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate, a standard the Supreme Court held in Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U.S. 1, 80 (1976), to be constitutionally mandated for the disclosure of expenditures by individuals and groups that are not candidates or political committees. 424 U.S. at 80. However, neither Buckley nor other pertinent case law prohibits the imposition of further requirements on communications made by candidates and political committees. It is the Commission's experience that an inordinate amount of Commission time and resources are diverted to the question of whether a campaign mailing or advertisement paid for by a candidate constituted ``express advocacy'' and therefore required a disclaimer. Since political committees are in the business of electing candidates to political office, the Commission believes it is appropriate for them to be subject to a different standard under section 441d(a) in certain circumstances. The Commission is therefore proposing to include in the regulatory text a presumption that all communications by authorized political committees, or by party political committees, that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate contain express advocacy, and thus trigger the section 441d(a) disclaimer requirements. This interpretation would further a major goal of the FECA, that of more complete disclosure on political communications directed to the general public. It would also eliminate problems that have arisen in determining whether specific communications contain ``express advocacy'' in this context. This presumption would be rebuttable, since certain communications, e.g., those limited to one candidate's placing a newspaper ad offering another sympathy on a bereavement, are clearly not election advocacy. The Commission welcomes comments on the advisability of adopting this presumption, as well as suggested alternatives to and/or specific exemptions from the presumption. Alternatively, the Commission is soliciting comments on whether the statutory language should be interpreted to require disclaimers on all communications by political committees, whether or not they include express advocacy. This, too, would further the disclosure aims of the Act, as well as eliminate possible problems in determining whether the ``express advocacy'' standard has been met. Party Political Committee Communications The Commission is also seeking comments on whether the required authorization statement should be dropped or modified for communications and solicitations that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate, made by political party committees prior to the time the party's candidate is nominated. There are several possible approaches to this issue. One option would be for such communications to state only who paid for the communication. Please note that this would not change the Commission's long-standing conclusion that such communications may count against the committee's coordinated party expenditure limits. If a state or national party committee chooses not to make the coordinated expenditures permitted by section 441a(d), it may assign its right to make those expenditures to a designated agent, such as the senatorial campaign committee of the party. FEC v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , 454 U.S. 27 (1981). The proposed rules would clarify that the disclaimer on a communication made as a coordinated party expenditure should identify the committee that made the actual expenditure as the person who paid for the communication, regardless of whether that committee was acting as a designated agent or in its own capacity. Unauthorized Committee Solicitations That Mention Candidates While the Act requires communications by unauthorized committees to state both who paid for the communication and whether it was authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee, the text of the current rule does not include the second requirement for unauthorized committee solicitations. The proposed rule would clarify that an authorization statement would be required if the solicitation refers to a clearly identified federal candidate.
