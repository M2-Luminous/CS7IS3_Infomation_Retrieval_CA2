Due to a conflict between the ruling and opposition parties over political reform, Prime Minister Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata were forced to cancel planned trips; Hosokawa was scheduled to visit Britain in January and Hata was planning to make a round of calls to the Middle East and Europe. In particular, relations between Japan and the United States are in a serious condition. Some people doubt that the prime minister will be able to announce at Japan-U.S. summit talks, slated for February, effective pump-priming economic measures in line with Japan's pledge to the United States to reduce Japan's trade surplus. It is pointed out that, if not properly handled, the relations between the two countries "may become worse than before," (according to a senior Foreign Ministry official). The New York summit held in September, where Prime Minister Hosokawa and President Clinton met with each other for the first time, was a venue for the "reformist leaders" to confirm their solidarity. Expecting that the prime minister might launch policies beneficial to the United States, the United States so far has maintained a stance of watching the "administration for political reform" in a relatively warm manner. It can be said that the next summit will be their first actual chance to mutually examine progress of the new Japan-U.S. economic talks. The Japanese Government plans to reject U.S. demands to set numerical targets in individual fields. However, the government understands that it is macroeconomically necessary to show some degree of a positive stance toward U.S. demands for expansion of Japan's domestic demands and to reduce the trade surplus. However, the Hosokawa administration had no choice but to give up compilation of the 1994 budget, which was much desired for stimulating the economy, before the end of 1993 and to delay making a decision on income tax reduction until the next year [1994]. Moreover, mid-January of next year -- when the government plans to launch economic measures -- is indeed the time when deliberation on political reform will reach its final stage. We can make no guess about whether or not the government will be able to sufficiently deal with the political situation when it gets confused. This is why the United States, which so far has ventured to pretend as if it were in a "Japan-U.S. honeymoon period," feels uneasy about Japan's political situation. On the other hand, due to the substantial extension of the current Diet session, it became impossible for the prime minister to make his planned round of calls to Italy, Germany, and France. The foreign minister also had to call off a series of planned trips abroad. Various diplomatic obstacles are being felt now. But, it is obvious that the Hosokawa administration will immediately fall into a crisis of administrative collapse should it fail to deal with top priority issues needed for political reform. Feeling such a dilemma, a senior Foreign Ministry official said in a self-scorning tone that "the Tokyo summit was held after the Diet was dissolved."
