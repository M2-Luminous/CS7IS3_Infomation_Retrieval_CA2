The heads of the country's four major business lobbies agreed in a joint statement issued after their meeting that "disbanding of the Diet and a following snap election, which would create a political vacuum, should be avoided at all costs." The joint statement also said the ruling coalition and the opposition camp should realize political reforms through constructive debate and that the next general election should be conducted under the new single-member constituency system after the electoral map is redrawn. The Tuesday meeting brings together Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), Kosaku Inaba, Chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations, and Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives. At the meeting, Nagano, who attended a recent International Labor Organization (ILO) meeting, reported that the European economy has been showing healthier signs although a recovery has not yet been in sight. The four business leaders agreed that the Japanese economy is at a similar stage.
