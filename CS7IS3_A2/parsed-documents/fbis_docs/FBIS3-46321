A Chinese source in Hong Kong revealed this. During the meeting, the CMC also revised the "Military Guideline," the rules setting forth the role of the military in pursuing reform and open-door policy. This is the first time in five years that the guideline has been revised. It may be said that all this shows that Jiang Zemin, CPC general secretary and concurrent CMC chairman, is trying to solidify his position within the military. According to reports by China's XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, the Chinese Air Force's eighth meeting of party delegates was held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 24 December. That meeting was attended by Jiang Zemin; Liu Huaqing, CMC vice chairman and member of the party Political Bureau Standing Committee; Zhang Zhen, CMC vice chairman; Defense Minister Chi Haotian; Zhang Wannian, chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army [PLA]; Yu Yongbo, PLA General Political Department director; Fu Quanyou, Political Department director of the PLA General Logistic Department; and many other top military officials. It appears that the CMC meeting was held around that time. According to the Chinese source, the man removed during the CMC meeting was Zhang Gong, a political commissar in the Chengdu Military Region, who had served as the spokesman for the martial law force at the time of the Tiananmen incident. In May of 1990, following the Tiananmen incident, Zhang's contribution was recognized and he was promoted, in one big sweep, from the position of director of the Beijing Military Region's Political Department to the political commissar of the Beijing Military Region. But in December 1992, he was transferred, in a de- facto demotion, to the position of political commissar of the Chengdu Military Region, and as a result of the recent CMC action, he was even removed from that position. The Chinese source insisted: "The personnel action strongly smacks of purging targeted at Zhang who, as the spokesman of the martial law troops, was a symbolic figure at the time of the Tiananmen incident." The source said that the latest CMC meeting also demoted or removed the people belonging to the group linked to party Political Bureau member Yang Baibing who was dismissed as chairman of the CMC following the CPC 14th Congress in the fall of 1992. The source did not give details on it, however. During the meeting, the CMC also approved the "Guideline for Building Army Grassroots Units" presented by General Secretary Jiang. Its purpose is to make the roles of the military forces comform to the government's position of pursuing the policy of reform and opening up. A draft for it was first presented to the commission five years ago. The passing of it by the CMC means that five years have been given to the work of transforming it into a formal "guideline." The "guideline" can be said to be the basic action guideline for the military forces in the future, and asks the military to be "politically qualified, militarily strong, exemplary in attitude, strict in discipline, and logistically well prepared." The reason General Secretary Jiang wanted this completed is thought to lie in his desire to solidify his base within the military. Meanwhile, in a ceremony in Beijing on 23 December, 12 senior officials from the Chinese People's Armed Police Force Headquarters were promoted to the rank of major general. Concerning this, a Western diplomatic source in Hong Kong said: "The Armed Police Force is the organization in which Jiang is trying to gain influence over. There is no doubt that Jiang's political intention regarding the military forces was evident at that promotion ceremony."
