FR940429-0-00018 FR940429-0-00008 The EA/RIR/FRFA prepared for this action considered an alternative for increased observer coverage similar to the one presented in Comment 4. The alternative was more stringent and could provide more observer data of certain fisheries relative to the preferred alternative implemented under this final rule. However, this alternative was not adopted by the Council for several reasons. First, concerns were expressed that some fishermen would have difficulties complying with 30 percent observer coverage in each fishery because fishermen would need to be aware of and plan for the target fishery each trip and keep track of the exact number of fishing days by fishery. Second, 30 percent coverage by fishery would be relatively more expensive for a vessel in the 60&hyph;125 ft (18.3 m&hyph;38.1 m) LOA category to comply with relative to the preferred alternative. Last, compliance monitoring would be more difficult and associated enforcement costs would be increased relative to the preferred alternative under the final rule due to calculations to check 30 percent observer coverage by fishery. Comment 5. The proposed action to increase coverage of the longline fisheries in the eastern GOA is inadequate for two reasons. First, the proposed action is subject to manipulation. Second, the overall level of reliable observer-generated data from the hook-and-line gear fleet in the eastern GOA is deplorable. To respond to these inadequacies, the final rule should require all vessels in the 60&hyph;125 ft (18.3&hyph;38.1 m) LOA category that use hook-and-line gear to carry observers a minimum of 30 percent of the fishing days they operate in the eastern GOA during any particular calendar quarter on a fishery-by-fishery basis. Furthermore, NMFS should make a concerted effort to place observers on vessels under 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA so that data can be gathered about the operating characteristics of the small boat fleet that accounts for most of the hook-and-line harvest in the eastern GOA. Response. The alternative coverage requirements suggested in Comment 5 for longline vessels in the eastern GOA was considered by the Council, but not adopted for reasons similar to those presented in the response to Comment 4. The Council considered lowering the size limit for vessels required to carry observers to vessels less than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA. The Council did not adopt this alternative because of increased costs to industry and increased chance of injury to an observer or crew on small vessels because of limited working space and accommodations. Under the current Observer Plan, NMFS has determined that implementation of changes to the observer coverage requirements for vessels under 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA would require separate regulatory action. Furthermore, staffing and budget constraints prevent NMFS from placing employees onboard small vessels to serve as observers. Given these regulatory and practical constraints, observer coverage requirements for the small boat fleet would best be pursued under the North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan, which is pending approval and implementation by the Secretary. Comment 6. The proposed action to lower observer coverage on vessels using pot gear is premature and not supported as long as observer data generated from the pot gear fisheries are used for allocative purposes. Data used to support allocative measures should be based on comparable levels of observer coverage. Therefore, observer coverage on vessels using pot gear should remain unchanged until an individual vessel quota system is implemented that will effectively address resource allocation issues. Response. Since the implementation of the domestic observer program in 1990, observer data collected onboard pot gear vessels participating in a directed fishery for groundfish consistently indicate that relatively low levels of prohibited species bycatch mortality are associated with these operations. The Council recommended that NMFS reduce the observer coverage requirements for pot vessels equal to or greater than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA from 100 percent to 30 percent because of the very low bycatch mortality associated with these operations and the Council's expressed policy to encourage selective fishing practices that typically experience low prohibited species bycatch mortality rates. Under the final rule, the resulting levels of observer coverage of vessels using pot gear will assure the collection of sufficient observer data to identify any changes in assumed bycatch mortality rates and other factors that may affect future resource allocation issues.
