Edouard Balladur has now arrived in Bosnia after travelling from Zagreb. He is due to visit Bihac, a Muslim enclave besieged by the Serbs, where a French UN soldier was killed on Friday [11 March]. Systematically targetted in the last few days, the UN soldiers on the ground want stronger powers to hit back. Colonel Legrier: [Begin recording] [Legrier] The visit by our prime minister and our defense minister is very much appreciated, because we have been in an extremely tense situation over the last two weeks. Our men have been repeatedly targetted and have come very close to death. They have behaved quite magnificently, and the presence among us today of these two high-ranking officials is very good for their morale. [Unidentified correspondent] Do you expect something in particular from this visit? We know that the French forces deployed in Bihac have called for NATO air strikes. [Legrier] That is quite true. On Thursday [10 March], I asked for a NATO air strike, which could not be carried out. I asked for one again last night [12 March]. I received authorization for a strike, but unfortunately it came too late: The target that had been attacking us had time to disappear into the undergrowth, so we were unable to strike. What we need is a great deal of determination on the part of the authorities in order to raise the many constraints that are weighing down the decisionmaking process, and which make our decisions very difficult to carry out. [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think that the political authorities need to go further still? [Legrier] I honestly think we have gone some way to solving the problem in Sarajevo by showing a great deal of determination. We need to show the same determination everywhere. [end recording]
