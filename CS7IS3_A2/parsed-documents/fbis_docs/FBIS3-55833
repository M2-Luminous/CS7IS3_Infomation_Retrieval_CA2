The Russian troops stationed in Latvia went on higher alert in connection with the incident, but they neither left the places of their deployment nor launched any aggressive actions, he pointed out. As INTERFAX already reported, Monday morning groups of armed Latvian militiamen seized several installations belonging to the North-Western Group of Russian Troops. The two Russian generals who came to the locality were arrested on instruction from the head of the administration of a Riga district. Only when President Guntis Ulmanis intervened and presented his apologies, the Russian generals were released and the invaded installations were freed. According to Krylov, this "gross and unprecedented action was probably designed to provoke Russia to take retaliatory measures." "The saddest thing is that it was launched at a time when progress was being made at the Russian-Latvian talks in Riga in regard to the key aspects concerning the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia," he noted.
