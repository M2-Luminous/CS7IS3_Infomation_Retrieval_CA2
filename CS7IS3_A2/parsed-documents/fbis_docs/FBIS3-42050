North Korea made the deal at its consulate in Nakhodka with a company that sells submarines it has salvaged from the sea, according to the dispatch from Russian fleet headquarters in Vladivostok. Although the company has a permit to export submarines under the Pacific Fleet's arms reduction plan, it needs formal approval from the central government to sell intact submarines. In an abnormal procedure, the submarines are likely to be towed by Russian warships to North Korea to escape inspection by customs officers, the vernacular Japanese paper said. Once the submarines leave Russian waters, they will be handed over to North Korean ships for the rest of their journey to chongjin, the daily said. The Golf II submarines are similiar to the Fox-Trot types in size, but excel them in speed and cruising range and can carry three SS-N-5 ballistic missiles. They were sold for $130 dollars a ton, with the total 2,126 tons selling at $276,000. They were initially for sale to a Japanese company, but went to North Korea after the first contract was called off, the TOKYO SHIMBUN said. The Russian Navy officially confirmed earlier the sale of four Fox-Trot submarines to North Korea, which have reportedly been delivered through a Japanese trader. It added that the sales were under condition that North Korea use the vessels for scrap.
