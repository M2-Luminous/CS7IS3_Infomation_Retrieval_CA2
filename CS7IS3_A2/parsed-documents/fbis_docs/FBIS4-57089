Fernandez spoke for over two hours about the country's economic and social situation with a group of four professors and 18 students from New York City's Columbia University. The visitors, most of whom are economics and finance majors, have been in the country since last week gathering information on the mixed partnership system and on foreign investment legislation. The ranking official said the measures taken in the farming sector -- the creation of the basic cooperative production units system, the self-employment law, and the foreign investments law -- will not change the socialist nature of the Cuban political system. Fernandez added that in the 35 years since the revolutionary victory on 1 January 1959, the country has made noteworthy success in public health, including a life expectancy of 75 years and an infant mortality rate that is comparable to those of highly developed countries. The Cuban people are resisting the U.S. policy of hostility, not surrendering to it because they want to safeguard those achievements, Fernandez said. He emphasized that joint ventures have been established with Canadian, French, and Swedish firms on the island to exploit oil, and with other countries to exploit citrus, nickel, and mining with good results. Fernandez told the university students, who are U.S., Japanese, Canadian, and Latin American citizens, that the last eight U.S. Administrations have been at odds with Cuba, but Cuba does not profess enmity toward the people of the United States. The visitors asked Fernandez about the possibility of Cuban authorities considering investments that are 100 percent foreign capital as well as quicker changes in the economic sphere. Fernandez said the Cuban authorities are willing to discuss any issue to achieve communication and peace based on respect for the right to self-determination, sovereignty, and their political system.
