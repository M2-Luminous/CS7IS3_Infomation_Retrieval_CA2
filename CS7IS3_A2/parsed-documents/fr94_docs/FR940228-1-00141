FR940228-1-00141 FR940228-1-00010 (3) The institution must determine which policy under paragraph (b)(1) of this section provides for the largest refund to that student. (c) Pro rata refund. (1) Pro rata refund, as used in this section, means a refund by an institution to a student attending that institution for the first time of not less than that portion of the tuition, fees, room, board, and other charges assessed the student by the institution equal to the portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that remains on the withdrawal date, rounded downward to the nearest 10 percent of that period, less_ (i) (A) Any unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged. A scheduled cash payment is the amount of institutional charges that is not paid for by financial aid for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged exclusive of_ ( 1 ) Any amount scheduled to be paid by Title IV, HEA program assistance that the student has been awarded that is payable to the student even though the student has withdrawn; and ( 2 ) Late disbursements of loans made under the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal SLS, and Federal PLUS programs in accordance with 34 CFR 682.207(d). (B) The unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment is computed by subtracting the amount paid by the student for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged from the scheduled cash payment for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged; (ii) A reasonable administrative fee not to exceed the lesser of_ (A) Five percent of the tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges assessed the student; or (B) One hundred dollars; (iii) Any application fee charged by the institution; and (iv) The portion of ``board'' charges (i.e., meal tickets) that have been expended by the student that exceed the portion attributable to the period for which the student attended at the time of withdrawal. The institution must include in the refund any unexpended ``board'' credits. (2) (i) For purposes of this section, ``other charges assessed the student by the institution'' include, but are not limited to, charges for any equipment (including books and supplies) issued by an institution to the student. The institution may deduct from the refund owed under this paragraph the documented cost to the institution of equipment issued to the student if the institution specifies in the enrollment agreement a separate charge for equipment which the student actually obtains or if the institution refers the student to a vendor operated by an affiliated or related entity and the student does not return the equipment in good condition, allowing for reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days following the date of the student's withdrawal. The student shall be liable for the amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment not returned in good condition exceeds the refund under this paragraph. Equipment is not considered to be returned in good condition if the equipment cannot be reused because of clearly recognized health and sanitary reasons, and this fact is clearly and conspicuously disclosed in the enrollment agreement. (ii) An institution may not delay its payment of the portion of a refund allocable under this section to a Title IV, HEA program or a lender under 34 CFR 682.607 by reason of the process for return of equipment prescribed in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. (3) For purposes of this section_ (i) ``Room'' charges do not include charges that are passed through the institution from an entity that is not under the control of, related to, or affiliated with the institution; and (ii) ``Other charges assessed the student by the institution'' do not include fees for group health insurance, if this insurance is required for all students and the purchased coverage remains in effect for the student throughout the period for which the student was charged. (4) (i) For purposes of this section, a student attending an institution for the first time is a student who_ (A) Has not previously attended at least one class at the institution; or (B) Received a refund of 100 percent of his or her tuition and fees (less any permitted administrative fee) under the institution's refund policy for previous attendance at the institution. (ii) A student remains a first-time student until the student either_ (A) Withdraws, drops out, or is expelled from the institution after attending at least one class; or (B) Completes the period of enrollment for which he or she has been charged.
