FR940922-2-00008 FR940922-2-00006 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;614&hyph;801] Fresh Kiwifruit From New Zealand; Final Results of Antidumping Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: On May 6, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on fresh kiwifruit from New Zealand. The review covers one exporter, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board (NZKMB), and the period November 27, 1991, through May 31, 1993. Based on our analysis of the comments received, we determine the dumping margin for NZKMB to be 15.41 percent. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Amer M. Kayani or Thomas F. Futtner, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5346 or 482&hyph;3814, respectively. Background On May 6, 1994, the Department published the preliminary results (59 FR 23691) of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on fresh kiwifruit from New Zealand (57 FR 23203, (June 2, 1992)). The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of the Review The product covered by the order under review is fresh kiwifruit. Processed kiwifruit, including fruit jams, jellies, pastes, purees, mineral waters, or juices made from or containing kiwifruit, are not covered under the scope of the order. The subject merchandise is currently classifiable under subheading 0810.90.20.60 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Although the HTS number is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this review is dispositive. Analysis of Comments Received We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. At the request of respondent, NZKMB, we held a public hearing on June 20, 1994. We received timely comments from respondent and petitioners, the California Kiwifruit Commission (CKC). General Comments Comment 1 Respondent argues that the Department should exclude from NZKMB's expenses amounts of interest it incurred to finance antidumping deposits in accordance with the Department's practice in the administrative review of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Order; Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from France, et. al. (58 FR 39729, (July 26, 1993)). Respondent further argues that the Department successfully verified the amount of interest NZKMB incurred as a result of the duty deposits. Petitioners contend that this interest is not ``dumping duty interest'', but rather that it is simply interest incurred by respondent on short-term commercial bank financing to finance kiwifruit business operations. Furthermore, petitioners contend that respondent's reliance on the third administrative review results in Antifriction Bearings is misplaced because in the more recent Antifriction Bearings fourth administrative review, the Department disallowed a reduction for U.S. indirect-selling expenses by the amount of interest incurred to finance antidumping duty deposits.
