Presidential ex-candidate Mykola Bagrov, satisfying journalists' request, held a news conference today. He explained his defeat at yesterday's balloting saying that the people voted not against him but against their difficult situation [as heard]. Mykola Bagrov did not agree with the opinion that he was preparing the presidential office for himself. [passage indistinct] I have not interfered with the results of the balloting, and this was confirmed by Yuriy Meshkov's impressive victory. Mykola Bagrov was sorry that Crimean residents did not support his program, on which he had worked so hard. Asked about how realistic Yuriy Meshkov's program is, Mykola Bagrov said that the first Crimean president will face many difficulties. If Yuriy Meshkov appeals to him for help, he -- guided by Crimean interests -- will not refuse to give it. With regard to his personal plans for the future, Mykola Bagrov did not specify them, but said that he was going to leave politics. At any rate, he will not participate in the elections to the Crimean or Ukrainian Supreme Council. A hard life is in store for me, he said at the end, but I am not going to part with the Crimea.
