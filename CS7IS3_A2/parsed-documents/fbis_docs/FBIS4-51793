The four Korean ships, 300-400 ton large, are Petro 301 and Petro 303 of Taeung Deep Sea Fisheries Co., Tongwon 311 of Tongwon Industries Co. and Chaewon 22 of Chaewon Industrial Co. The vessels, fishing within 200 nautical miles of Argentina's "territorial waters," tried to escape after the Argentine Navy ordered them to stop but were later captured, Argentine authorities said. Korean fishing sources here said four Korean vessels are confirmed to have been captured, but the figure may rise to seven. The incident marks the first time that the Argentine Navy, instead of the Coast Guard, has seized several Korean ships at a time for entering the zone and could cause a diplomatic dispute, informed sources said. The Korean ships' catch will be confiscated and they face a fine of at least 500,000 U.S. dollars.
