The spokesman explained that "loss-making mines will be gradually closing down with due regard for the social and human factors." According to him, the so-called "miners' problem," which is so acute at the moment, stems from the bygone economic system which has become completely obsolete. Kostikov also reported that President Yeltsin intended to meet the government for talks on this issue.
