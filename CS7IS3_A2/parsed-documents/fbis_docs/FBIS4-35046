Granillo Ocampo made this remark during an exclusive interview with the NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS news agency a few minutes after the conclusion of a World Cup soccer game between the Argentine and Nigerian teams. The ambassador went to the stadium, representing President Carlos Menem. The diplomat said that the president "followed the game on television" at a hotel in the southern city of New Orleans. The ambassador emphasized that "there will be good news" on the pharmaceutical patents issue, which worries the U.S. Government because the U.S. laboratories are asking the Argentine laboratories to pay for intellectual property rights. Moving on, the diplomat emphasized the significance of a meeting held yesterday in the White House between Presidents Menem and Clinton. The diplomat said: "I would say it was a really superb meeting due to the issues discussed, the quality of the meeting, the agreement that existed, and the good news that they gave us but asked us to keep secret for the time being. [no closing quotation marks as received] The ambassador refused to provide any details on the matter, but admitted that "there is good news on the pharmaceutical patents issue." The diplomat announced that a U.S. Government envoy would travel to Buenos Aires to confirm "that Argentina has awakened interest here." The ambassador said: "The person is like a foreign trade minister, who will go to approve certain trade agreements that the two countries are in the process of concluding." Granillo Ocampo believes that the second meeting between Presidents Bill Clinton and Carlos Menem this year "represents a recognition of our country, as it was arranged in 10 days and because top-level U.S. Government officials were present, which demonstrates that Argentina is being described a country worth talking to." Granillo Ocampo stressed: "This also demonstrates that President Menem is being described as a valid person to talk to, and that when he is in the United States high-level talks are held, taking advantage of his presence."
