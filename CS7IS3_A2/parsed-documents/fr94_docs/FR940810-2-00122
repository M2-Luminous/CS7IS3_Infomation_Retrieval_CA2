FR940810-2-00122 FR940810-2-00074 5. The Board's determination of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications shall be made known in writing promptly to all Participating Insurance Companies. 6. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all variable contractowners so long as the Commission continues to interpret the 1940 Act as requiring pass-through voting privileges for variable contractowners. Accordingly, Participating Insurance Companies will vote shares of the Fund held in their Separate Accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely-received from contractowners. Each Participating Insurance Company will vote shares of the Fund held in the Participating Insurance Company's Separate Accounts for which no voting instructions from contractowners are timely-received, as well as shares of the Fund which the Participating Insurance Company itself owns, in the same proportion as those shares of the Fund for which voting instructions from contractowners are timely-received. Participating Insurance Companies shall be responsible for assuring that each of their Separate Accounts participating in the Fund calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with other Participating Insurance Companies. The obligation to calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other Separate Accounts investing in the Fund shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreements governing participation in the Fund. 7. The Fund will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring voting by shareholders, and, in particular, the Fund will either provide for annual meetings (except to the extent that the Commission may interpret Section 16 of the 1940 Act not to require such meetings) or comply with Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act (although the Fund is not one of the trusts described in Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act), as well as with Section 16(a) of the 1940 Act and, if and when applicable, Section 16(b) of the 1940 Act. Further, the Fund will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretation of the requirements of Section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of directors and with whatever rules the Commission may promulgate with respect thereto. 1 1 Applicants will amend the application during the notice period to reflect this condition. 8. The Fund shall disclose in its prospectus that (a) the Fund is intended to be a funding vehicle for all types of variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts offered by various insurance companies, (b) material irreconcilable conflicts possibly may arise, and (c) the Fund's Board of Directors will monitor events in order to identify the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts and to determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to any such conflict. The Fund will notify all Participating Insurance Companies that Separate Account prospectus disclosure regarding potential risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate. 9. If and to the extent that Rule 6e&hyph;2 and Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act as amended, or Rule 6e&hyph;3 under the 1940 Act is adopted, to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the 1940 Act, or the rules promulgated thereunder, with respect to mixed or shared funding, on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested in this Application, then the Fund and/or Participating Insurance Companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T), or Rule 6e&hyph;3, as such rules are applicable. 10. The Participating Insurance Companies and/or G.R. Phelps, at least annually, shall submit to the Fund's Board of Directors such reports, materials, or data as the Board reasonably may request so that the directors of the Fund may fully carry out the obligations imposed upon the Board by the conditions contained in this Application and said reports, materials, and data shall be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate by the Board. The obligations of the Participating Insurance Companies to provide these reports, materials, and data to the Fund's Board of Directors, when the Board so reasonably requests, shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreements governing participation in the Fund. 11. All reports of potential or existing conflicts received by the Board of Directors, and all Board action with regard to determining the existence of a conflict, notifying Participating Insurance Companies of a conflict, and determining whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or other appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request. Applicants' Conclusion For the reasons stated above, Applicants believe that the requested exemptions, in accordance with the standards of Section 6(c) under the 1940 Act, are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
