ACTION: Correcting amendments. SUMMARY: The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) is correcting its regulations on the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program in order to update Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers and internal references. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Jill M.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program contained in part 1703 in the Code of Federal Regulations is in need of correction for two reasons: (1) §1703.34 contains a non-current Office of Management and Budget control number which was inadvertently overlooked when the regulation was updated on March 14, 1994, at 59 FR 11702. The current control number is being inserted; and (2) Internal references need to be redesignated in §1703.46 as the paragraphs in which they are found were redesignated in the rule published on March 14, 1994, at 59 FR 11702.
