The traitor Kim Yong-sam showed up at the "Seoul City office" on February 7 and, talking about "the complexion of the recent demonstration", blared that "violence against police would never be tolerated" and that the "home minister" and the "police agency director" must "counter violence relentlessly". Recalling this, the news analyst says: How can a democratic and peaceful rally and demonstration intended to prevent the treacherous rice market opening and defend the nation's dignity and right to existence be called "violence"? It is the "civilian" fascist group, not the innocent peasants and citizens, that became riotous in actuality. When a demonstration of peasants and citizens broke out, the traitor Kim Yong-sam branded it as an "impermissible violence" and issued a ruthless repressive order, bruising many demonstrators. As stark facts show, the real violence is the brutal crackdown of the fascist clique which fired multiple tear gas and brandished the sword against the barehanded peaceful demonstrators, and the chief culprit in it is the traitor Kim Yong-sam himself. The traitor Kim, a puppet, has sold off to the United States the rice market on which he had staked his "presidency" in return for the "international cooperation system" intended to do harm to fellow countrymen. He is, indeed, a rare traitor who deserves a stern punishment by the nation for his arch crimes. Suppression is by no means almighty. Fascist suppression will only result in digging his own grave, being an act of self-destruction. The Kim Yong-sam group must stop cracking down on the righteous struggle of peasants and other sections of people against the rice market opening, promptly release the arrested peasants and other demonstrators and step down without delay as demanded by the South Korean people.
