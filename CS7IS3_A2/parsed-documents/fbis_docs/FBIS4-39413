They are handling cashless settlements and transactions with the cash money of some republics of the former USSR. These banks are risking quite a lot, but their main purpose is to get a foothold on this promising market. The Central Bank of Russia is constantly stressing that this is, indeed, a very promising business. It has issued an instruction, saying that the Russian commercial banks are permitted to carry out, without any special agreement, transactions with the national currencies which it quotes. Today, the Central bank fixes the exchange rates of the currencies of all the republics of the former USSR, except the Caucasian states and Turkmenistan. The recent attempts to effect settlements among the former Union republics in freely convertible currencies and through bank correspondence accounts have proved futile. In the meantime, the need for the active financial interaction of the new sovereign republics is dictated by their cooperation links in production, trade, travel, and the need to remit money from one republic to another. This is why Russian experts persistently recommend the active use of national currencies in mutual settlements. What is preventing this? Assistant Head of the Foreign Transactions Department of the Russian Central Bank Andrey Vernikov told ITAR-TASS that the work of the national banks with local currencies was complicated by the high rates of inflation in the newly independent states, unpredictable currency regulations, restrictions and bans on export and import trade. Vernikov and his colleagues believe it is most important for surmounting these obstacles to guarantee the "smooth work of the currency market". "This means," Vernikov explained, "that all the national currencies should be sold on the markets of each of the newly independent states. A bilateral union must be concluded to make our money sell freely in Kazakhstan and vice-versa. The union becomes multilateral if several such agreements are intertwined. It may be joined also by the east European states. Russia has already concluded agreements with the national banks of Bulgaria and Hungary, allowing their enterprises to effect settlements with Russian partners and make payments in national currencies. Poland, Mongolia and Slovakia are displaying interest in such agreements." The concept of a payments union was received with understanding by a recent meeting of representatives from the central banks of the republics of the former USSR and their governments. Then it was approved by the heads of CIS governments, which authorised corresponding bodies to draw up an agreement on a payments union in accordance with this concept, which is to be a voluntary association of states, intended to ensure uninterrupted payments on the basis of mutually convertible national currencies. "The implementation of the system of mutual convertibility of national currencies of the former republics of the Soviet Union must without doubt proceed stage by stage. The payments union may be joined by countries that deem themselves ready to accede to it and are prepared to assume concrete commitments," the representative of the Russian Central Bank believes.
