The centerpiece of the package, endorsed at an evening special cabinet meeting, is income and other tax cuts worth 5.85 trillion yen decided earlier by the coalition parties after four days of marathon debate on how to cover the resulting revenue shortfall. Other key elements are 6 trillion yen in additional spending on public works for the current fiscal year through March, 1.2 trillion yen to boost public housing loans, 1.36 trillion yen in measures to help smaller businesses, and deregulations to stimulate the real estate market and facilitate the liquidation of nonperforming bank loans. With previous four public works-led packages already totaling some 30 trillion yen failing to lift the economy, the government decided for the first time to include tax cuts, hoping to make the package its final and decisive pump-primer. The tax-led measures also came amid U.S. pressure on Japan for an income tax cut to boost domestic demand as a contribution to reducing its huge trade surplus. Japan posted a record surplus for the second straight year in 1993 in its politically sensitive current accounts, including goods and services trade. The statistics were released Monday. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is no doubt relieved by the agreement after a two-week delay caused by disputes over the now-enacted political reform bills as well as the tax issue. Hosokawa said at a press meeting he expects "substantial" effects from the tax cuts, "to meet expectations both at home and abroad." Hosokawa had been urging his ministers to prepare the package, to be followed by a third fiscal 1993 extra budget and the fiscal 1994 budget, in order to have it ready before his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday. The Finance Ministry is to compile its draft budgets on Thursday, but uncertainty still remains because of the extremely tight schedule, ministry officials said. An official of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) which compiled the package told reporters that a large chunk of the new outlays would be funded by the third extra budget, and the tax cuts would be included in the fiscal 1994 budget. Of the total, 10.2 trillion yen is to boost the economy, he said, estimating that the gross national product (GNP) would expand by a nominal 2.2 percent beyond the fiscal 1992 GNP, the latest available figures, over a one-year period. But he noted that the effects would not appear all at once in fiscal 1994. The package is broadly divided into three parts, in line with their expected effects and results in stimulating the economy. With the first part that includes tax cuts, public works and housing loans, the government is aiming to boost domestic demand to help the economy "overcome the current tough condition" in the short term, the EPA official said. The second and third parts are intended to put the economy "on a full-fledged recovery phase in fiscal 1994" and to promote "stable growth in and after fiscal 1995" by solving structural problems since the collapse of the "bubble" economy in the late 1980s and by facilitating forward-looking corporate activities. Under the second part, the package calls for special tax breaks, 2.78 trillion yen advance purchases of public works land sites and other measures to stimulate the real estate market. It also calls for various deregulations in the financial and securities market primarily to help banks liquidate their nonperforming loans. For the advance land purchases, the government will also earmark 500 billion yen for a quasi-public institute that supports private-sector city developments. Also included are additional lending and other forms of support for smaller businesses and 10 billion yen for job programs amid increasing labor adjustments. Farmers will be granted 230 billion yen in public works and through other plans to help them cope with international competition following Japan's decision to free its rice and other agricultural markets under the GATT-sponsored Uruguay Round of multilateral talks. With the third part, the government is pushing for the easing and lifting of various microeconomic regulations, including those under the Antimonopoly Law. A loan system worth 10 billion yen is to be offered by the Japan Development Bank and other public financial institutions to assist investment in new businesses. Import promotion is also spelled out in the third part, with the emphasis on exhibitions and import centers, along with the recently-revealed action plan for government procurement. Aside from all these government measures, the package also calls for "appropriate and mobile management in monetary policy with a careful watch on domestic and overseas economic trends and the international currency situation."
