The exchange rate of the U.S. currency is on a constant downward slide, which has brought it to so far unknown low levels compared with the Japanese yen and has made it fall to less than 1.6 German marks on occasion. However, this weakening was no coincidence but was certainly intended. The White House -- annoyed by Tokyo's unwillingness to make efforts to reduce its gigantic trade surplus -- tried to put pressure on the Japanese by strengthening the yen. However, this policy, whose usefulness one might dispute anyway, had unexpected side effects. It undermined the trust of the international money managers in the United States and made them get rid of their dollar investments on a wide scale. This made long-term interest rates in the United States rise. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had hoped to be able to avoid this development by raising interest rates on short notice. However, this calculation did not work. The investors are obviously missing a clear commitment by the U.S. Administration to its own currency. So far, it has not been made. This puts Chairman Greenspan in a dilemma. If he continues to raise short-term interests, as the markets demand, there is the danger that he will strangle the incipient recovery. If he leaves them unchanged, investors will continue to unload their dollars.
