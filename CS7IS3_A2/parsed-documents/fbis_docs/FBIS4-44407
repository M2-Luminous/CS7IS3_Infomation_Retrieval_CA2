Reform before that can be divided roughly into two stages. In the first stage (1978-1991), reform was launched in a sequence from countryside to city, from allocation to production, from enterprise operation rights to ownership rights, from adjusting prices to relaxing them, and from a consumption market to a capital market, having chosen gradual advancement as the way of reform. This suits China's practical situation, and especially suits its system and developmental background. The successes attained in the primary stage of reform have provided the impetus for the whole economic system to take an important step towards shifting to the socialist market economic system. Although the first stage of reform cannot be described simply by carrying forward a single project or by an isolated force penetrating deeply into reform, still, a synthesized set of reform supports was not really launched. The reform strategy chosen was supervision by division of rights and transmission of profits for steady advancement; at the outset, the ultimate goal for changing the whole system was unclear, so reform could be done only through taking each step cautiously, "fording the river while touching each stone at the river bottom," which definitely limited to some degree its width, depth and progress. After Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech during his southern China trip in 1992, and the 14th CPC Conference's positioning the wholesale changeover of the economic system to the "socialist market economy" as the overriding policy, the theory of reform reached a new level. Once the goals of reform were set out, there was motivation to shift to the new stage of economic reform, and the reform strategy selected shifted from gradual progress to acceleration, from supporting parts to a whole set of supports, from research and experimentation to a comprehensive plan. However, speeding up reform and the set of reforms requires further perfecting and detailed consideration and preparation. The reform of 1993 was conducted against just such a background. Viewed from the strategic level of reform, 1993 was a year which pushed reform to accomplish a periodic transition, a year of theoretical conclusions and designing plans for the approaching complete set of reforms; meanwhile, it also set out some reform steps to match up with developing the market economy on a new level. Because the new stage of reform is more strongly characterized by comprehensiveness and continuity, we cannot ask whether the reforms of one particular year were significant and outstanding achievements. Rather, we should base our evaluation on the whole entity and the long term. Especially since the problems which exist in the current economic operations process were brought on for the most part by conflicts between dual channel systems, unavoidable when shifting from a commodity economy to a market economy. Although "strengthening macroeconomic adjustment and control" and leading into the parameters for adjusting parallel systems in 1993 did not completely eliminate the traditional means of planned economic adjustment, the flexible operations of "microeconomic adjustment" and strengthening finances, especially banks' key role in macroeconomic management, have brought under control the basic key elements of the macroeconomic adjustment system linking with the market economy. Of course, it is the economists' responsibility and duty to confront current problems, analyze their outstanding causes, determine ways of resolving them, and propose countermeasures aimed at speeding up reform in the new stage, especially in 1994. It is also the basic starting point of this research report. Reform Achievements in the Transition In 1993, the central government gathered various forces which drew up plans for comprehensive reform, and proposed a comprehensive set of reform plans, starting with the five areas of finance, revenue, investment, enterprises, and social insurance. This is a major achievement, defining the activity and mission of reform in the new stage under the prerequisite of summarizing the experience of the previous 15 years of reform. It is certain that since 1984, every larger scale reform had a plan, but these were either outlined or just promoted in a single item, without a comprehensive supporting set in accordance with the demands of the market economy. However, 1993s plan was a substantial supporting set of reform plans based on marketization, which prepared for comprehensive creation of the system in the second stage. In the timely, sequential process of reform, distribution of content and force of reform is not balanced and in equal value; some years have more reform content while some have less content. Usually, in years with less reform content the focus is often on reorganizing and handling the economic order, resolving outstanding new contradictions and problems, creating a better environment for new stages of reform. The "reorganization and handling" of 1989-1991 and the "macroeconomic control and adjustment" of July to October 1993 were both of this sort. But, the former was not only a comprehensive, long term shrinkage of the economy, forcefully implemented, it was also carried out through project cutbacks and termination of investment by administrative orders handed down from higher to lower levels, in an attempt to control increasing demand through a low growth rate, bringing about an artificial "balance between supply and demand". The result was that three years' reorganization and handling brought on a two and half year slump in the market. In addition, when a favorable reform environment emerged, there was a failure to enforce reform promptly to promote the transition from the first stage of reform to the second stage, and a wonderful reform opportunity was missed. In contrast, the second shrinkage of the economy was not comprehensive, only about half a year, and carried less force. In addition, it employed parameter controls instead of the traditional quota controls. On the one hand, it adjusted people's and enterprises' monetary activities by flexible adjustment of the exchange rate, thereby stabilizing it, and guaranteeing the RMB's reputation and status; this special effort to unify the exchange rate provided experiences and lessons in currency reform which definitely will be employed in the future. On the other hand, although the interest rate adjustment tended to be small, it basically worked to control the expansion of investment and furthered the tendency of residents to make deposits, stifling their overwhelming urge to consume and stabilizing the market to carry out its "soft landing" function. Doubtless, this parameter control was accomplished through governmental intervention, certainly far from the parameter management of the developed market economy. But the problem is that the banks and the government are still not separate. "Bank independence" and "specialized bank commercialization" still have not moved from theory to reality, the central bank has not gained its independence, stable economic function and rights under the "bank president directed by senior officers" system. If government did not intervene directly, macroadjustment and control would have no function. In the transitional period from the traditional planned economy to the socialist market economy, from direct control to indirect control, we will often have the situation that the new system cannot work if we do not take advantage of the old system; what is meaningful here is that the self-reform of the old system will gradually provide space for breeding the new system. The macroadjustment and control during the summer and autumn of 1993 is a model sample in this regard. For cooling down real estate market, the major goal is to restrict developing a "froth economy," to avoid having capital which is primarily short from flowing into real estate excessively and thereby increasing the basic industry bottlenecks, e.g., transportation, telecommunications, etc. In addition, most of the capital used on the stock exchange and real estate exchange are public funds, so if we do not implement controls until the new system is built up completely, the final explosion of accumulated contradictions will be hard to imagine. Meanwhile, there cannot be lasting, rapid, and healthy development of the economy either. The operation of economic policy in 1993 can be summarized as "focusing with both hands". This means using one hand to grasp macrocontrol and adjustment, while suppressing an overheated economy, trying to avoid decline, and maintaining rapid growth. On the other hand grasping system renewal, while carrying out comprehensive reform design, accelerating domestic economic work and progressively regulating marketization of the system. Besides the reform achievements listed above, there was other significant progress in 1993's reform, including the following several areas: 1. The key measure of passing price reform In the past 13 years, China has achieved much in the way of price reform. Up to 1992, in the national market set price rate, agricultural products and by-products occupied 78.5 percent, gross social commodity retail sale value occupied 79.6 percent, and production materials occupied 64.2 percent; as for share of market adjustment in national commodity value, agricultural products and by-products were at 77.8 percent, consumer goods at 83.4 percent, and among these, industrial consumer goods were at 78.1 percent, and production materials at 61.8 percent. In 1993, in the commodity market, those items which had been viewed as related to the national plan and the people's livelihood, such as grain, had their prices opened up comprehensively, implementing a policy of relying on the market fixed price for the most part and totally abolishing the grain ration, with the former ration provision shifted to free purchase in the market. Although there still cannot be grain exchange between farmers and government without government involvement, this type of participation has to be regulated in accordance with supply and demand. When grain supplies are plentiful, a limited portion begins to appear in the purchasing market, less is expended on grain consumption and possible rises in price after opening up the market do not create huge pressures on the average person's life. Promptly opening up grain distribution and prices was a successful step, offering new experiences in "reform must seek opportunities." Shifting grain distribution along with market adjustment, fixing grain exchange prices according to supply and demand, demonstrated that China had successfully passed the difficult point in price reform, and also bolstered our confidence in the marketization of housing and rental price reform. 2. Building a modern enterprise system was put on the agenda Building a modern enterprise system is a basic item in the comprehensive reform plans issued in 1993. It broadened our vision of enterprise reform, and showed that deepening enterprise reform was not just a matter of carrying out relaxation of operational rights or clarifying property rights. But it should select and reorganize enterprises' organizational form in accordance with fair competition and perfecting efficiency in combination with relaxation of operational rights and clarification of property rights. There are two fundamental meanings here: one, is that in accelerating the transformation of the state-owned enterprise system, whether we should go the way of incorporation, how much should be run by local people, how much do we implement the joint stock system, how much should we retain the unitified state ownership form with local operation, all must be determined solely by the demands of the developing market and not by artificial will, and even less is it necessary to set a quota figure in advance; two, it would be suitable to creating a fair competition situation for the various types of enterprises, including state-owned, collective, and privately owned enterprises, in addition to requiring a unified tax system, there should be permission given for capital and labor force to circulate freely. 3. Initial progress in marketization of key elements Taking establishment of a modern enterprise system as the basic mission of microscopic reform logically raises the question of marketizing key elements. In 1993, financing channels in China tended to be pluralized, the amount of currency freely exchanged in the currency market increased, especially in the foreign currency exchange market, the government reduced quota restrictions, and broaden the space for automatic adjustment in market supply and demand. In the dangerous situation of abnormal devaluation of the renminbi, the government did not artificially restrict the price level but used the means of raising the interest rate while selling government reserves of gold and foreign currency, in order to narrow the gap between foreign currency supply and demand, and altering enterprises' and individuals' expectations of currency value, and stabilizing the market. This is significant in that it not only did not put any obstacles in the way of further currency and fiscal reform, it also pointed out the possibility and feasibility of establishing a unified currency rate system. In a country like China, with an almost unlimited labor supply, the development of a labor market, especially the establishment of a labor market in the area of the state-owned economy, will be an important reform project. In 1993, there were two areas in the development of a labor market in the state-owned economy that showed initial progress: one was the establishment of an internal labor market, that is, "one plant with two systems" an arrangement which increased the flexibility of capital inside enterprises and reorganized labor; the other was the establishment of the second job market, breaking the old pattern in which labor could not flow between state ownership and non-state ownership. 4. Accelerated development of the private economy Another important achievement of reform in 1993 was the accelerated development of the individual and privately owned economies. These characteristically were demonstrated in: 1) There was a rapid increase in the number of new registrations. Taking the first quarter as an example, there were 153.000 new private commercial and industrial registrations in addition to the base of 15.53 million registered in 1992 nationally, an increase of over 10 percent. Shanghai had a net increase of 2,000 families in the first half year, with 10 new businesses starting up every day; Dalian had 1,284 new registrations in the first half of the year, a 540 percent increase. 2) Private capital joining state-owned enterprises is quite outstanding. There were 34 state-owned and township collective silk industry enterprises in Huzhou, Zhejiang which implemented joint public-private ownership, with the private share being 60 to 80 percent, and these had a 100 percent rate of success. At present, individual business and private owned business are not only knocking at the doors of big cities, but also at the door of the state-owned and collective economies, and their developmental trend is bright. Although these facts are not obvious results of reform measures, to a certain degree, they can be looked upon as "self-reforms," closely connected with government relaxation of the ownership structure policy. 5. Initial achievements in reform of the social insurance system Since the nineties, national health care, housing, retirement and provision for the elderly have been raised to an important position, but the pace was not stepped up until comrade Deng Xiaoping made his speech during his inspection tour of southern China, and 1993 was a year of significant acceleration. Taking housing reform as an example, each locality implemented "walking on two legs," which means "raise rents, offer subsidies" and preferential sales. Some carried out this raising of rent while offering subsidies in three steps, some in one. Although rents and housing prices generally tended to be low, at a considerable distance from the current market price, it must be considered that in a total reform measure, taking the first step is very important. It is unrealistic to try to accomplish marketization of the welfare system in one step. In addition to the several areas listed above, 1993 also saw some reform actions by government administrative organs in such areas as finance and tax revenue distribution safety, the external environment for enterprises, etc. However, reform in these areas basically have not jumped out of the traditional planned economy framework. Looking at what is required to develop a new economic system, they are obviously backward. The lack of progress in reform of these areas is precisely an important source of the conflicts and problems produced in the present dual system. Background of the New System: Contradictions and Difficulties Reform has entered a new stage. It is impossible for things to always go smoothly when there is a transition from shallow to deep, from gradual to accelerated, from parts to a whole set of reform supports; there will be many contradictions and difficulties. If we say that reform in the eighties was solely a confrontation with the monolithic system of the traditional planned economy, while all other neglected tasks had to wait for construction, still people were so eager for reform that even superficial reform had a somewhat positive effect. The nineties mean dealing with the implementation of a complete set of supports for reform and development at a deep level in a situation where a dual, mutually conflicting system exists, and the difficulties are greater. Moreover the major tasks in the new stage of reform, i.e., the property rights mix, reorganization of employment, total marketization of the welfare provision system, remolding the financial system into competitive banking, reorganizing governmental functions to meet the demands of the market economy, etc., will all probably present a challenge to current profit takers at each level. New conflicts may arise, as will the difficulties of economic reality and the operational process of reform. Let us start first of all with conversion of the enterprise system, especially state-owned enterprises. This mission has been suggested for several years, but it was only in 1993 that establishment of a modern enterprise system was proposed. Realistically, it has always been difficult to make fundamental breakthroughs. In the past several years, many people have attributed the causes of this to unliberated ideas and old theoretical understanding, but the problem is by no means that simple. If we assume that before the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee, the task was to smash traditional ideas about reform of state-owned property rights, and the ideas of "clarifying property rights" and stepping up the pace of property rights reform were written into the "Decisions," with unanimous agreement, can it then be said that when conditions are ripe, conversion of the state-owned enterprise system and establishment of a modern enterprise system will be successful? No. Conversion of the state-owned enterprise system and establishment of a modern enterprise system means accelerating the reorganization of employment, and reorganizing employment will definitely means reductions in the numbers of employees, and a considerable number of current employees will be dismissed. Once it has been decided to develop a market economy and establish fair competition, we have must be duty-bound not to turn back on establishing and developing a labor force market, for with the promotion of efficiency and competition, unemployment is unavoidable. That was why in the reform plan of 1987-88, we proposed "marketizing employment, and public unemployment," for a market economy without some unemployment and a labor force market are unimaginable. In state-owned enterprises, the difficulty in implementing this plan is not that workers cannot grasp the concept, but rather in the lack of a suitable external environment. Public housing and pensions are now assumed by work units, so if large numbers of people are dismissed, they will be left in society with neither salary, a place to live, or health and welfare benefits; how will they live? Among the 150 million employee contingents we have today, 110 million, or two-thirds, are state employees; even if we dismiss just one-tenth of these, more than 10 million will remain. Calculated by a burden coefficient of 1.72, it means over 27.2 million people may well be in the situation of having nothing, and being homeless. In addition, China has a surplus agricultural labor force of over 100 million which must be shifted to non-agricultural industry, an average of more than 13 million annually who reach the age of coming into the work force, plus a possible 10 to 30 million people dismissed from collective enterprises. These will all bring huge pressures to relocate surplus labors in state-owned work units. On the one hand, we should resolve unemployment in state-owned work units through bankruptcy and the system of the excellent winning while the inferior are deleted; on the other hand, it is difficult for surplus people to find new job positions, as well as their family members not having protection. While this will not be a difficult point in this and the next year's reform, it will be a major conflict and difficult situation in the second stage of reform. In addition, the first 15 years of reform generally smashed the original, excessively concentrated, centralized system, some of the control rights which originally were the central government's have been transmitted to the market and local governments through releasing rights to enterprises and local governments, but in the meantime there also appeared the phenomenon of local government having excessive rights. At present, there are three problems with the behavior of local governments: one is adverse adjustment toward higher levels; two is direct interference with lower; three is obstructing their neighbors. These three have the common objective of protecting local profits. Out of its need to develop the socialist market economy, China must establish unified markets in all areas, establish equal competition in localities, allow enterprises not only to rid themselves of administrative control from the central government, but also rid themselves of direct interference from local governments, promoting each level of government to act only a supply service, as all microeconomic major bodies of government, especially local governments, must accept adjustment by markets. The current situation far exceeds this requirement. Local governments' adverse adjustment and control toward higher levels is found chiefly during periods of economic adjustment. Whenever the central government cannot implement policy either totally or mixed, it is generally due to not to enterprises but to local governments. This is because when the central government attempts to slow things down, stifling the economy from being too hot, those regions which are already too hot are usually in compliance in public but in opposition in private. Although in report charts, the statistics figure show a reduced rate of speed, yet in practice, there remains an insistence on high speed to resolve regional employment and improve the level of regional development; on mix adjusting, although the central government has repeatedly stressed accelerated development of transportation and telecommunication, etc., in bottleneck industries by means of cooling down manufacturing. Because manufacturing brings high value and large profits, while basic industry is more long-term, local governments usually put labor resources, material resources and financial resources into manufacturing industry, so there is always an unsatisfactory mix. Thus, resistance at present to total amount and mix adjustment is not from enterprises but from local governments. Local governments' direct intervention with lower levels is becoming stronger as the release of rights expands with reform. This intervention is aimed chiefly at three targets: one is enterprises, two is banks, three is the peasants. They complain of excessive assignment of labor force, money, and materials, "too many mothers-in-law." Actually, most of these are the activities of local governmental organs. This direct intervention with the main entities of the market, and especially with banks, seriously impedes the normal development of the market economy. Local protectionism or local economic impedances not only cause duplicated construction among different regions and products and similar technology choices, but also impedes the establishment of a unified national market. Local governments' non-marketized activities higher, lower, left and right have become a major contradiction in current economic operations and reform. Due to local governments have considerable power, strong economic force, a complicated situation with economic conditions and unbalanced profits, etc., added to the reduction in the central government's powers, there are no corresponding regulations restricting the activities of local governments, so converting local governments' function will become a difficult point in the new stage. The simple tax division system can only resolve the distribution of tax revenues between the central government and localities; it cannot accomplish the goal of redefining local government's function in accordance with the demands of the market economy. Second, there is a problem with lagging financial system reform. After 15 years' reform, China's financial channels have begun to develop toward multiple elements. In addition to deposits and bank loans, there are government and enterprise bonds, stocks, and other forms of raising funds. However, capital distribution is still affected greatly by the supply system, and in a certain sense, the "external circulation" of capital has more of a market component than does "internal circulation." The reason "internal circulation" has more non-market component is that banks have not been separated from government. The Bank of China not only is not an independent unitary organ with the right to issue currency, it cannot make its own decisions regarding adjustment of currency supply and price levels. It is controlled by administrators in the central government, but in addition each of the specialized banks (especially branch banks) have their credit and loans controlled by local governments; they do not obey markets but local administrators. Meanwhile, banks continue to maintain the state monopoly, rejecting the elimination system, and the lack of competition also results in too tight control of "internal circulation," which make the direction of application unreasonable and inefficient. Under market economic conditions, finance is at the center of domestic economic activities, the banks are the adjustment center, and interest rates are determined by market supply and demand of capital. However, finance, banking, and interest rates in China are at present still operated directly by the government. Changing this pattern, making an independent, multiple element, competitive, and efficient new financial system has naturally become a third theme and a difficult point in the new stage of reform. The key here is to resolve conflicts of interest and distribution of rights between government and enterprises, and between the central government and local governments. Key Choices for Accelerating the Marketization Process In the first 15 years, the outstanding achievement of converting the economic system in China is the establishment of a price competition system, with the single planned, price setting of the past changed into setting price in the market with government supervision. The focal point of reform in 1994 and in the entire new stage is converting the state-owned enterprise system, and around this focal point, the launching and breakthroughs in reform will be from the following several aspects. 1. Establish a modern enterprise system The major battlefield for 1994 and future economic reform is in the state-owned enterprises, that is, converting the current state-owned enterprise system into a modern enterprise system. In order to attain this goal, we must implement creativity in both the internal and external state-owned enterprise system. The theme of internal reform is still property rights reform, while external reform includes three basic aspects, i.e., the welfare system, the role of government, and the financial system. In the transformation of the state-owned property right administrative system, theoreticians are increasing their demands for organizing and building up the limited responsibility corporation and the joint stock limited corporation. So this is a certain measure toward establishing a modern enterprise system and a modern market system. Under a joint stock system there are many levels one can choose, with wide coverage, big corporations doing big shares, small corporations doing small shares, allowing free purchase of shares both by organizations who represent the state's and residents' interests in joint stock. This form of property rights organization can cut across cities and countryside, regions and countries; it helps the flow of capital flow and capital's concentration and decomposition. But, facing the huge scale of state-owned asset property rights that we have now, simply creating a joint stock limited corporation may not be practical; one needs to consider a variety of alternatives. In addition to developing joint stock limited corporations, there should be appropriate development of two enterprise property organization forms: a cooperative rights system and independent, individual capital. These should be developed together by system change, auction, lease, contracting and sales, etc. In the process of reorganizing property rights, there is no doubt we will absorb the "corporate culture" of enterprise operations in Europe and America, but we must in no way ignore the "individual and family culture" preserved from China. Chinese economic booms in Taiwan, Singapore, and Southeast Asia have proven that the latter can also be combined skillfully with the modern market economy. In order to develop and expand the latter two property rights organizational forms, we can on the one hand sell small state-owned enterprises to individuals and families, while on the other hand carry out reorganization of the system by selling some segments which are unsuitable to capital concentration, for example, selling some branch plants to individuals and families, giving them the freedom to choose the property rights organizational form. Regardless of what means are employed to reform the enterprise system, there must be strict checks on capital and assets clarified, doing a good job in assets evaluation to prevent the nation from losing assets. Implementing enterprise reform must combine internal and external reform. The principal cause of inefficiency in converting the enterprise system over the past few years has been the lack of a better external environment. Enterprises which should be eliminated cannot be eliminated, redundant personnel who should be dismissed cannot be dismissed, because it is hard to find a job again, benefit allocations are attached to work units so lack mobility, and employees leaving work units face loss of their current residences, medicare, pensions and other benefits supplied by their work units. In order to accelerate the transformation of the enterprise system in the next several years, the first step is to accelerate socialization and marketization in benefits allocation. This will include: 1) Establishing a system of socialized unemployment, old age insurance and medical insurance, establishing a nationwide social insurance bureau, allowing insurance companies to operate in multiple forms and with full responsibility for their profits and losses. This will create a situation where workers' and their family members' medicare, pensions and unemployment will neither be attached to work units, nor having trouble at home. 2) Reform the current work unit housing allocation system, having all publicly-owned housing managed by corporate enterprises. Housing reform over the past few years stressed the point of trying to raise housing prices, reducing the financial burden of government and enterprises through building houses by raising house prices and then selling some houses at discounted prices. This still has not accomplished the commercialization and marketization of housing. The difficulty here is not that residents lack the ability to bear rising rents, or this is too complex in operation, but rather that the commercialization of public housing must first of all be socialized. We must convert housing allocation by work units to allocation by socialized corporations. Only after housing is socialized will it become possible for the labor force to flow freely among different enterprises. 3) For enterprise reform, a good external environment must also include a flexible capital reorganizing system. China's current enterprise system is a system in which "workers will be workers forever, managers will always be managers." There are all kinds of limitations on capital reorganization, such as the "threshold is too high," there are excessive restrictions on registering new corporations through requiring the approval of many departments. But after registration it is difficult to file for bankruptcy, just the opposite of the "easy to register but hard to stay in business" situation which prevails in developed countries. If this abnormal phenomenon cannot be changed, it will be unfavorable to establishing a bankruptcy and unemployment system in enterprises either. If workers lose their jobs and cannot find employment in other work units, some of them can collect funds or obtain loans to establish stores or plants, becoming employers. More small enterprises in existence means the absorption of more of the labor force, as well as providing alternatives for surplus labor in state-owned work units. 2. Transforming the Role of Government on Two Levels The basic condition for establishing a modern enterprise system is the elimination of direct governmental intervention, and this requires transforming the role of government, especially that of local government. First of all, separate government from enterprises, carry out a common policy of "enterprises without mothers-in-law", do not permit government administrative departments to directly involve themselves with enterprises' activities. Government should only take care of legislation, formulate regulations, collect taxes, and regulate enterprises' activities through economic policies that either stimulate or cool down, and all of these accomplished by market parameters. For projects with direct government investment, we should still entrust incorporated enterprises to undertake these but not have them operated by government administrative organs. All government management activities are public matters, and include setting and implementing local tax regulations after implementation of a tax division system, ecological environment administration and public investment in infrastructural projects at the local level, etc. Carrying out the transformation of governmental functions can be considered on two levels: one is the function of the central government (here we are only talking about the economic function), two is the function of local government. In principle, the chief function of the central government can be regarded as: 1) carrying out macroadjustment and control of the domestic economy, including macroemployment and inflation, currency supply and interest rate level, the national tax standard and economic growth and balance administration; 2) national level social insurance arrangements, including poverty and unemployment relief; arranging for retirement and care for the aged and subsidies for military people, etc.; 3) construction of interprovincial infrastructural facilities; and 4) developing natural resource monopolies and high tech, education, and research on a massive scale. Local governments should only undertake public affairs within their local sphere; there are chiefly two basic divisions between their role and that of the central government: one is division of scale, in that the central government governs an entire entity, while local governments govern only parts; the second is that localities lack macroeconomic adjustment and control powers in such matters as the issuance of currency and its circulation, etc. The only direct relationship between these two levels of government and enterprises is revenue, with all other regulatory activities conducted via two intermediaries: the law and the market. 3. Model an Independent, Multi-Element, Competitive Financial System Establishment of a modern enterprise system requires the support of the modern financial system. At present, in addition to suffering from too much government intervention in supplying, selling, and pricing of goods and in the employment of people, state-owned enterprises also lack the power to make their own choices in the use of capital. The capital distribution system is still in effect. It is not simply a problem of the banks' administration level: the key is factor is that the banking business also suffers from interference by government officers. The reason is that specialized banks are not incorporated, nor are they separate from government. In developed market economy countries, no matter whether commercial banks which operate by enterprise methods or central banks which implement currency policy, the controlling balance between currency supply and demand, the regulation and control of overall interest rate levels are all independent, and any direct interference by government administrative organs is illegal. This explains why their banking system is highly independent, because they are responsible for macroeconomic balance. America has the most advanced banking system in the world, with the greatest degree of independence. While banks in Japan and Germany are subject to more interference from government, this kind of interference is indirect, and usually must be implemented by legal means. When designing and constructing the new banking system in China, we can refer to the Japanese and German experience, and learn from the American model. Regarding enterprise reform, there is also a problem of inducing the competition system in financial system reform. At present, all of our banks are run by the state, in a kind of monopolistic operation without competition. Would it be possible to try operating the banks on a joint stock system? Everyone is very cautious about this question, because it is harder to control than those assets in material form, such as land, real estate and enterprises. Problems which arise in the reform of material assets are easier to handle than those which arise in the reform of financial assets. Plus, if the government regulations on bank administration are unclear, it is easy succumb to the lure of reaping staggering profits, so the income gap caused by policy will be too sharp. There must be appropriate controls on taxes on part of the income from bank differential interest rate, and in addition, banks' activities must be regulated by a corresponding set of legal regulations. All of this requires very cautious and strict consideration. Therefore, before launching bank system reform, we must make it a goal that the new banking system "take state ownership as the dominant factor, with multiple forms of ownership forms coexisting". There should be a process for preparing legislation and system design. When the situation is still not ripe, there should be no rush to implement joint stock or privatized capital banks. But this should be considered for the long term. Modeling an independent, multiple-element, competitive bank finance system to develop the socialist market economy is inevitably the road we will take. 4. Establish a System in Which Every Citizen Pays Taxes and There Is Public Financing Enterprises are the principal entity of the market, developing the market economy depends first and foremost upon establishing this market principal entity. However, the socialist market economy is not a free, laissez-faire economy: the degree of government intervention is stronger and the scale of government intervention is wider than in the Western market economy. One of the former's important characteristics is that it achieves more fairness by means of reallocation. This involves the problem of national taxes, and involves the problem of the distribution relationship between the "state" and the "people." The chief measure for handling the distribution relationship between the "state" and the "people" is the tax. More taxes mean more benefits go to the state, while less taxes mean more benefits go to the people. Before the implementation of reform, the tax system in China was very simple, having a very small number of varieties, low tax rates and little change. The major reasons for this were: one, there were no privately owned enterprises, and the state-owned enterprises turned over profits instead of taxes; two, both urban and rural residents generally had low incomes, so paid no income tax; three, farmers paid in grains in lieu of tax. Since the implementation of reform some changes have occurred: the state-owned enterprises are carrying out the policy of converting profits into taxes; privately owned enterprises and other types of enterprises have become more important taxpayers; with the rising incomes of both urban and rural dwellers, personal income tax has been produced and expanded; the tax on farmers' materials have been converted into currency taxes. With the tax system changed, in order to prevent the national treasury from drying up, the tax system should correspondingly be reformed; there should be corresponding adjustments in both the varieties and rates of taxes, and these should be implemented by means of strong and powerful measures. In the past several years, we did not attain this point, and policies concerning this aspect had some deviation. This policy deviation was due to the old tax system growing increasingly unsuitable to the new economic situation. So, accelerating tax system reform has become an urgent matter. Recently, tax system reform has been listed as a very important issue among five major reform issues, which demonstrates that the central government is giving a great deal of attention to the problems which exist in the tax system. But if we look at the publicity and implementation of policy, it seems that there has been more emphasis on resolving the tax division system of revenue relationship between the central government and localities. It is no doubt very important to carry out a tax division system, as it can clarify the tax allocation of rights, responsibilities and benefits between the central government and localities. This will lay the foundation for smashing the huge, monolithic, central government-intensive type of financial system, and result in the future in less wrangling between the central government and localities, and among localities themselves, freeing each level of government to concentrate on it regular work well, and improving the efficiency of governmental activities. However, we cannot limit ourselves to this if we are to establish a new tax system suitable to developing the socialist market economy; it is urgent that we establish an uniform tax payment system that involves every citizen. Now, evading taxes has almost become a habit with businessmen, and the taxes evaded increase or decrease with the amount of income. If we do not pay urgent attention to building the system and legal restrictions, it could possibly lead to the people growing prosperous while the state becomes impoverished. The basic points of the tax system reform to be implemented soon should not be an increase or reduction in taxes, but should be a complete tax, which means collecting all taxes that should be paid. We can consider establishing a uniform system of tax payment involving every citizen in three aspects: 1) work out detailed, well-organized tax collection regulations, including the division between national taxes and local taxes, tax varieties, tax rates, deadlines, scale, penalty rules, etc.; the more the detail the better the tax law. 2) Establishing a strict tax reporting system, fixing an annual legal tax reporting term, with individuals and business owners required to report taxes to government tax departments before the deadline. Once tax evasion is discovered, there should be an audit of the past few years' total income and tax report documents, and strict punishment levied. This will form a habit of tax reporting for individuals and business owners by the threat of strict punishment. 3) Establish a two-level system of national tax administration for both central government and provinces, giving tax officers full authority to implement the state's tax laws, and no government administrator can reduce or exempt taxes for individuals or business owners which exceed the powers of tax officers, for any reasons. 4) All individuals, regardless of their status, citizenship, age and gender, must pay their taxes in accordance with the same law. There can be consideration of implementing an employee chart system in which all employees must have employees' charts, as well as showing tax payment forms, letting government restrict employers, and employers restrict employees. When opening deposit accounts or opening accounts with currency exchange organizations, the tax form must be attached when providing identification. Operation of the socialist market economy must be based on an extremely strict legal system, and tax laws are fundmental, major laws in a nation's economy. Comprehensively accelerating reform of the tax law is a very urgent part of accelerating reform of the entire economic system. Tax system reform is actually reform of the state's financial income system. Once equal competition is implemented, and state-owned and other enterprises operate under the same tax law, the state's tax revenues may shrink in scale, so government expenditures will shrink in turn, which will require adjusting the government's financial role. Our present government finances are still comprehensive finances, and after releasing rights and profits, in the original monolithic revenue and expenditure financial model, unified revenues shrank at a faster pace than the unified expenditures did, causing a steady increase in the financial deficit. In 1985, our financial surplus was 2.16 billion yuan, and in 1992 we had a 23.66 billion yuan financial deficit. If there is no adjustment in the pattern of revenue and expenditure, the deficit will continue to grow, even if there is repeated removal of educational funds. The basic way to resolve the current financial difficulty is not to raise taxes ("digging out resources"), and there should be no reductions in scientific and educational funds ("cutting expenses"); rather, there can only be fundamental reform of the financial revenue and expenditure system, and this means moving the comprehensive finances we have now to public financing, except that investment in natural monopolies, extremely huge scale, national defense, and some fundmental industries will continue to be government expenditures, and the government should use capital which it controls to provide social guarantees and other public affairs. So, establishing a system of public finance will become one of the basic missions of reform starting in 1994.
