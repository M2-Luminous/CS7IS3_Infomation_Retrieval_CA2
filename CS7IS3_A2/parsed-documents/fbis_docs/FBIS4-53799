Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae announced in a press conference yesterday that 433,335 acres (535 million pyong), amounting to 20 percent of the total privately-owned land in direct use or under control of the armed forces, will either be decontrolled or deregulated to a large extent. He said the measure, due to take effect June 1, is being initiated after a full year of consultations with related government agencies and political parties. The total area is far in excess of the 283,500 acres of protected regions which have been decontrolled since 1973. "The decision to decontrol the protected area is in line with a directive from President Kim Yong-sam to provide greater convenience to residents in affected areas and to contribute to national economic development," he said. The areas to be decontrolled are concentrated in the northern parts of Kyonggi-to and Kangwon-to and include regions located close to the metropolitan area and Inchon, the minister explained. The affected areas include land in Pochon, Ilsan and Koyang, all in Kyonggi-to, and Hwachon, Kangwon-to. In addition, he said, areas near the Civilian Access Control Line which have been opened to group tours by civilians and recreational activities will be reclassified and downgraded from "controlled" to "limited." Minister Yi noted that the measure effectively means that regulations pertaining to construction and rehabilitation of existing facilities will be eased to open the way for brisk development. "Certain military facilities along the coastal areas will also be transferred to the Navy, making it simpler for construction projects to be approved," he added. Yi went on to say that the draft revision to the Military Installation Protection Law has been put on public notice and will go into effect June 1. Once the revision is in place, owners, who have for long been virtually prohibited from exercising their right on their real estate holdings, will be able to utilize their land for urban development and agricultural activities. However, he said, strict measures will also be implemented to ensure that the decontrolling of the area will not lend its hand to encouraging real estate speculation. "The Construction Ministry is prepared to deliberate carefully on each of the applications and only those who are judged to be sincerely interested in developing the areas will be given approvals," he said. He elaborated that all those found to be violating related regulations and filing false applications will face criminal charges and be prosecuted to the maximum limit. Autonomous groups such as city and provincial administrations will also establish special task forces to crack down on people suspected of engaging in real estate speculation and subject them to tax audits, he said.
