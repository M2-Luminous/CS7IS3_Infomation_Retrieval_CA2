In an interview with ZDF today, Woerner said "what we want is a greater Europe, if you will, a lasting Euro-Atlantic community with the Russians so that they do not have the feeling of being excluded or even encircled." Woerner defended the concept of Partnership for Peace with the countries of Central and East Europe that was approved at the NATO summit in Brussels, and pointed out that consultations were envisaged in the event of a crisis. Even though there were no security guarantees for these countries as yet, this did not mean "that we will stand idly by if they are attacked." As for NATO's attitude to the Bosnia conflict, Woerner said, with regard to possible air strikes in Bosnia, the alliance depended on the approval of the United Nations. The opinion of UN troops on the ground also had to be heard. However, he had the impression that there was "much greater determination" in the alliance: "Things cannot stay the way they are."
