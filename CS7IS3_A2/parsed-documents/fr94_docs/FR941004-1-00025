FR941004-1-00025 FR941004-1-00004 The drafters of this regulation are Mr. John Wachter, project officer, and LT Elisa Holland, project attorney. Background and Purpose LDOTD has requested 8-hours notice for an opening of the draw because of a decline in vessel traffic that passes the Superior Oil Canal bridge. Thus, the reason for the proposed change. 8-hour notice would allow the bridge owner relief from having a person available at the bridge site from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., creating a savings to the taxpayer while still serving the reasonable needs of navigational interests. Discussion of Proposed Rules The Superior Oil Canal bridge is a 589 foot structure. Navigational clearances provided by the bridge are 13-feet vertical above mean high water in the closed position and unlimited in the open position. Horizontal clearance is 63-feet. The depth of the waterway at the bridge site is approximately 20-feet. Navigation on the waterway consists of mainly small tugs and light work boats. Data provided by LDOTD show that from January 1, through December 31, 1993, the number of vessels that passed the bridge totaled 191 for the year. This breaks down to about 15.9 vessels per month or 1.9 vessels per 24-hour period. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small business and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. Since the proposed rule also considers the needs of local commercial fishing vessels, the economic impact is expected to be minimal. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism Implications This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under paragraph 2.B.2. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
