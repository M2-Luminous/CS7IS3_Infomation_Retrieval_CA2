He said: This secessionist act, which ignores constitutional legitimacy, aims only to obstruct the efforts exerted to achieve security and stability in our country in light of UN Security Council Resolution 924. The source added: The step taken by the secessionists, who have rebelled against constitutional legitimacy, reminds us of another step taken by the secessionist gang, which rebelled against legitimacy and democracy when the three-day cease-fire decision was issued on 21 May 1994 in response to a desire expressed by the custodian of the two holy places, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz of fraternal Saudi Arabia. Then, 'Ali Salim al-Bid shocked the world by announcing the secession despite his knowledge of the good efforts exerted by the custodian of the two holy places in the hope that his desire, to which our political leadership responded favorably, would be a prelude to a permanent cessation of fighting and a solution to the disputes through constructive dialogue. The source added that this secessionist gang has confirmed once again that it insists on shedding the blood of the Yemeni people in order to impose secession through force of arms. The source concluded by saying: The government of the Republic of Yemen considers this illegitimate step a blatant challenge to the UN Security Council and a flagrant violation of Resolution 924. Despite this fact, this flagrant violation of the UN Security Council will not deter the government of the Republic of Yemen from dealing with that resolution in a positive spirit and in manner that will lead to implementing it in a comprehensive way by all those concerned.
