"I express my condolences and my grief to (march organizer Superior Bonze) Moha Khosananda, the bonzes and laymen, and my compatriots and foreign friends who sacrificed themselves for the ideals of peace, national reconciliation, nonviolence, and friendship through Lord Buddha's peaceful means," the monarch declared in a communique. He stated the Khmer Rouge were responsible for these "tragic and sad actions." A peace march spokesman, cited by AFP, declared that three persons, a bonze, a nun, and a layman, were killed Saturday evening with automatic weapons while at least three bonzes were wounded by the Khmer Rouge. According to the Battambang police, the violence resulted in four dead during this attack, which took place near Bavel District. King Sihanouk urged the organizers of the march to cancel the initiative out of fear that "other incidents" would take place. The peace march of some 1,000 persons, led by Buddhist spiritual leader and Nobel peace prize nominee Moha Khosanada, left for Battambang on 24 April. It planned to go to the Khmer Rouge headquarters in Pailin, some 400 km from here, and then go on to the Angkor Wat temples. According to march organizers, several of the 12 foreigners who took part in the march were kidnapped by the Khmer Rouge. King Sihanouk demanded they be freed immediately, but information on these alleged kidnappings remained unclear Sunday. A British diplomat said there were contradictory reports about their fates and that one of the persons believed kidnapped was seen safe and sound in Battambang. Serei Kosal, deputy Battambang governor, said he had heard that foreigners were reported missing and believed kidnapped by the Khmer Rouge, but he could not confirm these reports.
