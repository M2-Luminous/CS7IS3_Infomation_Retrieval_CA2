On an ecology consciousness scale of one to ten, Germans had the high score of 7.8. Eighty percent of Germans claim that they contribute to environmental protection through their own behavior and that they are willing to buy environmentally friendly products. But only half of them are willing to spend more money to do so. In fact, 80% reject higher gas prices, according to a poll taken by the research institute of Axel Billig & Partner in Cologne and commissioned by the Berlin Office of the Environment. The ecologically aware person has become a statistical norm, environmental consciousness is no longer dependent on age, sex or education. Yet in spite of the pronounced ecological awareness of the Germans, individual behavior meets its limitations when it comes to [imposing] personal restrictions. Thus, over half of the respondents were ready to dispose of batteries separately or to buy energy saving appliances, but every second person rejected higher prices for environmentally friendly products. Fewer than 20% would limit their driving and only 12% would keep the heat lower. For 15% the "pain threshold" for modifying driving behavior was a gas [price of] two German marks per liter. Only 6% believe that the government and business are doing everything necessary for the environment--60% by contrast are of the opinion that either nothing or practically nothing decisive is being done. Yet almost 60% say that not only could the government and business do substantially more, every individual could also contribute more as well. Appeals alone are not enough to increase willingness on the part of individuals, according to the Ministry for the Environment. Instead, environmentally acceptable behavior must be made easier and, if possible, be rewarded. For example, offering environmentally friendly products at prices which are less expensive than the others and not, as is often the case, more expensive.
