Are you disappointed with the way in which the peace process is evolving? ['Arafat] Indeed, more than nine months have passed since the meetings in Oslo and eight months since the signing of the agreement in Washington, but I regret to have to say that nothing has been accomplished so far. [Petrean] How do you explain the delays in the initially envisaged calender of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations? ['Arafat] The reason for this is the policy of procrastination and delay used by the Israeli Government, something that jeopardizes the peace process and places it in a dangerous situation. The Palestinian side has proven flexibility and full responsibility by trying to reach a so-called "peace of the brave men," despite the tough Israeli practices in the field and the continuation of the Israeli policy of killing and arresting Palestinian citizens, imposing traffic restrictions, and maintaining a military encirclement and economic isolation, something that makes the life of our citizens in the occupied territories very difficult and does not contribute in the least to the establishment of a favorable atmosphere for making further progress along the road of peace. The massacre at Ibrahim's Mosque in Hebron is a telling example of the Israeli policy of colonialization and the Israeli Government's responsibility for having brought these colonists there and for having trained, armed, protected, and encouraged them to set up colonies in the towns and inhabited areas of the occupied territories. It is also a telling example of the procrastinating and eschewing policy practiced by the Israeli Government in the implementation of the accord and declaration of principles signed in Washington last September. [Petrean] The attacks and acts of violence continue uninterrupted, particularly in the occupied territories. Do you believe that the Israeli-Palestinian "rejection front" is on the point of reaching its goal? How broad is, in your opinion, the current opposition against the peace process? ['Arafat] One must realize that the delay in the implementation of the peace process will increase the number of people in both camps who oppose this process. The general feeling, which is increasingly growing day by day, particularly among the Palestinians, is that the peace process is futile and that it has failed because of the stubbornness and shunning of the Israeli side. This feeling not only represents the personal stand of several individuals, but is a pervading feeling justified by the growing distrust in this peace process and its usefulness. I have repeatedly warned that the delay in the implementation of the peace process and in the achievement of palpable results may turn the peace process against itself and put it in a dangerous situation! Well, the present is just proving this point, which cannot be ignored, since the acts of violence are on the increase on both sides and the hopes that the Israeli Government will favorably respond to the so-called "peace of the brave men" offered by the PLO -- and successively endorsed by the Palestinian National Council (parliament) in its sessions -- are getting dashed. The Palestinian people are fully engaged in the peace process and want peace. But more than that, the Palestinian people want to live in peace and do not want mere empty words uttered in a handsome way or brilliant festivities and promises that are invalidated by the official Israeli practice and by the actions carried out by the Israeli colonists in the occupied territories. Now, I would also like to ask a few questions. Where is the peace we have been talking about for the past seven months? Where is the peace, when the Israeli occupation against our people's freedom continues? Where is the peace... when the Israeli prisons are full of Palestinian citizens? Where is the peace... when the killing, wounding, and humiliation of Palestinian citizens keep repeating themselves day by day? Where is the peace... when the economic, commercial, and financial isolation is practiced as a constant policy? Where is the peace... when armed extremist colonists are doing what they want in Palestinian towns and villages, without having to answer to any laws? What shall I tell my people? Shall I tell them that the peace process is useless, since the Israelis are not serious and the cochairmen of the peace process are making no effort to implement the provisions of the peace accord? Shall I tell them that the other international forces and the international community are also doing nothing in this respect? [Petrean] Is the PLO ready to ensure the rule of law and order in Gaza and Jericho after the Israeli withdrawal? What kind of social regime does the future Palestinian self-governing authority plan to establish? Is democracy desired and possible? ['Arafat] Palestinian democracy is no illusion or figment of the people's imagination but a reality of the Palestinian people within the PLO, a reality with a long-standing tradition. Thanks to their originality, keen awareness, and feeling of full responsibility, the Palestinian people have managed to preserve and are still preserving this democracy, even during the Palestinian revolution (known as the "Democracy of the Forest of Guns"). Therefore, any future of the Palestinian people in a new state of their own depends on the total and full application of democracy and on its conscious and responsible practice, since democracy is the citadel that protects the Palestinian people's achievements. It is the citadel that preserves the order and supervises the unity of the people and their parties and institutions operating inside and outside the Palestinian territories. All draft laws and the temporary Constitution confirms, supports, and promotes this reality. [Petrean] The PLO has estimated that at least $13 billion is needed in the next 10 years to promote economic reconstruction and meet basic social requirements. What are the financing possibilities available to you? What overall economic strategy do you envisage? ['Arafat] I would like to emphasize the huge burden of responsibility on the shoulders of the Palestinian National authority for the future reconstruction of the occupied territories, since we are obliged to start from zero and even from below zero. The long years of the Israeli occupation have brought the Palestinian territories, society, institutions, governmental bodies, and national councils into a disastrous state, something that has hurt the entire infrastructure; consequently, we will have to rebuild this infrastructure basis in its entirety. Therefore, the PLO and the Palestinian National Authority -- fully aware of their huge responsibility in this respect -- are doing everything possible to implement their economic program in the financial and production sectors, so as to begin Palestine's reconstruction as soon as possible. As you know, this requires ensuring the necessary financial means for implementing these projects and plans. We are now in the process of establishing contacts with the relevant international financial institutions and with the funds of the credit countries, which can grant assistance and the necessary financial means. However, this is a very difficult and slow process, which does not meet the immediate requirements of beginning the reconstruction work. [Petrean] Do you believe that Romania, which has always had very good relations with the PLO, can participate in the Palestinian reconstruction? What role can be played by Romanian businessmen? ['Arafat] We believe that a large part of the development projects in Palestine should be done through bilateral cooperation with friendly countries, countries that want to help the Palestinian people and participate alongside them in the development of Palestine. As you have said, Romanian-Palestinian relations, at both the official or popular level, have always been warm and sincere. We believe that the friendship between the two peoples provides for a favorable basis for increasing bilateral economic cooperation, and we hope that Romania will play an important role, both at the governmental and private sector levels, in the reconstruction of the Palestinian infrastructure. We welcome this role. [Petrean] Looking slightly ahead, how do you think the problem of the Jewish settlements in the occupied territories should be solved? What about Jerusalem? ['Arafat] The problem of the colonies and Jerusalem should be discussed as soon as possible after the implementation of the agreements on Gaza and Jericho, within a period that should not exceed the beginning of the third year after the implementation of this accord. Let us not forget that these colonies are not legal from a juridic point of view; nor are they legal from an international viewpoint, particularly in view of the UN decisions of the 4th Geneva Convention of 1949. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told me not long ago that he intends to liquidate the colonies. Regarding the holy Arab Jerusalem, it is subject to Decision 242 of the UN Security Council regarding the Arab and Palestinian territories occupied after 1967. The problem of Jerusalem is also covered by Decision 904 of the UN Security Council, which considers Jerusalem as part of the territories occupied at the respective time (1967). Likewise, the Israeli United Workers Party sees the possibility of creating two capitals in Jerusalem for the two states, and we support this idea.
