FR940613-2-00045 FR940613-2-00031 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review June 6, 1994. The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirements to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. For further information on these submissions contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632&hyph;0276. Persons wishing to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, room 3221 NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;3561. Note: The Commission has requested expedited review of these items by June 29, 1994, under the provisions of 5 CFR 1320.18. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0563. Title: Section 76.915, Change in status of cable operator. Action: Extension of currently approved collection. Respondents: State or local governments, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 465 responses; 2.39 hours average burden per response; 1,111 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: Section 76.915 is used to determine whether or not a cable television system is subject to effective competition and therefore, not subject to rate regulation under the 1992 Cable Act. If the collection of information was not conducted under §§76.915(b) and (d), the potential for franchise authority error in determining the presence of effective competition would be unchecked and could lead to deregulation of cable rates for systems not subject to effective competition in contravention of the 1992 Cable Act. Franchising authority decisions on petitions for change in status must be made within 30 days after the pleading cycle set for in §76.915(a) closes. Franchising authorities must notify the Commission within ten (10) days of any decision changing status. Unless the Commission receives an opposition to such changes in status, the decision will become final 30 days after adoption by the franchising authority. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0564. Title: Section 76.924, Cost accounting and cost allocation requirements. Action: Revision of a currently approved collection. Respondents: Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: Recordkeeping requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 30,070 recordkeepers; 80 hours average burden per recordkeeper; 2,405,600 hours total annual burden.
