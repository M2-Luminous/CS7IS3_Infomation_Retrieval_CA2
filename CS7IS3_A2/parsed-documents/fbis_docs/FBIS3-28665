"I don't believe the Fed has decided to tighten the credit condition. Rather, it has driven it to natural [as received]," the source said on condition of anonymity. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said Friday the Federal Open Market Committee has decided to tighten its credit policy which is "expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market rates." The source said the Fed has so far guided interest rates lower as an emergency step to realize the economic recovery and the stable financial mechanism. "Now that the U.S. economy is on the recovery, the Fed may have given up the idea of lowering rates. If it continues to ease credit conditions, fears of inflation may arise," the source said. "Interest rate development in the Japanese short-term money market is set by domestic factors, rather than the U.S.'s. It is hard to believe it will have a big influence on Japan's credit policy."
