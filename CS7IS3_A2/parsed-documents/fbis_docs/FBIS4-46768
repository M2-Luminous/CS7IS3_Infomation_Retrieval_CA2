Ch.). Point 6 of this same code explains: "The brother-in-arms resolves any questions guided only by national legal consciousness in accordance with the powers and authorities granted to him by the Chief Brother-in-Arms, and is not subject to any other laws." The most remarkable Point 3 of the code states: "Any encroachment on the honor and dignity of a brother-in-arms is a crime against the Russian nation." So there you have it! What is this--megalomania or someone's angry will, which wants to turn the country into a theatre of military operations? Point 14 of the code declares: "A brother-in-arms is obliged to always remember that Russia has no friends. One who forgets this becomes a traitor." This is medieval blackness... Yet it is so similar to that which the CPSU [Communist Party of the Soviet Union] and the KGB [Committee for State Security] were in their time able to do with our country, turning it into an enemy of the whole world! On the next-to-last page of this newspaper, from the text of this oath which appears very much like a military one, we may learn that a brother-in-arms is obligated to keep military, national and state secrets. A national secret--this is something altogether new. We did not experience such a thing even under the leadership of the CPSU and the KGB. And since there are national secrets, then, naturally, we must "have a cautious attitude toward all persons of other faiths and toward foreigners." In short, it is a textbook of hate. And this at a time when the United States has put an end to racial discrimination, and when the last country of classic apartheid, the Republic of South Africa, has embarked upon the path of racial conciliation. In our country, along with the outward fascists, it is the communists who have taken the national idea into their arsenal. The formation of pro-fascist organizations began as early as the mid-80's, with the blessings of gorkom [city committee] and raykom [rayon committee] functionaries. The CPSU and KGB began to formulate groups which had the outward appearance of different directionality, and on which they could subsequently rely. When the appointed hour struck, the confusion of the true CPSU and KGB leaders was short-lived. All went to their pre-arranged "apartments"--the various parties, movements and fronts. They scattered, like some animal from a fantastic fairytale which breaks into many miniature copies of itself at the moment of danger. Perhaps only the main headquarters of this party and the levers of control are hidden from prying eyes. However, it is unlikely that this evokes any doubt among attentive observers regarding the existence of a well-managed system. The strong anti-democratic communist-nationalist newspapers have also been preserved: SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, PRAVDA, ZAVTRA and many other smaller ones. Very indicative was the emotional phrase of GKChP [State Committee for Extraordinary Situation] Oleg Shenin (former CPSU Central Committee member), upon the announcement of cessation of work at the last session of the court: "The USSR shall be restored!" As they say, they will not haggle over the price. And the effort to unite the former Soviet republics will be similar to the effort to bring all the powderkegs to one place--closer to the bonfire. Without troubling themselves over the reasons for the disintegration of the USSR, the national-communists, finding their scapegoats in the democrats, essentially never understood why the country fell apart. Yet A. Solzhenitsyn knew about this even 40 years ago, and not only knew, but wrote about it in the "Archipelago" [Arkhipelag GULAG] which, unfortunately, not that many of our fellow countrymen have read. (Otherwise, perhaps, the elections last December would have gone quite differently.) Aleksandr Isayevich wrote the following: "Rulers change. The archipelago remains. It remains because this state regime could not stand without it. Disbanding the Archipelago, it would itself cease to exist." (Arkhipelag GULAG, part 7). The prophecy has come to pass: First they liquidated the terrible archipelago, and the rest collapsed by itself. The foundation disappeared. No, it was not Yeltsin who tore down that old building. It could exist only on the foundation of fear and camps. So, for a normally thinking person, the consequences turned out to be quite predictable. The loud national-communist pseudo-patriots are calling Russia not to the future, but to the past--to the musty world of totalitarianism of reaction and terror. Yet Russia is a country just like Germany or France, except that it had fallen behind them by some 300 years due to the Mongol yoke and the extended feudalism which was associated with it, whose chains were broken only 130 years ago. It is easy to understand that mutual guarantee and communal land ownership were necessary to the feudal lords in order to keep people who had no rights under submission. When the bolsheviks came to power, they merely resurrected feudalism in a somewhat different form, replacing the landowners with numerous party furers, and the commune with kolkhozes. Today the national-communists assure us that this is the "Russian way." That means they must again turn the people into a mindless herd which they can drive to conquer world supremacy, which the Zhirinovskiy followers need so much. For this it is necessary to have enemies, both domestic and foreign. In order to find them, the musty national thesis is once again dragged out, remarkable in its primitiveness and maliciousness, as is, we might add, also the approach to the freedom of conscience--the intimate relationship of man with God, a sphere where considerable progress has been achieved in recent years. From the standpoint of the new specialists on freedom of conscience, the nationalists: "Freedom of activity of religious confessions, religious communities and individual cleriks will be provided only in that measure in which it strengthens the spiritual powers of Russians and those living in Russia." Yet in pre-revolutionary Russia, the national question as such did not exist on a background of religious inequality. Today, in connection with the weakening of religion over recent decades, the ethnic torch is being fanned. We will note that among the irreconcilable active Russian nationalists we may find also the half-breed Zhirinovskiy, and this leads us to think that the fanning of the nationalist flames is primarily a political matter, and only at the lowest level--the level of the lumpenized masses--does it take on a primitive nationalist coloration. Primitive because it would be laughable to speak of the purity of a nation where even the emperor and the nobility were not ethnic Russians. The lower strata of society were also not ethnically pure in a complete sense--the 300-year Tatar yoke stirred everything up. Those whom we today call Russians are a mixture of Eastern and Western Slavs, Mongols and Ugro-Finns, Khazars and persons of Scandinavian extraction, native residents of the North and Siberia and persons of Baltic extraction. There is a bit of everything here, and this, we must believe, is not a shortcoming, but rather an advantage. And so for this very reason, we should hardly seek out ethnic purity today among the citizens inhabiting Russia, even in the newspapers ZAVTRA and RUSSKIY PUT, and moreover prohibit mixed marriages and consider them a crime, as the RNE [Russian National Unity] program calls for. At the same time, it seems that one of the forms of racism--anti-Semitism--in many cases is still a definite means of achieving mercenary political goals. One such example is Zhirinovskiy. However, he is not the only one. Entire organizations such as the Russian National Council, the Slavic Council, the Union of Russian Communities, and the Front for National Salvation, not to mention the openly fascist organizations, are shamelessly exploiting Russian nationalism for their own political purposes. Those who are busy searching out domestic enemies can divide citizens into those who are more and less Russian. Therefore, today we should fight not for the rights of nations, but for human rights. This approach is broader and guarantees protection for all. The tendency of slipping into the protection of rights by national or linguistic principle will more often hinder than help. Nevertheless, the president and the MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] as represented by Kozyrev and its other leaders are ever more often following the lead of numerous nationalistic organizations in speaking of the rights of the Russian and the Russian-speaking population, and not about the protection of human rights, as is directly provided by the Constitution. The protection of Russian and Russian-speaking citizens must be the specific case of protection of human rights everywhere, wherever they are violated. The success of international and national rights protection organizations and their actions has always been associated with the emphasis of attention on general human rights. Ultimately, we must admit that the idea of statehood on an inter-ethnic basis is movement ahead, while the idea of national limitation is obvious backward movement, as proven by world experience. In conclusion, here is one more quote from the "code of honor" of the Russian National Unity, which emphasizes the extremely aggressive character of the principles of this organization, excluding it from the political sphere and relating it to the number of openly terrorist organizations: "Persecution of foreign and domestic enemies of the Russian Nation, no matter how far beyond the boundaries of Russia they may be found, is a matter of honor for the brother-in-arms." We may draw our own conclusions. But who must be the first to draw them? And where, ultimately, are our wonderful laws which are called upon to defend civic peace in the country? Freedom and democracy have come to us over difficult roads. Can it be that our imprudence, carelessness and irresponsibility will force them to leave our boundaries?
