Almost no light is thrown on them in the Russian press, but if something does appear, it is with great distortions. In addition, the reasons for the drop in production and the lowering of the standard of living in the republic are not explained. I am Belarusian; I periodically visit my homeland, and I see that life there is becoming worse and worse. But, after all, it was not long ago that Belarus was considered the most stable and reliable republic of the USSR, and after its dissolution the starting conditions of the new state were better than in neighboring former republics of the USSR. In 1991-1992 half of the former Union exported industrial and food commodities from Belarus that were bought at cheaper prices than in other regions. Our Lithuanian and Latvian neighbors proved to be smarter. With a premonition of the quick end of the ruble in their countries, the Balts bought up and exported everything they could. Indeed, the Belarusians themselves haphazardly took cattle to neighbors in the hope of earning money. The dashing Dzhigits-Caucasians also did not lag behind the Balts. Trains with conquering hucksters left from Moscow for Minsk, Brest, and Gomel. Belarus's proclamation of its independence in August 1991 did not change anything in its economic activity. Independence Day was established without taking the history of Belarusians into account. As if there had been no Belarusian People's Republic, which was proclaimed on 25 March 1918, no uprising of 1794, no uprising of Kastus Kalinovskiy in 1863, no Grunwald Battle, and other remarkable events. The coupon-ticket system of protecting the consumer proved to be weak in the face of intensifying corruption, wholesale accumulation of commodities at bases and warehouses, and given the practical absence of customs offices at the borders. Continuously increasing inflation in Russia caused an enormous shortage in the supply of money with the picture of the leader of the proletarian revolution. Discontent and strikes started with demands for payment of wages that were being withheld in various regions. On airliners to hot spots in immense Russia, Yeltsin and his companions-in-arms scattered money that had just come off the printing press. Russia accepted foreign handouts. The whole Western world jabbered about rendering Russia humanitarian assistance. Many former republics of the USSR hurriedly introduced national money. Intimidated by the April strikes of 1991, the Government of Belarus, fearing that it would not get its lot of all-Union money coupons, introduced its own monetary surrogate--the "hare," which was printed at the Perm Goznak factory. All-Union notes of the 1991 version, Russian notes of the 1992 version, and "hares" were simultaneously in monetary circulation in the republic. In addition, a distribution coupon system that protected the Belarusian consumer from his foreign colleague was operating. Food commodities were sold only for "hares," with presentation of a citizen's consumer card of the republic. Payment with coupons of the two systems was allowed for transportation, municipal services, and public catering. Such a system made it possible to avoid a sharp drop in production and to maintain relative stability in the republic for a short time. V.F. Kebich, chairman of the Council of Ministers of Belarus, declared at the end of 1992 that the republic was successfully overcoming the first stage of a smooth transition to market relations, that the slump in production had been stopped, and that a slow rise had begun. We will add that S.S. Shushkevich, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, had refused humanitarian assistance. The first sprouts of national independence began to appear at that time: Independent newspapers and journals began to appear in the Belarusian language, a number of schools began to teach in the mother tongue, discussions flared up in parliament about whether the Belarusian language should be the only official language, and the Belarusian Army began to be formed. Diplomatic relations were established with many states, comparatively good arrangements were made with the closest neighboring states, and it was possible to avoid serious disputes on territorial questions with Lithuania, with whom Belarusians lived for several centuries in one state--the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The much higher standard of living in Belarus by comparison, for example, with Russia can be judged by the psychology of the consumer of food. Thus, on 4 January 1993 in Gomel I ate a glass of sour cream, drank a cup of tea, and ate two small pieces of bread for 12 Russian rubles [R]. Such a meal would have been several times more expensive in Russia. The relative prosperity in Belarus in 1992 and the awakening of national dignity were achieved in a fierce struggle of the parliamentary opposition with the communist majority. In contrast to the unsound Russian shock programs of transition to the market--"400 days" and "500 days"--the Government of Belarus did not have official programs. At the same time, the opposition, in the form of the BNF [Belarusian People's Front], worked out its own program of privatization and transition to the market, calculated for 20-25 years and consisting of several stages. In addition, the transition to each successive stage was to be implemented only to the extent the previous one was realized. This would make it possible to avoid chaos and tension in the country. The communist parliament of Belarus rejected the proposals of the opposition. The opposition called for the introduction of our own currency--the taller--the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the republic, a restructuring of the Belarusian Army, and the development of real programs for the creation of a market economy. The opposition indicated that the inactivity of the government and parliament, the marking time in place, and the temporizing policy of Shushkevich, who was trying to reconcile two opposite political directions, will lead to a crash in the economy and loss of the republic's independence. At the beginning of 1993 the BNF and other democratic forces of the republic collected 442,000 signatures (according to the Constitution of Belarus only 350,000 are required) for a referendum on immediate parliamentary elections. The parliament boycotted the constitutional demands of the people. S.S. Shushkevich, taking a compromise position, passed a resolution in parliament on ahead-of-schedule elections (by one year) to the Supreme Soviet. These elections were supposed to have been held in March 1994. A big crack occurred in the economy of Belarus in the spring of 1993, when not enough cash "hares" were available and coaches with new batches of "hares" "got lost" in the labyrinth of the railroad lines of the Moscow rail junction. The government passed a resolution on the "temporary" circulation of the Russian ruble in the purchase of food commodities. Prices began to rise sharply in the republic. Products disappeared from the shelves. The "hare" began to be quoted lower than Russian money. The second blow against the economy of Belarus was delivered in July 1993, when Russia, in a unilateral procedure, conducted an operation to remove from circulation rubles with the image of a silhouette of the leader and the introduction into circulation of the 1993 version of bank notes of the Russian Bank. According to an existing agreement of Russia with states that were in the ruble zone, Russia was obligated to notify its colleagues within six months about the conduct of such an operation. The current notes of the national bank ("hares") remained in circulation. The financial system of the republic was broken. The economy of the state, which relied mainly on the Russian consumer, began to drop sharply. For two years the Government of Belarus practically did nothing to reorient the economy toward other countries, a Black Sea-Baltic economic union was not established, which the opposition had insisted on, and the question of the construction of a Ukraine-Belarus-Baltic oil collector for the reception of oil from the Near East was not resolved. Under pressure from the communist majority in parliament, S. Shushkevich began to yield small gains anyway: Activity of the Communist Party was authorized, Kebich's government concluded an agreement with Russia on extending the period of stationing Russian troops on the territory of Belarus for another eight years, and Belarus joined the collective security system. We will note that Belarus was compelled in the course of seven years to overcome by itself the consequences of the Chernobyl accident, when 70 percent of all radioactive emissions fell on its territory. One-fourth of the territory of the republic was exposed to radioactive contamination. The republic expends 20-25 percent of the national budget on elimination of the aftereffects of Chernobyl annually. At the same time, Belarus is the most militarized state in the world: In 1991, of each 1,000 persons, 43 were servicemen. Belarus did not sustain the repeated increase in prices in 1993 for Russian energy sources: There was not enough meat or other agricultural products, which were delivered to Russia at cheap prices. A number of enterprises came to a halt, and many began part-time operations. Lack of our own policy, and corruption in the upper echelons of power, which involved even the family of the prime minister, led to a crash of the financial and economic system of the republic. Inflation reached 50 percent a month, the exchange rate of the "hare" with respect to the ruble fell by a ratio of one to four. Kebich's government led the country on a road to nowhere. Striving to hold onto power a little longer, first two powerful ministries (internal affairs and state security) were sent into retirement, and afterwards also S.S. Shushkevich, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, and the activity of the social military union BZV [Belarusian Union of Officers] was banned. The elected speaker, M. Hryb, is striving for dictatorship, declaring the need to introduce the institution of the presidency, and postponing the elections of a new parliament until the end of the year. The inclination of Kebich's government to avoid responsibility for the inactivity and corruption is now being covered by joining a unified ruble zone with Russia. The responsibility is thereby transferred to the Government of Russia, and all material losses--to the Russian taxpayer. However, Russia's infusions into the existing economy of Belarus, considering the composition of the current government, will be squandered and embezzled.
