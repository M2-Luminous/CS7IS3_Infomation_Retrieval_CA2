Only through sustained investment in domestic research and development could the country ensure a steady, if not spectacular, growth in the industry and contribute towards Vision 2020, he said at the opening of the Telemex/Elec-Com/Electrical '94 Exhibition, here. Tajol Rosli said that given the rising demand for telecommunications services, joint-venture projects with multi-national manufacturers to produce or assemble telecommunications equipment locally were encouraged if Malaysia were to be a strong contender in the telecommunications equipment export area. In this respect, he noted that Telekom Malaysia was leading the way by investing RM670 million (about US$248 million) in its local network, RM160 million (about US$59.25 million) in its international network and RM1.7 billion (US$629 million) in the development of rural telecommunications. It is hoped that other telecommunications corporations would follow suit and work towards making Malaysia the regional centre for telecommunications activities, he added. The six-day exhibition on telecommunications system, office automation, electronics and electrical equipment, is staged by 54 exhibitors including those from China, Germany, Japan and Singapore.
