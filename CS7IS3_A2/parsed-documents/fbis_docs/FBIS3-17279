He said this was explained by the war that is continuing on the territory of Azerbaijan, by the crisis in the national economy, which is on the verge of bankruptcy, and also by actions of various political groupings, trying to destabilise the internal political situation. In order to pull the republic out of the crisis, Guliyev believes, it is necessary to take urgent measures in two directions: To urgently end the war in a way that would fully guarantee the national interests of Azerbaijan, and to get down to economic reforms. He stressed that the republic's leadership remained dedicated to the peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. Guliyev expressed the hope that the talks between the conflicting sides, currently under way in Moscow with the mediation of Russia and the CSCE, would yield concrete results. Guliyev also informed the parliament on the intention of the Azeri leadership to take resolute steps to strengthen law and order in Azerbaijan.
