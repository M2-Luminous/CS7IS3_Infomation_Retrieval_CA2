Mr Kravchuk wrapped up his sentence with the words "nuclear nightmare", shook his lacquered white helmet of hair and was gone. A telephone call from the German chancellor is one sign of the international attention being paid to Ukraine. Another is Mr Kravchuk's forthcoming visit to the US, which has been moved forward from March 16 to March 3. Ukraine is in the spotlight because various factors -- resurgent nationalism in Russia, last month's victory for Russian separatists in Ukraine's breakaway Crimean peninsular, and economic collapse -- have converged over the past few weeks. Many observers, from the CIA to Britain's Royal United Services Institute, a defence think- tank, have come to a worrying consensus that "a probable conflict" is looming between Ukraine and Russia. Mr Kravchuk, the first democratically elected president in the 1,000-year history of this nation of 53 million, makes clear that the effects of war would be widespread. "Remember that Ukraine still has 176 nuclear missiles and that Russia has three times as many," he told the Financial Times yesterday. "Let no one imagine that if a war were to explode between two such countries, he could be somehow immune to the nuclear poison that would be released." For Ukraine, keeping the peace with Russia is a particularly tricky balancing act. On one hand, as Mr Kravchuk repeats again and again, Ukraine is eager to have "good neighbourly relations with Russia", which is, after all, its single biggest trading partner. On the other hand, he is equally emphatic that Ukraine will not surrender a single inch of sovereignty. "I repeat again what I have from the very beginning: I will never take a single step in the direction of reducing Ukrainian independence. I will never change my position on this issue," Mr Kravchuk insisted in the cultivated Ukrainian which he pointedly speaks at all public appearances. This deep-seated commitment to independence, which is shared even by the Russified and Russian-speaking members of the Ukrainian elite, is why Mr Kravchuk rejects the steps neighbouring Belarus has taken to ensure friendly relations with Russia -- rejoining the rouble zone and re-entering Russia's foreign policy sphere of influence. Although Ukraine's inflation rate of 80 per cent in December gives some indication of how rocky Kiev's road to independence has been, Mr Kravchuk is adamant that the Belarussian route "is not a resolution of the problem. It is just a return of the old ways." Worryingly, economic chaos is prompting a similar desire for reintegration with Russia in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Walking the tightrope between friendly relations and reabsorption is a task to which the wily Mr Kravchuk is perhaps particularly well suited. Since 1991, when he underwent a conversion from communist ideologue to nationalist leader, Mr Kravchuk has won a certain notoriety as a man who has elevated vacillation into a political philosophy. Now the politician who prides himself on his ranking as a chess Grand Master believes he has discovered a move which will help Ukraine maintain its precarious geopolitical balance -- a strong relationship with the west. Mr Kravchuk's opening gambit came last month when he signed a historic tripartite agreement with the US and Russia, under which Ukraine pledged to give up all its nuclear weapons. He succeeded in an even more difficult move last week, when he persuaded Ukrainian parliamentarians many of whom greeted the initial agreement with cries of treason and calls for impeachment -- to remove obstacles to ratification of the accord. Mr Kravchuk and US diplomats in Kiev, who are effusive in their praise of the president's "remarkable political skills," say the nuclear issue is decided. They believe Ukraine will surrender all its nuclear weapons and Mr Kravchuk himself thinks it is just a matter of time -- perhaps later this month -- before the Ukrainian parliament joins the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. But the president has not orchestrated this newly amenable stance on the nuclear issue without expecting something in return. In addition to upwards of $1bn, which Ukraine is slated to receive from a company sponsored by the US government for the enriched uranium in its nuclear warheads, Mr Kravchuk is also counting on massive western assistance for the economic reforms he believes are crucial. "We have no alternative but the market," he says with the zeal of a convert. "Without economic reforms Ukraine as a state will not survive." Heart-warming words, but when asked to name a target monthly inflation rate for December 1994, Mr Kravchuk says he would be happy with 50 per cent. While this would be an improvement over December's figure, it is hardly likely to be what the International Monetary Fund team, due to arrive in Kiev on Sunday, has in mind. Just as he hopes to find a narrow middle road in his relations with Russia, Mr Kravchuk is searching for a path towards economic therapy without the shock. He says the Ukrainian National Bank cannot stop printing money because "that would stop the entire economy", yet he wants to stabilise the currency, the Ukrainian coupon, and speaks of introducing a harder national currency this year. To bridge the gap between the market reforms that he would like to get under way and the social stability he is intent on maintaining, he is counting on hefty aid from the west. "We will need a stabilising fund of between $3bn and $4bn to introduce our new currency," he says. Mr Roman Shpek, the young, urbane minister of the economy charged with conducting negotiations with the IMF, said Ukraine would like a "bridge loan" of $300m from the US, a $700m "systemic transformation loan" from the IMF, and $400m for sectoral reform from the World Bank. In future conversations with the German chancellor, and when he visits Washington, Mr Kravchuk will perhaps try to explain that a few billion dollars are a small price to pay if the alternative is war between Ukraine and Russia. But if he fails to persuade the west to give him money, as Russia's experience suggests he might, it is hard to imagine what sort of gambit Mr Kravchuk could devise next to preserve his country's independence.
