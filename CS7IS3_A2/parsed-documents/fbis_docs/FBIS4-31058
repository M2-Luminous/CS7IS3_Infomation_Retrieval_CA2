The document replies, point by point, and makes topical all the pieces of information contained in the Koenig-Jansson report. After taking note of the conclusions in the report that show appreciation for the favorable basis existing in Romania to further pluralist democracy and after acknowledging the toilsome efforts made by the rapporteurs, the document points out certain outdated pieces of information which have been overtaken by recent evolutions in Romanian society as well as certain inaccurate or distorted pieces of information stemming from the fact that the sources were sometimes one-sided. The memorandum also contains a number of additional clarifications, such as the fact that on 17 May Romania's president promulgated the law ratifying the European Convention on Human Rights and its additional protocols and that Romania acknowledges the exceptional importance of its adherence to the European Convention on the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Punishment or Treatment of Persons, a document which it signed on 4 November 1993. The competent commissions of parliament are examining two draft laws on ethnic minorities, one elaborated by the UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] and a second one elaborated by the parliamentary group of [non-Hungarian] ethnic minorities in the Chamber of Deputies. The education draft law currently being debated in parliament is based on the stipulations of the Constitution, which guarantee the right of persons belonging to ethnic minorities to study in their mother tongues and their right to education in their mother tongues. The aforementioned draft law, the memorandum assesses, surpasses the existing standards of the CE in the domain of education and training in the mother tongues of ethnic minorities. The document elaborated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also presents further information which has been made topical or supplemented, ensuring the CE that Romania's Government will make all necessary efforts to accomplish, as soon as possible, all the pledges made at the time of the country's adherence to that body. In view of the fact that the procedures used in the process of verifying are still being discussed by the [CE] Committee of Ministers, the document assesses that the current system of reports, in its existent form, is an outdated method of verification.
