FBIS4-7078 "dreas080_d_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 South Korea Special National Assembly Session Extended Special National Assembly Session Extended SK2604082094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0654 GMT 26 Apr 94 SK2604082094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- The ruling and opposition parties have agreed to extend the eight-day special session of the National Assembly by three days to deal with approval of the prime minister-designate and the parliamentary probe into the Sangmudae military scandal. Floor leaders of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the opposition Democratic Party (DP) agreed to extend the 167th special session during an eleventh-hour meeting arranged by speaker Yi Man-sop late Monday night. The two floor leaders also decided that the extended session will handle an opposition proposal calling on the cabinet to step down en masse. The ruling and opposition parties will convene the National Assembly legislation and judiciary committee to discuss investigation of the Sangmudae scam, in which the opposition alleges that funds for the construction of Sangmudae -- military facilities in the Southwestern provincial capital of Kwangju -- were illegally funneled to the ruling party. The prolonged session will concurrently deal with detailed plans for the Sangmudae probe and approval of the prime minister- designate, said speaker Yi after the meeting of floor leaders. The speaker also said that the motion calling for the cabinet's resignation would be handled after the prime minister-designate issue was settled. Speaking to reporters on the last-minute agreement to extend the special session, DP spokesman Pak Chi-won said, "the ruling and opposition parties agreed, during the session, that they will concurrently deal with the three motions on Sangmudae, approval of the prime minister-designate and the resignation of the entire cabinet." The special session is unlikely to go smoothly, however, due to the designation of Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister for unification affairs, as new prime minister. The parties also failed to agree on witnesses for the Sangmudae case and the tracking of checks to unearth the whereabouts of funds used in Sangmudae construction, experts say. The parties were able to agree that the Sangmudae case should be handled before the other motions.
