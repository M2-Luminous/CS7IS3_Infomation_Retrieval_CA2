Asked why he preferred to be in Brazil when there was a tense situation in Paraguay, Wasmosy said that what is happening in Paraguay is simply demagogic populism. The president said that all social groups have the right to petition for whatever they please, adding that he would never resign his post. Then, he ironically told journalists that they themselves could also ask for his resignation. "We are living in a democracy, and I would not like to intervene in this game of demagogic populism. I am here today because these people have fulfilled something they promised me they would do. In October they will again do something I requested, which will benefit us all and will reduce production costs," Wasmosy said in justifying his presence at the ceremony to inaugurate the interconnection between the Tiete and Parana Rivers in Sao Paulo State. Asked about Cadelpa's [Paraguayan Cotton Chamber] position, Wasmosy said we should not attack the association excessively because it has always cooperated with the government and peasants. The president then outlined Cadelpa's efforts in favor of a successful cotton harvest year and used almost the same words used by Cadelpa to explain the meaning of the documents seized and aired by the CBII [Congressional Investigating Committee on Illegal Activities].
