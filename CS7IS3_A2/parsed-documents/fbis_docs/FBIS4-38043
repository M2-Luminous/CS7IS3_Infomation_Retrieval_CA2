The Israeli Government and the Jewish settlement policy are fully responsible for this ugly crime, as well as all previous and subsequent crimes, against the Arabs. This is because the Israeli Government allows settlers to carry, and trains them on the use of arms under security pretexts. It also hoards them in communities inside the occupied Arab territories at the expense of the Arabs and their dignity, and fills them with hatred and rancor against the Arabs so that the settlers will support the Israeli Army in terrorizing the Palestinians and force them to leave their homes and lands. TISHRIN adds: The continued occupation of the Arab territories and the continued presence of settlers in these territories will keep the situation in the region explosive. The crimes of settlers and the Israeli Army are the product of a single policy that is based on murder, terrorism, and expansion.
