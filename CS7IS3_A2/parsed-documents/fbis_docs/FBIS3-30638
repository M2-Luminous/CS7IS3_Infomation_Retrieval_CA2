Their session with the president lasted nearly an hour and a half. According to the president's advisor on foreign political affairs, Dr. Zhelev set forth the principled Bulgarian position on the Yugo-crisis, stressing that right from the outset Bulgaria expressly stated its refusal to take advantage in any way whatsoever of the difficulties experienced by disintegrating Yugoslavia and to look for benefits other than guarantees of its own national security. "We are convinced that recognizing the four former Yugoslav republics was a move which strengthens the situation in the region. By its act of recognition, Bulgaria reaffirmed the right to independent and sovereign existence, as well as those countries' right to arrange and choose a form of government which suits them best," the presidential advisor said, briefing the press on Dr. Zhelev's meeting with the two mediators. Dr. Zhelev called attention to the need of the European Union, once it failed to take vigorous action and adopt a categorical position and thus halt the escalation of the conflict into open warfare, should learn a lesson and apply it in its present actions and encourage all those factors which could contribute to the security guarantees of the neighbouring countries. Earlier in the day, Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg had nearly an hour's long talk with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, which Lord Owen described as "a very full discussion." "The European Union's plan of action has the full support of the government here, which is good to hear," Lord Owen noted. The chief Bulgarian diplomat described as "inaccurate" a REUTER report yesterday, which quoted a senior government official as saying that "Bulgaria would support a unified Bosnia" and "is against the model of ethnically clean formations which we see as unacceptable for the situation in the Balkans." Answering reporters' questions after his session with Mr. Daskalov, Lord Owen said that "the experience of this country of being able to settle disputes between minorities and different religions and different ethnic communities must be the model," he said. "Muslims have been part of Europe's history all throughout history.... There is no objection in principle whatever from the European Union, if that is the wish of the people, for there to be a Muslim republic out of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This has never been a problem to us," the mediator said. He also mentioned the danger of the Bosnian conflict spreading to Sandjak, Kosovo, Albania and Macedonia. "Containment of the fighting has been an important part (of the crisis management effort)," Lord Owen said, stressing the importance of the support which can come from the countries in the region that neighbour on the former Yugoslavia. "I believe that the role of Bulgaria is part of the regional response," he went on to say. "You are paying a very heavy price for sanctions. Sadly, the rest of the world has not come up with adequate compensation for that (the embargo losses). It is making your task of moving towards a market economy and deepening your commitment to democracy much harder," Lord Owen said.
