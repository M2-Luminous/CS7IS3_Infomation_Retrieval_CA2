He added in an exclusive interview with AL-WATAN: Our main objective is to entrench the concept of conscription, which has become a tangible reality. He further said that these endeavors are aimed at making use of the conscripts' skills and transferring these conscripts to the units best suited to their qualifications and expertise. In reply to a question, Col. Sumayt denied the existence of favoritism or distinction between conscripts, and indicated that rumors in this respect are untrue and unrealistic. Col. Sumayt also touched on the issue of sanctions and said: "The Conscription Law has given many rights to the conscript, and has provided for some sanctions ranging from added time to fines and imprisonment." He added: "If the person subject to military duty fails to present himself, six months will be added to the period of his conscription. The additional period would be reduced to two months if the person joined the army within 15 days after the deadline. The person would be referred to a court to stand trial in accordance with Article 29 of the law, which provides for jail sentences or fines if he fails to present himself for a second time." In conclusion, Col. Sumayt said: "If the person subject to military duty fails to present himself after the legal age of conscription, which is 30 years, he will be referred to a court to stand trial in accordance with the provisions of Article 30. He could then receive a maximum jail sentence of three years or be asked to pay a maximum fine of 1,500 Kuwaiti dinars."
