The results showed that Na,K-ATPase activity in cerebral tissue was significantly reduced (P < 0.01) after 60 min ischemia and 80 min reperfusion of the brain. The animals were in comatous and hypoactive state. Convulsion and seizures occurred occasionally. After treatment with 101.3 kPa or 253.25 kPa pure oxygen, the activity of Na,K-ATPase increased to approximately the normal value (no significant difference between 101.3 and 253.25 kPa). The results indicated that the mechanism of HBO in treating cerebral edema in gerbils might be closely related to the recovery of Na,K-ATPase activity in cerebral tissues.
