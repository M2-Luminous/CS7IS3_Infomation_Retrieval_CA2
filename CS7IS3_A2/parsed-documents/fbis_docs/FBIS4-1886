This was discussed on Sunday [3 April] between a visiting delegation of the China National Chemical Engineering Group Corporation and the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation. The Chinese visitors were impressed with the quality of industrial grade paper made from green jute and expressed their optimism about the possibility of setting up the paper mill and eventual export of green jute based pulp from Bangladesh to China. At present, Bangladesh has tried hard to diversify the use of its rich jute resources as the prices of raw jute are too low in the world market and the country's jute industry has been shrinking drastically over the past decade. Recently, local paper makers have successfully produced quality paper from green jute while the government has urged local and overseas investors to pour their money into the jute sector which has been suffering huge losses.
