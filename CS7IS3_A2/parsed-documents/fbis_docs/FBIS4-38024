During the meeting, they discussed bilateral ties, as well as the current situation and the rebels' noncompliance with the cease-fire. The member of the Presidential Council explained the efforts that were made and the concessions that were offered in order to avoid igniting the fire of sedition and how the rebels insisted on sparking it and on departing from legitimacy. He asserted that the state does not want war and loves peace. However, he added: We are keen on maintaining our unity and the independence and sovereignty of our country and the continuation of shura and democracy and respecting the people's will, represented in the 27 April 1993 elections. For his part, the British ambassador expressed satisfaction over the Yemeni government's cooperation with Lakhdar Brahimi, the envoy of the UN secretary general. He said that Britain supports democracy in Yemen and is anxiously awaiting the report that will be presented by the international envoy. Afterward, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, member of the Presidential Council, received Arthur Hughes, the U.S. ambassador in Sanaa. They discussed bilateral ties and ways of enhancing them. The brother member of the Presidential Council asserted that the state had complied with the cease-fire but that the rebels violated it. He added: We are waiting for the U.S. Government to explain its position toward this. He pointed out that the Yemeni Republic appreciates the concern of the brothers and friends not to see more Yemeni bloodshed, noting that the war is not an end in itself and that it will leave negative effects. He said all countries that care about Yemen should seek to end the war by not extending any moral or material support to the secessionist rebels and ensuring our Yemeni people's rights as noted in the UN Charter, primarily freedom, democracy, justice, and independence. For his part, the U.S. ambassador expressed his satisfaction with the recent cease-fire decision issued by the state, saying he deems this a step toward a complete cease-fire. He said the United States had earlier asserted that it does not approve of recognizing secession and that it seeks dialogue. He expressed his belief that new efforts for reconciliation could be made by Lakhdar Brahimi in a new visit to the region.
