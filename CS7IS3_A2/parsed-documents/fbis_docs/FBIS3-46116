This year we should realistically safeguard political stability as the task of prime importance, acted in close connection with the key aspect of correctly handling the internal contradictions of the people, strive to deeply and meticulously carry out this work, and try by all possible means to maintain political stability in the whole province. Party committees and governments as well as public security, procuratorial and judicial departments at all levels should properly handle the relations of stability, reform, and development, and maintain political stability during the whole course of reform. When we issue one reform measure, we should give consideration to the possible influence that may cause to political stability, purposefully adopt preventive measures, and strive to reduce social turbulence. It is necessary to realistically strengthen ideological and political work, strive to dissolve social contradictions, be good at hearing the voice of the masses and using the democratic, persuasive, and educational methods to improve the ideological feelings of the people. All localities should act in line with the demand of the provincial party committee, pay great attention to the living of workers of enterprises with difficulties, actively raise funds to pay the wages of workers left in arrears, and help them solve practical difficulties. Party and government leaders and relevant departments at all levels should pay full attention to the hot issues which the masses show strong reactions, adopt effective measures and solve them one by one in an effort to calm the feelings of the masses and guarantee social stability. Xie Yong pointed out: To further successfully carry out the public security comprehensive management work under the new situation, this year all localities should conscientiously implement the central stipulations on implementing the leadership responsibility system in comprehensive management of public security, further implement the principle that those who takes charge of the work should assume full responsibility and the system of negating everything if one fails to do a good job in public security work, help the party and government leaders at all levels grasp the comprehensive improvement of public security. Xie Yong emphatically pointed out: This year we should regard cracking major cases, dealing blows to criminal cliques, and capturing escaped criminals as the priorities, strengthen routine work, organize special struggle in a timely manner, resolutely check the upward trend of major cases, such as murder, robbery, rape, major theft, and serious crimes on violence. To do a good job in dealing strict blows to criminals, we must conscientiously solve the problem of failing to strictly enforce law and further raise the quality of dealing blows and social effect. It is necessary to conscientiously consolidate cultural places, strengthen control over the criminal trend and fugitive criminals in society, actively conduct activity on running villages in line with law, and implement democratic management.
