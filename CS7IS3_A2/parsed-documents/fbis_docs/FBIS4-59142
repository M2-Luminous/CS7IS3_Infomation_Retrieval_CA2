"We have decided that we cannot work under pernicious conditions and make this conference a success," Sulayman Shafiq, a member of staff at the Ibn-Khuldun Centre organising the conference, told AL-AHRAM WEEKLY. The conference, scheduled to take place between 12-14 May, first came under fire from the renowned political analyst and writer Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal for including on its agenda a discussion of the problems of Copts in Egypt. Other intellectuals followed suit, and Pope Shanudah III of the Coptic Orthodox Church issued a statement in which he rejected the designation of Copts as a minority and insisted that they were part and parcel of the Egyptian nation. "We have striven to hold this conference, which deals specifically with the Middle East and the Arab world, in Egypt in order to acknowledge its regional role and to challenge any misconceptions about domestic security," Shafiq said. But, he added, organisers had to reconsider and decided to move the conference to "another country where freedom of expression does not come under severe attack". Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi, head of the Shura [Consultative] Council, was quoted on Monday as saying the state opposed the convening of the conference on Egyptian soil because Copts and Muslims make up one nation, share the same history and coexist. But Shafiq denied that the organisers were aware of any government objection. "We have not been informed of any governmental opposition to holding the conference," Shafiq said. Shafiq disclosed that even before the storm was triggered the organisers had considered a number of alternative host-countries. Cyprus was a strong option and Lebanon also offered to play host. "We chose Egypt because we wanted to challenge the image that is being projected of Egypt as an unsafe country," he said. "But it seems that intellectual terrorism is much more powerful than armed terrorism." State Councellor Sulayman Qiladah thinks the decision to move the conference reflects the success of Egyptian public opinion in rejecting a gathering that includes on its agenda the possibility of international interference in the region under the guise of protecting minority rights. "This is a major achievement of the unified stand made by all Egyptians who refused to discuss a topic that should only be discussed within an Egyptian framework," he said. "The good thing about this conference is that it showed how strong our national unity could be at times of crisis." Shafiq said the Egyptian delegation to the conference will be made up of 20 prominent personalities, including Dr Mahmud Hafiq, head of the Shura Council's services committee, Prof. Mahmud al-Juhari, president of Hilwan University, Jihad 'Udah a political analyst, and seven Coptic figures led by Dr Wasim al-Sisi. A discussion of Coptic "problems" is still on the agenda but Shafiq was not sure whether it would actually take place. Fahmi Huwaydi, a writer on Islamic issues who turned down an invitation to attend the conference, said that shifting the conference from Cairo to Cyprus will not solve the complicated problems of Middle Eastern minorities. "The conference remains a defence of the minorities' cause more than a serious and true attempt to put an end to their grievances and problems," he said. "The situation of the minorities is far too complicated to be discussed through such a modest institution as the Ibn-Khuldun Centre." Another writer on Islamic affairs, president of al-Zaqaziq University Dr Muhammad 'Imarah, expressed dissatisfaction with the removal of the conference from Egyptian territory. He said that certain lines should not be crossed or even approached by research centres and this conference seems to have gone far beyond these lines. It was time, he said, that it was stopped. "Now it is not, as some would claim, the freedom of expression and thought we should protect; it is a whole nation that should be protected, before they divide it into minorities and majorities and produce a climate ripe for sectarian strife," 'Imarah said. Huwaydi pointed out that the topic was first studied in the '70s by the Arabic Studies Centre of which Sa'd al-Din Ibrahim, the chairman of the Ibn-Khuldun Centre, was also a member. "This centre had its effective presence in the Arab world at the time and had no connections with any foreign associations--which could cast doubts on the credibility of any institution." A side-result of the controversy was the resignation of Jamal Badawi, editor-in-chief of the newspaper AL-WAFD, after Wafd Party Chairman Fu'ad Saraj-al-Din gave last minute orders to lift Haykal's article lambasting the conference. Shadin Shihab reports, however, that Badawi appears ready to withdraw his resignation. "The problem between Badawi and Fu'ad Pasha has been resolved and I am very optimistic that Badawi will resume the functions of his post very soon," Yasin Saraj-al-Din, leading Wafd member and brother to the party leader, told AL-AHRAM WEEKLY. He said that if Badawi contributed his weekly article for publication, "then we must conclude that the problem has dissolved into thin air". Badawi's name continues to appear on the newspaper's masthead despite the reported resignation. Yasin Saraj-al-Din explained that Badawi had given him, and not Fu'ad Saraj-al-Din, his letter of resignation which was to be passed on to the party leader. "I am the closest person to both of them and Badawi found it too embarrassing because of his great respect for the Pasha," Saraj-al-Din said. "I never gave the letter to the Pasha. It is still in my pocket. I decided to resolve the dispute and not to widen it further." Badawi was not available for comment.
