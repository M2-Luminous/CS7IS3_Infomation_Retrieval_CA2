A prominent Russian expert, who is in charge for the problems of the Russian-Ukrainian relations, that's why he preferred to stay anonymous, expressed this opinion in his interview with INTERFAX. In his words, "those Ukrainian politicians who strive "to pull out" Russia out of Crimea and "to possess" the entire Black Sea Fleet demonstrate the same play with fire. Unfortunately, separate officials in Kiev also voice identical statements," he noted. As the expert said, "Russia does not raise the issue on Crimea's return at the official level" "As one can say, what has been done, has been done. In 1954 during the celebration of the 300th anniversary of Ukraine's and Russia's re-unification Nikita Khrushchev handed over Crimea to Ukraine with a stroke of the pen. Now it does not matter much that nobody asked the Crimeans about this. This wide gesture of the communist leader, who is often and, probably, justly called a precursor of one more reformatory, Mikhail Gorbachev, has not changed anything in the life of the peninsula or his citizens. The USSR has not only seemed, but it was a monolith in which the borders between its republics were of pure nominal and administrative nature," he pointed out. The expert believes that after the collapse of the USSR "Yeltsin's team" had no choice but to recognize the territorial integrity of Ukraine within the former Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. "As if we have lacked only a conflict between Russia and Ukraine,--he noted.--Meanwhile, the time places everything to the proper place. If the emissaries from Kiev and Lvov had not tried to dictate their provisions to the Crimeans, had not implemented an artificial Ukrainization, and agreed to the introduction of the institute of dual citizenship then the situation in the Russian- speaking and pro-Russian Crimea could have remained more or less calm. However, Kiev has made an opposite decision and even has not let the democratically elected Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov to the negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministers Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy who were held in Sevastopol, that is in Crimea." According to the expert, such actions are able "to blow up" not only Crimea but to undermine Ukraine's territorial integrity. "It is not necessary to be a prophet in order to forecast the results of the possible referendum on Crimea's withdrawal from Ukraine and its unification with the Russian Federation. One can ban a referendum and recognize it non-constitutional. However, one should not forget that even the principles of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe which has fixed the unchangeability of the post-war borders, admits that such a referendum is quite possible under certain provisions. And where is the guarantee that the Donetsk basin and Ukraine's whole Left Bank region would not follow Crimea? It is difficult to predict any answer under the forthcoming economic collapse of the Ukrainian economy," stressed the expert. He expressed his supposition that "these premises make Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk force postponement of the presidential elections scheduled for 26 June." "It's interesting to note that the most active critics representing Ukrainian nationalists support Kravchuk's position. Apparently they understand what they do in this case," he made a conclusion.
