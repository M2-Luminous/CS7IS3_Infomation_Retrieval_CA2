A senior official of the Russian Space Agency who had taken part in the talks told Interfax that "the two sides agreed to use the draft compiled by Russian experts as the basis for further negotiations." A protocol was signed, listing the issues on which full agreement had been reached and those on which talks had to continue. In particular, no agreement has been reached on which country's legislation should apply in the station and which country's law enforcement agencies will police there and the town of Leninsk. The official emphasized that the Kazakh negotiators needed more time to analyze the Russian offer of an amount to be paid for use of the launching pads. He did not rule out the possibility that the talks would be continued in Almaty, the Kazakh capital. Meanwhile, officials in the Kazakh embassy told Interfax that the status of Baykonur was likely to be discussed when the presidents of the two countries met in Moscow on February 11 and 12. Nursultan Nazarbayev will have a stopover in Moscow on his way to the U.S.
