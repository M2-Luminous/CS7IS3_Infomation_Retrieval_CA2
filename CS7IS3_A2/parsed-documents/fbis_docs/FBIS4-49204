Spokesman of the General Office of the NPC Standing Committee Shen Zhangrong said this morning that China's Copyright Law has played a "significant role" in protecting copyrights and promoting the development of China's cultural and scientific causes since it was put into effect on June 1, 1991. "However, piracy of books, audio and video tapes, and computer software has become quite rampant in recent years, in illegal attempts to reap huge profits," Shen said. This has infringed upon the rights of the authors and destroyed the normal order of the socialist cultural market and economic activities. "It has also affected foreign trade of the country and its cultural and scientific exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries," said the spokesman, adding that perpetrators of this kind of activity should be severely punished. During the eight-day session, the legislators will also deliberate over nine other draft laws and regulations. They are the draft law on management of urban real estate, draft supplementary provisions to regulations governing offenses against public order, draft amendments to the regulations on active service and ranks of military officers of the People's Liberation Army, the draft law on judges and the draft law on prosecutors. The legislators will also hear a report on the construction of the Three-Gorges Dam project.
