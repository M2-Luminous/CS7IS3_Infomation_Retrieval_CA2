For some time, the Iraqi regime has been interfering in Yemen's internal affairs, particularly after the successful democratic experiment in Yemen. With this experiment, the Yemeni people in both parts of the country opted for unity and coexistence under a single regime to prevent the country from sliding into the cycle of conflicts and crises. By depending on the people's will and by going back to the people, Yemeni unity was achieved. Naturally, the Baghdad regime does not feel comfortable about the success of any experiment that may smell of democracy and in which the peoples have a decisive say. Thus, the Baghdad regime decided to inflame the Yemeni crisis and steadily sought to undermine Yemeni unity, hoping to gain a foothold there by creating a fragile pro-Iraqi regime in Yemen that would follow in its footsteps and accept whatever Iraqi dictator Saddam Husayn imposed on it. According to Iraqi opposition sources, the Yemeni Socialist Party has expressed concern with the sabotaging role played by the Baghdad regime in the Yemeni crisis. Instead of lending a helping hand to bring the views of the two conflicting parties in Yemen closer, the Iraqi regime is trying hard to deepen their differences by backing one party against the other. Reports indicate that 12 Iraqi pilots have arrived in Sanaa to train and support the northerners' troops. The same reports indicate that during the past two months the Iraqi Embassy in Sanaa was the scene of meetings between military commanders who support Yemeni president 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the Iraqi military attache in Sanaa. To further increase tensions in Yemen, some members of the pro-Baghdad Yemeni Ba'th Party kidnapped a number of foreigners some time ago and held them with some of the tribes affiliated with the party. Furthermore, the Baghdad intelligence service in Yemen in the past few years has assassinated several Yemeni political and scientific figures. [passage omitted]
