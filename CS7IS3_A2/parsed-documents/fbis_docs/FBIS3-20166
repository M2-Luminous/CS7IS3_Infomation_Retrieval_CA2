This happened when Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas participated in the final session of the EU foreign minsters' meeting in Ioannina in northern Greece. "I also warned that if they cannot reach agreement before Easter this could do serious damage to our efforts to win support for the European idea among the general public in Sweden," af Ugglas told DAGENS NYHETER. The same message was delivered jointly by the four foreign ministers from Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria in individual conversations with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana. "There was no real drama; we sat Hurd and Solana in the corner of a sofa and said that we were all concerned about what is happening," Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal told DAGENS NYHETER. "Britain will have to carry a heavy responsibility if the candidate countries' membership is pushed forward in time," Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto told Finnish journalists. But the most strident phrases from the four candidate countries came from Margaretha af Ugglas who is, however, now hopeful about a solution. "But if it proves possible to reach agreement on Tuesday or Wednesday, we can move forward with the preparations for the referendums as we have planned. And then the uncertainty of the past month will largely be a closed episode. ``Everything else is an impossibility, seen from our viewpoint. If the matter cannot be resolved now, but is put off instead, this will have an effect on all our planning and could in the final analysis also lead to our having to change the date of the referendum,'' the foreign minister said. "But my impression is that, it will be possible to finally resolve this matter on Tuesday," Margaretha af Ugglas said. "The warnings from the candidate countries made a strong impression on me," Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes told DAGENS NYHETER. "It is definitely the case that this matter has led to a situation in which the European Union is beginning to lose credibility," Claes added. "I have just had a meeting with the foreign ministers of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria and they are becoming more concerned and dismayed the longer the time that passes without an agreement. This is yet another aspect that we have to think about," Douglas Hurd said in an interview with BBC Radio.
