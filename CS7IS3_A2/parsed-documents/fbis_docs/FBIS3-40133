Source information is given in parentheses at the end of each item or is provided in the body of the item. HONG KONG INVESTMENT IN THE PRC: FEATURE: More Mainland Companies Prepare To List in Hong Kong At a seminar in Wuhan, representatives of the second batch of mainland companies to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and officials of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) met to discuss listing procedures, according to an article by Christine Chan on page 1 of the 27 January edition of the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST). Among those listing is the Wuhan-based steel giant Wuhan Iron and Steel (Wugang), which is expected to be the largest listing of a Chinese company thus far, eclipsing Maanshan Iron and Steel's HK$3.93 billion (Hong Kong dollars) listing in November 1993. Maanshan's chairman, Hang Yongyi, was invited to speak at the conference to pass on his experience of listing in Hong Kong. Of those expected to list, four are power supply companies: Huaneng International Power Development, Huaneng Electricity (Shandong), Datang Power Plant, and Shandong Power Plant. In addition, Harbin Power Plant Equipment and Northeast Electric Transmission and Transformation Equipment make power plant equipment, cables, and transformers for the electricity supply industry. Airline and transportation companies are also represented by China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines, as is the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway, which is expected to raise up to HK$400 million. In a series of articles on pages one and two of the 28 January edition of the BUSINESS POST, Barry Porter and Foo Choy Peng examine several issues arising from the increasing numbers of mainland companies seeking to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange through either direct or indirect means. Barry Porter quotes the chairman of the Hong Stock Exchange, Charles Lee, saying that nearly all of the 22 companies listed would float shares in Hong Kong, although some could obtain secondary listings in other exchanges, notably New York. Mr. Lee, who attended the Wuhan seminar, said that the first of the new batch of PRC firms to list in the territory could be ready to make public offerings by June 1994. However, Mr. Lee also said that this may be "wishful thinking." Foo Choy Peng cites a CSRC official who draws attention to several drawbacks encountered by mainland firms who had decided to obtain access to the Hong Kong stock market by the acquisition of Hong Kong-listed shell companies. Mr. Nie Qingping said that the CSRC was unable to supervise such companies effectively, which could lead to problems with investor protection. Mr. Nie added that such "back-door" listings also raised the possibility of state-owned assets flowing out of the country. Mr. Nie said that fund-raising through direct listings was the preferred method, with Hong Kong as the major venue for such exercises. In another article on page one of the same issue, Foo cites Henry Tsang, a director of investment banking with Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, who says that a shortage of market professionals could affect Hong Kong's ability to meet the requirements of those Chinese companies seeking to list in Hong Kong. According to Mr. Tsang, lawyers, bankers, and accountants in the territory were all operating at "full capacity." "We just don't know how much this market is able to cope in terms of more and more transactions." Mr. Tsang said that it took a lot of effort from many people to deal with just six public offering by mainland companies last year. "It is important to note that Hong Kong investors are probably not enough to satisfy all China's requirements," Mr. Tsang said, adding that it would not be easy for the Hong Kong market to absorb an issue substantially larger than $100 million Listing of Wuhan Steel Firm To Fund Expansion Plans Wuhan Iron and Steel (Wugang) plans a major expansion using the proceeds expected from its launch on international securities markets. The company aims to produce up to 11 million tonnes of steel in 1994. Sales are expected to hit 17.6 billion yuan, with pre-tax profits of 3.45 billion yuan and foreign exchange earnings of $120 million. The company's expansion plans are expected to require capital expenditure of 22.5 billion yuan and $850 million in foreign exchange. Wugang plans to build a third steel mill, a cold- rolled steel plant, and a 400-megawatt power plant.

The computer distributor and manufacturer is raising $29 million by issuing 168.75 million shares. Trading will begin on 14 February. According to company Chairman Liu Chuanzhi, the cash raised will be used to develop and market new products and for additional working capital. Legend has three design centers in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and San Jose, California, and has an annual production capacity of 1.68 million motherboards. The company also distributes personal computers in mainland China through a network of 22 distributors. (Beijing CHINA DAILY in English 26 Jan 94 p 2) Mainland Chemical Firm Plans Hong Kong Listing Yizheng Chemical Fibre Company, the world's fourth largest manufacturer of polyester and one of the biggest chemical companies in China, plans to issue H shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in March. According to the Jiangsu-based company's agenda, the H shares will be issued in mid-March and listed by the end of that month. Shares for domestic investors, A shares, will be listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in May. The company is presently engaged in a $421 million investment program which will raise the company's annual production capacity to 1 million tonnes by 1995. Last year, the firm produced 545,000 tonnes of polyester with total sales of 4.94 billion yuan, profits of 1.05 billion yuan, and export earnings of $37.2 million. (Beijing CHINA DAILY (BUSINESS WEEKLY) in English 30 Jan 94 p 1) Guangzhou Investment Placement To Raise HK$1 Billion Guangzhou Investment is raising HK$1.03 billion in a share placement to expand its interests in cement manufacturing in Guangdong. The placement is being arranged by Peregrine Brokerage and will dilute Yue Xiu Enterprises' controlling stake from 64 percent to 53 percent. Merchant bankers expect this to be the first of many issues in the territory to Hong Kong and international investors this year. Using the proceeds of the placement, the company plans to take interests in three cement operations in Guangdong: 51 percent of Zhujiang Cement Plant, which has an annual production capacity of 1.8 million tonnes; 50 percent of the Huadu Cement Plant in Huada City, which will have an annual capacity of 400,000 tonnes on completion in 1995; and 51 percent of Xinqing Cement Plant, which had an annual capacity of 170,00 tonnes in 1993. The placement is the first major issue of its kind by the mainland group since its listing as the property arm of Yue Xiu in December 1992.

In an article on page 7 of the SUNDAY MORNING POST (SUNDAY MONEY) on 30 January, Kennis Chu examines the renewed influence of investors from mainland China in the Hong Kong property market. According to Chu, Chinese investment has risen noticeably since November 1993, when credit controls imposed in July of last year by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji to cool inflation were relaxed. Property prices have reached record highs, particularly for Grade-A office space and luxury apartments. The article states that Chinese participation in the real estate market can be divided into three types: central government enterprises, such as CITIC and China Merchants Holdings; companies owned by provincial governments like Guangdong Investment and Sichuan's Jianling (HK); and city and village-owned companies, such as Foshan's China Weal, Huiyang, and Pripenic. In a front-page article in the 2 February issue of the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST), Barry Porter cites a report by real estate consultant First Pacific Davies which puts the volume of recorded transactions in January at HK$17.32 billion and estimates an additional $5 billion in private transactions. The article points out that this exceeds the previous monthly record of HK$12 billion set in May 1993, a month in which there was an "unprecedented surge in buying by mainland corporations," a spree which Porter asserts was "partly responsible" for Zhu Rongji's July austerity program. The article goes on to state that mainland corporations are buying Hong Kong property as a hedge against a further devaluation of the yuan. However, most of the major publicly recorded purchases have been by completed by listed Hong Kong-based firms, such as Hong Kong China, controlled by the Lippo group, which paid HK$2.2 billion for an apartment block in the Mid Levels area; Lai Sun Group, which bought a Tsimshatsui office building for HK$1.4 billion; and Great Eagle, which paid HK$2 billion for the Ramada Renaissance Hotel, also in Tsimshatsui. The SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST) on 29 January reports on page one that, in an effort to reduce its exposure to the residential property market, the territory's leading lender has further tightened its policies on the provision of mortgages for "luxury" apartments costing more than HK$5 million. Hongkong Bank announced that from 29 January, the mortgage lending ratio for properties worth $5 million or above would be reduced to 50 percent from 60 percent. The ratio for those priced below $5 million remains at 70 percent. However, a report carried by the Hong Kong-based PRC-affiliated news agency ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese at 0912 GMT on 30 January states that the Bank of China (BOC) Group had no intention of following Hongkong Bank for the moment. The report said that the BOC would closely watch the market's reaction and developments in the field. An official with the BOC Group said that they would not require their 13 subsidiary banks to follow the same rules in arranging mortgages; instead, the banks would be allowed to decide their own policy according to their particular financial resources. Mainland Tourists To Supplant Taiwanese in 1994 According to estimates from the Hong Kong Travel Association and the China Travel Service, mainland China is expected to replace Taiwan as the source of the greatest number of visitors to Hong Kong. During the first 11 months of last year, the number of mainland tourists visiting Hong Kong rose to 1.58 million, just behind arrivals from Taiwan. Last year, Hong Kong attracted 9 million visitors, a 13-percent increase on two years ago. Booming tourist arrivals have given Hong Kong's hotels an average occupancy rate of 85 percent. (Beijing CHINA DAILY in English 24 Jan 94 p 3) Bank of China Chief on Operations in Hong Kong Mr. Wang Qiren, chairman of the board of directors of the Bank of China, has said that in transforming specialized banks in the mainland into commercial ones, the mainland should refer to experiences in bank management overseas, especially that of Hong Kong and Macao. Mr. Wang said that since the implementation of reform and opening to the outside world, financial circles in the mainland have set up increasingly close ties with their counterparts in Hong Kong. At present, 13 Hong Kong-based banks have set up 35 branches, 24 representative offices, and six jointly funded financial institutions in mainland China, and mainland banks, including the Bank of China and the People's Construction Bank of China, have also set up branches in the territory. Mr. Wang said that the Bank of China would develop its business in the territory in an active and steady way. (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in English 1020 GMT 3 Feb 94) CITIC Pacific Takes 50 Percent of Lantau Development Hong Kong Resorts International (HKR) is selling half of its wholly owned subsidiary Hong Kong Resort Company to CITIC Pacific, a subsidiary of the Beijing-controlled China International Trust and Investment Company, for HK$3.4 billion. Hong Kong Resort's main asset is its Discovery Bay residential development on Lantau island, which has a population of 9,500. HKR Managing Director Payson Cha Mou-sing has been lobbying the Hong Kong Government to build a tunnel to link Discovery Bay with the North Lantau Expressway, which is part of the new airport project. At present, Discovery Bay is only accessible by ferry, but if linked to Kowloon by road, land values on Lantau Island would be likely to appreciate. (Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST) in English 8 Feb 94 p 1) OTHER ISSUES: Record Volume of Air Cargo in 1993 Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd. (HACTL) handled a record 1.1 million tonnes of air freight in 1993. Final year-end figures show that HACTL passed the 1-million-tonne mark for the first time in November. December saw a further 99,134 tonnes carried, up 19.6 percent on 1992. For the year, HACTL handled 550,167 tones of export cargo, up 17.1 percent on 1992; 432,429 tonnes of import cargo, up 22.1 percent; and 116,203 tonnes of transshipment goods, up 22.9 percent. HACTL is one of three bidders for airport cargo handling franchise at Chek Lap Kok. However, the Provisional Airport Authority is unwilling to grant any franchises for Chek Lap Kok until the Sino-British disagreement over airport financing is resolved. The other bidders for the franchise are the Hong Kong Airport Services consortium, comprising Singapore interests, China Merchant Holdings, and Kerry Holdings, and DHL. (Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST) in English 25 Jan 94 p 2) Growth in Imports, Exports Slows in 1993 Hong Kong's trade deficit fell last year, but growth in exports and imports slowed and some analysts believe the territory is heading for a period of stagnant growth in external trade. Exports grew 13.1 in the year to December, while imports rose 12.2 percent, leaving a total trade deficit of HK$26.3 billion. Miron Mushkat, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said that China's economy was unlikely to be a "particular source of strength" to Hong Kong. China's austerity program was said to have affected re-exports while domestic exports continued to be affected by the relocation of manufacturing industry to the mainland. (Hong Kong HONG KONG STANDARD (FINANCIAL REVIEW) in English 29 Jan 94) End of Vietnam Embargo Boosts Shares of Hong Kong Firm The share price of Luks Industrial jumped 21 percent on 3 February as prospects of an end to the U.S. embargo against Vietnam became apparent.
