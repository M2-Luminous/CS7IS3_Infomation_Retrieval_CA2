FR940804-0-00048 FR940804-0-00022 I. Background A. Introduction On October 1, 1993, EPA proposed a rule (58 FR 51270) governing the sequence of mandatory sanctions under section 179(a) (42 U.S.C. 7509(a)) of the amended Act. The document included extensive background on the Act, some of which is briefly resummarized in this background section because it relates directly to the Act's sanction provisions. The information not repeated concerns the overview at pages 51270&hyph;2 of the proposal provided on the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (1990 Amendments), title I requirements of the Act, and EPA action on SIP's. This background section also summarizes the proposal and the rationale. B. Consequences of State Failure 1. Section 179(a) Scope and Findings The 1990 Amendments revised the law concerning sanctions 1 to address State failures to comply with the requirements of the Act. Under section 179(a) of the Act, for any plan or plan revision required under part D of title I or required in response to a finding of substantial SIP inadequacy under section 110(k)(5) (42 U.S.C. 7410(k)(5)), 2 the Act sets forth four findings 3 that EPA can make, which may lead to the application of one or both of the sanctions specified under section 179(b) (42 U.S.C. 7509(b)). The four findings are: (1) A finding under section 179(a)(1) that a State has failed, for a nonattainment area, to submit a SIP or an element of a SIP, or that a submitted SIP or SIP element fails to meet the completeness criteria established pursuant to section 110(k) (42 U.S.C. 7410(k)); (2) a finding under section 179(a)(2) where EPA disapproves a SIP submission for a nonattainment area based on its failure to meet one or more plan elements required by the Act; (3) a finding under section 179(a)(3) that the State has not made any other submission required by the Act (including an adequate maintenance plan) or has made any other submission that fails to meet the completeness criteria or has made a required submission that is disapproved by EPA for not meeting the Act's requirements; or (4) a finding under section 179(a)(4) that a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented. 1 The 1990 Amendments also revised the Act's provisions concerning Federal implementation plans (FIP's). Under section 110(c)(1), the FIP requirement is triggered by an EPA finding that a State has failed to make a required submittal or that a received submittal does not satisfy the minimum completeness criteria established under section 110(k)(1)(A), or an EPA disapproval of a SIP submittal in whole or in part. However, since FIP's are not the subject of this notice, these provisions are not addressed here. 2 A finding of substantial inadequacy under section 110(k)(5)_known as a ``SIP call''_is made whenever EPA finds that a plan for any area is substantially inadequate to attain or maintain the relevant national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). 3 Section 179(a) refers to findings, disapprovals, and determinations. These will all be referred to by the one term ``findings.'' The EPA makes section 179(a) findings of failure to submit and findings of incompleteness via letters from EPA Regional Administrators to State governors or other State officers to whom authority has been delegated. 4 The letter itself triggers the sanctions clock. To make findings of failure to submit and findings of incompleteness under section 179(a)(1) and section 179(a)(3)(A), EPA is not required to go through notice-and-comment rulemaking. 5 For section 179(a)(2) and section 179(a)(3)(B) findings of disapproval, the Federal Register document in which EPA takes final action disapproving the submittal (after notice and comment) initiates the sanctions clock. For section 179(a)(4) findings of nonimplementation, the sanctions clock starts when EPA makes a finding of nonimplementation in the Federal Register through notice-and-comment rulemaking. For both disapprovals and findings of nonimplementation, the clock actually starts on the date the final Federal Register actions are effective. 4 7&hyph;62, Finding of Failure to Submit a Required State Implementation Plan or Any Other Required Submission of the Act, Clean Air Act, Delegations Manual, 12/13/91. 5 Notice and comment considerations vis-a-vis findings of failure to submit and incompleteness are discussed in the proposal at page 51272, footnote 7, and in section IV.G. of this document.
