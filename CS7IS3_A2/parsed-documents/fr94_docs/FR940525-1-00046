ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations by proposing requirements for permitting the use of health claims that characterize the relationship of a substance (food or food component) to a disease or health-related condition on the labeling of meat and poultry products. FSIS is also proposing regulations establishing a labeling application process for such health claims. This proposal would permit health claims relating to the association between: (1) Adequate calcium intake and reduced risk of osteoporosis; (2) diets low in fat and reduced risk of cancer; (3) sodium reduction and reduced risk of high blood pressure; (4) reduction in dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and reduced risk of coronary heart disease; (5) diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and reduced risk of cancer; (6) diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain dietary fiber and reduced risk of coronary heart disease; (7) substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables (foods that are low in fat and may contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, or vitamin C) and reduced risk of cancer; and, (8) folate and reduced risk of neural tube birth defects. FSIS is taking this action to provide consumers with accurate, informative labeling on meat and poultry products that conforms with such labeling on other foods. FSIS is proposing regulations to permit health claims that are designed to parallel those issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for other foods.
