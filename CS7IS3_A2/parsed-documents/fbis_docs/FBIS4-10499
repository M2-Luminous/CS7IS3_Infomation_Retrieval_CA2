Addressing a PDC rally at the Ovalo on Saenz Pena del Callao Avenue, PDC President Julio Luque Tijero called on all democratic political parties, labor centrals, federations and unions, peasants, professionals, and students to join this front. The current PDC leadership held the rally "as a sign of mourning for democracy on the second anniversary of the rupture of the national institutional order," on the occasion of the self-inflicted coup perpetrated by President Fujimori with the support of the Armed Forces high command. In his speech, Luque Tijero said the PDC "looks favorably upon the presidential candidacy of Javier Perez de Cuellar," who is heading voters' opinion polls by considerable margins. Speaking later to LA REPUBLICA, PDC President Luque Tijero said: "The main objective of all Peruvians with democratic heritage is the defeat of the concealed dictatorship headed by President Fujimori." He added that the Democratic Front should elect its presidential candidacy through a consensus. He said: "I believe that in this case all of us must look beyond any selfish party ambitions or ideologies and that Perez de Cuellar is the person who will enjoy everyone's support." In his address at the rally, Luque Tijero warned citizens and international public opinion about the danger that "at any time" the government may decide to either postpone or not hold the 1995 elections. He said: "President Fujimori has an extensive record so as to be able to trust him. First, he won over the people's confidence by promising that he would not implement an economic `shock' program but he turned around and enforced a brutal `supershock' program." He added: "Later, he swore before God and the fatherland to uphold and enforce the Constitution but he abruptly violated it exactly two years ago. Now that polls show that his popularity is sharply declining, who can guarantee what Fujimori will do tomorrow?" In this regard, he said the country must stay alert and united in case of eventual election fraud or any attempt to perpetrate another coup. Luque Tijero said: "Not only all Peruvians but also international public opinion must be alert." To this effect he called upon all democratic governments of the world, particularly those who comprise the so-called "Support Group," and international organizations such as the United Nations, the OAS, the ILO [International Labor Organization], etc., to demand from the Fujimori administration the full and effective upholding of the sovereign will of the Peruvian people expressed in free elections. For our part, stated Luque Tijero, we have addressed letters to international organizations that represent the PDC such as the Christian Democratic International and the Christian Democratic Organization of the Americas. Present at the 4 April rally were delegations from the Peruvian Port and Maritime Workers Federation, the PescaPeru [State Fishmeal and Fish Oil Production Agency] Workers Federation, and other Callao port labor unions. Sergio Valdivia, secretary general of the Port and Maritime Workers Federation, who harshly criticized President Fujimori's administration's antilabor policy, delivered a speech before Luque Tijero.
