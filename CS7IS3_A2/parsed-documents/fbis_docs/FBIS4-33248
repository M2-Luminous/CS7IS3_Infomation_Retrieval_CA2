Menem did not identify the official report on which he based his statement. He added that "there were hooded people with blunt objects in their hands" at a factory that had been occupied by strikers. Despite the fact that he was aware of the description that Menem gave of the labor conflict, Tierra del Fuego Governor Jose Estabillo said at a meeting with Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf that the social situation was under control, and without any possibility for an outburst. After meeting with Estabillo, Ruckauf went to a meeting also attended by Presidential Secretary Eduardo Bauza, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, and Labor Minister Armando Caro Figueroa. Caro Figueroa reported on the negotiations, expressing optimism for a rapid solution to the conflict. Cavallo, Ruckauf, and Bauza also decided that Caro Figueroa would coordinate all negotiations, although at yesterday's meeting it was made clear that the labor minister will have to report on each step of the negotiations. Hours before the meeting held at Bauza's office, Menem made statements to the radio station of his friend Gerardo Sofovich. The president made assurances that a handful of activists are going around the country showing up at every social conflict, and that UOM [Metalworkers Union] leader Lorenzo Miguel intends to facilitate a settlement to the labor crisis. "It is obvious that it is not only workers who are operating now, but groups of agitators who go around the country, creating problems for those who want to work. I listened to a report by a judge, who in order to enter a factory had to adopt a series of measures, and he finally met with hooded strikers, who were hooded not because of cold weather but because they wanted to conceal their faces. Some of them had blunt objects," Menem told Sofovich. [Sofovich] "Did you have a chance to meet with Governor Estabillo?" [Menem] "Yes, he told me that the situation in Tierra del Fuego is totally under control. Yet it seems that strikers continue in their position without obeying the decision by the Labor Ministry."
