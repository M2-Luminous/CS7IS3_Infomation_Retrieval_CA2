FBIS3-30103 "dreas038_a_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-038 Document Type:Daily Report 25 February 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Former Premier Miyazawa on Japan-U.S. Ties OW2502125194 OW2502125194 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television in Japanese at 2318 GMT on 19 February in its "News 2001" program carries a live 33- minute interview with Former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama, political commentator Kenichi Takemura, and Keio University Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi at the FNN studio in Tokyo, with frequent and lengthy commercial messages. Asked by Kuroiwa about the present state of Japan-U.S. relations, Miyazawa says: "I am worried about the relations. This is not the time for the prime minister to say that an adult Japan-U.S. relationship has been built. It is important to bring Japan-U.S. relations back to a normal state." Miyazawa also says: "Japan-U.S. relations are important to the two countries and the two countries should give consideration to their importance." Asked by Kuroiwa to comment on the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks, Miyazawa says: "It is wrong for the United States to stick to its demand for setting numerical targets. I told President Clinton when we met last April that numerical targets are no good. The President expressed an understanding of my view. It is said that the President did not ask for numerical targets at a meeting with Prime Minister Hosokawa." Miyazawa also says although he does not know the details, the President and Prime Minister Hosokawa had enough time to bridge the differences between the bureaucrats of the two countries. On the breakdown of the Japan- U.S. framework talks, Miyazawa says, "Given the importance of Japan- U.S. relations and the responsibility of the two countries to the international community, the breakdown of the framework talks is not a good thing." After a brief interview via satellite with an unidentified American researcher on future Japan-U.S. relations, the subject returns to Japan-U.S. trade friction. Discussing the trade friction, Miyazawa says, "Japan must keep in mind that relations with the United States have reached the point where the United States is now applying pressure on Japan to change its trade stand." Discussing Japan-U.S. trade friction, Miyazawa says: "I believe that what is at issue is the relationship between the leaders of the two countries. Since Japan and the United States are contacting each other in a broad range of areas, some problems are bound to arise in certain areas and I believe it is normal that such problems are arising. It is important for the two countries to restore a venue for dialogue." Miyazawa also says: "I believe that Japan should expand its domestic demand. Taken individually, Japan has no choice but to deal positively with the issue of automobile, government procurement, and insurance one by one. The figure of $50 billion or $60 billion in Japan's trade surplus with the United States cannot be drastically reduced. Japan has no choice but to take efforts to reduce the trade surplus and work to have the United States understand its efforts." Asked by Murayama to comment on Japan's moves to take its case to GATT if the United States imposes sanctions on Japan, Miyazawa says: "It is good for Japan to do so. What the latest GATT multilateral negotiations concluded is that the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act's Super 301 provision runs counter to GATT rules. The United States has been told by GATT not to restore the provision. Nonetheless, the United States still intends to restore the provision, and this is problematic. I believe that it is good for Japan to take its case to GATT if the United States slaps sanctions on Japan." Discussing Japan-U.S. trade friction, Miyazawa says: "European nations think that numerical targets are ridiculous. If Japan takes its case to GATT and a GATT arbitration panel is set up, Japan can win. European nations are saying that $60 billion in Japan's trade surplus with the United States is too huge and the Japanese market should be opened wider." After a brief interview via satellite with an unidentified American researcher, the subject returns again to Japan-U.S. trade friction. Asked by Takemura to comment on U.S. criticism of the Japanese bureaucracy, Miyazawa says: "This time, the President criticized the Japanese bureaucracy. It is reasonable for the President to intend to accomplish a lot during his term of office. The President criticized officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. I think his criticism was an expression of his view that Japanese politics should exercise leadership more aggressively." Discussing future Japan-U.S. relations, Miyazawa says: "Trade relations between the two countries are a part of Japan-U.S. relations. What is most important for Japan's diplomacy is to maintain friendly relations with the United States. The United States places its relations with Japan at the top of its foreign policy agenda. Since the two countries have contacts in a broad range of areas, some problems are bound to arise and the problems will not disappear. The two countries are aware of this. Leaders of the two countries should work to prevent the people of the two countries from feeling unfriendly toward each other." Commenting on Japanese bureaucracy, Miyazawa says: "The Japanese bureaucracy is very good at doing what is precedented, but it is not good at doing something new. I think that doing something new should come from the political leadership." Discussing a realignment of the political parties, Miyazawa says, "There will be no realignment of the political parties within this year." Miyazawa also adds: "Some have argued for amending the Constitution to promote Japan's military buildup. I think that the economically effective military buildup is the development of nuclear weapons and this is what Japan can do. If Japan posses the nuclear weapons, it should not use them. If it does not use them, it would serve nothing. The management of nuclear weapons is very difficult. If Japan was a dictatorial nation, it could easily develop them. Japan should not become such a nation. It is very difficult for any nation to keep its deterrent without using the nuclear weapons. I believe that Japan should not develop such nuclear weapons." The interview ends at 2351 GMT.
