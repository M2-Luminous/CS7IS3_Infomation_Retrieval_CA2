A huge plume of smoke rose above the airport in the southern stronghold as ambulances raced to the scene, following the air raid late morning. There were no immediate details of casualties or the extent of the damage. Northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, besieging the key port city of Aden for three weeks, have targeted the airport several times to stop southern jet planes from taking off there. Meanwhile, northern artillery units continued to fire shells sporadically at Aden following a dawn attack on the northern suburb of Shaykh 'Uthman which hospital officials said killed at least 18 civilians and wounded several more.
