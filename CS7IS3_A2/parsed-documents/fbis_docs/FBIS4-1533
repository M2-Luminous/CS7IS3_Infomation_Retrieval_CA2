An extraordinary era creates extraordinary theory. If we say that Marxism is the proletarian scientific theory of the era of free capitalism, Leninism is the proletarian revolutionary theory of the era of monopoly capitalism, and Mao Zedong Thought is the crystallization of collective wisdom of the CPC during the era of China's new democratic revolution and socialist revolution, then Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is present-day Chinese Marxism with which our party leads the people of all nationalities in our country in bringing order out of chaos and entering the new period of socialist modernization. Therefore, as part and parcel of the whole theory, Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist literature and art surely has the distinctive spirit of our times. Comrade Jiang Zemin said: "Combining the basic tenets of Marxism with the realities in China and the characteristics of our times, by inheriting and developing Mao Zedong Thought, concentrating the wisdom of the whole party and people throughout the nation with the great courage to chart a path to socialist construction and open a new realm of Marxism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping creatively put forth the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics." Just as Comrade Jiang Zemin said, after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, while dialectically inheriting and developing Mao Zedong's thinking on literature and art, Comrade Deng Xiaoping opened new ground on various aspects of endeavor in the light of the many new developments and problems facing writers and artists in the new period and achieved major accomplishments, thus forming his own theory on literature and art with Chinese characteristics. A careful and systematic study of the achievements will enable us to clearly see that Deng Xiaoping's theory on literature and art with Chinese characteristics has a clear-cut characteristic of our times and a vigorous creative spirit. 1. The theory has provided a new method of leading literature and art. After the proletariat has seized political power, as a ruling party, how should the Communist Party exercise leadership over the ideological realm as a whole, including literature and art? This is a problem facing not only our socialist country. In this regard, we have both positive and negative examples. Naturally, it was necessary to impose strict control over the ideological realm when China's newly born people's regime was not yet consolidated, and even to exercise necessary control under certain historical conditions. However, when class struggle ceased to be the principal contradiction of the Chinese society and socialist modernization has increasingly become its central task, what method should the party adopt in leading literature and art work? After correctly analyzing numerous theoretical and practical issues, such as the nature of socialism in China, the current stage of socialism in China, and its main contradiction and fundamental task, and basing himself on the laws governing literature and art, Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forth the correct idea that the party should adopt in leading literature and art work and gave a practical Marxist reply. He said: "Leadership does not mean handing out administrative orders and demanding literature and art serve immediate, short-range political goals. It means understanding the special characteristics of literature and art and the laws of their development and creating conditions for them to flourish. That is, it means creating conditions that help writers and artists improve their skills." Proceeding from acquiring a correct understanding of the speciality of literature and art creation, he stressed that party leadership over literature and art did not mean wanton imposition of administrative interference. He said: "In the production of literature and art, which involves complex mental labor, it is essential that writers and artists follow their own creative spirit. What subjects they should choose for their creative work and how they should deal with those subjects are questions that writers and artists themselves must examine and gradually solve through practice. There should be no arbitrary meddling in this process." Therefore, he pointed out particularly sharply: "The bureaucratic style of work must be dropped. There must be no more issuing of administrative orders regarding the creation and criticism of literature and art. To think such a practice upholds party leadership can only produce results opposite those intended." Here we must clearly point out: These methods advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping do not mean weakening party leadership over literature and art work. On the contrary, they mean further strengthening party leadership by improving the way the party leads literature and art work. Particularly in view of the errors made in ideological education and the unchecked spread of bourgeois liberalization during the first decade of reform and opening up to the outside world, he emphatically pointed out: "Vigorous efforts should be made to strengthen party leadership over the ideological front." "Principal leaders of the party committees at all levels must attach importance to the developments, problems, and work of the whole ideological front, including theoretical and literature and art circles." He firmly believed: "So long as our party really strengthens Marxist leadership, firmly overcomes weakness and laxity as well as liberalism, and conscientiously conducts active ideological struggle, the abovementioned problems on the ideological front can be solved, and it will not be difficult to solve them." In this new situation and in accordance with the numerous correct methods put forth by Comrade Deng Xiaoping for the party to lead literature and art work, to better and more effectively uphold party leadership over literature and art in political principle and orientation and necessary organization, party leading organs must earnestly change the way they operate, pay keen attention to orientation, total quantity, structure, and efficiency, and further realize the party's macroregulation and control, as well as correct guidance of literature and art work. 2. The theory has expounded the new connotations of the literature and art standards. Practice is the sole criterion for testing the truth, and also the sole criterion for judging the literature and art works as one of social ideologies. As far as literature and art works are concerned, the practice with which to judge them is generally manifested in a prominent way in two aspects: The society's political practice and literature and art practice. As such, Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the criterion for judging whether literature and art works are right or wrong and whether they are good or bad into "the political criterion and the artistic criterion." Meanwhile, the Marxist viewpoint on practice maintains that, as social practice undergoes a constant change, the political and artistic criteria with which to judge the right and wrong -- as well as the superiority and inferiority -- of literature and art works are also bound to change accordingly. In terms of the political criterion, when socialist modernization has become the main tide of China's present-day social life, Comrade Deng Xiaoping expounded scientifically: "Socialist modernization is our biggest political issue at present, because it represents the people's biggest and most fundamental interests." Therefore, the practice of socialist modernization has naturally become the biggest and most fundamental political practice of the people of all nationalities of present-day China and has correspondingly become the biggest and most fundamental political criterion for judging the right and wrong of present-day China's literature and art works. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "The basic standard for judging all our work is whether it helps or hinders our effort to modernize." In terms of artistic criterion, according to the objective laws of literature and art creation, Comrade Deng Xiaoping unified the profound artistic contents and the perfect artistic form. This highest realm, which literature and art creation seeks, is the artistic criterion for weighing the superiority and inferiority of the literature and art works in the new period. First of all, in terms of artistic contents, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Our socialist writers and artists should create vivid, inspiring flesh- and-blood characters. Through them, they should truthfully depict our rich social life and the inner qualities of our people as shown in their social relations, and give expression to the trend of historical development and to the demands of our progressive era. They should endeavor to educate the people in socialist ideology and imbue them with the drive and spirit necessary to build national strength and prosperity." Second, in terms of art forms, Comrade Deng Xiaoping went on to point out: "All writers and artists should earnestly study, assimilate, and expand on all that is best in the literary and artistic techniques of every land and every age and perfect art forms with the distinctive features of our nation and our own time." The practice of literature and art development in the new period has proven: So long as we judge the superiority and inferiority of literature and art works using the artistic criterion which perfectly combines contents and forms as expounded by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, we can help raise the level of China's literature and art creation in accordance with objective laws. 3. The theory has entrusted a new task to literature and art creation. In the final analysis, with what works should our writers and artists serve the drive to build socialism with Chinese characteristics? This is a major topic of discussion which has a bearing on the question of what mission writers and artists should undertake. On this issue, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Our writers and artists should try harder to portray and help foster the new socialist man and achieve greater success in doing so. We must portray the new features of the pioneers in the modernization drive, their revolutionary ideals and scientific approach, their lofty sentiments and creative ability, and their broad and realistic vision. Through images of this new man, we must stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses for socialism and inspire their creative activities, which are of historic significance in the pursuit of the four modernizations." Here, proceeding from the overall situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, in fact, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly entrusted to writers and artists the great mission of developing the theme of the spirit of our times. Every era and society have their own main tide of historical development and the spirit which occupies a leading position in the entire development of ideology and culture. As the dynamic aesthetic reflection of social life, every state must have its own main theme [zhu xuan lu 0031 2467 1774] in the literature and art creation of every era. In discussing the mission of this era in building socialist spiritual civilization, including literature and art, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "It is fundamental to enable the broad masses of people to have communist ideals, moral integrity, education, and a sense of discipline. Internationalism and patriotism both belong to the category of spiritual civilization." Correctly applying the stand, viewpoint, and method of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Comrade Jiang Zemin more concretely expounded on this issue. He pointed out: "Patriotism, socialism, and collectivism must become the main theme of our society." The real social life is rich and colorful. The spiritual and cultural demands of the masses of people are multifaceted and multileveled. In the light of this reality, Comrade Deng Xiaoping advocated: "The road before literature and art should become broader and broader. Guided by the correct principles for creative work, writers and artists should deal with an even wider range of themes, increasingly vary their means of expression, and dare to blaze new trails. We must guard against or overcome the tendency to be formalistic and abstract, which produces monotonous, stiff, mechanical, and stereotyped works." Therefore, in our literature and art creation, including mainstream works, theme, form, style, and means of expression must also be diversified, rich, and colorful. To put it another way, the diversification of theme, form, style, and means of expression should be encouraged. Only when this dialectical unity is achieved in both theory and practice can fine works and performances truly worthy of our great people and era be produced. What needs pointing out here is that while developing the main theme, all spiritual products which educate and enlighten the people and give them entertainment and aesthetic treats should be welcomed and encouraged. In a word, developing the main theme, encouraging diversification, and upholding the unity of the two are the demands of the era and also the demands of the development laws of literature and art. The more resounding and clear-cut this theme of our literature and art, the more able it will become to effectively embody the "two serves" orientation and the "double hundred" policy and resist the interference of various distractions. Through literature and art works "which have healthy and encouraging contents, particularly eulogizing reform and opening up and modernization as well and artistic magic," writers and artists should fulfill the great mission entrusted to them by history to develop the theme of the spirit of our times and promote the flowering of socialist literature and art creation. 4. The theory has expounded the new standards for literature and art efficiency. Literature and art, from the formation to distillation of artistic conception and from the process of creation to aesthetic enjoyment, show that ideology is the most fundamental and clear-cut speciality of literature and art. Of course, after entering circulation, some literature and art works have the specific characteristics of both ideology and commercial formation. In the last 10 years, the socialist cultural market has emerged forcefully and developed rapidly. Hence, how to correctly understand the commercial attributes and speciality of most literature and art products and how to correctly handle the relationship between the social benefit and economic results of literature and art products has become a new important question promoting the flowering of China's literature and art. In 1983, sternly criticizing the unhealthy phenomenon of "putting money above everything else," which emerged in the literature and art circles, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "The unhealthy trend of `putting money before everything else'" has also spread in the literature and art circles. From grass-roots to central performing groups, there are performers giving performances everywhere without authorization. Quite a few people made money by publishing works and giving performances with lowbrow contents and vulgar forms. It is a pity that some performers and literature and art fighters of the People's Liberation Army were also involved in such activity." Quite indignantly, he pointed out: "The tendency of commercializing spiritual products is also manifested in the other aspects of spiritual production. Some people who unworthily occupy a place in literature and art, publishing, and historical relic circles have simply become merchants, intent on nothing but profit." Comrade Deng Xiaoping's firm opposition to the erroneous trend of commercializing spiritual products is in line with the Marxist basic principle of differentiating spiritual products from material commodities. In 1985, in regard to the emergence of bourgeois liberalization and the tendency of money worship on the ideological and cultural front, Comrade Deng Xiaoping once again clearly stated: "Ideological, cultural, educational, and health departments must take social benefit as the sole standard for all activities. The enterprises under their jurisdiction must also take social benefit as the supreme standard." This standard not only deals with what is of basic importance in the production of literature and art products, but also has great significance in guiding the construction of China's socialist cultural market. In other words, as part and parcel of the socialist market economy, China's cultural market naturally must abide by the general laws of the market rule in its development. However, because the creation of cultural products is a complex mental exercise, we should not let the market completely decide their rise or decline or their success or failure; because the relationship between the long-term development of the cultural cause and short-term consumption of literature and art products should be correctly handled, we should not let the utilitarian [gong li 0501 0448] behavior of the market completely decide their proportional readjustments; and because the cultural products entering the cultural markets have the attributes as both commodity and ideology, we should all the more not let the commercial gains and loses of the market completely decide which to choose. These special features of our socialist cultural market require us to regulate and control the market more directly and powerfully by using policy, legal, economic, and administrative means and, in the complicated practice, ensure in terms of mechanism that "social benefit is put in the first place and the relationship between the social benefit and economic results of spiritual products is correctly handled." 5. Theory has charted a new way of building literature and art. In the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, continuously probing the new way of promoting China's socialist literature and art cause is one of the important tasks facing the drive to strengthening the building of material and spiritual civilization and also one of the important contents of Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist literature and art with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's major achievements in this regard are as follows: 1. Literature and art structural reform is clearly defined. In 1979, when dealing with the need for qualified people in large quantities in prospering China's literature and art, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Through improved ideological and administrative work we should create the necessary conditions for persons of outstanding talent to emerge and mature." Later on, from the angle of reform being the fundamental way out of China's various socialist undertakings, he emphatically stressed: "I stand for reform. Without reform, there would be no way out. Decades of experiments have proved that the old ways were unsuccessful." He went on to say: "Reform is all-embracing. It includes economic structural reform, political structural reform, and resulting reforms in the other aspects of endeavor." With these expositions, in fact, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly defined: China must carry out reforms including literature and art structural reform. Moreover, literature and art structural reform is the effective way of promoting the development of China's literature and art cause. In this aspect, on the basis of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core has provided correct leadership in light of the development of China's literature and art cause. The report to the 14th CPC National Congress clearly stated: "We should actively carry out cultural structural reform, improve our cultural and economic policies, and promote the flowering of our socialist culture." In the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Questions Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" which was promulgated not long ago, the party once again put forth the task of "deepening cultural structural reform, improving our cultural and economic policies, and strengthening the management of the cultural market according to law." In the new situation of building the socialist market economic structure, we must acknowledge that to drop old habits and reform the literature and art structure is inevitable. However, the change must not be arbitrary, spontaneous, and unregulated. It must conform to development laws. Therefore, we must note the internal relationship between literature and art structural reform and economic structural reform and their generality in some aspects and fully understand the former's own laws and speciality. Only when we have a good grasp of this point can we ensure the sound and smooth progress of literature and art structural reform. Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forth a scientific standard for judging the nature and the success or failure of reform, thus providing a theoretical basis for us to test the success or failure of literature and art structural reform. To be specific, we must see if the reform helps bring the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of writers and artists into full play, if it helps turn out works and talents, promotes the flowering of socialist culture, and meet people's increasing demands for cultural life, and if it helps promote economic growth and overall social progress. 2. The training of writers and artists is clearly defined. According to the Marxist viewpoint, man is the most active of the productive forces. Developing culture, literature, and art production and prospering China's socialist literature and art is no exception. This requires training and fostering large numbers of outstanding socialist writers and artists. Meanwhile, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always favored "respecting knowledge and talents." He maintained: "Only when outstanding, talented writers and artists have come to the fore group by group can the scientific and cultural levels of the Chinese nation be raised as a whole." When specifically discussing literature and art work, he urgently pointed out: "Special stress must be laid on the training of talented writers and artists. For a country as big as ours, with a population of over 900 million, we really have too few who are outstanding. This is quite out of keeping with the demands of our times." On the question of improving the political quality of talented writers and artists, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We are now building socialism with Chinese characteristics. As the times and task are different, there is indeed a lot of new knowledge for us to learn. Therefore, we should strive to master the basic Marxist theories in the light of new realities." He also urged "writers and artists to conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought so as to enhance their own ability to understand and analyze life and see through appearances to the essence." He reminded writers and artists to attach importance to changing their world outlook. With skill and patience, he said: "In our socialist society, everyone must remold themselves. Not only must those whose basic stand has not changed remold themselves, all people must study, continuously remold themselves, study new problems, accept new things, conscientiously resist the corrosive influence of bourgeois ideology, and better shoulder the glorious and arduous mission of building a modern and powerful socialist country." On the question of enhancing the artistic quality of talented writers and artists, advocating that writers and artists should learn from the people in the practice of life, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "The creative life of all progressive writers and artists is rooted in their intimate ties with the people. Creativity withers when these ties are forgotten, neglected, or severed." On the other hand, also advocating that writers and artists should learn from successful artistic experience in the practice of art, he pointed out: "We should draw on and learn all that is progressive and advanced in the literature, art, and performing arts of old China, and of other countries as well." From the strategic position that there is no lack of successors to carry on China's socialist literature and art cause and with his particular concern about the training of young writers and artists, he especially pointed out: "Our young writers and artists are vigorous in perspective and in them lies the future of our literature and art. We should help them eagerly and also make strict demands on them, so that they will not become divorced from life but will make steady progress both ideologically and in their art." Placing particular stress on the unity of the contingent of writers and artists, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We sincerely hope that our writers and artists will unite more closely and expand their ranks. Whether professional or amateur, all socialist and patriotic writers and artists and all those who support the reunification of the motherland should try harder to help and learn from each other and to concentrate their energies on literary and artistic creation, study, and criticism." In a word, Comrade Deng Xiaoping eagerly hoped that "more and more comrades in the ranks of writers and artists will become real engineers of the human soul." "For a tree to grow tall, one must make its roots firm. For a river to flow endlessly, one must dredge its fountainhead." Past events since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee have proven: The completely new practice of prospering China's literature and art is inseparable from Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, in particular, the literature and art theoretical guidance contained in it. Therefore, the fundamental task of our cultural work is to earnestly study and correctly apply the theory's stand, viewpoint, and method in unifying our thinking, studying our work, and guiding our practice.
