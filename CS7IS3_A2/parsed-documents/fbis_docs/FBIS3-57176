There is vast potential for multifaceted cooperation. As long as there is the desire on both sides. But is there? And just how profitable is it, for example, for us to trade with China today? "The policy of liberalization in foreign economic relations is beginning to yield positive results. This is evidenced, in particular, by the development of Russian-Chinese trade," officials at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations say. It is certainly true that the total volume of commodity turnover between Russia and China has increased. Russia had a surplus in 1992. But in reality things have turned out badly for the Russian recipient and consumer. By the end of 1992 the rate at which goods were ordered from and supplied by the Russian side under the terms of the relevant protocol had considerably outstripped the rate at which goods were supplied by the Chinese side. As a result, Russian suppliers have not received goods in exchange for their exports. Furthermore, in the light of Russian exporters' difficulties with the supply of complete sets of equipment, the Chinese side is holding back with regard to honoring its mutual commitments to despatch goods to the Russian Federation. In addition, the Chinese side has prevented the Russian side from honoring its commitments to supply equipment to the "Suizhong," "Jingxian," "Yimin," and "Yingkou" thermal power plants. How should this be viewed? The policy of liberalizing foreign economic activity has meant a rejection of the regulating role played by the center, which represented general state and national interests. As a result of the new policy, trade with China now mainly takes the form of border and regional commodity exchange, rather than being conducted on an intergovernmental basis (by protocol). The participants in this process are nonproduction cooperatives and enterprises, and also foreign economic associations at regional, city, and rayon level. The basis of this border and regional commodity exchange is barter (the exchange of goods for other goods). In 1992, the bulk of Russian supplies of trucks, tractors, combines, machine tools, and mining equipment, and also some power engineering and aviation equipment and spare parts, were implemented by enterprises on a barter basis. The supply of so-called "hard currency Russian goods" -- fertilizers, metals, and commercial timber -- is offset by consumer goods imported from the PRC, although these are often of poor quality. This also cannot be counted as one of Russia's achievements in its trade with China. In 1992 the proportion of decentralized trade in the Russian Federation's commodity turnover with the PRC increased from 59 percent to 90 percent in the space of one year. Moreover, the export of machinery and equipment fell from 35 percent in 1991 to 31 percent in 1992. Liberalization in foreign trade has therefore had a negative impact with regard to utilizing production capacity in Russia's machine-building industry. Trade with the PRC has not given it any incentive to increase output. Barter-driven border trade is gaining in scope. According to XINHUA, at the end of June 1993 barter deals between the province of Heilongjiang and Russia (and also other CIS republics) amounted to 1.51 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 83.3 percent in comparison to the same period in 1992. At the end of July 1992 China had a surplus in border trade with Russia. Current trade relations with China are economically disadvantageous to Russia, because border and regional trade deals are unevenly balanced. Russian export prices are set too low, while Chinese import prices are set too high. In a number of cases Chinese companies have deliberately refused to buy timber, petroleum products, fertilizers, and metal products through interstate channels, instead obtaining them in significant quantities on a barter basis. It is quite obvious that China is pumping out Russia's raw material resources with the aid of border and regional trade. Joint Russian-Chinese enterprises in our Far East are a component part of this "border pump." However, the creation of these enterprises is seen as an achievement in Russian-Chinese foreign economic relations! They are involved in the export of natural resources and unprocessed raw materials and in the services sector (the hotel business, in particular), according to experts from the semigovernmental Japan External Trade Organization. But is this activity by joint enterprises in the Russian Federation's long-term interests as a whole? After all, we are losing irreplaceable natural resources and receiving in exchange foodstuffs and consumer goods which have no demand on the world market. This kind of trade cannot be described as mutually advantageous. According to data for the first half of 1992, Beijing was able to improve its overall foreign trade balance as a direct result of supplying goods to Russia, by expanding its exports -- which began to decline noticeably from January 1993. What about Russian exports to the PRC? As a result of capital construction being scaled down in China, our rolled steel, machinery, and equipment are not in the demand they used to be. According to data for October 1993, the value of unsold Russian goods has reached 1.3 billion yuan. Assessing the prospects for developing economic cooperation between our countries, many Chinese economists regard the Russian Far East primarily as a supplier of fuel and raw materials. Strange though it may seem, some representatives of Russian economic science share these sentiments. Trade between the Russian Federation and the PRC is sometimes held back for technical reasons. In the first half of last year, for example, the plan for freight traffic between the two countries was only 62-67 percent implemented, mainly because of a shortage of cars and the low capacity of railroad sidings on PRC territory. Meanwhile, it was planned to transport as much as 5 million tonnes of freight by rail from Russia to the PRC in 1993, whereas China was only supposed to dispatch 2.4 million tonnes. The Russian side has volunteered to iron out transport bottlenecks by offering to build a passing track between the Chinese station of Manzhouli and Zabaykalsk, using its own resources. This was announced by Zabaykalsk Railway Chief A. Dovgello. Such generosity on the part of officials in the Russian railway department would be touching if they were paying for the work out of their own pockets. Especially as the transport system in rayons bordering on China leaves much to be desired. It is extremely interesting that some tend to view the export of Chinese manpower as an achievement in our foreign economic relations. According to XINHUA, in the first half of 1993 the province of Heilongjiang alone sent 20,000 Chinese contract workers to Russia. To quote SIBIRSKAYA GAZETA, the citizens arriving in Maritime Kray from China today "can hardly be called the best examples of the Chinese nation." For example, the services of some plant growers from China have had to be refused. More than 60 Chinese hired workers have been sent back to the PRC early from the "Leninskoye" Peasant Farmers' Association in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. When they arrived from the city of Tongjiang, the Chinese workers were contracted to grow tomatoes and cucumbers on land leased in the oblast. However, once they had planted out the seedlings, they left the ripening harvest to the mercy of fate and actively engaged in commercial activity. They obtained large consignments of Chinese goods from across the border and sold them at the local market. The question of Chinese contract workers goes beyond pure economics. A political problem lies behind it. At the end of the sixties the PRC leadership officially made territorial claims against the USSR. In particular, they referred to lands in the Russian Far East. To this day the PRC Government has not retracted these claims. The question of "the lost territories" is hyped in various PRC publications, which is reflected in the mass social consciousness of the Chinese. According to Germany's DER SPIEGEL, the Chinese see their striving for the east of Russia as the continuation of a long tradition. Historian Huang Dingtian from the Heilongjiang Academy of Social Sciences claims that, 140 years ago, large areas of Siberia belonged to China, and the Chinese never forget history. According to SIBIRSKAYA GAZETA, the reality is that twice as many Chinese as Russians live in Maritime Kray's Pogranichnyy [Border] Rayon. All these PRC citizens are living there illegally. Our own Russian street traders (known in the jargon of today's new "businessmen" as "commuters") do not arouse any positive emotions in our neighbors. Every day, several thousand Russian buyers descend on northeast China. Once they have "stocked up," they hurry home. This is how Russians try to ensure their own personal prosperity on the road to a market economy! Russian-Chinese foreign economic relations cannot be discussed in unequivocal terms. Nevertheless, while living for the present, we must not forget Russia's long-term economic and political interests.
