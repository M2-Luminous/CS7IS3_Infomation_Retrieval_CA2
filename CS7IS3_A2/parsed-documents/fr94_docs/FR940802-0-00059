FR940802-0-00059 FR940802-0-00008 IX. Statutory Authority EPA believes that the final rule adopted today is a reasonable exercise of the discretionary authority granted the Agency under sections 211(k) and 301 of the Act. EPA interprets the first sentence of section 211(k)(1) as broad authority to adopt reasonable requirements for reformulated gasoline, unless otherwise prohibited by the Clean Air Act or other statutory provision. EPA interprets the second sentence of section 211(k)(1) as authorizing EPA to adopt regulations for the reformulated gasoline program that result in the greatest emission reductions achievable, and at the same time tend to optimize the resulting impacts on cost, energy requirements, and other health and environmental impacts. In effect, EPA has full authority to adopt emission reduction standards and other requirements that achieve this result. For further discussion of the statutory authority for the renewable oxygenate program the reader is referred to section III.A. X. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51,735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, the Administrator has determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' based on the above criteria. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations have been documented in the public record: EPA Air Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;49. A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the reformulated gasoline program has been prepared and placed in Public Docket No. A&hyph;93&hyph;49 to accompany this EPA notice of final rulemaking. A draft version of the Regulatory Impact Analysis was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12866. Any written comments from OMB and EPA response to those comments have also been placed in the public docket for this rulemaking. A final version of the analysis is available in the docket cited above. XI. Compliance With the Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this rule were submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. These requirements are not effective until OMB approves them and a technical amendment to that effect is published in the Federal Register . An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1591.05) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch; EPA, 401 M Street, SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 0.64 hours per response and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 3.44 hours per respondent. If the burden associated with quality assurance testing is included these estimates increase to 22.44 and 5.44, respectively. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' EPA will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements prior to OMB issuing approval.
