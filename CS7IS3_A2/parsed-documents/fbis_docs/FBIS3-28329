With regard to a source to finance the proposed tax cuts, Chairman Murayama indicated that a consultative body should be set up to make a decision on this issue while watching the economic trend. [Begin Murayama recording] A consultative body has to be set up to decide on a revenue source for implementing tax cuts, and it is necessary to watch the economic situation after economic pump priming measures are taken. In line with discussion on administrative reform, a welfare vision, and other issues, a decision should be made on how to cover the cost of the proposed tax cuts. [end recording] Chairman Murayama said such a view is basically the same as views of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Democratic Socialist Party. He indicated that it would be possible to reach an accord if the ruling parties make no bones about the timing for making the decision at the proposed consultative body. Moreover, Chairman Murayama reiterated his criticism of the idea of introducing the National Welfare Tax. He indicated that the SDPJ for its part intends to demand that a pension-oriented tax be introduced to finance basic pensions.
