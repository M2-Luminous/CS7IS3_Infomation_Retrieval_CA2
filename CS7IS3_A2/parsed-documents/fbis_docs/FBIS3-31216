The delegation intended to observe what has happened to the Albanians returned from Austria, Scandinavian countries and Germany. Concerning the refusal of the Serbian authorities to go to Kosova, Ms. Christine von Kohl told BBC: "This time we received no answer." She explained how she had personally talked with the official in charge of so-called Yugoslav Embassy in Vienna. Ms. von Kohl said one of the reasons for refusing the visas might be the fact that the Belgrade's authorities want to show they do not observe the CSCE norms as it recently happened with the Amnesty International.
