ACTION: Correction to final regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains corrections to the final regulations which were published Tuesday, September 13, 1994, (59 FR 46895). The regulations related to the service limits for temporary appointments. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tracy E. Spencer, (202) 606&hyph;0830, or fax (202) 606&hyph;2329. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The final regulations that are the subject of this correction revise OPM's time limits for temporary appointments (i.e., appointments limited to 1 year or less) to set a uniform limit for such appointments in both the competitive and the excepted service at 1 year with no more than one 1-year extension (24 months total service). This change is intended to ensure that temporary appointments, under which employees receive no benefits, are used to meet truly short-term needs. Need for Correction As published, the final regulations show the effective date of the new time limits as 60 days following publication. However, OPM had intended to make the regulations effective 30 days following publication, the earliest date permitted by law. In view of Congressional and employee concerns and evidence that under existing limits some employees have, indeed, served for years under a succession of temporary appointments, we believe it is critical to make the revised limits effective as soon as possible. The final regulations also listed contact for further information as Tracy Spencer on (202) 606&hyph;0960. Her telephone number is now (202) 606&hyph;0830. Correction of Publication Accordingly, the publication on September 13, 1994, of the final regulations, which were the subject of FR Doc. 94&hyph;22447, is corrected as follows: EFFECTIVE DATE: October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tracy E. Spencer, (202) 606&hyph;0830, or fax (202) 606&hyph;2329. Office of Personnel Management. Lorraine A. Green, Deputy Director.
