Renault is completing installation of the first European ``green network,'' while Peugeot is starting a pilot operation in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region. Renault is completing the installation in 10 West European countries of its ``green network,'' a system for collecting and recycling automobile scrap. From Swindon in Great Britain to Vienna in Austria and from Amsterdam to Lisbon by way of Paris, Brussels, or Milan, beginning in 1994, 1 million bumpers, 700,000 batteries, 3 million liters of solvents, 3 million tires, and 120,000 cubic meters of used packaging will be collected every year and then ``reworked'' (that is, transformed into new raw materials) by recycling professionals. The network, which got its start in the Tours area and in Germany in the summer of 1991, has already made it possible, for example, to use some 120,000 used bumpers to manufacture new parts (fenders and side bumpers) for the latest Safrane, Clio, and Twingo models. The system will involve the 13,500 dealers and agents in Renault's European sales network. From every sales outlet and repair point, the same trucks that deliver new replacement parts will carry away automobile scrap to regional or national collection centers (for example, Zurich for Switzerland and Valladolid for Spain). There the scrap will be sorted and the resulting inventories in each category sent to certified recycling firms. In cooperation with the French Scrap Iron Company, Renault also set up the first industrial center for processing junked automobiles in Athis-Mons (Essonne) in September 1992. In one year, that plant has recycled some 10,000 vehicles with what the firm reports is ``a salvage rate exceeding 90 percent'' and good economic profitability. In less than 10 years, ``no more than 10 percent'' of the weight of a vehicle will wind up in dumps, compared to 25 percent today. In addition to its existing centers (in Athis-Mons, Madrid, and Wuerzburg, Germany), Renault intends to establish new ones--notably in Toulouse. Some of them will be operated in cooperation with other manufacturers, as is already the case with BMW in Wuerzburg. Peugeot's `Clean Garages' On a smaller scale, Peugeot is also concerning itself with the collection of automobile scrap (oil, batteries, and tires). In cooperation with the National Council of Automobile Professionals (CNPA), the firm in Sochaux has just launched a pilot experiment in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region: car owners who maintain their own vehicles are being encouraged to bring their used materials to facilities equipped for the purpose (there will be 40 such establishments by the end of the year, plus another 200 in 1994). The used materials will then be sent to recycling centers. If the experiment is successful, the system will be extended to all of France. Parallel with that, Peugeot is engaged in a ``clean garage'' operation following what the manufacturer calls ``successful'' testing since December 1992 by its dealer in Douai (Nord). This operation consists of sorting shop scrap at the source for subsequent recycling. Will the consumer find his garage bill increasing to serve the ``green cause?'' Renault rules out that possibility, at least ``in the short term.'' Peugeot is reportedly considering the possibility of an ``environment fee'' in the name of ``modern-day public-spiritedness.'' The reason, according to Peugeot and the CNPA, is that every year in France, 100,000 metric tons of used motor oil, 2 million batteries, and 15 million tires are thrown away, all too often in unauthorized dumps. Compare those figures to the current effort.
