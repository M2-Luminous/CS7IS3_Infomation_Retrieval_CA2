The idea is to emphasize prevention rather than repression which, generally speaking, has been used since, or even before the tenure of President George Bush. One reason for the change of strategy is that the one used so far has proven ineffective and only increased the number of consumers by an average of 140,000 new addicts per year to the incredible current number of 10 million consumers. At the same time as it announced the so-called New National Antinarcotics Strategy, the White House also asked the U.S. Congress to approve a $13.2-billion allocation to implement this program. This includes a substantial increase in the funds earmarked for cooperation with drug producer countries. This directly concerns us because Peru is the world's biggest coca leaf producer and the money allocated for cooperation is earmarked for eradicating plantations and destroying laboratories. U.S. Government officials have said that this money -- which will not reach Peru or Bolivia until October -- will also be used to strengthen the Peruvian and Bolivian judicial systems and to train their respective specialized police units. Despite a relative increase, and the strategy implemented in Peru, the main changes by U.S. officials do not seem positive. Iban de Rementeria -- a UN expert in narcotics affairs and agricultural development who termed the U.S. strategy "a complete turn around" -- has stated that although it is right that the United States has admitted for the first time since 1904 that the drug problem is a domestic problem, there are other aspects that reveal faults in the new strategy as far as our countries are concerned. Rementeria said: "There should be no illusions because we continue alone in this field," adding that prospects for Peru and Bolivia are not good because "in their capacity as producers they will be abandoned to their fate, they will be given no aid, and no importance will be granted to the alternative development crops." To a certain extent, the current international agricultural policies upheld by the GATT are even more serious because the recent Uruguay Round has institutionalized the subsidy system in developed countries, condemning agriculture in the Third World "to failure." Bolivian Chamber of Deputies President Guillermo Bedregal has mentioned the serious social conflicts that would be unleashed in his country following a cut in the alternative development program. As we can see, it is not just a matter of a mere substitution of plantations, which to a great extend has failed because a series of complementary aspects -- such as guaranteeing peasants access to market -- were overlooked. Alternative development is what is sought and needed now; so that the coca grower's problems will be tackled in a comprehensive way, that the peasant will by no means be regarded as a delinquent or an accomplice, but merely a producer with limited possibilities and without an "alternative" -- for the time being -- to survive. The solution to the immensely complex trafficking problem must, therefore, contemplate the problem of the peasants -- who are on many occasions involuntarily and exploited producers of the raw material -- whose needs and interests must also be considered.
