ACTION: Notice of Interpretative Bulletin. SUMMARY: HUD has issued regulations implementing the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 and providing for consumer complaint handling and remedial actions.

Some manufacturers are not adequately carrying out their responsibilities under the regulations. Accordingly, the Department finds it necessary to reiterate, through this Interpretative Bulletin, its policy with regard to the regulations. DATES: Date of issuance: October 31, 1994.
