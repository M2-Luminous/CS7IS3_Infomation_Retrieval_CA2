"The sides not only do not have any differences on any serious issues, there are not even any significant divergences of positions," this was the evaluation of the present state of relations between Russia and the United Kingdom by a close advisor to the Russian foreign minister on the results of talks between Andrey Kozyrev and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. The visit of the head of British diplomacy, which began in Murmansk on 22 May, was noted for a symbolic event today. D. Hurd became the first foreign minister of a western country to visit the strategic base of the Russian fleet at Severomorsk. "This is our latest true gesture of partnership with NATO," the Russian diplomat said, commenting on the British minister's visit to the Admiral Nakhimov, a Northern Fleet heavy cruiser. Although we still await the signing of agreements--a framework document and a special protocol on mutual relations between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance, reflecting its special nature as a nuclear power --partnership between the Russian Federation and NATO is already in fact being implemented. The same day, the diplomat reported, the high-ranking representative of NATO's military command is awaited in Severomorsk. According to the Russian diplomat, among western partners "the British probably understand us most of all," and here the personal position of the Foreign Office head plays a part. For example, on the question of Russia's participation from the outset in a political conference between G-7 countries with equal rights, Great Britain "was one of the first to stretch out its hand to us," and the summit in Naples this summer will be the premiere of the political "eight." In relation to an agreement between the Russian Federation and the European Union, London is in favor of this accord being reached as soon as possible. Until recently, the Foreign Office representative explained, two unsolved questions had largely remained in the way to a triumphant ceremony. The first, where the "ball was in the Russian court," concerned the lifting of restrictions on the activities of foreign banks in Russia. A solution was found--for some banks conditions will be improved as of now, and for others--in the foreseeable future. The second matter is linked with the position of the partners, first and foremost the French, and their commercial interests. Russia was offered lower quotas than at present in trade in materials of the nuclear fuel cycle, to which Moscow could not agree. Experts from the two sides are working on the problem, and according to information just received, they are close to a compromise. As far as London is concerned, it favors an agreement being signed in June. Close interaction is also to be seen in efforts to settle the situation in Bosnia. It is being implemented by the sides in the spirit of the communique of the ministerial meeting between Russia, the United States, and the five countries of the European Union on Bosnia, held in Geneva on 13 May. As far as the Russian Federation's relations with the Baltic countries are concerned, in the opinion of the British partners, the package of agreements with Latvia on the withdrawal of Russian troops, which also contains guarantees of the rights of military pensioners, could also extend to the Estonian side. According to the Russian diplomat, London will try to convince Tallinn of this. Speaking about Douglas Hurd's trip to the Ukraine next Tuesday, the Russian diplomat said that the British side strives to prevent any worsening of relations between Moscow and Kiev, and therefore follows the principle of "no harm." In fact other Western countries have also adopted a similar position. As for the declarations by Ukrainian representatives about their intention to appeal to the UN Security Council regarding the situation in Crimea, Moscow has told the British side it favored this major international body taking an interest in this problem, calling for a settlement through peaceful, political means. This would cool down some hotheads on various sides. It is not a coincidence that the meeting between the Russian and British foreign ministers took place in Murmansk. This region has a vast potential, where bilateral cooperation has great prospects, and generates serious interest in Great Britain. Douglas Hurd expressed hope that plans will go ahead to twin Murmansk and Aberdeen, a large British port and center of oil and gas industry. The head of the British diplomacy remembered the war time camaraderie and expressed his conviction that in peaceful times the cooperation between the two countries must be equally close. The United Kingdom, he said, is planning to send official representatives to Murmansk to mark Victory Day, which had been achieved with some help from the marines of the military and merchant fleet of Great Britain, who had taken part of Arctic convoys delivering aid from the allies to the town during the war.
