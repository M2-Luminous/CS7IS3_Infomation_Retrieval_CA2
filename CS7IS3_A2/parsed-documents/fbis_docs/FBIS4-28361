Political instability increases dependency on the bureaucracy for policy formation. Political initiative is indispensable to reform bureaucratic control. 2. The prominent power of the MOF [Ministry of Finance] bureaucrats regarding recent policy formation stands out. Today, however, when the people's awareness concerning burdens and benefits has matured, it can also be said that an opportunity has come to demolish the past superiority of the MOF bureaucrats. 3. The relationships of regulation, cooperation, and separation are necessary between policy and administration, and system reform for these purposes is expected from the new government. "Personifiers of National Interest" a Myth The Hosokawa administration ended in an unexpected demise, and the political world rushed feverishly into the second act of its reorganization. Politicians tend to relish rebellions, and they cannot help bouncing around like fish taking to water during such an upheaval. However, it is highly questionable whether the alignment changes among the political parties and the politicians will actually lead to a change in Japan's politics. The reason is that the point of how to escape from bureaucratic control and to realize politics led by the political parties is missing from today's axial issue of reorganization of the parties. In Japan's politics, the ruling party represents, instead of an entity that embodies a doctrine, nothing more than a position of monopoly access to the budget or authority in the hands of the bureaucracy. The more the political parties compete with each other and the longer the political vacuum is prolonged, the greater the government's actual dependency on the bureaucracy becomes. If the current drama of political party reorganization fails to recharge political energy for the purpose of taking command of the bureaucracy and ends as a tempest in a teacup called Nagata-cho, the road to political reform must be deemed to be far. Following the change of administrations, there is a strong impression of the MOF's mounting impact on policy formation. The greatest barrier in an attempt to convert from bureaucratic control to political party politics is probably how to change this point. During the past dozen or more years as the emergence of the "zoku" Diet members became conspicuous, instead of examining the need for individual annual spending programs, the MOF bureaucrats have manipulated such symbols as the "cumulative rise of national debts" or the "welfare revenue sources in an aging society," and have devoted their efforts toward the suppression of social expectation levels vis-a-vis policy benefits. A strategy existed of coexisting with interests politics on the one hand, and forcing declining benefits and rising burdens onto the general population on the other. With the change in administrations, not only did the pressures of interests politics weaken, but also as public opinion polls at the time of the uproar over the people's welfare tax indicated, the majority of the people have begun to think that an increase in the tax burden is unavoidable if it is for the sake of stable social security. It may perhaps be said to be a time for the bureaucrats to rejoice. However, such an environmental change has the potential to destroy the MOF bureaucrats' own position of superiority. First is the limitation to the debate on sound finance. The soundness of finance is not a value per se, but a prerequisite condition for coping with an important policy task. As long as the people display a determination to pay taxes, they have a legitimate right to demand an expansion of necessary policy measures and a reduction of unnecessary measures. In the first place, the authority of the MOF bureaucrats was permitted to rule in a political atmosphere of lesser burdens and greater benefits. Second, there is the timid posture of the MOF bureaucrats regarding a reexamination of the existing annual spending structure. In addition to securing tax revenues, the rationalization of annual expenditures is indispensable for sound finance. However, the MOF bureaucrats have avoided any restructuring of annual spending that takes time and effort politically. Moreover, they have committed the contradiction of investing profits from the sales of NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation] stocks, which should have been applied toward national bond redemption, instead toward such insignificant public service projects as resort development. The myth that "MOF bureaucrats personify the national interest" could probably be demolished by questioning such contradictions from the side of politics. Thus bureaucratic control that seemed to be strengthened at first glance is not rock-firm at all. A break from bureaucratic control becomes possible by the people and the politicians shouldering the real costs of sustaining a welfare state on the one hand, and making clear their intentions concerning policy objectives on the other. Also, the bureaucrats should thus prepare a scenario that includes a plurality of policy measures, and the people should choose from them. Such is the inherent arrangement of democratic politics in action. Point Out Problems Which Are Invisible From Within Amid the present vortex of political party reorganization, terms like "normal nation" and "social democratic liberal" are being bandied about. However, without any viewpoint on the kind of apparatus that will be formed to implement policy decisions, such polemics remain mere symbols without content. Major policy tasks change at intervals of 20 to 30 years, and a reorganization of the political structure itself is demanded in order to accurately respond to such changes. In fact, examples in Europe and the United States show that integration and abolition (reorganization) of central government agencies is not so rare, and it is common for a new administration to firmly implement the scrap-and-build process of the agencies. In this sense the strong continuity of Japan's central government agencies may be regarded as exceptional. It is also a reflection of the long-term continuity of one-party rule on the side of politics, and the lack of concern among the political leaders regarding a structuring of the administrative apparatus. Speaking of creating new politics, it should be the responsibility of the politicians to indicate a medium-term vision, first of all, on what problems they will grapple with and with what kind of administrative organization. A debate on the posture of the bureaucrats often ends in a simple attack on the bureaucrats due to anger against bureaucratism. However, both the administrative organization and policy were initially formed because of social demand, and it is a delicate question as to whether it is pathological or physiological for the bureaucrats to work diligently at their stations and to defend their organizations and budgets. As our experience as individuals proves, it is difficult for us to objectively evaluate our own work. When policy implemented by bureaucrats with a subjectively noble sense of purpose loses its significance amid the eral and environmental changes, and when no one within the existing division-of-labor system notices the important problems that have newly arisen, it is not the responsibility of the bureaucrats themselves but the responsibility of politics to point out such problems. It is a great misfortune for Japan's bureaucrats that all others are virtually nonexistent. Consequently, reform of bureaucratic control is inseparably linked to improvement of competence on the side of politics. Bona Fide Administration With Command Power Necessary The proper relations between politics and administration are divided into the three categories of regulation, cooperation and separation. Regulation exists when the political leaders are in command over the bureaucracy and they check the efficiency and integrity of administration on behalf of the people. Cooperation exists when the response by the politicians to the people's will and the specialized competence of the buraucrats blend together smoothly. Separation means the rule that the authority and financial resources held by the administrative organs are not used to cultivate the power of specific parties or factions. In Japan, the long postwar rule by the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] overlapped with the history of the bureaucrats' position of superiority, and the relationship between politics and administration became complicated. For example, as the "zoku" Dietmen phenomenon indicates, relations between the ruling party and the bureaucracy became intimate and, as a result, the abuses of the bureaucracy such as sectionalism and conservatism moved parallel to the ruling party side. In addition, the cabinet and the ruling party lost their power of leadership and coordination. Also, subsidies and the licensing authority were used to broaden support for the ruling party, resulting in a series of corruption scandals. Consequently, a restructuring of the relations between politics and administration based on the three criteria is urgently necessary. In order to give concrete form to regulation, it is first necessary to strengthen the cabinet as a reservoir of political energy. In Japan, there are numerous cases where the big boss of the ruling party such as Representative Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] devotes himself to party affairs without necessarily becoming a member of the cabinet himself. However, this is a problem from the standpoint of the purpose of the parliamentary cabinet system. First of all, the leading politicians must be convened within the cabinet and a system must be established to lead the bureaucracy. In Japan's previous cabinets, the ministerial posts were offered to the ruling party's politicians as concessions, and it was natural for the cabinet members to be taken lightly by the bureaucrats. It is also important to provide information equally to the Diet members of both the opposition and the ruling party, and thus facilitate checks by the Diet. In order to promote smooth cooperation between politics and administration, it is important to reexamine the practices of the Diet and the government offices which have wasted the inherent capabilities of the bureaucrats. For example, when the Diet is in session, a great many bureaucrats are kept extremely busy drafting interpellations to the Diet members and replies by the cabinet members. If the Diet deliberations are enhanced by debates of quality content between the politicians, the bureaucrats should be able to devote themselves to their inherent duties of policy planning. The abuse of personnel authority seen in the reshuffle of bureau directors at MITI [Ministry of International Trade and Industry] goes against cooperation. In order to maintain separation between politics and administration, it is necessary to strictly observe the recently enacted administrative procedures act and to coordinate interests in administration with fairness. Also, enacting a freedom-of-information act and enhancing transparency in policy planning and its implementation process will serve to prevent corruption. It is also urgently necessary to promote business orders based on fair competition through an improved bidding system. Regarding these points, the self-proclaimed pro-reform group of politicians should aggressively submit problems from the Diet side and take the initiative for concrete system reform. In any case, in order to reexamine the relations between politics and administration, a reform of awareness is indispensable for the politicians who have considered it their supreme proposition to gain access to administrative budgets and authority. It is hoped that, instead of being engrossed in a power game without any ideology, they will grapple with reform with an awareness as members of the same legislative branch of government.
