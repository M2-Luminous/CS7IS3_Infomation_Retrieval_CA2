SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, proposes that the existing land withdrawal made by Public Land Order No. 1413, be continued for a period of 20 years pursuant to section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, U.S.C. 1714 (1988). The lands are described as follows: New Mexico Principal Meridian Gila National Forest Black Range Administrative Site T. 16 S., R. 8 W., Sec. 17, lots 8, 9, 10, and 11 (exclusive of lands included in mineral patent). Mimbres Administrative Site T. 16 S., R. 11 W., Sec. 7, W1/2NE1/4. The areas described aggregate 225.33 acres in Sierra and Grant Counties. The purpose of the withdrawal is to protect the Black Range and Mimbres Administrative Sites in the Gila National Forest. The withdrawal segregates the lands from operation of the public land laws generally, including the mining laws, but not the mineral leasing laws. No change is proposed in the purpose of the withdrawal, but the lands will be opened to surface entry and to such forms of disposition as may by law be made of the National Forest System lands. For a period of 90 days from the date of publication of this notice, all persons who wish to submit comments in connection with the proposed withdrawal continuation may present their views in writing to the State Director in the New Mexico State Office. The authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management will undertake such investigations as are necessary to determine the existing and potential demand for the land and its resources. A report will also be prepared for consideration by the Secretary of the Interior, the President, and the Congress, who will determine whether or not the withdrawal will be continued, and if so, for how long. The final determination on the continuation of the withdrawal will be published in the Federal Register . The existing withdrawal will continue until such final determination is made. Dated: April 14, 1994. Carol L. Sampson, Acting State Director. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9909 Filed 4&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;FB&hyph;M
