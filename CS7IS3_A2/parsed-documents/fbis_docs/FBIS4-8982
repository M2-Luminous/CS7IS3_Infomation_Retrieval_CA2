Many coalition deputies have expressed the opinion that the amendment bill is an element of the game in the current conflict with the Belweder, not a desire to limit the powers of Lech Walesa. However, no one denies that this is what may really happen. There are rumors that the coalition will abandon the idea of amending the Constitution in return for the nomination of Dariusz Rosati. What for What The deputies who signed the bill to amend the Constitution explain officially that the Small Constitution played its role well when all of the authority centers came from the same political camp and the decisions they made showed the goodwill of all of the parties. At a moment when power in the state is wielded by political opponents at the same time, the constitutional provisions make it impossible to find solutions to conflicts. Coalition politicians unofficially admit, however, that the bill is an element of a political game in which various methods are being used. "From a political and moral point of view, this ploy is not the worst one possible," admits one of them, who stresses that right now the dispute between the coalition and the president is not over people but over the political system. "It is being decided whether we will have a presidential system, which the president is trying to achieve through facts, or a parliamentary-cabinet system, as it is stated in the Small Constitution." According to one of the leaders of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], the dispute may only be resolved by a gentlemen's agreement with the president: consent to the nomination of Rosati in return for the coalition's abandoning the idea of introducing its own people into the presidential ministries. If the president "bids higher," the coalition might also introduce into this game the National Council of Radio and Television, even though it is not interested in that for the time being. A bargaining chip is also the bill to amend the Constitution itself. Irrespective of the opinions of the clubs, if two deputies withdraw their signatures from the bill, the bill is no longer valid. For this reason, as was suggested by the SLD's Ryszard Grodzicki, who is supposed to be the reporter of this bill, the initiators did not allow more people to sign this bill. In his opinion, journalists now should not ask the initiators of the bill about its chances in the Sejm or try to figure out what constitutional ploy the president may use to neutralize parliament; they should first of all be interested in the opinion of the ministry on Rakowiecka Street [probable reference to Ministry of Internal Affairs] on this bill. The signatories of the bill stress modestly that it is a bill submitted by some deputies, not the coalition, and it did not have to be agreed on with the clubs' leaders. The SLD's Wladyslaw Zbikowski admits, however, that, in line with the club's regulations, before the bill was actually submitted, the Presidium of the club was informed about it; the Presidium did not oppose it. Grodzicki also suggested that such an initiative would not have been possible without the approval, or at least the knowledge, of the clubs' Presidiums. He also said that the bill was signed by 16 deputies, who are said to be the most recalcitrant deputies in their clubs and who most frequently breach the clubs' discipline. The list of names on the bill suggests, however, that this is not a very accurate opinion. As for the SLD deputies, the bill was signed primarily by deputies from Warsaw, and, as for the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], by those who happened to be in Warsaw. Chances of the Coalition According to the SLD's Bogdan Krysiewicz, there is no definitely antipresidential atmosphere in the club; the possibility of collective madness is also out of the question. "We do not make a decision on supporting or rejecting a bill very hastily. It would be good if the discussion in the club were made in the presence of the president and if both sides submitted their arguments clearly," he claims. Zbikowski believes that the bill will be backed by a definite majority of the club. His parliamentary colleagues are rather critical of the president's statements and decisions. Opinions in the PSL Club are divided, as well. Jan Komornicki believes that the amendment bill will either be rejected in the first reading or be forwarded to the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly and utilized during work on the new Constitution. "No one in the PSL, including the prime minister, wants a war with the president," says Komornicki. Janusz Piechocinski adds that the PSL merely wants stable conditions for the functioning of the government and that the president has not been ensuring that recently. On Wednesday [20 April], during the club's session, Piechocinski will try to persuade the leadership of the club to empower Deputy Speaker Jozef Zych, who is known for his ability to reach compromises and who has not said anything that might offend the dignity of the president, to take on the role of mediator between the coalition and the Belweder. Unlike SLD politicians, Piechocinski claims that the dispute is related to ambition: on whose terms the talks will start. If the bill is voted on, the club will have to take into account the opinion of the PSL Chief Council, which will convene on Saturday. However, if we assume that the bill submitted by the deputies is merely an element of a game, it would be too early to evaluate its chances of being passed. This is confirmed by the opinion of one leftist politician, who said that "if the president manages to persuade two people to withdraw their signatures," the entire issue will no longer be valid. The same politician doubts, however, that the president will accept the invitation to the SLD Club. What Is Going On? The authors of the bill propose amendments to two articles in the Small Constitution: Article 4 and Article 68. The change of the former links the end of the term of office to the day of the first sitting of the new Sejm and obliges the president to order elections no earlier than three months and no later than four months from the dissolution of the Sejm. Deputy Grodzicki claims that, in the case of amending the law, the regulations would probably still include solutions that would make it impossible to launch new legislative initiatives; they would merely allow the work that has already been started to be completed and set in order. The second change would lie in the following: If the president did not change the composition of the Council of Ministers or if he refused to make such a change within seven days of the submission date of the prime minister's motion, he could request such a change--approved by an absolute majority of votes. As a result of the present state, the justification is that key posts may not be filled, which causes negative results for the activities of the government and for its efficiency. According to the authors, this amendment does not aim to limit the president's powers; it makes it possible to overcome a difficult situation, in which the president does not make a change in a ministerial post within seven days or refuses to make it.
