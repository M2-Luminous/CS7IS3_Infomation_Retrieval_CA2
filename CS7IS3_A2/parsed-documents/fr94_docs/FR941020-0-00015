FR941020-0-00015 FR941020-0-00005 In contrast, Hadson contends that the rules have not had a significant adverse effect on the ability of marketing affiliates to compete given the phenomenal success that affiliate marketers have enjoyed. Hadson maintains that the success of the regulations is shown by the reduced number of complaints from state governments, producers, and competing marketers, and it argues that this success is sufficient grounds to make the Order No. 497 rules a part of the permanent regulatory framework. The Commission denies the requests for rehearing. Even with the changes created by Order No. 636, the pipelines still retain an economic incentive to favor their affiliates, since such preferences may increase the overall profitability of the parent corporation. Although the unbundling of pipeline gas sales from transportation service has created a more competitive gas market, this competition has not eliminated the pipelines' incentives to favor their affiliates. Pipelines can still provide their affiliates with competitive advantages by giving them preferential access to transportation information or to discounts or other transportation benefits. Similarly, while the capacity release mechanism has created competition between released capacity and the pipelines' firm and interruptible capacity, the industry has not even had a year's experience with capacity release, so evidence of how it will affect the pipeline's control over transportation service is still unknown. The pipelines assert that the regulations are unnecessary because the Commission's Part 284 regulations already prohibit undue discrimination and that the Standards of Conduct and reporting requirements are therefore duplicative. Although the Part 284 regulations do prohibit undue discrimination, these regulations do not establish the mechanisms, included in the affiliate regulations, to help ensure that non-affiliates are treated equally with affiliates and to provide for public and Commission monitoring of affiliate transactions. Given the special relationship between pipelines and their marketing affiliates and the pipelines' incentive to favor affiliates, the additional protection provided by the affiliate regulations is necessary. In addition, the pipelines claim that the regulations should be removed since there has been little evidence of favoritism to affiliates so the regulations place unnecessary burdens on the ability of affiliates to compete and create needless reporting burdens. Even with the current regulations, the Commission has received complaints of affiliates abuses. Using the number of complaints is an uncertain indicator of whether the regulations need to be continued, since the presence of the Standards of Conduct and the public scrutiny created by the reporting requirements may have had the desired prophylactic effect and decreased the extent of potential problems which otherwise might have occurred. In the final rule, the Commission significantly reduced the burdens created by the tariff and reporting requirements. The regulations that remain do not create such undue burdens on the pipelines or their affiliates that rescission is warranted, given the pipelines' continuing incentives to favor affiliates. These regulations strike a reasonable balance between prevention of pipeline favoritism towards affiliates and the competitive and reporting burdens claimed by the pipelines and affiliates. For example, the Standards of Conduct do nothing more than require the pipelines to provide to non-affiliates the same information and discounts the pipelines provide to affiliates by posting such information on EBBs. Such disclosure does not prevent the affiliates from competing; it merely ensures that all relevant transportation information is provided in a public forum so competition between affiliates and non-affiliates can take place on an even basis. Moreover, since pipelines are required to operate EBBs by ยง284.8 (b)(4) and (5), the additional burden of posting affiliate information is not great. The Commission will not impose a sunset date for the reporting requirements. The Commission's review of the Order No. 497 requirements in this rule resulted in a significant reduction in the reporting requirements: pipelines now are required to post and maintain a simple log of contract data used to allocate capacity only if they use such data, and to maintain a limited amount of information concerning transportation discounts provided to affiliates and non-affiliates. Given this reduction in burden, the Commission does not find that the administrative burdens created by establishment of a sunset date are now appropriate, especially since the Commission is unable to determine when it will have sufficient information to reevaluate its reporting requirements. The Commission, however, is committed to undertaking such a reevaluation when the industry has obtained sufficient experience operating in the restructured environment. IV. Standard F Standard F requires the pipelines to disclose contemporaneously to all shippers transportation information provided to affiliates. The Panhandle Pipelines argue that this Standard is no longer needed, because, due to the capacity release and flexible receipt and delivery point authority created by Order No. 636, customers control access to capacity, not the pipelines. The Commission, however, fails to discern how the ability of customers to exercise greater control over the use of their capacity would lessen the effect of a pipeline providing important transportation information to an affiliate, but withholding the information from the rest of the market. As an example, a pipeline's advance notice of curtailment plans could permit an affiliate to make alternate transportation arrangements so that it can continue to provide uninterrupted service, while shippers without advance notice may be at a disadvantage in attempting to make such alternate plans. 14 14 The affiliate, for instance, could lock-up alternate receipt or delivery points before other shippers are aware of the need to change points.
