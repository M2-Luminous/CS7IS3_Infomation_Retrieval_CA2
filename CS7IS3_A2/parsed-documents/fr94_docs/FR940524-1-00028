FR940524-1-00028 FR940524-1-00009 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Parts 671, 672, and 675 [I.D. 051794B] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area; King and Tanner Crab Fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of availability of amendments to fishery management plans; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this notice that the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 30 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), Amendment 27 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area, and Amendment 3 to the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands for Secretarial review and is requesting comments from the public. These amendments would incorporate the provisions of the North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan (Research Plan) into each FMP. The intended effect of these amendments is to provide a standard application of the Research Plan and associated observer coverage throughout applicable fisheries. DATES: Comments on the FMP amendments must be received by July 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the FMP amendments should be submitted to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802 (Attn: Lori Gravel), or delivered to the Federal Building, 709 West 9th Street, Juneau, AK. Copies of the amendments and the environmental assessment/regulatory impact review prepared for the North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan (Research Plan) are available from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, AK 99510; (telephone: 907&hyph;271&hyph;2809). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ronald J. Berg, at 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management Council submit any FMP or FMP amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an FMP or amendment, immediately publish a notice that the FMP or amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments received during the comment period in determining whether to approve the FMP or amendment. Amendments 30, 27, and 3 would revise language in the FMPs for GOA groundfish, Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area groundfish, and Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands king and Tanner crab, respectively, to reflect the development of the Research Plan and to indicate that observer requirements under those FMPs are as specified under the Research Plan. The Research Plan was prepared by the Council under section 313 of the Magnuson Act, as amended by section 404 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, Public Law 102&hyph;582, and is intended to provide an industry-funded observer program and to promote management, conservation, and scientific understanding of groundfish, halibut, and crab resources off Alaska. The proposed Research Plan, that was submitted for Secretarial review on March 31, 1994 would: (1) Require that observers be stationed on fishing vessels engaged in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish and on U.S. fish processors fishing for or processing species under the authority of the Council, except salmon, including the Northern Pacific halibut fishery, for the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation, management, and scientific understanding of fisheries under the Council's authority; and (2) establish a system of fees to pay for the costs of implementing the Research Plan. A proposed rule to implement the Research Plan was published in the Federal Register on May 6, 1994 (59 FR 23664); additional details of the Research Plan may be found in the proposed rule. Because Amendments 30, 27, and 3 are non-regulatory in nature, no proposed rule will be published to implement them. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: May 19, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
