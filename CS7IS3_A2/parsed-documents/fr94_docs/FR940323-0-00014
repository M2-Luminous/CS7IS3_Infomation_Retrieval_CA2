FR940323-0-00014 FR940323-0-00007 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AGL&hyph;25] Establishment of Class E Airspace; Oscoda, MI AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action is to establish Class E airspace by correcting the current airspace reference for Oscoda, MI from Class D to Class E2. A Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed at Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the recently established SIAP. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 U.T.C., June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert J. Woodford, Manager, System Management Branch, AGL&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, 2300 East Devon Avenue, Des Plaines, Illinois, 60018, telephone 708&hyph;294&hyph;7568. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On December 27, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Oscoda, MI (58 FR 68328). An Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) has been installed at the Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport that will continuously provide weather data, and a non-federal VOR SIAP has been established. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed to contain IFR operations at the airport. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Minor changes were made to the legal description to correct the geographical coordinates for Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport and to accurately identify this Class E airspace as operating continuously by deleting the last two sentences in referencing to publication of specific hours. Other than these editorial changes, this amendment is the same at that proposed in the notice. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E2 airspace at Oscoda, MI, to provide controlled airspace to the surface for aircraft executing the VOR SIAP into the Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.
