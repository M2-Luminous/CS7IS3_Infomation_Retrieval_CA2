The APF released a statement detailing the alliance's political goals and structure. Following is the statement's full text: In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The key goals of the APF: The political goals include proceeding from the necessity to keep the struggle going in order to topple the Gaza-Jericho accord and realize our people's and the Arab and Islamic nation's objectives, the alliance obligates itself to the following: First, on the Palestinian front: 1. The Palestinian National Charter. 2. Our people's inalienable rights to their homeland, Palestine, liberation, return, self-determination, and full national independence. 3. The Palestinian issue is an Arab and Islamic one. The responsibility for the deliverance of Palestine must be borne by the Arab and Islamic nation, most of all the Palestinian people. 4. Our people's and territory's unity and that of their cause and objectives and their national destiny and adherence to all their national and historic rights. No one has the right to cede any part of these rights. 5. Adherence to the option of armed struggle and jihad as a principal tool to attain liberation. 6. Adherence to the unity of the Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied homeland as well as the integrity of their land. 7. The alliance deems the PLO a national achievement whose gains must be safeguarded and institutions rebuilt on democratic foundations. 8. The alliance deems the present PLO leadership unrepresentative of the Palestinian people or their hopes and aspirations. 9. The alliance deems the recognition document and the 'Arafat- Rabin agreement national treason that all possible means must be used to topple. Neither the document nor the agreement are binding on the Palestinian people. 10. Adherence to Palestine as a historic homeland that has no alternative for the Palestinian people, and resistance to all projects of a substitute homeland or resettlement, transfer, compensation, or attempts to suppress the Palestinian people's national identity. 11. Boycotting the political, administrative institutions responsible for implementing the self-administration and the Gaza-Jericho accord and the holding of elections for the self- administration council, and organizing the widest possible popular campaign to isolate, ostracize, and topple these institutions. 12. Severing links with all the institutions that 'Arafat or his team lead or are involved in under the name of the PLO. 13. A determination to pursue and step up armed struggle and all forms of political and mass struggle, particularly inside the occupied territory to keep the popular intifadah going as the main arena of conflict with the Zionist enemy to promote the inalienable, historic and national rights of the Palestinian people. Second, on the Arab and Islamic fronts: 1. A reaffirmation that the Palestinian cause is the core of the Arab-Zionist conflict. 2. Taking into consideration that the dangers attendant to the 'Arafat-Rabin accord are not limited to the Palestinian people and Palestine but constitute a threat to the Arab and Islamic nation, the APF would like to make it clear that facing this liquidatory conspiracy and its repercussions is a responsibility for the Palestinian people and Arab and Muslim masses. 3. A bolstering of joint Palestinian-Arab-Muslim militant ties to counter Zionist and expansionist hegemonic blueprints and political, cultural, and economic normalization. 4. A reaffirmation of the right of the Palestinian people in the diaspora to exercise their militant responsibilities alongside the nationalist, Islamic, and Arab forces to promote liberation, return, self-determination, and full national independence. Third, on the global front: 1. The role being played by the United States supporting the Zionist entity and advocating its plans against our Palestinian people and their struggle and the Arab liberation movement is deemed by the alliance a brazen aggression on our people and our national cause. 2. The APF underscores the importance of stepping up cooperation with the Islamic, Asian, and African states, as well as with all the friendly nations standing by the struggle of our Palestinian people and supporting their inalienable national rights. 3. We stress the importance of forging an alliance with all the forces for liberation and progress around the world -- the forces that reject imperialist domination and Zionist invasion and support our struggle and our national rights. 4. To work to disseminate all that relates to the Palestinian cause and the national struggle to win the widest possible public opinion over to the cause of our struggle and our rights and to make the case that the 'Arafat-Rabin agreement neither amounts to a solution nor brings peace. The alliance's structure: Inspired by its political goals, the APF is to form a Central Command, which will be responsible for formulating its decisions, policies, and political goals: A -- The numerical composition: Each faction will have two representatives on the APF's Central Command. B -- The meetings: The Central Command is to convene sessions at least once a month. This is in addition to extraordinary meetings that may be convened at the request of at least four factions. Decisions are to be adopted by agreement [bittawafuq], and the meetings are to be chaired on a rotating basis. C -- A Secretariat is to be set up for the APF and each faction will have one representative there. It will convene at least once a week, or whenever the need arises.
