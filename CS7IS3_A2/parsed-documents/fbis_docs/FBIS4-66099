"The United States, even more than usual, does not seem to be following a steady compass," the London-based group said in its annual review of world security issues. In one of the strongest indictments of Mr Clinton's failings, the report said he had been "blowing a very uncertain foreign-policy trumpet." The United States seemed to want, not security guarantees like the countries of Eastern Europe, but a guarantee of its own security policy, it said. The report, published yesterday, said: "By the end of the year, the U.S. was insisting on no open-ended commitments, assurance of victory without casualties, and an exit strategy. These are awesome guarantees to ask for in todays uncertain world. It took a few American deaths during the humanitarian aid mission to Somalia to convince Mr Clinton that if the Somalis would not play the game, "it was time to gather up his marbles and go home. At least Somalia was left "somewhat better off." In Haiti, however, the "dubious U.S. policy" had left the country worse off The report said Washington was guilty of an "extraordinary show of ineptitude." After sending a few lightly armed troops to back up Washington's policy of returning the elected President to run the country in place of "the thugs in the military who had deposed him, the ship carrying the American unit was ordered to turn round and go back. The report also noted the "dangerous implications" of Russia's recent forays on to the world stage, particularly in the Balkans and former Soviet republics. Russian influence in helping to persuade the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina to remove their heavy weapons from Sarajevo had been effective. It has, however, given the Russians a degree of influence in the former Yugoslavia that it has not had since Stalin lost control there in 1948. No settlement of the crisis in the area is possible now without Russian participation and full agreement. More worrying than Moscow's action in Bosnia was the reassertion of Russian nationalist zeal towards the so-called "near abroad," the former Soviet republics. The term, as used by the Russians, indicated Moscow did not accept that the states which "rose from the rubble of the Soviet Union" were fully independent. Moscow seemed intent on ensuring that these states acted "only with Russian interests and desires in mind. If need be, it would meddle in their business," even militarily to ensure this outcome and the West seems willing to accept this state of affairs with little demur. On the eve of a NATO Defence Ministers' meeting in Brussels, at which Pavel Grachev, the Russian Defence Minister, is expected to tell his Western counterparts what Moscow wants from the alliance, the survey said Nato governments were finding it difficult to choose between the demands of Russia and those of central and eastern Europe.
