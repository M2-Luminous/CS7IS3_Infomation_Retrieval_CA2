Shukla] [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 7 -- Armed forces of Pakistan and the U.S. have begun a five-week-long joint exercise in the rugged mountains north of Peshawar. The objectives include preparing both Pakistani and American troops for highly-specialised high-altitude warfare, say military experts here. It is learnt that 150 U.S. commandos arrived in Islamabad on Thursday [January 6] to commence the exercises. Besides imparting training to their Pakistani counterparts, U.S. troops, too, will gain considerable experience in high-altitude warfare from these exercises, since the terrain chosen is ideal for this purpose. Military observers in Delhi have expressed concern that the expertise gained by Pakistani troops from these exercises could have a bearing on the future of the Siachen dispute. However, it is learnt that last year also a similar joint exercise was conducted. Its continuance for a second year in succession is indicative of the U.S.'s growing military cooperation with Pakistan, experts say. Highly-placed sources here said that the Americans have clarified that not many U.S. soldiers are participating in the mutual training scheme and too much significance should not be attached to the matter. It has, however, been confirmed that troops belonging to certain special units of the U.S. Central Command will be taking part in the programme which is being conducted on the southern slopes of the mighty Hindukush ranges. Sources here also revealed that the Chief of Army Staff, Gen B.C. Joshi, had advised his senior officers not to get unduly alarmed over this development. The Indian Air Force is also learnt to share this perception. Yet, coming in the wake of a succession of anti-lndian statements from the Clinton Administration and given its clear "tilt" towards Pakistan in South Asian affairs, many officials in Delhi are understandably worried by the latest development which comes just after the failure of the Foreign Secretary level talks between India and Pakistan. A source in the Army, however, discounted the possibility of Pakistan being able to overrun Indian positions in the Siachen glacier with the help of U.S. training. "We are considered Number One in high altitude warfare by one and all," he said. He pointed out that past efforts by Pakistan to spring a surprise on Indian positions in Siachen (where temperatures range between 40 and 50 degrees below zero) had been effectively beaten back. Both the Pakistani army and air force got a bloody nose in their attempt to dislodge Indians from their militarily superior position on the glacier. Military experts here feel that the joint high altitude exercise could, nevertheless, be mutually beneficial. The U.S. Army may be aiming for combat readiness for such warfare in view of changing geo-political realities in mountainous Central Asia. Both Pakistan and the U.S. have a strong interest in the region in today's post-USSR scenario. The entire region has become volatile and politically unstable following the carving out of independent, mainly Islamic, republics. Clearly, the Americans see Central Asia as a potential trouble spot for the future and want to be in readiness to face any eventuality.
