FR941017-2-00116 FR941017-2-00066 Since substantially all of the NCP purchase price has heretofore been funded with a cash capital contribution from GPU, EII now proposes to use the proceeds of the sale of the Notes from time to time in its general business activities, and, in particular: (i) to fund preliminary project development and administrative activities in connection with EII's investments in QFs and small power production facilities, and defined in PURPA, and EWGs and foreign utility companies (``FUCOs''), as defined in Section 33 of the Act, as may be authorized in File No. 70&hyph;7727; (ii) to acquire securities or other interests in QFs, EWGs or FUCOs, provided, however, that EII will not, without prior Commission authorization, acquire (a) an interest in a QF (which is not also an LWG) or (b) except as may be permitted by Commission rule, regulation or order, an indirect ownership interest in a FUCO (which is not also an EWG); and (iii) to reimburse GPU for a portion of its funding of the NCP purchase price. EUA Cogenex Corporation (70&hyph;8473) EUA Cogenex Corporation (``Cogenex''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eastern Utilities Associates (``EUA''), both at P.O. Box 2333, Boston, Massachusetts 02107, a registered holding company, has filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 12(c) of the Act and Rules 43, 45, 46 and 54 thereunder. Cogenex now requests authorization to form and acquire a subsidiary company for the purpose of acquiring certain assets of a company engaged in related business activities and funding those activities. Specifically, authorization is now sought for: (1) Cogenex to form and acquire a wholly-owned subsidiary to be named EUA Citizens Conservation Services, Inc. (``CCS''); (2) for CCS to issue common stock to Cogenex; (3) for Cogenex to acquire such common stock from CCS; (4) for Cogenex to make loans to CCS; (5) for CCS to issue notes to Cogenex to evidence such loans; (6) for CCS to issue preferred stock; (7) for CCS to redeem such preferred stock pursuant to the terms thereof; (8) for CCS to acquire certain assets of Citizens Conservation Corporation (``CCC''), a nonaffiliated,tax-exempt Massachusetts corporation; and, (9) for CCS to assume certain liabilities from CCC. It is stated that CCS will primarily specialize in energy services for residential multi-family housing. The services will include energy audits, technical assistance to owners/residents regarding energy costs and end uses, assistance with financing projects, and energy performance contracting similar to the services Cogenex currently provides to its commercial and institutional customers. CCS will also contract directly with utilities to implement residential low-income multi-family demand-side management programs and will provide program design consultation to utilities, governments and private entities. The initial authorized capitalization of CCS shall be 200,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, and 7,500 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value (``Preferred Stock''). Cogenex requests authorization: for CCS to issue and for Cogenex to acquire 10,000 shares of CCS' common stock at a purchase price of $100; and for CCS to issue to CCC 7,500 shares of the Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock shall be issued to CCC in exchange for, and Cogenex requests authority for: the transfer of certain assets of CCC to CCS, including the rights to prospective business opportunities of CCC, and the rights to contracts to which CCC is a party, pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between Cogenex and CCC dated September 2, 1994 (regarding the proposed acquisition of certain of CCC's assets), and the goodwill associated with such assets (``Assets''); and CCC entering into a noncompete and cooperation agreement with CCS. Cogenex also requests authority for CCS to assume the obligations of CCC with respect to the Assets. It is stated that the acquisition of the Assets will allow Cogenex to indirectly expand its customer base by, among other things, entering into the public housing sector and will provide the public housing sector with the benefit of Cogenex's experience and expertise in energy conservation and management. Cogenex anticipates a synergistic relationship with CCS whereby CCS will provide a new outlet for the services and products of EUA Day and EUA NOVA (both divisions of Cogenex) and for the engineering services of Cogenex. The Preferred Stock shall be non-redeemable until January 1, 2002 or upon the seventh anniversary of the execution of the definitive agreement (``Definitive Agreement'') between Cogenex, CCS and CCC (which shall fully set forth the terms and conditions of CCS' acquisition of CCC's Assets), whichever is later. Upon such date, the Preferred Stock may be redeemed at Cogenex's sole discretion at a redemption price equal to $100 per share plus then-accrued dividends, if any, plus an additional amount, if any, determined in accordance with a specific formula. The Preferred Stock shall be entitled to an annual dividend per share at a rate equal to 33% of the net income of CCS divided by 7,500. The Preferred Stock dividends shall be paid annually when and as declared by the board of directors of CCS, but not later than June 30th of the calendar year in which they are to be paid. The first such year for which dividends shall be paid shall be the year ending December 31, 1995. Dividends shall be noncumulative and shall be paid only from current earnings, if any. Authorization is also requested: (i) for Cogenex to make loans to CCS in an aggregate amount not to exceed $5 million outstanding at any one time for the purpose of funding the development of projects (``Development Loans''); (ii) for CCS to issue notes to Cogenex for the Development Loans; (iii) for Cogenex to make loans to CCS in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.5 million outstanding at any one time for working capital purposes (``Working Capital Loans''); and (ii) for CCS to issue notes to Cogenex for the Working Capital Loans. The aggregate amount outstanding at any one time for the Development Loans and the Working Capital Loans combined shall not exceed $7.5 million. Provision of credit shall be made at Cogenex's sole discretion and shall be provided upon such terms, conditions and rates as is customarily provided to affiliates of Cogenex. The Development Loans, and the Working Capital Loans shall (i) mature within twelve months of their issuance and be renewable from time to time (ii) be prepayable in whole or in part without penalty and (iii) shall earn interest at a rate equal to the lesser of Cogenex's short-term borrowing costs or the prime rate on the date of issuance. The source of this financing will be short-term borrowings by Cogenex under the EUA system's existing bank lines of credit, internally generated cash, repayment of funds advanced to CCS, proceeds of future long-term debt to be issued by Cogenex and/or purchases of stock, capital contributions, loans and/or advances by EUA previously authorized, or to be authorized, by the Commission. CCS shall repay the Development Loans and the Working Capital Loans from internally generated funds, permanent project financing and the issuance of additional notes for Development Loans and Working Capital Loans, as authorized under this application-declaration. CCS shall not incur any indebtedness in the form of permanent project financing, nor use the proceeds thereof for the purpose of repaying Cogenex, without first obtaining Commission authorization. Cogenex is currently restricted to earning less than 50% of its revenues from outside New England and New York (``50% Restriction''). CCS' revenues will be subject to the 50% Restriction just like any other aspect of Cogenex's business (other than revenues from qualifying cogeneration facility projects, as defined in the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended, and consulting revenues, which revenues are not included in the calculation for the 50% Restriction); however, Cogenex states that revenues received by CCS through the service agreement it will enter into with CCC will not be included in the calculation for the 50% Restriction. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
