Meeting with visiting Australian Governor-General Bill Hayden at the Great Hall of the People here this afternoon, Qiao praised the positive contributions that Hayden has made in past years for the promotion of Sino-Australian ties. He said that the two countries have had effective exchanges and cooperation since they were linked diplomatically. Qiao noted that in recent years the exchanges between the parliaments of the two countries have grown rapidly, adding that there are also frequent exchanges between the legislative bodies of Chinese provinces and Australian states. "At the beginning of this month we received a delegation from the foreign affairs, trade and defence committees of the australian parliament, and a Chinese NPC delegation headed by Vice-Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Tian Jiyun will visit Australia soon. These events would contribute to further development of Sino- Australian relations and friendship of the two peoples," Qiao said. The NPC chairman pointed out that China and Australia, both in the Pacific region, are complementary in their economies. China is willing to forge deeper and closer cooperative ties with Australia on the basis of the peaceful co-existance, equality and mutual benefit, he stressed. Qiao also briefed Hayden on the work of the npc and the construction of China's socialist market economy. Hayden expressed thanks for the warm reception he has met in China. He said he was pleased with the achievements gained in Australia- China economic cooperation, which he described as "instrumental" to the two countries and as "favorable factors" for the economic development and political stability of the Asia-Pacific region.
