The fact that enterprises put into practice the shareholding system is one of the major forms of establishing a modern enterprise system. China has already experimented with joint-stock enterprises for several years and made new beneficial explorations for China's enterprise system. Recently, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, the State Economic and Trade Commission, and the State Securities Commission jointly organized personnel to conduct surveys of some listed companies in some areas. The report written by a staff reporter and released today gives an idea of the surveys, the experience gained, and the new problems raised for everyone's reference. Since China's economic restructuring has shifted from rural areas to cities, the vitality of state-owned enterprises, especially large and medium-sized enterprises, has been a central question with which we have always been concerned. What is the next step for deepening state-owned enterprises following the contracted responsibility system? Precisely against this background, the shareholding system was put forward. In October 1987, the report to the 13th CPC National Congress pointed out that "the forms of the shareholding system emerging in the course of reform, including the form whereby the state holds most of the shares, departments, localities, and enterprises hold some shares, and individuals can buy shares, is an organizational form for the property of socialist enterprises and can be experimented with continuously." Since then, the number of experimental joint-stock enterprises in various localities has increased rapidly. At present, there are some 5,000 joint-stock enterprises across the country, nearly 200 of which have their shares traded on the market. As an organizational form of modern enterprise, the shareholding system is developing rapidly in China. Of course, this kind of development is still proceeding in an experimental stage. What people are concerned about is the question of whether or not the objective of deepening enterprise reform has been achieved after these experimental enterprises have been put into operation. If so, in what aspects is this reflected? It Offers a Sharp Knife With Which To Separate Functions of the Government From Those of the Enterprise and a Foundation Stone on Which the Enterprise May Operate Independently. Now That the Enterprise as a Legal Body Possesses Property Rights, Its Numerous Relations With the Government Are Self-Evident, and Only By Being So, Can the Enterprise Operate Independently With Perfect Assurance. The idea for state-owned enterprise reform in recent years has basically been the delegation of administrative powers. Power delegation involves two questions: First, the concept of power delegation itself is not the negation of the system of excessively concentrating the powers of the enterprise in the hands of the government. Therefore, power delegation is only limited, and an enterprise cannot change its status as a subsidiary of the government despite power delegation. Second, precisely because of the reasons mentioned above, there is a comparatively large degree of haphazardness in the government with regard to power delegation. It happens that when instructed to delegate power, the government will do so and that over time, it will recover the power delegated or that it will not delegate power unless this is beneficial to it. With regard to the government's delegation of power, the enterprise is totally in a passive and subordinate status and the functions of the government and of the enterprise are ultimately inseparable. Now that the assets of the enterprise are owned by the government and its managers are appointed by the government, what can an enterprise base its independent operation on? Between August and September 1993, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, the State Securities Commission, and the State Economic and Trade Commission jointly conducted special surveys of how listed companies in Shenzhen, Hainan, Shanghai, and Sichuan, where state-owned joint-stock enterprises are more concentrated, was changing their operation mechanisms. The surveys reported that by straightening out the relationship between ownership and management, the listed companies have smashed the traditional trammels of being subordinate to the government and have succeeded in separating their functions from those of the government and are able to operate independently. This is mainly reflected by the following: They have straightened out the relationship of interests with the government and have changed from being solely responsible to their supervisory departments to being responsible to all shareholders. The enterprises turn over taxes to the state and profits to owners, thus separating taxes from profits. They have complete rights over the use of assets. They have changed the previous practice of having their leaders appointed by the government and then hired by the board of directors. Regarding their investment decisions and project development, their board of directors will first put forward investment proposals and then decisions will be made by the meeting of shareholders. In this way, the enterprises have the power to operate independently and have money at their disposal. Managers of the listed companies share a common feeling, namely that they have all the 14 powers to be delegated to enterprises according to the "Regulations," although they find it difficult to refuse contributing to relevant quarters. This is incomparable with the past before the system was changed. In early November 1993, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, State Economic and Trade Commission, and State Securities Commission jointly called a symposium on the question of how listed companies are changing their management mechanisms and they had this common consensus: Listed companies are leading the way in changing management mechanisms. Given the same enterprises and the same government, why has the relationship between the government and enterprises been so easily straightened out after enterprise transformation with the shareholding system and why was it difficult for the enterprise to operate independently in the past before it was transformed with the shareholding system? He Zhongze, who is deputy director of the Enterprise Department of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, and who is currently under training as assistant manager of the Hainan Chemical Fiber Industry Company Limited, said: "Under the traditional form of ownership, the ownership of state property is not clearly defined, so all government departments can exercise the power of ownership on behalf of the state to interfere with the internal affairs of the enterprise. Nevertheless, all of the departments can shirk responsibility for the increase of the value of state assets. If ownership is theoretically unclear, it is of course impossible to define what belongs to whom in practice." Before changing to the shareholding system, the Hainan Chemical Fiber Industry Company Limited was a venture jointly developed by three companies which included the Hainan Provincial Development and Construction Corporation. This type of joint venture ought to have a certain degree of independence with respect to management mechanism compared with ordinary state-owned enterprises. But since the three controlling parties were state-owned enterprises, and since they employed different forms of investment in the joint venture, powers, responsibilities, and interests over the assets of the joint venture were not clearly defined, the three cooperative parties continually had conflicts with one another in the course of its management. In the course of transforming the joint venture, on the basis of scientific assets evaluation, the ownership of its stock assets was reasonably defined, several other legal bodies were invited to join as shareholders, and shares were issued to staff and workers internally, thus defining the property rights of all the assets of the joint venture in the form of law and setting multiple restrictions on the share powers of corporate and individual shareholders. The number of shares one holds determines one's power and say in the enterprise. Each party sends its own directors to the board of directors in keeping with the number of shares held. All shareholders, whether of the enterprise or the state, can only demonstrate their own will during the process of policymaking through the directors they have sent to the board. They cannot directly demand the managers obey their own commands. Moreover, since the managers are appointed by the board of directors, the general manager is solely responsible to the board, but not to the government or to a particular shareholder. Precisely because of this restricted relationship of responsibilities, powers, and profits established on the foundation of clearly defined property rights, interference from outside the enterprise is out of the question and the solicitation of instructions from higher authorities in the course of the enterprise's policymaking is unnecessary. Therefore, since practicing the shareholding system, the Hainan Chemical Fiber Industry Company Limited has all policymaking power within the enterprise and there is basically no interference from government departments. Shenzhen's Jintian Industries Company Limited cited such a fact: In 1987, the company vied with other state-owned enterprises to buy a newly built industrial plant in Liantang, Shenzhen. But before these state- owned enterprises' reports to their supervisory departments were approved, Jintian Company's board of directors had already acquired possession of the plant. For some time after Sichuan's Emeishan Salt Industry Group of Companies Limited changed to the shareholding system, the government departments concerned continued to manage the company's manpower and financial and material resources with the previous way of managing state-owned enterprises. Then the company's general manager Li Jianwen made representations to the departments concerned and these government departments decided very quickly to delegate all powers, changing administrative interference to participation in policymaking. On previous occasions of power delegation, enterprises could do nothing when they did not really get the power. But why did the government departments really delegate power this time? The reason was: Under the traditional system, an enterprise asking for power from the government meant sharing its power. The government was above the enterprise and so the latter was a "beggar." Now the government is only a shareholder of the enterprise and if it seizes all its power, it infringes on the interests of other shareholders. The enterprise asks for power from the government in order to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of other shareholders, and in asking for power, this has a completely different meaning from the past. Now government departments are no longer faced with several factory managers and secretaries whom they could dismiss and hire at their discretion in the past, but with other investors who are on the same footing as they. Sometimes, the balance of interests has a stronger binding force than the government does. The Publicly Listed Company Accepts the Supervision of the Community and the Public and Is At All Time Under Great Pressure from Investor Demands for Higher Returns. It Cannot But Exercise Control Over Itself. It Cannot But Consider Matters From the Long-Term Perspective. It Cannot But Gear Itself to the Needs of the Market. It Cannot But Compete. The General Manager Said: We Are Under Too Great Pressure. People in Shenzhen know that the Jintian Company is very successful and the bosses of the company should naturally make very good profits. Nevertheless, the first sentence the company president Cai Mingxi said to the survey team sent from the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, State Economic and Trade Commission, and State Securities Commission: To be honest, none of us wish to work for joint-stock companies, especially listed companies. The pressure is too great! The pressure coming from the public on listed companies is several times greater than that coming from government supervisory departments on state-owned enterprises! The Shenzhen Teli Machinery and Electricity Company Limited was transformed from the former Shenzhen Machinery Industry Company which was derived from the Shenzhen City Industry Bureau. Before adopting the shareholding system, it consisted of four state-owned enterprises and was given the annual profit target of over one million yuan and allowed to retain the remaining profits. The incomes of its staff and workers increased each year, so both the company and outside quarters were all satisfied. The situation is greatly different now that the company has adopted the shareholding system. After turning over taxes, the enterprise can only retain 15 percent of its profits as a welfare fund and another 50 percent as bonus dividends to shareholders. If less than the due amounts of dividends are given, the shareholders call up all day and asking what is going on. In the past, the enterprise emphasized stable operations. But this year, it is only expected to perform better than last year. Now it not only has to stress stability but must continuously forge ahead because the shareholders make comparisons. They demand that its profits be not lower than last year and not lower than others', or else the president would look bad when the mid-year and annual reports are given. Fang Shimao, chairman of the board of the company, said: In the past, if the company failed to complete the tasks, all we had to do was explain the objective reasons to the departments concerned and then we would be able to stay out of trouble. But now, the shareholders will not accept explanations but will force you to resign. It happened in the Shenzhen Anda Company Limited that in the first half of 1991, the company called a meeting of shareholders at which the shareholders unanimously insisted on the resignation of its general manager. There was only one reason for this, that was the bonus dividend allotted to them in the first half of the year was too low, with only 0.2 yuan given for each share, which fell below the average profit margin of joint-stock companies in Shenzhen at that time. The then general manager had gone through observations by relevant departments and was found to be "competent," so the holder of state shares, the biggest shareholder, hesitated about whether or not to dismiss him and hire another person. As a result, many shareholders sold the warrants of the enterprise's enlarged number of shares, causing them to fall to 0.05 yuan per warrant and thus forcing the biggest shareholder to dismiss the general manager. In 1992, the bonus dividend for each share came to 0.85 yuan. As an enterprise without a higher authority over it, the joint- stock company must accept supervision from three quarters: First, by shareholders; second, by intermediary organizations in society; and third, by public opinion. The three quarters of supervision are mutually supplemental to a certain degree, enabling the joint-stock enterprise to possess an innately perfect self-restricting mechanism. Two major problems in connection with the management of state-owned enterprises were unresolved for a long time, namely their short-term behavior and making undetected losses. These two phenomena will almost not occur in the joint-stock enterprise. As the decisionmaker of the enterprise, the board of directors which represents the interests of shareholders is right in the enterprise, whereas the state-owned enterprise's supervisory department which has the final decisionmaking power is far from the enterprise, so the enterprise finds it very easy to deceive or hide the facts from the owners. However, the management activities of the managing body headed by the general manager is always under the supervision of the board of directors. Judging from the actual situation of joint- stock enterprises across the country, their boards of directors are basically comprised of directors sent from big shareholders. The interests of big shareholders are long-term interests, and they do not allow the managing body to seek short-term gain by means of sharing the enterprise's equipment with others. Still less will they allow the method of dividing and using up the profits to please floating speculating shareholders. Moreover, it is impossible for the managing body to seek short-term gain because short-term behavior weakens the competitiveness of the enterprise, and its harm will surely be manifested in the following year or two. Moreover, shareholders demand that the enterprise makes continually increasing profits. Ultimately the managers can hardly escape being held accountable to the shareholders. We can say, therefore, that there is no incentive for short-term behavior from the decisionmakers to the managers of a joint-stock enterprise. The accounting office checks the mid-yearly and annual accounting reports and figures of the enterprise against its accounts and then publishes the results of the checks to shareholders and assume legal responsibility for the results. Fang Shimao, chairman of the board of directors of the Shenzhen Teli Machinery and Electricity Company Limited, said: It was completely at my own discretion to report profits in the past, that means, when I wished to turn over more, then I reported more, and when I wished to turn over less I reported less. Now I cannot do this. I must report the exact profits or losses and the accounting office will not allow you to "report more or less," and it is more difficult to deal with than the supervisory department in the past. As managers, you cannot use the trick of reporting unnoticed losses, and you find this unnecessary. You can no longer drift along today, and then quit and take up a similar position elsewhere tomorrow. You will ultimately be held "accountable" tomorrow by the owners even if you hide yourself elsewhere. Public opinion will make you lose your prestige in society. Precisely because of the pressure coming from the several areas, listed joint-stock enterprises generally have a sound financial management system. Many enterprises practice a financial management supervision system in which all financial supervisors and other key financial staff are directly sent from headquarters to their subsidiary companies, and their salaries and bonuses are all approved and paid by the headquarters to facilitate the effective management of the finances of subsidiary companies. Shen Yigang, the general financial director of Shenzhen's Jintian Company, said: "The financial transparence of listed joint-stock companies is one of their greatest characteristics. The half-yearly financial report and business performance bulletin are unavoidable responsibilities and obligations. Shareholders can query the business status of the company at all times and by all forms. Therefore, if managerial personnel at all levels of the company do not make great efforts to restrict themselves and boost economic returns, they cannot justify themselves at the meeting of shareholders." In the past, enterprises bargained with their supervisory departments in every effort to lower the profit target. After being transformed with the shareholding system, the sense of mission and urgency to increase of the value of the assets of enterprises drive managers to seek maximum profits for their enterprises. Without any outside interference, the Shanghai First Pencil Company Limited raised the profit target three times last year and succeeded in reaching it. In April, the company raised by 54 percent the profit target set earlier in the year at a meeting of shareholders. In this way, the interests of the enterprise, of shareholders, and of managers are perfectly integrated under the shareholding system. Many general managers jokingly call themselves senior "wage earners." They can fire ordinary staff and even vice general managers, and can also be fired if the board of directors is unsatisfied with their business performance. There is this common consensus among listed joint-stock enterprises: Enterprises are owned by shareholders and you must think of ways to please them. The Shareholding System, a Modern Enterprise System, Is Displaying its Attractive Charm in China's Enterprise Reform. Through Transformation to the Shareholding System, We Are Beginning To Be Able To Resolve Deep-Seated Economic Problems Such as Readjusting the Industrial Structure and Enhancing the Vitality of State-Owned Enterprises. In July, Shenzhen's Zhongguo Baoan Group of Companies Limited purchased large numbers of the shares of Shanghai's Yanzhong Company Limited and caused a great wave in Shanghai's stock exchange. Some people made a fortune and others got tied up. Shareholders were at a loss for some time. Despite the fact that this was the first time in China that a joint-stock enterprise purchased over 16 percent of the shares of another joint-stock enterprise without conforming to some norms, the China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee acknowledged the validity of the purchase. We should encourage this kind of purchase because this really shows that the most essential significance of the stock market is not to offer a site for stock speculators, but that it has formed an equity market, offering us an effective method of achieving the rational flow of assets, especially stock assets, on a larger scope and readjusting the industrial structure. The very reason the readjustment of the transregional and intertrade industrial structure has proceeded so slowly for many years does not lie with enterprises but with a plurality of departments. A merger, for example, would often put the numerous departments of two parties into protracted talks. In the case of the equity market, the Zhongguo Baoan Company saved the effort of consulting the relevant departments. Moreover, the Yanzhong Company had no idea about the purchase beforehand. How quick this transaction was concluded! How efficient it was! Judging from the experimental joint-stock enterprises in China at the present time, the majority of them have transregional and intertrade characteristics. The Nantong Machine Tool Factory was a state-owned enterprise which entered the international market and whose exports had a ranking position in the same trade. But its productive capacity was inadequate and badly needed expansion. Nantong City had seven related factories. Some were people-owned enterprises; some were collectively-owned enterprises; and others were city and township enterprises. Of the people-owned enterprises, some were owned by the city and others by prefectures and counties. In order to merge the seven enterprises into one big company, they used the shareholding system to form the Nantong Machine Tool Company Limited, broke through departmental ownership and regional boundaries, and developed it into an enterprise group, readjusting the irrational enterprise structure. Each party was given bonus dividends according to the number of shares they hold. And through participation and decisionmaking in the board of directors, the various parties have coordinated their interests and brought into play their own initiative. This kind of joint-stock enterprise group formed by linking assets has its responsibilities, powers, and interests better defined than ordinary enterprise groups, smoother operational mechanisms, and therefore have a more obvious scale of merit. The vitality of state-owned enterprises is a central question we are trying to settle in the course of reform. The vitality of state-owned enterprises and their structure are two questions, but they are interally very closely linked. The irrational structure affects vitality to a certain degree, because if vitality is lacking there is no motivation for structural readjustment. The shareholding system is like a two-edged sword which has changed the two questions from mutual containment to mutual promotion. The Shenzhen Property Company Limited originally had net assets totalling 100 million yuan. Its assets were assessed in the process of changing to a joint-stock enterprise and its net assets rose to 180 million yuan. Then through shares issued at a premium, its net assets leaped to over 600 million yuan. Its business has changed from just the construction industry to the construction industry, tourism, and the real estate industry. After changing to the shareholding system, it turned over 4.8 million yuan to the state each year. In 1992 when it was changed to a joint-stock enterprise and was listed, it earned 160 million yuan of profits and taxes. In the first six months of 1993, it earned an after-tax profit of 160 million yuan and it is expected to have no problem earning 300 million yuan of profits and taxes in the whole year. In this way, the state can earn 216 million yuan as it owns 72 percent of shares. The profit is many more times than in the past before it was changed into a joint-stock company! Sichuan's Emeishan Salt Chemical Company Limited sold the premiums of state shares, whose proportion was excessively large, to corporate enterprises, and invested the funds earned in other trades and industries with higher profits and better prospects of development. Now its national assets have increased in value and its salt production structure has been adjusted, strengthening its ability to adapt to changes in the market. The results of the surveys conducted by the joint survey team of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, the State Economic and Trade Commission, and the State Securities Commission show that the shareholding system, an organizational form of modern enterprises, enables listed enterprises to get huge vitality and demonstrates an exceedingly strong self-developing capacity. The actual profits earned by the 12 listed companies syrveyed in Shanghai increased in 1992 over the same period the previous year, with the rates of increase ranging from 35 to 400 percent. Compared with the same period in 1992, the actual profits in the first six months of 1993 had increases ranging from 44 to 274 percent. The five companies listed in Hainan this year earned after-tax profits totaling 253 million yuan in 1992, while their after-tax profits in the first six months of 1993 already reached 331 million yuan, representing a 30.83-percent increase in after-tax profits over the whole year of 1992. The transformation of China's enterprise with the shareholding system is still at the experimental stage, and there is still a lot of work to do for us to further standardize it. We should not, of course, take pride in the achievements we have obtained, but all this has convinced us of the need to unswervingly proceed with experimentation with the shareholding system. As an important choice for us to deepen reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and change their management mechanisms, the shareholding system is demonstrating its huge superiority.
