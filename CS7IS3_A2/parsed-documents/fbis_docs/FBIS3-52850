Our correspondent has learned that the Defense Ministry has prepared a map showing all the bypass roads that will be paved when the negotiations with the PLO end. Our correspondent Gil'ad 'Adin has the details: The negotiations on the second stage of the implementation of the autonomy have not yet started, but a map of the autonomy roads is ready. The Defense Ministry defined the autonomy's areas considered dangerous and its presumed borders. The definitions were handed over to the Construction and Housing Ministry, and Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer instructed the Public Works Division [PWD] to prepare detailed plans for paving the new roads. According to the map of the autonomy roads, 620 km of new roads will be paved. The work will be on an enormous scale, including bypass road for dangerous areas, safe access routes to the settlements in the territories, and roads along the autonomy borders which will serve those wishing to avoid the entire area. The new map was designed to be incorporated into the map of the peace roads, of which we reported some three months ago. That map provided a general plan for roads to the neighboring Arab countries, and not roads leading to specific settlements. The autonomy roads project will cost some 2 billion new Israeli shekels. It is not included in this year's PWD budget, which is why an additional budget is currently needed. The Defense and the Construction and Housing Ministries are keeping the plan secret. We have learned that a detailed map has been prepared, and now it is clearer what the finance minister was referring to when he said, after the state budget was approved, that an additional budget will be required for plans connected with the establishment of the autonomy.
