Some 400 people from several Colombian cities attended the meeting with the revolutionary leader at the auditorium of Cartagena de Indias' Professionals Club. One by one, the leaders of the friendship groups expressed to the Cuban leader their admiration and full support for the persistent resistance of his people to harassment by the United States. All speakers demanded the lifting of the U.S. blockade on Cuba and stressed their decision to continue to support what they called a "temporary period." Visibly moved, the president responded to their display of solidarity and answered some questions from attendees. One of the questions was asked by a young 18-year-old girl, who asked Castro why he arrived in Colombia to attend the Fourth Ibero-American Summit wearing a guayabera instead of his traditional green army uniform. The revolutionary leader replied that he wore a guayabera in response to suggestions made by conference organizers, who asked the rulers to attend the summit wearing informal clothes to confront the hot Cartagena de Indias weather. He pointed out that he did not know whether he would return to his country in plainclothes, adding that he will definitely wear his legendary guerrilla uniform again. Professionals Club President Carlos Cruz inspired a very special moment when he asked the Antillean chief of state to put his signature on the main wall of the auditorium, which will henceforth be called Fidel Castro Auditorium. The Cuban statesman grabbed a black marker and drafted his signature in big letters amid cheers and chants loudly uttered by sympathizers of the Cuban cause. Another affectionate and funny situation took place as the local Friendship Association gave him a long-sleeved white guayabera, similar to the one he wore on the first day of the summit.
