He said this today at a news conference devoted to the second RMDR Congress due to be held on 29 January. The former mayor of Moscow believes that with the implementation of the "shock therapy" policy, a westernist version of reform had been chosen, of which the essential elements became the dissolution of the USSR and annihilation of Russia's military-industrial capacity, in which the West had an interest. He called "shock therapy" a "model for the complete destruction of the country and its subordination to international monopolies." In the opinion of Gavriil Popov, neither the Gorbachev nor the post-August concepts of reform have solved the main problem for Russia -- the transition to a postindustrial society, and therefore the country is faced with the "task of developing a third model for the period of transition." He insists that the development of "a Russian model for the post-industrial society" requires "gigantic work," which may be done only as a result of the unification of the centrist forces in Russia. The RMDR leader believes that there is no need to create a fuss about the new government. In his opinion, it is a "caretaker government for a year-and-a-half, the task of which is to purify the country of the extremes of a westernist policy." Analysing the reasons for the defeat of the RMDR in the elections (the movement failed to gather the five percent of votes necessary to enter parliament), Gavriil Popov gave as one of the reasons the unsuccessful attempts to form an electoral coalition with other parties. "We did not expect that Russia would reject the westernist policy right away," he said, adding that this was the main strategic mistake of the RMDR. The movement's congress will be devoted to the results of the elections and the elaboration of the RMDR's tactics and strategy. Gavriil Popov said that accusations being made against him of corruption in his time as mayor could only be explained by the fact that after August 1992 he had "come out against the line being taken by the Russian Government."
