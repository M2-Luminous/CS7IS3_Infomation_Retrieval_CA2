Prior to his departure for Brussels to attend the conference, which is to be held under the sponsorship of Egon Alfred Klepsch, chairman of the European Parliament, Mesic said he will present to the conference a Croatian proposal that the international community return to its principle of the inviolability of borders. This principle will secure an undivided Bosnia-Herzegovina, while the occupied areas in Croatia will be fully reintegrated into its legal and constitutional system. Bosnia-Herzegovina should be demilitarized, and also Serbia, which presents the worst danger for this part of the world. President Mesic also said he will meet parliamentarians from a number of countries in the course of his visit to Brussels.
