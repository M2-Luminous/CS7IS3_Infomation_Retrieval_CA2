Journalist Cabrera Peinado has further details from Pinar del Rio. [Cabrera Peinado] Through 28 January some 400,000 union leaders in Cuba will be preparing, holding discussions and making proposals with regard to the measures the Revolution's leadership will have to adopt to streamline internal finances; and as of 28 January, meetings with all Cuban workers will be held. Many proposals were made openly and without formalities at the meetings held at La Primavera and at the dried tobacco processing center. Among these proposals was that the monitoring and safekeeping of state resources be improved, so that these resources will not be squandered or end up in the hands of antisocial elements. Also, in these assemblies taking place in Cuba, the residents of Pinar del Rio Province came out in favor of finding ways to reduce to a minimum the amount of currency circulating -- which is affecting the nation and, in particular, the workers, because of the high prices of products on the black market. They also came out in favor of increasing the nation's production levels and improving the efficiency of enterprises. They noted the need to raise certain prices, such as those of cigarrettes, alcoholic beverages, and other products which, even though they may be articles of prime necessity, should cost what it costs to produce them. They also came out in favor of subsidizing people who need a subsidy. It was also said that there exist a number of services which could perfectly well be charged for, such as admission to sports and cultural events and students' clothing and books, as well as cosmetic surgery and other health procedures that are not indispensable to life. Pedro Ross Leal said that our fatherland is urgently in need of a battle for economic efficiency, and, more than anything else, needs to find solutions to current problems. He added that the nation cannot allow itself the luxury of continuing to have 69 percent of its enterprises be unprofitable, for in addition to what is invested in health and education, 1.6 billion pesos are paid out in social insurance and welfare annually. [Begin Ross recording] And what the nation wants, what the leadership of the Revolution wants, and what we as a union movement have to do is to encourage the workers, as owners, and in the final analysis as the principal organizations in our society, to play the part that befits them.
