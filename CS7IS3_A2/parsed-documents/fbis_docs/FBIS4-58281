Overlooking the provisions of the "GATT" world trade agreement in making such a decision could ultimately lead to a new Cold War -- a situation that could prove harmful to the United States -- because no country can ignore its economic interests to defend U.S. economic and trade interests. It is true that the United States is the only superpower in the world today, but it would be an intolerable situation if it were to act unilaterally and resort to bullying tactics. The U.S. Administration's endeavors to maintain its own economic prosperity following President Clinton's assumption of office is totally unjustifiable. There was a time when U.S. presidents -- President Kennedy, for instance -- tried to rid the world of poverty and tried to see that poor nations prospered along with the United States. Today, however, the Clinton Administration is hell-bent on acting arbitrarily. If the United States continues to act this way, it will loose the sympathy of other countries in the world. When this happens, ill will may develop and it is likely that developing countries may start to regard the United States as a hostile country. It is certain that if it looses the sympathy of the developing and poor countries, the United States will have difficulty finding markets for its products. It is no secret that the United States is currently facing a recession, and many East Asian countries and Japan are not proving to be suitable markets for the United States. In fact, it is impossible for the United States to act arbitrarily simply because it is a leading country. The U.S. argument regarding the application of "Special 301" to India is that the Indian Government has not taken effective steps on copyright and patent issues. This argument is not completely correct. The truth is that the Indian Government has taken considerable and effective steps regarding copyright and patent issues. Because of these steps, there is no logic in imposing the "Special 301" law on the pretext of "inaction" on the issue. Of course, it is only right that those who want to get rich by copying U.S. products should be restrained; no encouragement should be given to theft and copying. When it is amply clear that the Indian Government is taking every step to curtail this, however, the United States should refrain from adopting aggressive postures. The U.S. Administration's decision to brand China as the biggest thief of U.S. products reflects the imperialistic mentality of the United States. Undoubtedly, the theft and copying of products by some people does not warrant declaring the entire country a thief, and punishing or imposing sanctions against it is not natural justice. If the United States tries to defend its economic and trade interests by wielding a "big stick," such action could not be called appropriate. As far as patent rights are concerned, the United States has enforced a "product patent" policy under which any scientist or entrepreneur has the right to produce and sell special products. Without permission, nobody can produce or manufacture that product. India has a "production system" patent policy. Under the Indian policy, no other person can adopt a patented production system, but the same products can be manufactured by a different production system. The United States wants India to enforce the same "product patent" policy that is prevalent in the United States. It is clear that the Americans want to become the owners of products developed from hidden natural wealth or by scientific techniques. Accordingly, the United States has enforced a "product patent" policy. If the United States does not want to share its intellectual, scientific, and technical knowledge with all of humanity, it could only be described as anti-humanist. It would be better if the United States reconsidered its patent policy. If the United States wants to remain the leading nation in the world, it will have to share its intellect and skill with the entire world and all of humanity. Neither the United States nor any country can claim to be a superpower if it does not show magnanimity. If the United States tries to remain a superpower by adopting bullying tactics or starting an arms race, it will earn only ill will -- not sympathy -- which will create economic as well as political problems for itself. The indications that the United States will bring India under "Special 301" are not only a bad omen, they strengthen apprehensions regarding its intentions at a time when the prime minister's U.S. visit is only a few days away. Maybe the "Special 301" question has been raised in an attempt to pressure India regarding the signing of Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Raising this issue on the eve of the prime minister's U.S. visit, though, cannot be taken as a positive gesture. It would be better if the United States came to understood fully that India will never yield to such pressure tactics.
