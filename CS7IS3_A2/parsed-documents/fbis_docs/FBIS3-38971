"Either there will be a decision today, or there will be none. There will be no half-measures," the French sources said during a break in the Atlantic Council to allow the 16 ambassadors to consult their governments. According to the sources, the U.S.-French ultimatum proposal made this morning would give the forces which have been bombarding Sarajevo for 22 months 7-10 days to withdraw their heavy artillery to 20-30 kilometres from the perimeter of the city, or else face air strikes. Most NATO countries have expressed support for an ultimatum in response to the worst single civilian atrocity of the Bosnian war: the mortar shell that killed 68 and wounded over 200 in a Sarajevo market on Saturday [5 February]. But Canada is particularly concerned about the possible repercussions on its large peacekeeping contingent, encircled at Srebrenica, in the wake of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's threat that "no foreigner will be safe" if air strikes are ordered. Greece fears that an escalation of the Bosnian war would dangerously raise tensions in Kosovo and the rest of the Balkan area. The Council is meeting to respond to United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's call for a NATO green light on threatened air strikes to halt the massacre of Sarajevo civilians. If the Council approves the ultimatum, the last word as regards launching the strikes lies with Butrus-Ghali. (In Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had written to Butrus-Ghali warning of the "extremely serious" consequences of "any air strike, even limited to providing air cover" for UN forces. Kozyrev was quoted as saying that air strikes "would jeopardise the entire UN aid operation." Stressing the priority of a political solution to the Bosnian crisis, he reiterated Russia's view that before ordering strikes Butrus-Ghali must consult with the UN Security Council, where Russia has indicated it will veto such a move.)
