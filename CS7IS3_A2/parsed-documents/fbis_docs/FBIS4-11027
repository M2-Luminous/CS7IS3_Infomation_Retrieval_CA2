This week, different political groups, among them some legislators, offered to act as "mediators" to create a great front of the democratic and civic forces, so as to achieve unity to defeat the PRD in the upcoming elections. "I think what these people who call themselves antimilitarists [civilistas] are trying to do at this point is a useless effort, because the only thing they will accomplish is to stir up passions. This could result in situations we may all regret," Perez Balladares said, without specifying what he was referring to. The PRD presidential candidate said there are politicians who have claimed the right to call themselves antimilitarists and to speak for an entire people, while he remarked that there are people who fought against Noriega and who now support his presidential candidacy. "They are trying to create in this electoral period conditions similar to those in 1989, and this is a mistake," the opposition politician noted. Perez Balladares added that the current political moment must not be taken as a struggle against anyone in particular, but as a struggle against the problems in 1994. Meanwhile, Perez Balladares described the communique issued by the Justice and Peace Commission regarding the videos about the past military regime presented by President Endara last week as rickety. "We accept the decision of the Justice and Peace Commission, but we think they could have been a bit stronger," the PRD leader pointed out. Meanwhile, Perez Balladares accepted the existence of a large number of corporations with which his name is associated, but explained that this situation is not illegal but a part of his job as a businessman. "They have accused me of not working since 1984. This situation shows that I am neither retired nor unemployed, as they have tried to portray, but that this is how I made my living," Perez Balladares concluded.
