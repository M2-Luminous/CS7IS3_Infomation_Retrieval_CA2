Clearly Discern the Situation and Further Enhance the Sense of Emergency in Broadening the Opening Up Over the past few years, Hebei Province has done a great deal of work in opening the province to the outside world and scored marked achievements in some fields. However, the work in this regard has not been ideal. In particular, the development achieved in this regard since the beginning of this year has brooked no optimism. The work done in the first quarter can be summarized as the following three sentences: The exports of foreign trade showed a stable increase. The introduction of foreign capital decreased on a large scale. The work of foreign economic relations was not improved. Of the work of the "three foreign", except for the foreign trade in which the province is hopeful to fulfill the target set in the "work outline of the provincial party committee", the work in other two fields has lagged far behind. If we fail to conduct it well, there is a danger that nothing will come of it. In view of the entire country, the opening up with the utilization of foreign capital as a mainstay has entered a new stage. Major indicators in this regard are as follows: The work of opening up has been further suitable to the economic mechanism of international markets. The practice of bringing in foreign capital has been gradually expanded from industries most of which are of manufacturing ones to basic industries, service industry, and industries of building infrastructures. The target and style of investments have incurred a large change. The investment made in industrial capital has been gradually expanded to that made in banking affairs. The per-project investment has gradually developed into a systematic one. These new changes are either opportunities or challenges for us. The current and actual situation of the province has shown that the dynamics and extent in the opening up work have not been sufficient and become the factors that are restricting the deepening of reform and the accelerating of development. We must further enhance the sense of emergency in opening up and make all-out efforts to create a new situation in the work in this regard. 2. Realistically Do a Good Job in Grasping the Three Big Events of Opening Up The first big event is to uphold the principle of paying simultaneous attention to enrichment and improvement and to accelerate the pace of building up the development zones. By judging from the analysis of the situation prevailing in the 19 state-and-province-run economic and technical development zones throughout the province, although party committees and governments at all levels as well as departments concerned have done a great deal of work in developing these zones, generally speaking the work done in this regard is still not ideal. Except for few of them that have been better run, most of them have not achieved large development. The currently urgent task in building up the development zones is not to increase the number of these zones but is to persistently pay simultaneous attention to enriching and improving them based on the existing zones and to accelerate the pace of building them up. Paying simultaneous attention to enrichment and improvement in this regard means that in building up these development zones, it is necessary to earnestly implement the strategy set by the provincial party committee and the provincial people's government with regard to having the export-oriented economy bring along the development. We should adhere to the principle of operating the development zones with "foreign capital, industries, and exports" as mainstays. Efforts should be made to strive to have the initially-built development zones be near to or basically fulfill the following targets through the efforts of three or five years: 1) The utilization of funds with the combination between domestic and foreign ones and foreign capital should be regarded as the main, 2) The final outlet of products should chiefly turn toward exports or sales in foreign countries, 3) The character of enterprises should be chiefly of joint venture and cooperation, 4) In selecting and allocating industrial enterprises, we should take as a support the industrial enterprises whose products are with high added value and which are engaging in the intensified processing of natural resources and regard as a main guidance the knowledge-intensive and high-and-new tech industrial enterprises, 5) In economic operation, we should connect the standardized market mechanism with the international markets and try doing things in line with the international conventions, 6) We should train a large number of managerial talented personnel who know well the economy involved in foreign countries. In building development zones, we should proceed from the local reality and explore multi-channels to accelerate the development in this regard. Through the setting up of economic and technical associations with domestic cities and enterprises and the breakthrough made in bringing in foreign capital and technologies, the economic and technical development zone of Qinhuangdao city has worked a way of development by "integrating its economic associations with the introduction of foreign capital and technologies". Its experience gained in this regard is worthy of drawing on. The economic and technical development zone of Langfang city has become a typical city in the province due to its fast development and best management fostered by upholding the principle of doing things according to the market law as well as by "bringing in capital to open projects, making money through using the land resources, raising funds through multi-channels, and achieving snowballing development". It is hoped that various localities should earnestly study their successful experiences and do a good job in operating their development zones. The second big event is to rapidly make a breakthrough in utilizing foreign capital to conduct technical grafting and renovations among the out-dated enterprises. This important channel of utilizing foreign funds, with many advantages, may relieve the strained situation of funds among enterprises, may bring in advanced technologies and management, is helpful for shifting the business mechanism of enterprises, and may score dual results in both reform and renovations. The main reason why the province has taken so long to make a step in this regard is still the fetter of leftist concept. Under such a concept, localities are worrying that too much work in this regard would adversely affect the main-body role of state-owned enterprises and are afraid of being labelled with engaging in "privatization". They are also afraid of being labelled with "national betrayal" due to their transfer of some property rights of the state-owned enterprises. Some people also are afraid of being labelled with "the outflow of state interests" because joint venture and cooperation will be enforced among the profit-making enterprises. Some plant directors (managers) are also afraid of losing their official posts while conducting joint venture and cooperation. However, the crucial point in this regard is the subconscious worry of being "capitalist" or "socialist". The basic form of utilizing foreign capital to conduct technical grafting and renovations among the out-dated enterprises is the shareholding system that is a managerial style of assets and does not involve in the issue of being "capitalist" or "socialist". The first important task at present still is to further emancipate minds and to eliminate the "leftist" fetter. We should earnestly study the policies on utilizing foreign capital to conduct technical grafting and renovations among the out-dated enterprises. Principles to determine which industry and enterprise should first utilize the foreign capital to conduct technical grafting and renovations, which industry and enterprise should have control shares, and which industry and enterprise can allow foreign firms to have control shares or to buy their whole shares, should be defined according to the province's strategy of economic development, according to the demand of readjusting the industrial structure, and in line with the role played by the industry and enterprise in the state plan and people's life. In the view of an enterprise, major difficult points and problems for making a decision in this regard include asset appraisal, the burdens of enterprises' debts, and the living arrangements for surplus staff members and workers. In dealing with these problems, we may follow many successful experiences gained by the province in this regard and draw on the good methods fostered by the fraternal provinces. The key to successfully handling them lies in whether we dare to or are willing to study these experiences and methods. As long as these methods can maintain and increase the value of state assets, we should actively and boldly adopt them and further improve them in a creative way in the course of practice. The provincial level departments concerned should work out specific policies and methods that are practically feasible and with strong serviceability. We should straighten out the systems and enhance the organizational leadership. In viewing the utilization of foreign capital for conducting technical grafting and renovations among the out-dated enterprises characteristically, it means that enterprises will have one more channel of raising funds for technical renovations. Therefore, the task in this regard can be more smoothly managed by the provincial economic commission. There are almost 2,000 state-owned budgetary enterprises and more than 1,000 backbone enterprises run by the collectives of both urban and rural areas throughout the province. Therefore, we should carry out general investigation among them and form a line according to their conditions so as to determine the number of out-dated enterprises that may allow the enforcement of joint venture, cooperation, and technical grafting and renovations. After the number is fixed, we should force the enterprises to take up the enforcement and regard the enforcement as a formidable mission. From this year on, we should establish a strict responsibility system for the enforcement and have the enforcement be fulfilled within three years. The third big event is to vigorously conduct the work of inviting business and introducing foreign capital by regarding as a focal point the seeking of large business partners and the talks of large projects. By judging from the comprehensive analysis on the current world situation in politics and the economy and on the steady deepening of reform, the rapid economic development, and the social and political stability in the country, the emphasis of utilizing foreign capital in next period should be placed on attracting the investments of large financial groups and large transnational corporations and on conducting joint venture and cooperation with them. In inviting foreign business we should adhere to the principle of introducing large, medium-sized, and small business projects simultaneously. However, priority should be given to seeking large business partners and holding talks on large projects. Leading comrades should go out to look for various relations, to establish ties with the large partners, and to strive to conduct cooperation with the large financial groups and large transnational corporations that are economically strong. Establishing ties with a large number of large business partners will play a role of getting twice the result with half the effort. We should establish the archives of large business partners and the responsibility system for personnel who have dealings with the large partners. We should conduct propaganda patiently, deeply, protractedly, and honestly among the large business partners and render services for them so as to enable them to feel that they are possessing the successful conditions and confident in conducting cooperation with the province. 3. Vigorously Improve the Environment of Opening Up and Particularly the Intangible Environment To Promote the Quickened Development of the Export-Oriented Economy Over the years, the province has always attached great importance on the improvement of the investment environment. The tangible environment that includes the infrastructures of communications, energy resources, and telecommunications, has been obviously improved. The intangible environment of opening up has also been gradually improved. However, both tangible and intangible environments are far from the demands of opening the province to the outside world in a big way. In particular, the gap between the intangible environment and the demands is even larger and it has more problems. Particularly in the course of developing the export-oriented economy, ideology and concept are out of date; the level of business talks is low; the rhythm of work is slow; obstacles in the cooperation are many; and the observance of promises is poor. Thus, great attention should be paid to concentrating efforts on enhancing the one sense, perfecting the three large systems, improving the three environments, and reinforcing the one contingent of entrepreneurs in this regard. Enhancing the one sense means to enhance the sense of the whole people in opening up. Improving the intangible environment of opening up includes either the act taken by the government or the undertaking taken by the whole people, on which the society as a whole should attach great importance. We should truly foster a common understanding in which "every person poses as an investment environment, every thing represents the image of credit, every locality is involved in the opening up". We should also foster a strong sense of opening up and realistically integrate everything done by localities and local departments and personnel and particularly by the personnel involved in the business with foreign countries closely with the work of improving the environment of opening up, with the work of fostering and improving the province's image, and with the work of accelerating the pace of building Hebei into a strong province in the economy. The three large systems that should be perfected are as follows: The first is the system of rendering fine-quality and high-efficiency services for the business with foreign countries. Every department in service of the business with foreign countries, by regarding the transformation of function and work style as a target, should upgrade the political and professional quality of service personnel and the quality and efficiency of services; reinforce the service function; and broaden the service fields. Efforts should be made to accelerate the establishment and improvement of the social service organizations, including the offices of accountants, lawyers, and advisers, and to provide good services for the broadening of opening up. The second is the system of the policies on the business with foreign countries and the system of laws and regulations that are conforming with international conventions. We should earnestly formulate or revise and work out as soon as possible policies and provisions for the province to encourage foreign firms to invest their money in the province. The third is the system of obtaining sensitive and first-hand information. The three environments that should be improved are as follows: First, the social environment should be further improved. Efforts should be made to vigorously enhance the building of spiritual civilization, to deeply and protractedly carry out the struggle against corruption, and to strengthen the comprehensive management of public security. Second, the financial environment should be emphatically improved. Various financial departments should concentrate their efforts on enlivening the circulation of funds, vigorously open the sources of funds, and increase the loans and support for the "three types of foreign-funded" enterprises. They should also improve the financial service for the business with foreign countries and strive to establish foreign-funded and joint-venture financial organs or agents among the open cities throughout the province. Third, the environment of applying to customs should be improved as quickly as possible. Various relevant cities, prefectures, and port commissions and offices at all levels should grasp the enhancement of building up the port areas by regarding the enhancement as an important measure of improving the investment environment, attracting outside funds, and making the province's economy prosperous. Efforts should be made to improve the managerial systems of port offices, relax the conditions on the transportation of goods transfer, simplify the procedure of inspection, and upgrade the working efficiency. Reinforcing the one contingent of entrepreneurs means that enterprises are the main body of opening the province to the outside world and that bringing in foreign capital should chiefly rely on the operation of enterprises. In a sense, the market economy is an economy run by entrepreneurs. Broadening the opening up, enforcing the strategy of having the export-oriented economy bring along development, and developing the export-oriented economy require a large number of entrepreneurs who know well the international conventions and the world economy. It is impossible to develop the export-oriented economy without the grand contingent of entrepreneurs who are engaging in the business with foreign countries and without high-quality partners for joint venture and cooperation with foreign countries. The province has possessed a quite large contingent of entrepreneurs. However, its quality as a whole is not high enough. In particular, talented personnel engaging in the work of high science and technology and in the high-level management are so few. Those who know well the foreign economic relations and foreign trade are also so few. Those who have a good command of laws, are good at business and management, and are proficient in foreign languages, are even more few. We must adopt effective measures to accelerate the training and forging of the contingent of entrepreneurs engaging in business with foreign countries.
