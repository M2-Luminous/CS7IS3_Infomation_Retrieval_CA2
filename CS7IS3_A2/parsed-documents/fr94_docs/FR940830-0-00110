FR940830-0-00110 FR940830-0-00014 One comment asked whether a possible upward adjustment of the maintenance fee per paragraph (h)(2) would mean that the small miner would have to do assessment work of an increased value as well. The answer is no. The amount of assessment work to be performed is established in the Mining Law of 1872. The maintenance fee is in lieu of assessment work required, the value of which has not been amended. No further clarification is necessary in the regulations on this point. One comment questioned some of the references in paragraph (i). This paragraph has been removed in the final rule, because its contents are stated elsewhere in §§3833.1&hyph;5 and 3833.1&hyph;6. 43 CFR 3833.1&hyph;6 Paragraph (a)(1) was amended to make it clear that for purposes of obtaining the small miner waiver, the claimant is required to certify that he or she owns 10 claims or fewer on the date payment is due, which is August 31 of each year the Act of August 10, 1993, remains in effect. Two comments challenged this section of the proposed rule, correctly observing that the Secretary is not required to offer a small miner waiver under the Act of August 10, 1993. One comment stated that the Secretary also had the choice of not offering the waiver or offering some other kind, such as a one-claim waiver. The comment went on to ask about the analysis that went into the decision to offer the 10-claim waiver and pointed out the administrative costs and loss of revenue to the government in offering it (the other comment was also concerned with administrative costs). It further asked what percentage of claims of record are owned by those with 10 or fewer claims. It also said that the National Performance Review requested by the President states that the Government should get a fair return for Federal resources and the waiver runs counter to this idea. There is nothing to suggest that Congress intended anything other than for the Secretary to decide whether to offer the 10-claim waiver as outlined in the Act, or not to offer it at all. The statute allows the Secretary discretion to offer the waiver to small miners, but defines small miners very specifically. Also, the Act essentially extends the previous rental fee statute, which offered a similar 10-claim exemption. Therefore, no other types of waivers such as a one-claim waiver were considered. The choice to offer the 10-claim waiver was made primarily because the fact that Congress included the waiver in the legislation, although within the Secretary's discretion, and included specific criteria for implementing it, suggests that Congress believed that allowing the waiver is appropriate in certain circumstances, which the statute proceeds to lay out in detail. It is true that there is an administrative cost and a loss of revenue to the Government because of the waiver. It was determined, however, that these costs are justified. The decision to offer the waiver does not conflict with the National Performance Review, because the Administration's position concerning a fair return for resources must be applied in light of the particular facts involved, including other Administration positions, such as the policy of helping small business. Additionally, it is the Administration's position that a royalty on production should be instituted in separate Mining Law reform legislation, which would also apply to small miners. This is where the return for resources is more fairly applied. Only approximately 10 percent of all active mining claims on Federal land are eligible to be excused from the maintenance fee, so the vast majority of claims will be subject to maintenance fees paid by the claimants. One comment stated that paragraph (a) should not allow mill and tunnel sites to be waived if listed on a small miner waiver certification. Such sites will be eligible for waiver, because the Act of August 10, 1993, specifically allows a waiver of the maintenance fee required for mining claims and mill or tunnel sites. One comment objected to paragraph (a)(1), which allows a small miner to pay the fee as well as file for a waiver if so desired. The comment stated that this is misleading because the fee is nonrefundable and the fee waiver would become moot. The comment suggested that in such a case as this the fee should be refunded if a small miner waiver is found to be valid. The purpose of this paragraph, which is similar to language which implemented the rental fee, is to make clear that there is no penalty for both paying the fee and filing the waiver. The BLM has had a policy of not offering refunds in cases such as this because of the significant costs associated with processing refunds, and because a decision to pay the fee and file the waiver is entirely within the discretion of the claimant. It has been determined that such costs go beyond basic public service and represent a burden on the taxpayer. However, the regulation provides at §3833.1&hyph;1(d) that in such a case the claimant could apply the payment to a subsequent year if the most current claim fee is waived through the small miner certification process. Two comments asked whether paragraph (a)(1) allows for claimants to pay the fee for some claims and get the waiver for some if they have 10 or fewer total. The answer is no because the statute requires that if eligible claimants decide to apply for the small miner waiver they must do so for all their claims. This paragraph does allow for a claimant to both pay and file for a small miner waiver for all or some of his or her claims, but all of the claims count in deciding whether the claimant is qualified for the small miner waiver. One comment stated that paragraph (a)(1) should provide that if only one co-owner has more than 10 claims that only his or her interest in the claims will be forfeited in the event of non-payment under §3833.4. This depends on the relationship between the parties. If the co-owners are not related parties as defined in the law and this rule, the claim would be void as to the non-small miner co-owner only. Regarding paragraph (a)(3) one comment asked how a claimant makes a certification for mill and tunnel sites when assessment work is not required for sites. Simply listing sites on the small miner waiver form will act as a notice of intention to hold and will suffice for certification. One comment asked whether, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3), a small miner who owned only mill or tunnel sites could get a waiver. The answer is yes. One comment said that paragraph (a)(3) should state that mill and tunnel sites are required to be active for the fee to be waived. The maintenance fee is collected only in lieu of the assessment work requirement, 30 U.S.C. 28&hyph;28e. No activity level is specified for mill sites in those sections of the Mining Law. Therefore, no such requirement has been added to this rule. The validity of millsites may, nevertheless, still be challenged based on the requirements in 30 U.S.C. 42.
