A Bankrupt Meets Bankers"] [Text] Yesterday, Mr. Zhirinovskiy, who had attempted during his spectacular election campaign to pay with false pay-sheets and "slush-fund cash" for the air time accorded to him, tried to persuade Russian bankers at his faction's meeting to finance his future election campaign (or maybe also his previous one in view of his obvious bankruptcy). Representatives of 80 banks were invited to attend the meeting together with members of the Russian and Moscow governments, revenue services, and so forth. According to SEGODNYA's information, neither the top chiefs nor representatives of any reputable banks were seen at the meeting. A large number of Russian and particularly foreign journalists were present as usual. Generally speaking, as practice has shown, Zhirinovskiy is much better consumed on the foreign market than on the domestic one. The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] could not please the bankers with its traditional buffoonery at the meeting: When you ask for money, you have to behave appropriately. Zhirinovskiy simply said that banks should help the LDPR because it is precisely this party that guarantees stability in the country. "I want to give a signal from our party so that you could correctly assess the situation and help us financially." LDPR representatives explained that they are not fascists but simple patriots, and that they will prevent the fascists from coming to power. It turned out that the LDPR stands for the Chinese model, a stance evidently meant to give Zhirinovskiy a certain air of respectability a la Mr. Volskiy. Getting down to business, Zhirinovskiy told the audience that a total of 22 trillion rubles [R] is sitting idly in Russian banks. He did not ask "to give him all the profits," he just suggested that they share with him 1 percent of the amount. That is, the bankrupt lays claim to a meager R220 billion. During the meeting, LDPR members wondered about the behavior by chiefs of GMM [a foreign bank implicated in possible LDPR election misconduct], who, in their view, "do not realize their own advantage" as they stubbornly deny that they had financed Zhirinovskiy. LDPR speakers said that the company's ability to finance "the most stable party" should have been its best advertisement. As a matter of fact, earlier Zhirinovskiy had time to meet with Richard Nixon, former U.S. president, behind closed doors at the Balchug-Kempinsky hotel, where the American guest is staying. Zhirinovskiy conveyed through Mr. Nixon his message to the incumbent U.S. President and his autographed two books. Let us hope that the former president is wise enough not to hand this trash over to Mr. Clinton. To all appearances, Zhirinovskiy will get no serious money from mentally sound bankers. Evidently, the claimant himself has also realized that. Upon ending the meeting, he told the journalists that 21 September of last year may recur one of these days. "All characteristics are present, symptoms are evident; papers, documents are ready, troops have long been brought in for street clashes." Evidently, a difficult time has set in for Zhirinovskiy's party. The only thing that could save it is yet more bloody turmoil that the Nazi leader is trying his best to foment.
