This program will conduct site-specific health activities related to human exposure to hazardous substances at waste sites or releases. The activities will be conducted in communities near hazardous waste sites for which ATSDR (or a State under cooperative agreement) has prepared a preliminary public health assessment, public health assessment, public health advisory, health consultation, or other site-related report and the Health Activities Recommendation Panel (HARP) has determined that specific public health actions are warranted. Emphasis will be given to the sites rated as ``Urgent Public Health Hazard'' and ``Public Health Hazard.'' Note: This announcement is a continuation of a previously announced initiative, Program Announcement No. 407_Health Activities Recommendation Panel Site-Specific Health Activities, which was published in the Federal Register on August 9, 1993 [58 FR 42327]. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Environmental Health. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the Section ``Where to Obtain Additional Information.'') Authority This program is authorized under Sections 104(i)(1)(E),(7),(9), and (15) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 [42 U.S.C. 9604 (i)(1)(E) (7), (9), and (15)]. Smoke-Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.
