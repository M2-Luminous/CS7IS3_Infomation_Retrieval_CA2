Takahiro Yokomichi and labor leader Akira Yamagishi on Thursday [24 February] reached a broad agreement to aim at establishing a new liberal party in the future, officials said. In an hour-long meeting over lunch in Tokyo, Yokomichi and Yamagishi basically agreed on efforts to unite the Social Democratic Party [SDP], the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and Sakigake (Harbinger) into a democratic liberal party. Yokomichi is widely regarded as one of the candidates to head the new party expected to be established some time before the next general election. Yokomichi is also considered a next-generation leader of the SDP, the largest among the seven parties forming the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Yamagishi, as head of the 8 million-strong Rengo labor organization, reportedly played a key role in helping establish the coalition last year. The coalition's two propelling groups, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and the Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government Party], have called for establishing a two-party system under the political reform legislation which introduces single-seat constituencies for House of Representatives general elections. But the SDP, DSP and Sakigake, opposing the two-party system, have favored a "moderate multiparty system." Hosokawa, head of the Japan New Party (JNP), at first voiced support for the multiparty system. But earlier this month he instructed top aides to consider uniting the seven coalition parties into one against the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the next general election. Meanwhile, earlier on Thursday, coalition sources said Yokomichi is set to return to the national stage as a leading member of the planned new party. The governor of Hokkaido in northern Japan met with Satsuki Eda, head of the United Social Democratic Party (USDP) and a cabinet minister, on Wednesday night to discuss forming a new party that would involve a merger with the SDP, they said. Yokomichi agreed in the meeting with Eda, director general of the Science and Technology Agency, to start preparations to form the new party with the SDP as its core, they said. Yokomichi, a former SDP member of the House of Representatives, told Eda he is willing to run for a Diet seat in the next general election. He has already received a positive response to the idea of a new party from SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and its secretary general, Wataru Kubo, the sources said. Yokomichi met with Kubo and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger), on February 12 and agreed to form a united parliamentary group among the SDP, DSP and Sakigake, they said. Yokomichi has been elected to the Diet four times since 1969 and elected as Hokkaido governor three times since 1983. Yamagishi, speaking at a news conference at the Japan National Press Club, said Japan's political parties will be molded into three forces. Yamagishi, president of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), said the three will be the LDP, a new conservative party, and a new liberal party. It is unlikely the seven coalition parties will merge into one due to different views on constitutional interpretation and Japan's international contributions, he said. "The three polar groups will emerge in a transitional period to pave the way for the establishment of a two-party system," he said, adding this was the ideal goal for the future. After returning to Sapporo, the prefectural capital of Hokkaido, Yokomichi told reporters, "There were no such talks about (setting up) Yokomichi New Party." But he did not deny that there has been an idea to form a new party with himself as an axis. "People within and outside the SDP are thinking of forming the new party. It's not a matter for my comment," Yokomichi said.
