"Close involvement in reform, hastening development, vigorous development, and making the most of the national economy's dominant role," have become action slogans for stimulating an all-out effort throughout the industry. The development program for invigorating the machinery industry that the Ministry of Machinery has drawn up has been revised many times and will soon appear. Human talent is the keystone in dominant industries. One important aspect of the invigoration of the machinery industry is good management and good use of all kinds of specialists and technical talent to improve the caliber of the rank and file throughout the industry. Survey data show that as education, the economy, and science and technology develop, and as society and enterprises increasingly respect science and technology as well as scientific and technical talent, the speed of growth of technicians in the machinery system has been markedly higher than the total number of staff members and workers. Statistics from 10 dominant enterprises show an 8.6 percent increase in the total number of staff members and workers between 1988 and 1991, but a 20.8 percent increase in the number of technicians. At the same time, the caliber of technicians as a whole has also risen markedly, and the percentage of graduate students, and college undergraduates has increased by varying degrees. An environment of respect for human talent, respect for knowledge, and respect for contributions is gradually taking shape. However, by comparison with needs in invigorating the machinery industry, numerous problems in need of immediate solution continue in the training and use of human talent. Human Talent Utilization Efficiency Not High A questionnaire survey of 201 scientific and technical personnel shows that only 5.5 percent of scientific and technical personnel in the machinery and electronics industry personnel feel that their skills are being used to the full; 39.8 percent feel they largely apply their talents; and 17.4 percent believe their talents are not being used at all. In another survey of engineers in large and medium size enterprises, 72 percent felt they were being held back, 80 percent felt work unsatisfying, and only 5 percent put in overtime. Such a slack and easy going state of affairs naturally creates not very high work efficiency. Some comparative data for 1988 is shocking. In Japan, per capita gross output value of engineers in the machinery industry was $350,000, while it was only $84,000 in China. This is to say that in machinery industries having the same output value, China used 4.1 times the number of engineers as Japan. There are both structural reasons and conceptual reasons for this state of affairs. Examples include out of date products, antiquated organizational methods, softening of demand for technology and for technical personnel, and being accustomed to the expansion of extensive inputs primarily, using large amounts of money and manpower; and a serious shortage of development funds that leads to having a large number of technical personnel in name but not in reality, which makes the development of new products very difficult, and makes it even harder to translate scientific research achievements into production. (The money provided for technical progress in some developed nations generally runs between 3 and 5 percent of total sales. In strong Japanese enterprises, it runs as high as 10 percent. In China, by contrast, many enterprises invest less than 1 percent.) A Shanghai survey shows 70 percent of new research achievements have not been translated into the development of products. The value of knowledge is not fully appreciated. Many enterprises continue to treat scientific and technical personnel like organizational cadres, their average bonus being between 10 and 30 percent less than workers on the front line of production. Egalitarianism in distributions is a serious problem. "It makes no difference whether one works or does not work," or whether one "does not work and also takes few risks." This situation results in scientific and technical personnel not doing their best; production efficiency in the enterprise itself is not high; and overstaffing is the general rule, etc. Serious Flight of Human Talent Surveys show that despite the increase in technicians in the machinery and electronics industry in recent years, in state-owned enterprises -- particularly in large and medium size enterprises -- the dropping out of skilled personnel, the aging of human talent, and the flight of human talent is extremely serious. It is mostly middle age and young permanent scientific and technical cadres that leave. A sample survey showed a decline from 24.6 to 19.28 percent in the number of scientific and technical personnel between the ages of 30 and 40 between 1986 and 1991. Another survey showed the flight of more than one-third of the young scientific and technical personnel during the past 5 years from large and medium size machinery and electronics enterprises. More than 60 of the best graduates of institutions of higher education assigned to the Dalian Municipal Machinery Bureau were snapped up by the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises. Between 1984 and 1990, 4000 university graduates were assigned to a Beijing machine tool plant. More than half have already left. The problem in frontier regions is particularly serious. Survey statistics from 287 enterprises show only 7.92 percent of technicians in enterprises today are between 31 and 35 years of age, and 14.5 percent are between 26 and 30 years old. The flight of human talent not only weakens enterprises technical strength, but also damages continuity. It tends to create a vicious cycle. The main reasons for the flight and dropping out of human talent are that large and medium size state-owned enterprises are in the least favorable position in the intense competition for human talent. They cannot compete with the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, or with township and town enterprises, in earnings. In the probability of making a name for oneself and opportunities to travel abroad, state-owned enterprises cannot compete with educational and scientific research units. In housing, working conditions, and a feeling of being respected, state-owned enterprises cannot compete with administrative institutions. In work freedom, work environment, and income, state-owned enterprises cannot compete with companies of all kinds. Yet another important reason for the flight of human talent is that technicians can more easily put their talents to use in the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and in township and town enterprises, unlike in some large and medium size state-owned enterprises where seniority and age play a role, and where people are not used to the full. This corrodes people's spirit and enthusiasm. Accelerate Building of a Human Talent Corps Informed people believe that the priority task in invigorating the machinery industry is accelerating the creation of a high caliber specialist corps that combines ability and political integrity, and that is sensibly composed. The human talent strategy that the Ministry of Machinery espouses is "maintenance of continuity in the corps, optimization of the make-up, improvement of caliber, and speedy selection for promotion and training of middle agent and young permanent technical cadres and academic leaders so that new technical personnel will be available to replace old technical personnel over the next 10 years. It wants to build a technician corps of good political quality, that has fine professional skills, whose make-up is rational, that is highly trained, and that is imbued with vitality to meet the needs of reform and opening to the outside world, scientific and technical competition, and social development." The specific measures that the Ministry of Machinery has proposed to attain this strategic goal are the founding of a human talent bank, including the establishment first of a high level specialized talent bank, accelerated training of three-in-one talent (technology, management, and sales), and four-in-one talent (technology, management, sales, and foreign language); founding of a human talent exchange center, improvement of enterprises competitiveness, using fair competition as a basis for accurately guiding rational exchanges of human talent; formulation of preferential policies for the importation of scientific and technical management talent; founding a rewards system, increasing investment in education, etc. In short, the establishment of "human talent engineering" is imminent.
