It stressed that linking their release with its support of the Oslo agreement is "a one-upmanship rejected by our mujahidin." Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, said that the movement "has decided not to accept the conditions set by Zionist occupation authorities for releasing our prisoners, namely to pledge not to return to what they termed the pledge to continue terrorist actions, and to support the capitulationist Gaza-Jericho agreement." Ghawshah added in a statement that "the detainees' release is a natural right which should not be linked to the required pledge. Because the resistance against the occupation is a legitimate right in all values and laws known to mankind. Thus it is not right to describe it as a terrorist action. Besides, the detainees cannot abandon a legitimate and national duty they are performing against the occupation."
