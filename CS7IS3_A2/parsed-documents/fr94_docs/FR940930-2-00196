FR940930-2-00196 FR940930-2-00066 Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action The Commission has completed the evaluation to the action and concludes that this action would not significantly increase the probability or amount of expected primary containment leakage. The performance history of Type A leak tests at PBAPS, Unit 2, demonstrates adequate margin to acceptable leak rate limits. No time-based failure mechanisms were identified that would significantly increase expected leak rates over the proposed extended interval. The one historical Type A test failure at PBAPS, Unit 2, in June 1985, was determined to be an activity-related failure which would not be related to an extended test interval. Thus radiological release rates will not differ from those determined previously and would not be expected to result in undetectable leak rates in excess of the values established by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J. Consequently, the probability of accidents would not be increased, nor would the post-accident radiological releases be greater than previously determined. The proposed action does not otherwise affect radiological plant effluents or increase occupational radiation exposures. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact. With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does involve features located entirely within the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action. Alternatives to the Proposed Action Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would result in increased radiation exposure to plant personnel. Alternate Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement for the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3, dated April 1973. Agencies and Persons Consulted The staff consulted with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The state official had no comments. Finding of No Significant Impact Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed action.
