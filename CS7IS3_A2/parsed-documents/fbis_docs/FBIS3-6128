He makes all his ideological and theoretical pursuits and thinking with innovative views and creative stand on the basis of the requirements of the time which is changing and developing. The intelligence of the dear leader in making ideological and theoretical analysis and explanation in conformity with the time and reality finds an expression in that he reviews the history of the revolutionary ideas of the working class from the viewpoint of the times and raises and evolves ideas and theories in a unique way. Notably, he expounded from a new angle that the revolutionary idea of the great Comrade Kim Il-song is composed of the man-centred philosophical world outlook, the revolutionary theory centred on the popular masses and the method of mass leadership. This is, indeed, a unique discovery. When the imperialists were vociferating about the "end of socialism", the dear leader clearly indicated the strategy and tactics to frustrate the anti-socialist moves, defend the socialist cause and carry it through to accomplishment. This is an incomparable exploit he has performed for mankind. As long as there is the idea and theories of the dear leader characteristic of creation and innovation, the Korean people will advance along the road of victory and accomplish the cause of socialism without any turns and twists, no matter how the situation and the circumstances and conditions of the revolution may change. An important characteristic of Comrade Kim Chong-il's idea and theories is that they are run through with most profound pursuit and analysis, rich and diverse contents and are strongly expressive of clairvoyant ideological and theoretical intelligence and scientific foresight. The capacity of pursuit and analysis of Comrade Kim Chong-il is really extraordinary and distinguished. Deeply penetrating thinking, pursuit of discovering new truth by comparing, analysing, reasoning and combining problems and the perfection and plainness of easy-to-understand logics -- these are the ideological and theoretical gifts of the dear leader. He gives many clear-cut ideological and theoretical answers with rich and deep knowledge about the work of the party and people's power, the work of working people's organisations and defence building, industry and agriculture, construction and other domains, philosophy, political economy, history, literature and all other spheres. He has extraordinary intelligence and far-sightness looking farther ahead than any other and indicating the road of victory. He looks forward to a distant future from the present-day situation and the trend of the developing revolution, count ten and a hundred out of one practical fact and set forth a correct idea and theory. The rare clairvoyance of the dear leader is always accurate and most correct because it is based on a scientific penetration relying upon the aspirations of the popular masses and the law governing social development. Comrade Kim Chong-il is not only possessed of gifted ideological and theoretical intelligence and quality but also has conducted tireless ideological and theoretical activities. His rare intelligence and energetic ideological and theoretical activities have brought a great reality, demonstrating an invincible vitality in the accomplishment of the cause of socialism. Korea has been able to successfully build socialism centred on the popular masses, going through rough storms of the revolution because the dear leader comprehensively systematized the chuche idea and developed it in depth in conformity with the developing reality and glorified it as the great guiding idea of the era of independence and has armed the people firmly with it.
