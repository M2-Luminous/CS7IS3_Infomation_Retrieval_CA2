The meeting summed up and exchanged experience in helping poor and mountainous regions in economic development and discussed the policies, measures, and ways for poor and mountainous regions to develop the economy and free themselves from poverty. Responsible comrades of 37 poor counties and mountain counties (cities), as well as the prefectures, cities, and provincial departments concerned, attended the meeting. Lu Rongjing, secretary of the provincial party committee, and Governor Fu Xishou delivered important speeches at the meeting. Wang Zhaoyao, member of the Standing Committee of the provincial party committee and vice governor of Anhui, conveyed to the provincial meeting the guidelines of the national meeting on the work of helping poor regions to develop. Fang Zhaoxiang, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over the meeting and gave a summing-up speech. Other provincial leaders present at the meeting were Yang Yongliang, Wang Taihua, Chen Jiyu, and Wang Sheyun. Also present was Cui Jianxiao, adviser to the provincial leading group the help-the-poor work. In his speech, Lu Rongjing discussed the following five points on how to further understand the great significance of helping poor and mountainous regions in economic development and how to help them shake off poverty and achieve prosperity as soon as possible: 1. Helping poor and mountainous regions achieve prosperity sooner is an important economic task, as well as an important political task, and we must always pay great attention to it. Lu Rongjing said: To wipe out poverty and achieve a common prosperity is the essence of socialism, as well as its superiority. More than one-third of Anhui's counties are rated as poor counties or marginally poor counties and entitled to state and provincial aid, and about one-third of the land in the province is mountainous. It is evident that if the poor and mountainous regions cannot shake off poverty and achieve prosperity soon, they will impede Anhui's economic development and seriously prevent the province from attaining its goal of becoming fairly well-off on schedule. Most of Anhui's mountainous regions are old revolutionary base areas, particularly the Dabieshan region and the southern Anhui mountainous regions. During both the revolutionary war period and the socialist construction period, the people in the mountainous regions have displayed selfless dedication and made great contributions. Over many years, some poor regions along the Chang Jiang and the Huai He have repeatedly made great sacrifices to bear flood losses in the interests of the whole. We have the obligation to help those regions develop faster and make the people there improve their living standards sooner. For this reason, helping poor and mountainous regions achieve prosperity sooner is not only an important economic task, but also an important political task. 2. To Accelerate Development, Poor and Mountainous Regions Must Firmly Establish the Notion of Self-Reliance and Hard Struggle, and Earnestly Rely on Their Own Efforts To Improve Their Situation. Lu Rongjing said: Of course, the government will, as always, help poor and mountainous regions shake off poverty and achieve prosperity sooner. However, those regions must regard the help of the government and others merely as a motive force, and they must mainly rely on their own efforts to improve their backward situation. In development, poor and mountainous regions indeed have great difficulties, but they also have great potential. In particular, they have the advantage of possessing certain natural resources. With a strong desire to shake off poverty and achieve prosperity, the people in those regions have an extremely great initiative and creativity for developing the economy and improving their backward situation. If the masses are widely mobilized, their enthusiasm for braving the elements is aroused, and their potential and strength are brought into play, they will be able to blaze a new trail and truly shake off poverty and achieve prosperity. 3. It Is Necessary To Consider Local Realities, Give Play to Local Strong Points and Salient Features, and Constantly Explore and Improve the Ways of Economic Development for Poor and Mountainous Regions During the Course of Practice. Lu Rongjing said: The practice of reform and development has told us that the concept of economic development has an important bearing on the speed and efficiency of economic development as well as on the changes in the economic situation. The most fundamental way to straighten out an economic development concept is to adhere to the ideological line of "emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts," judge everything by whether it is conducive to the development of productive forces, and respect the initiative of the masses. We should consider local realities, find out the right place to make a breakthrough, and give play to our superiority and salient features. Any development concept which conforms to local realities should be upheld persistently and implemented step by step. 4. It Is Necessary To Fully Understand the Opportunities Created in the Transition From a Planned Economy to a Market Economy and Make Best Use of it To Vigorously Resolve the Prominent Issues Existing in Poor and Mountainous Regions. Lu Rongjing said: Anhui's poor and mountainous regions are endowed with rich natural and human resources. The gradual establishment of a market economy has created unprecedented opportunities and broad prospects for the development of these regions' resources. We must increase our awareness of current opportunities and do everything possible to seize them and take advantage of them. Currently, we must pay special attention to resolving several prominent issues. First, we must use the market as our guide to step up structural adjustment. Second, we must strengthen socialized service and market construction, and we must unclog distribution. Third, we must increase investment and strengthen the building of infrastructure. Fourth, we must improve science and technology education and raise our population's standards. 5. It Is Necessary To Strengthen Leadership Over Work in Poor and Mountainous Regions, Make Concerted Efforts, Pool All our Wisdom and Efforts, and Jointly Fulfill our Important Historic Mission of Helping the Poor Cast Off Poverty and Become Prosperous. Lu Rongjing said: Party committees and governments at all levels in poor and mountainous regions must always help peasants cast off poverty and become prosperous, and they must regard this as their foremost task. As always, they should be duty-bound to strengthen leadership over the work of helping the poor to develop. We must be resolved to earnestly change our leadership and work style, go deep into the grassroots and among the masses, conduct investigation and study in a down-to-earth manner, and earnestly implement policies on helping the poor to develop. We must try to discover models, review our experiences, give different guidance to suit different conditions, and earnestly carry out work in this respect. Grass-roots organizations and cadres play a role that will determine whether or not poor and mountainous regions can accelerate the pace to cast off poverty and become prosperous. We must strengthen the functions of towns and townships through constant in-depth reform to make it possible for town and township party committees and governments to effectively exercise their power, more successfully implement the party's relevant principles and policies, and organize and lead the masses in carrying out development. Village organizations, which are on the frontline of helping the poor to develop, are vital to the success of this work. Therefore, we must earnestly strengthen the building of party branches at the village level, particularly by doing a good job of selecting branch secretaries. We must pay attention to maintaining stability of cadres in poor and mountainous regions; there should not be excessive personnel changes. In his speech, Fu Xishou first analyzed the situation in helping our province's poor and mountainous regions to develop and the tasks facing us. He said: Since the beginning of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the vast number of cadres and masses in our mountainous and poor regions have upheld reform and opening up, relying on themselves to build up their regions through thrift and diligence. As a result, the local economy has developed considerably and their overall strength has increased notably. In 1993, the 37 counties (cities and districts) accounted for 27 billion yuan of the GNP, their gross industrial and agricultural output value reached 47.4 billion yuan, and their revenues totaled 1.4 billion yuan, an increase of 2.5 times, 3.2 times, and 2.2 times, respectively, over 1978. Construction of infrastructure has steadily increased with more than 5,000 kilometers of highway opened to traffic, and program-controlled telephones set up in all of the county towns. Our peasants' per capita income last year was 636 yuan, an increase of 7.4 times that of 1978. The number of people below the poverty line in 21 poor counties has decreased by 3 million from 1985. However, the task of helping the poor to develop in our province is still difficult. As a whole, the economy in the mountainous region is still fairly backward. We must not overestimate our achievements. Fu Xishou pointed out: To accelerate the pace of helping the poor and speed up economic development in poor and mountainous regions, we must successfully carry out the following six tasks in a down-to-earth manner: 1) We must earnestly do well in agriculture to lay a strong foundation for the development of poor and mountainous regions. Anhui's mountainous and poor regions are endowed with rich agricultural resources and have a variety of farm produce. However, its rich resources have not been fully exploited. We must use the market as guide to comprehensively develop their agricultural resources and vigorously develop a type of farming that provides high yields of fine quality with maximum efficiency. With enterprises as the leader, we should link thousands upon thousands of families in the regions with domestic and foreign markets and take the road of forming economic associations that combine agriculture with manufacturing and trade. 2) We must not let up on the development of village and town enterprises but vigorously promote them. We must begin the task by developing whatever projects are possible, based firmly on actual conditions. We should respect peasants' choice of types of ownership and allow them to operate as collectives, individual households, private enterprises, or shareholdings. We should treat everybody equally without discrimination. 3) We must run county-owned industries, particularly state enterprises, effectively. We should strive to follow market changes with interest, strengthen technological transformation, readjust the product mix, and improve enterprise management. 4) We must invigorate commodity circulation as well as concentrate our efforts on establishing transportation carriers and improving the circulation environment. We must do a good job in developing the commodity market and introducing peasants to the market. 5) We must insist on promoting development with reform and opening up. While taking measures to manage collectives' land ownership well, we must strengthen land-use rights. All localities must realistically study and formulate specific methods for quickening forestry and water resource development, so as to centralize as well as bring about collective operations and increased efficiency in land-use. 6) We must meticulously manage our financial and taxation matters to bring them into a better position as soon as possible. Fu Xishou said: Governments and departments at all levels must continue to increase their input in poor and mountainous regions. This year, the state has decided to increase the amount of existing funds, with Anhui's development fund for the poor topping 600 million yuan. We must effectively develop education and assist the poor through science and technology. We must implement the 9-year compulsory education system, develop vocational and technical education, and train personnel in practical and specialized skills. We must mobilize all social forces to jointly undertake the tasks to become well-off. Last year, the provincial government decided to adopt a system whereby provincial departments, cities under the jurisdiction of the provincial government, as well as large- and medium-sized enterprises were asked to help their counterparts in 21 poor counties. The policy will be implemented unchanged for several years until the poor regions cast off poverty. We must encourage well-off regions to help poor regions. And, economically developed regions should take the initiative to help poor and mountainous counties. They should utilize their edges in technology, personnel, market, information, and material resources to develop the resources of poor and mountainous regions through various channels such as economic cooperation, technical services, employment of labor services, and product distribution. They should cooperate with these poor regions in joint development on the basis of mutual benefit and supplementing one another with individual edges. The provincial party committee has decided that, beginning this year, provincial organizations will transfer department-level cadres to work with their counterparts in poor regions. Prefectural (city) and county offices will also transfer cadres to work with townships (towns) and administrative villages to help these regions cast off poverty more quickly. Regarding several specific policies on supporting economic development in mountainous regions, Fu Xishou said: Based on investigation and study, the provincial party committee and government have readjusted some policies on mountainous regions and formulated some new policies and measures, which all localities and relevant provincial departments must earnestly implement.
