[Al-Nashashibi] Among the first questions which we have begun to discuss in the council's meeting is the basic code issue and the appointment of the heads of departments in view of the interviews which the experts committee conducted with the Palestinians nominated for these posts at the council's request in Amman in late March. [Khashanah] Is it true that the problem between the PLO on the one hand and the United States and the World Bank on the other regarding the council's formation was solved at the recent Christopher-'Arafat meeting in Cairo? [Al-Nashashibi] That is true. [Khashanah] Did the agreement on the transfer of powers signed in Cairo by 'Arafat and Rabin fulfill the Palestinian leadership's expectations of the meeting? [Al-Nashashibi] The important thing is for the agreement to fulfill the Palestinian people's aspiration to freedom and independence. That depends on our people's continuation of the struggle for the sake of their aims. Because the agreement in its present form does not achieve the necessary steps leading to an independent Palestinian state. However, I am confident that our people will struggle competently to regain their rights in full. [Khashanah] How will the outstanding issues be resolved? [Al-Nashashibi] Experience with Israel so far does not inspire optimism about an imminent solution to the outstanding issues. However, our determination to achieve what we have not yet agreed upon at this stage is the means to recover our rights. [passage omitted] [Khashanah] To what extent does the economic accord signed in Paris between the PLO and Israel sever the linkage between the Palestinian and Israeli economies? [Al-Nashashibi] The accord reduces the chances of severing the linkage and perpetuates Israel's control over the Palestinian economy. The preamble stipulates that "the two sides should continue to cooperate in the economic sphere in order to establish a sound economic foundation on which joint relations would develop" -- which conflicts with our basic aim of building an economy free from the subservience imposed by Israeli authorities during the occupation. I believe that the preamble should have stipulated that the Palestinian people have the right to establish their own independent national economy in accordance with the states' and peoples' economic charter endorsed by the United Nations and which guarantees "the peoples' right to build their own national economies away from any foreign intervention."
