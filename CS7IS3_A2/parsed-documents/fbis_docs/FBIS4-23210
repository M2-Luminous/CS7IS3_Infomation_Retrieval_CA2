The warring sides have begun a process that is hoped will end the fighting which has left an estimated half million people dead. Representatives of the rebel and government armies held their first direct talks on Monday [30 May] to discuss the draft cease-fire prepared by the UN Mission in Rwanda. Meanwhile, there have been reports of continued fighting and dramatic movement of refugees. The Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] says the situation is getting worse by the hour. Dateline [Swiss Radio current affairs program] asked ICRC representative Tony Burgener about the importance of the talks on the humanitarian situation. [Begin recording] [Burgener] What we can hope is one point, that definitely the humanitarian issue is brought up immediately. I mean that it has to be--that it is going to be--separated from the political talks, that this one is taken into consideration. There are hundreds and thousands people now stranded. They need assistance. We, the international organizations, have to be enabled to bring in the food, the water, the medical assistance, whatever is needed, to these people. This has to be a point that has to be treated with first priority. [Unidentified correspondent] Do you have contacts with either side in your efforts, in your program--relief program? [Burgener] Of course, we are working in full transparency with both sides. We are informing them [of] whatever we are doing. This is absolutely necessary. We have to start talks on high level with authorities on either side and this of course we hope, facilitates our work also in the coming days, and that also the awareness of the humanitarian disaster which is taking place, not only in the area of Gitarama, of course. There are other areas also in the FPR [Rwanda Patriotic Front] zone, where hundreds and thousands of people are displaced, where also help is needed. All this, of course, needs the full understanding of both parties. [Correspondent] What are the main difficulties in getting supplies to the refugees? It seems that air supplies are irregular at best coming into Kigali. What are the main difficulties? [Burgener] Well, it's even difficult to talk about about main difficulties. I mean, it's almost absolutely impossible to bring in anything to this area right now since the roads are blocked, the airport does not work, and after all when you see this huge quantity of people who are staying around there--half a million people--to find supplies for them is very very difficult, the logistical problems which we are faced to [as heard], all this gives us a real, real headache. It's very, very difficult to bring in whatever they need, and they need just everything. They need food, they need water, they need medical assistance, they need also sanitary equipment because there is a risk of epidemics. The only way to do it would be probably from the western side, from Kibuye [on the shores of Lake Kivu facing eastern Zaire], towards Gitarama. This road is still open and we definitely will try our best to do whatever we can do. [Correspondent] Now, the thing is, Gitarama is a target for the rebels in the fighting. How secure is Gitarama as a refugee point? [Burgener] Well, first of all, there is no way for them this time to get out of this area. There is no other possibility to go whatever place if it's not Kibuye. Definitely those who can go further on of Gitarama they will try to do it. From that point of view it's very important that both parties, all parties understand that the humanitarian issue is very important, that it has to be given priority when they are meeting today.
