Today a Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that the departure of the Blue Helmets is, I quote, an option among others, while stressing the negative consequences that such a decision would entail. Some of the French Blue Helmets have arrived back at their barracks in Frejus . Sandra Smit and Didier Beaumont report: [Smit] [passage omitted] The defense minister made a point of paying tribute to the men of the 21st Regiment of Marines in Frejus, but also to the 9,000 French troops still deployed on the ground. [passage omitted] As Francois Leotard stressed, the political decisions of the UN take precedence over the demands of the military authorities. Since the outbreak of the Bosnian conflict, several generals have overstepped the rules. In the defense minister's view, this is no chance coincidence and the United Nations should reconsider the matter: [Begin Leotard recording] We believe that if there is a crisis, it is not a crisis between France and the United Nations. It is a crisis within the United Nations itself, with particular reference to its ability to handle situations as complex as that obtaining in the former Yugoslavia, to the chain of command, and also to the infirmity of the general staff in New York, which is obviously not adapted to this type of situation. [end recording] [Smit] Francois Leotard will soon be sending a memorandum to the United Nations, asking for very clear guidelines on the terms governing the use of the French troops, and above all on whether they are needed at all.
