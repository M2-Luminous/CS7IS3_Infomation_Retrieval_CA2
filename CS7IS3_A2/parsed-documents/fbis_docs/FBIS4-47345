The proposed plan calls for developing a monitoring system that is based on an automated system of current information and that includes five main components as follows: - ecological monitoring; - nuclear power plant monitoring; - an emergency control point; - a crisis center; - an automated radiation situation monitoring system. The ecological monitoring component calls for developing an automated system of up-to-date information on Ukraine's environment and forecasts of any changes therein. The nuclear power plant monitoring will, through an automated system, provide current information regarding the condition of the environment of rayons with nuclear power plants and will also forecast changes likely to occur therein. These forecasts will be based on numerous data sources, including meteorological, geophysical, hydrological, geochemical, hydrogeological, aerologic, actinometric, radiometric, biological, and special medical observations. These forecasts will be used to plan environmental protection measures and measures to recover materials released from nuclear power plants. The emergency control point will serve as the site where recommendations are formulated regarding emergency measures to be taken at nuclear power plants and from which technical and organizational assistance can be provided to individuals managing emergency, rescue, and restoration operations during the clearing of accidents, catastrophes, natural disasters, or damage inflicted on nuclear power plants as a result of sabotage or military actions. The control center will also maintain communications with government and social organizations. The automated radiation situation monitoring system will monitoring and forecast radiation situations at nuclear power plants, in exclusion zones, and in observation zones during normal plant operations and in the event of an accident. The routing of information from source to user will vary depending on the type of monitoring being conducted (i.e., regular, operational, special). The exact interaction between the various monitoring system elements is still being worked out. Figure 1.
