But Only A Real Manager Can Extract It From There"] [Text] It is an indisputable fact, as they say, that the fuel service base in the army and navy has come to a halt in its development. Most of it was built more than 30 years ago, during the missile-fuel boom, when the fuel service provided full support for the launching of missiles into space, the emergence of the navy onto the world ocean and increased motorization of the army. The base has recently become fairly obsolete, however, and since the collapse of the Union it has found itself in an altogether critical state. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA raised the need to renew this very important material base at the beginning of last year. The report was titled "Where Are We to Get Two and a Half Billion?" Today, in view of the fact that we have not managed to solve the problem and that prices have spiraled to hundreds of times what they were, a trillion would not be enough. Just what can be done? Necessity, as they say, is the mother of invention. The solution was made easier by the fact that the interests of the fuel service coincided with the nation's economic interests. More precisely, those of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, which has recently begun experiencing a shortage of containers and pumping equipment, and simply of space. In the armed forces, on the contrary, due to a shortage of fuel and lubricants (caused by inadequate financing), fuel bases and depots are idle, and everything is being off-loaded directly into the military units and onto the ships. Incidentally, empty containers corrode more rapidly.... So why not help the Ministry of Fuel and Energy with the transfer, storage and distribution of petroleum products, and thereby earn some money for improving and renovating the materials and equipment base? The Central Missile Fuel Directorate came out with an initiative to this effect. And it was supported by the Rear Services of the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense, and then by higher authorities. Decree No. 219, "On the Construction of and the Renovation of Operating Petroleum Transshipment Facilities," issued by the government on 14 March 1993, specifically authorized the Fuel Service of the Armed Forces to take part in this undertaking. In other words, the military bases and depots were given the opportunity to provide services for outside, civilian organizations for a charge and without detriment to the combat training. In accordance with this decree, the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation issued Order No. 355 on 15 July of last year, with an appendix listing the bases and depots authorized to provide services, and also containing complete regulations on their activities. What do these documents say? I took this question to Major-General P. Gorupay, chief of the Central Missile Fuel Directorate of the Ministry of Defense. "These documents are extremely important to us," Pavel Ivanovich said. "They are based on an agreement between the base and an outside organization. They include a list of services, diverse services: The transfer of liquid petroleum products from reinforced concrete tanks to the reservoirs of bases and depots, the unloading of apportioned fuel into storage facilities and at open sites, the chemical analysis of oil, technical assistance with the accounting, the allocation of vehicles for hauling the fuel, the provision of depot sites and containers for storing various materials, and so forth. The charges for the services are open but no lower than the current market prices in the given area. Rigid monitoring is specified to prevent possible violations." I was told at the Central Directorate that there is rapid development of the fuel service for the Moscow, Volga and Leningrad districts, the Northern and Baltic Fleets. The military fuel base located at Murmansk, for example, concluded a one-year agreement with the Murmansk Maritime Shipping Line on the transferring of petroleum products. Payments under the agreement should amount to more than one million dollars. For six months now a Baltic Fleet fuel base has been transferring fuel belonging to a large joint enterprise--under an agreement permitting this, of course--with visible results. A major overhaul of the railroad platform and the pipeline have been carried out with the several million dollars earned, several pumping units have been installed with the assistance of the Swedes, and the installation of standing tanks is underway. Even a service on a lesser scale is profitable. The central base located at Naro-Fominsk has concluded an agreement with one of the enterprises whereby incoming motor transport equipment is off-loaded and stored on the latter's tracks. The amount involved is 600,000 rubles per day. The base at which A. Kustov is chief does not have much space, but it is within the Moscow city limits. He said that an agreement has been reached on the storage of expensive assemblies and devices, for which the charge is considerably greater.... In short, the minister's order has opened up extensive possibilities. Some people have taken it the wrong way, however. Some of them are in no rush to execute it. There is plenty of time, they say, and have not taken the initiative to look for customers. There have also been overly clever "executives." Colonel V. Basalayev, chief of a fuel dump, conducted operations involving petroleum products for a joint-stock company not at the market price, as should have been the case, but at a preferential price. There would have to be some abuses, of course. This incident was rapidly halted, and all of the fuel services were apprised of it. Additional problems arose for the fuel service. Additional personnel are needed for organizing the services and for strict, universal monitoring: Financial experts, economists, legal experts and others. This was taken into account in the order issued by the Minister of Defense. A group consisting of three officers and two civilian employees is being added to the T/O of the Central Directorate, to be maintained out of income from the services provided. The group exists only on paper for now, to be sure. It has been impossible thus far to arrange all of the necessary formalities.
