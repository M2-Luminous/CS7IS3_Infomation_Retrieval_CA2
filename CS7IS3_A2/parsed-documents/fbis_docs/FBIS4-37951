The Government of Pakistan condemns such wanton acts of terrorism, wherever they are committed and whosoever is responsible for them. The spokesman recalled that the Government of Pakistan had issued several public appeals for the release of the kidnapped Britons. Their return, safe and unharmed, is a matter of profound relief. The spokesman expressed the hope that Britain and other peace-loving states would use their influence with India to persuade the latter to end its repression in Indian-held Kashmir which is undoubtedly responsible for driving the hapless Kashmiris into committing such desperate acts.
