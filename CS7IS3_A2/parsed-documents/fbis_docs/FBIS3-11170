The increase was one of the issues discussed by Cardoso with the representative of Brazil's creditor banks in New York today. [Begin recording] [Reporter Paulo Henrique Amorim] After the meeting, Bill Rhodes, the banks' representative, said that tomorrow afternoon he will send a document to all creditor banks recommending the approval of the Brazilian proposal to replace the IMF loan with U.S. Government certificates purchased by the Brazilian Government. Bill Rhodes believes the fact that Brazil has not obtained a loan yet from the IMF will not prevent the agreement with Brazil from being signed as scheduled on 15 April. Minister Cardoso said Brazil has enough exchange reserves to sign an agreement with the banks without problems. I asked Bill Rhodes if he believes Brazil will be able to maintain a balanced budget even after the Chamber of Deputies approved a salary increase for deputies. Rhodes said he does not discuss Brazilian domestic issues but believes Minister Cardoso will make the economic plan be fulfilled. I asked the same question to Minister Cardoso. [Cardoso] I believe the Senate will have the political knowledge to understand the current situation and correct what I find unforgivable: the increase approved at a time when Brazil needs austerity, when we are asking not to increase workers' salaries in general. There is no justification for the deputies to approve a salary increase for themselves, and there would not be any justification for the Senate to do the same either. [end recording]
