FBIS4-4854 "dreas066_a_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Hosokawa Reiterates Resignation Remarks Denial Hosokawa Reiterates Resignation Remarks Denial OW0604042694 Tokyo KYODO in English 0416 GMT 6 Apr 94 OW0604042694 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Wednesday [6 April] he has no intention of giving up the premiership, reiterating his denial of reported remarks by him that he wants to quit, officials close to the premier's Japan New Party (JNP) said. The officials said the premier told a JNP legislator over breakfast, "I neither said such a thing nor have I developed such an idea. I am dismayed." He was referring to reported remarks by two legislators that he said Tuesday he wants to resign. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, however, told a news conference, "Given the circumstances, the premier should not make remarks indicating he might step down." Takemura denied the incident will affect the Diet budget debate, currently stalled by a dispute between the ruling coalition and the opposition camp over Hosokawa's allegedly dubious personal finances. The chief cabinet secretary spoke of the need for the government to redouble efforts to achieve a breakthrough in the stalled Diet business next week. Hosokawa told reporters early Wednesday that he has not said anything about resigning over dinner Tuesday evening at a Japanese-style restaurant in Tokyo with two legislators of the House of Councillors. One of the two legislators, Yasushi Shimomura of the Niin Club, a small political party, quoted Hosokawa as telling him and his colleague Kiyoshi Nishikawa, "I want to resign as I am exhausted." Nishikawa confirmed what Shimomura said but added he took the premier's remark as a joke. In the stalled Diet budget proceedings, the opposition has pressed the premier to account for his 1982 acceptance of 100 million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin Trucking Network, a conglomerate at the center of a scandal involving gangsters, politicians and money. Hosokawa described the 100 million yen as a loan but legislators of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) said they suspect it is an unreported political donation. The opposition camp has also demanded summoning Hosokawa's former Financial Secretary Masatoshi Miyama to testify in the Diet on allegations that Hosokawa distributed the money in 1982 to Kumamoto Prefectural Assembly legislators during his campaign to secure the governorship of the prefecture. Hosokawa has rejected the demand to have Miyama testify. Meanwhile, the premier's coalition partners scrambled to defend him Wednesday morning. Kozo Watanabe, a Shinseito leader, told reporters, "Whether it is a lawmaker or cabinet minister, it can happen that a person develops a desire to resign when the person is going through difficult times." "I think his remarks were carelessly uttered," Watanabe said. Shinseito is a key member of the seven-party ruling coalition. Watanabe also told reporters, "I believe the prime minister has not renounced his determination to continue to live up to his prime ministerial duties." The reported resignation remarks "were a mere happening whose repercussions will fade away in a day," Watanabe said. Watanabe said he contacted Hosokawa by telephone Tuesday night to ask him about his reported resignation remark. Watanabe quoted Hosokawa as telling him, "It puzzles me why it has caused such a stir. I do not have any desire to do so." Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters, "The prime minister denied that he made such remarks. We really have to take his denial at face value. He has demonstrated his desire to exercise his power." Murayama also denied that the reported remark will affect the political situation. Another senior SDP official, however, said of the premier's reported remarks, "Without question, the premier has lost his nerve." The SDP is the largest coalition party. A senior official of new party Sakigake, also a coalition partner, said, "Whether the premier made that statement or not, he will not be able to revive his fortunes. The political situation has become fluid."
