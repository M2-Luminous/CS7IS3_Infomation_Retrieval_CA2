Might it have come from a Russian military arsenal? [Dyakov] That cannot be ruled out. But controls over radioactive components in Russian military nuclear facilities are still quite stringent. The quantities of plutonium that have appeared on the black market and can be used in weapons are very small. No one can make a bomb out of that. [Rybak] Can plutonium for use in weapons be obtained during the process of dismantling warheads? [Dyakov] Russia destroyed some 2,000 warheads last year. This took place under strict supervision. [Rybak] In that case, where are the loopholes? The theft and smuggling of radioactive substances is reaching frightening proportions! [Dyakov] The situation is fully under control in all the facilities under the authority of the Nuclear Ministry. But because the wages of most employees are not enough to subsist on, many of them try to earn extra money. Unfortunately, one way of doing that is by stealing and selling radioactive substances. [Rybak] Can one not control the handling of these substances more stringently? [Dyakov] That is very difficult. Noone knows exactly how much plutonium and uranium are produced in civilian reactors. That does not apply only to Russia. In the entire world there are no exact figures, just estimates. [Rybak] Weapons-grade plutonium is still being produced in Russia. When will the military reactors be shut down? [Dyakov] Weapons-grade plutonium is produced in three reactors in Russia. The press claims that they will be closed down this year. That is nonsense. These reactors also produce electricity and provide heating for the neighboring cities of Krasnoyarsk and Tomsk. Only when there is an alternative can they be shut down. That is out of the question before the year 2000. But we are prepared to place under intentional control every gram of plutonium we produce. The relevant document has already been drafted. [Rybak] Could the West offer more effective help? [Dyakov] The Americans have already promised us lots of money just to dismantle the warheads. Now they want to provide us with gas-fueled power stations in exchange for the shutdown of the nuclear ones. I am skeptical about that, because so far we have only received a smidgen of this loudly proclaimed assistance.
