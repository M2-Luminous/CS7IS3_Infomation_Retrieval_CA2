It was noted that the situation in these sectors is critical and is continuing to get more acute. The amounts of fuel and energy resources recovered and produced have been decreasing for a long time. According to the Russian State Committee on Statistics [Goskomstat], the total volume of industrial production at enterprises of the fuel and energy complex in the first half of the year has decreased (in prices comparable with the very same period last year) by 13.8 percent. In 1992, the decrease amounted to 11.3 percent. The greatest decreases were in recovery of oil and gas condensate (13.9 percent), production of gasolines for motor vehicles (14.4 percent), and production of diesel fuel (15.4 percent). The operation of individual enterprises in the complex and in its sectors as a whole has been paralyzed by the acute financial crisis. Market offerings of fuel and energy resources often surpass the demand of customers capable of paying for them. As a result, oil refineries have become overstocked with petroleum products, especially mazut, and have stopped accepting oil for refining. This has forced a cutback in oil recovery and the shutdown of operational wells. The provision of petroleum products for harvest operations in a number of regions and the creation of winter fuel reserves and fuel shipments to rayons in the Far North are danger of being interrupted. Because of big flaws in price and tax policy, the complex's enterprises cannot form their own financial sources to develop production under the conditions of a market economy. Clear-cut proposals regarding changing the ratio of prices for energy resources and processing sector's products, reducing the tax component in fuel and energy prices, and taking measures to provide tax incentives for priority directions of the activity of fuel and energy complex enterprises have yet to be formulated. Industry's investment complex is under the threat of collapse. In January through June of this year, very important construction jobs were financed at only 12.5 percent of the approved annual limit of budgetary allocations. The anticipated start-up of production facilities and facilities in the social sphere has been estimated to be 10-30 percent below the last year's level and will not exceed 50 percent of their 1988 level. Because of their high interest rate, government-issued loans are unacceptable for financing new construction or reconstruction and modernization of very important facilities. The board approved a plan of action that included a broad set of measures: development and consideration by the Russian Federation government of a draft decision regarding a mechanism for giving priority to development of the sectors of fuel and energy complex and its state support partly by budgetary financing, investments in very important construction projects, and retention of unappropriated regulation funds for 1994-1995 (obtained by deductions from product production costs). Also very important are steps such as developing the conceptual principles of a pricing policy for the fuel and energy complex's products and accelerating the Russian Government's consideration of the drafts of the laws ``Concerning Oil and Gas,'' ``Concerning the Foundations of a Federal Energy Policy,'' and ``Concerning Energy Conservation'' and the special federal program Fuel and Energy. According to the approved plan, special emphasis is to be placed on the need for quick consideration in the Russian Federation Council of Ministers of proposals to reduce the tax rate on the sale of fuel and lubricant materials to 10 percent. In accordance with the board's decision, a rush report regarding the critical financial situation of the complex's enterprises will be sent to V.S. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Council of Ministers. The report will include an urgent request for his personal intervention in speeding up resolution of the fundamental questions regarding stabilizing the situation in the complex's sector.
