This was the reason we asked its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Josef Prokes, for an interview. [Marek] Only recently you were the commander of the 71th airborne battalion. Without having to change places, you became practically overnight the commander of the 43d mechanized airborne brigade. What is the difference between these two units? [Prokes] I would rather begin with what the two brigades have in common. They are located in Chrudim and they are airborne units. But they differ in their character and mission. The new brigade will be, as is, after all, indicated by its name, an airborne unit. It will therefore be possible to deploy it by parachute drop. But at the same time it also will be mechanized, which indicates its other possible insertion into combat--on personnel carriers. [Marek] Will there be some difference in the training of the unit presently being formed compared to the former airborne battalion? [Prokes] There will be no substantive difference in training. In certain areas the content will be changed. But these will be relatively small changes. [Marek] Speaking about the names--isn't it a pity that the 71st battalion, which already has its own tradition, its image, is being renamed the 43d? [Prokes] I agree with you, it is a pity. Number 71 has its own history, which goes back to World War II. We were interested in having it at least appear under its historic name. But in view of the reorganization and renumbering of the entire army it was impossible for our wish to be granted. [Marek] You mentioned that the brigade is mechanized. What kind of equipment will it have? [Prokes] Primarily wheeled, unarmored vehicles. [Marek] What would these be at present? [Prokes] For the time being, mainly UAZ all-terrain vehicles. Before long, however, we should be getting new equipment. Mentioned are Mercedes and other latest generation all-terrain vehicles. [Marek] At the present time the battalion is being transformed and provided with additional troops. Will you be able to start training by 1 July 1994? [Prokes] Basically, training was never interrupted, it goes on in perfect continuity. The battalion is merely being supplemented with additional servicemen. The deadlines for forming the unit are relatively short. However, I am convinced that we can meet them. [Marek] Can you envision a situation when the parliament decides, for example in six months, to deploy the brigade in some combat mission? Would you be able to handle it? [Prokes] As I said already, the brigade will be formed by 1 July. We shall meet that deadline. [Marek] Are you satisfied with the quality of the people you are getting? Are they real professionals? [Prokes] Most of the additional people we are getting have served in functions commensurate with those to which they are being assigned. The problem could be only in the fact that someone was, for example, a commander of a motorized rifle platoon and now he will command paratroopers. When we place a beret on an officer's head, it does not mean that he automatically becomes a paratrooper. He will have to learn some things. But if the person is only a little competent and has certain prerequisites, that should not present any great problems. [Marek] Are these people in sufficiently good physical condition? [Prokes] That is an individual matter. However, the majority of platoon commanders are young people who are in appropriate physical condition. [Marek] Do you try to make the training as interesting as possible, make it as close to real combat conditions as possible? [Prokes] It's not that we are trying. It is one of the basic principles which we have been following for a long time. There is much greater interest among the soldiers in that kind of training. When you are interested in what you are doing, it is much more effective than if it is merely something you are ordered to do. [Marek] How many times a year, for example, does a soldier fire a submachine gun? [Prokes] There is no firing range in Chrudim, and that is causing us some problems. We have to travel to one. In spite of that, our soldiers have the opportunity to fire at least once or twice every month. [Marek] Do you also practice reflexive firing? [Prokes] For the time being, the rules do not make it possible for us to do that. But if there should be a change, such practice should be interesting and useful.
