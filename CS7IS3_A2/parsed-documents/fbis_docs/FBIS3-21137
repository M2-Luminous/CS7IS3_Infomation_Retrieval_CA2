In the past, it was believed that the density of liquid silicon changed in a linear manner, but when researchers measured the density with a measuring device they developed, they found that the rate of change in density was different depending on the temperature region, and they also confirmed that the density changed over time. By controlling the liquid silicon with these parameters, it should be possible to improve the quality of silicon crystals when they are pulled [Czochralski Process] and also to increase the yield. These results were announced on 10 December at the meeting to report on research in Operations To Promote Innovative Science and Technology at JRDC held at the Keidanren Hall in Otemachi, Tokyo. To measure the density of the liquid precisely in the Kimura Project, a method based on Archimedes Principle was adopted that uses a dual probe to cancel the effect of surface tension when a float with a constant volume is submerged in the liquid. The float is made of graphite and coated with silicon carbide like a crucible to give it heat resistance. This enables highly precise measurements to an accuracy of 1%. Researchers measured the density of silicon liquid with this device. When they plotted a graph of density vs. temperature, they found that the slope of the change in density (temperature dependency) was different in three separate regions. Density is an important quantity reflecting the number of atoms and the distance between adjacent atoms. Until now it was believed that the density decreased linearly and that silicon liquid changed linearly from a semiconductor to a metal. However, with this recent confirmation that the slope of the change in density is different in low-, mid-, and high-temperature regions, researchers now believe that when silicon first begins to melt it forms giant aggregates of atoms (clusters) with covalent bonds, in the mid-temperature range it becomes a mixture of metallic atoms and chains of atoms with covalent bonds, and in the high-temperature range the atoms all become metallic. Temperature Dependency of Density in Liquid Silicon Researchers also studied the change of density over time at 1431ï¿½C, which is the boundary between the low- and mid-temperature regions. After melting began, the density rose for three hours and then gradually fell off. Researchers believe this means that the covalent bonds require time to be broken, and this phenomenon appears as a change in density over time. The discovery of this phenomenon provides the first scientific corroboration of know-how learned through experience at silicon crystal-pulling sites such as the saying: ``You get high quality crystals if you wait two or three hours after melting before you pull.'' Researchers have not only obtained some clues on controlling the liquid by noting this change in its properties, but this discovery also opens the door to a dramatic reduction in the density of defects in pulled crystals, etc.
