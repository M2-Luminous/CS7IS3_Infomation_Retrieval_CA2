[Italian Social Movement (MSI) Secretary] Gianfranco Fini carried the MSI public with him. He received loud applause for his opposition to Scalfaro at the last day of the congress that ratified the "swing" toward the "grand right" of the National Alliance. Fini asked the audience: "Do you know what the left will do if it accedes to government? It will allow Scalfaro to retain his post after 27 March. And this is unacceptable...." More applause. After leaving the platform, he added: "I have said it, and I repeat it. I do not consider it appropriate for Scalfaro, who was involved in that mysterious business concerning the intelligence services, to continue in his post...." Nor would just any change of president be acceptable. "What if they bring in Jotti? Can you imagine that? Keep in mind that she does have a chance. She is a woman, she had a role in the Resistance...." They devoured him with their eyes, both friends sand enemies, as they experienced differing emotions. The die is cast. Now there will be no compromise. Did anyone think that the Alliance was merely "a tactical move designed to gain a few more members of parliament?" They will have to think again, Fini warned. The National Alliance, of which the MSI is the linchpin, "is a great blueprint for the future." Fini was not intimidated by the presence in the front row of Assunta Almirante [widow of former MSI Secretary Giorgio Almirante]; her daughter, Giuliana Almirante (who drew more attention thanks to memories of her father); or Alessandra Mussolini, the duce's granddaughter. Nor was he influenced by the awkward condemnation -- though it did not lead to a separation -- issued by [MSI ideologue Pino] Rauti ("Did we establish the Republic of Salo just to achieve economic liberalism, just to introduce Coca-Cola?") Fini dealt with the internal dissidents. Even the Nazi skinheads appeared, brandishing a banner, then disappeared, removed by the security guards. The time has come to look after the allies. "There is an understanding" with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and the Christian Social group. The same values apply -- God, the family, the homeland -- as can be seen from the television propaganda. Negotiations with the League are more difficult. Fini did not rule out the possibility of a "technical agreement." "Some headway" could be made together, but only on the following conditions: The League must resolve the uncertainty over national unity, must say whether there is one republic or three; then it will be possible to start negotiating. How? By secretly sharing out constituencies, one in exchange for another? No, that would be too "petty," too restricted. Any agreement, the MSI secretary said, must "materialize out in the open." No secret trysts, no secret love affairs. Only agreements on policy and on the constituencies, with equal "status." Carlo Tassi did not give a damn for all this; he defied this congress for renewal by giving a fascist salute from the stage and by bringing with him [French National Front leader] Le Pen's second-in-command as an unofficial guest. Although he lives in Piacenza, he has always bought cars with Como license plates, to avoid the letters "PC" [for Piacenza and communist party]. He was heard to say: "The agreement with the League is fait accompli.... We will give him a real shafting." These may be mere quips. But one thing is certain: The dance of rapprochement will not be easy. Fini refuses to take "the first steps, either direct or indirect"; he wants no "ambassadors." If [Northern League Secretary] Bossi so desires, he is willing to negotiate; otherwise, never mind. He will shoulder the "responsibility" for a possible victory by the left-wing forces. But Bossi "cannot lose if he wants to retain his leadership." Leadership is indeed one of the problems for the right-wing alignment (Fini does not like the adjective, "moderate" -- "it smacks of compromise.") The chances of an accord depend also on who is put forward as the next prime minister. Berlusconi or Bossi? As, Fini has already said: "The indication of a prime minister may be important to the public, but it is not obligatory. I would have no hesitation in choosing between Bossi and Berlusconi. I would opt for Berlusconi because he has potential in both the North and the South, whereas Bossi can only be a leader in the North."
