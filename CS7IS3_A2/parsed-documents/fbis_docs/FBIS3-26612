Shanghai's economic and urban construction as well as social development will enter an important phase in 1994 with more emphasis being laid on the financial front. Huang Ju passed on these remarks when he addressed the Shanghai municipal financial work meeting yesterday. In his speech, Huang Ju fully affirmed results achieved by the financial system. [passage omitted] On work to be carried out in 1994, Huang Ju said: Various reform and construction programs to be carried out in Shanghai this year will be very arduous; their implementation will depend on the financial circles' support. He forwarded four demands to Shanghai's financial system: First, it is necessary to conscientiously study Volume Three of "The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," thoroughly understand its spirit and substance, unify thinking and understanding, and make efforts to create a new socialist financial situation under which financial departments will be charged with the responsibility of exercising macroeconomic regulation and control. Second, it is necessary to firmly implement the state's monetary policy by placing total credit volumes under strict control. Shanghai must foster the concept of taking the whole nation as a chess game and resolutely carry out the central authorities' policies. On the premise of placing total credit volumes under strict control, various financial organizations should intensify fund-raising and financing, broaden sources of both credits and funds, strengthen funds deployment, speed up cash flow, and gradually enhance and improve the ability to flexibly exercise macroeconomic regulation and control. Besides, Shanghai's financial departments should contribute to economic restructuring by stepping up research on enterprise reform and the creation of a new enterprise system. Third, on the basis of correctly handling relations among reform, development, and stability, Shanghai's financial circles should grasp the opportunity to actively and steadily promote financial reform and opening up. Fourth, we should persist in maintaining the high quality of financial personnel. Leaders at various levels should attach greater importance to fighting corruption and building a management system, prevent and curb economic crimes, and uphold the principle of "fostering both material progress and cultural and ideological progress" by strengthening the building of spiritual civilization within the financial system.
