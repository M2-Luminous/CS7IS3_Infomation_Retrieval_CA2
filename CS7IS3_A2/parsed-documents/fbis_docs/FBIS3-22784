There is a growing threat of local conflicts with the use of weapons of mass destruction on our southern flanks. This seemingly pessimistic prognosis is shared today by many military practicians. Does the Russian leadership have information about real nuclear arsenals and programmes of "threshold" and "near-threshold" countries located on Russia's perimeter? This is the subject of an interview MN correspondent Vladimir Orlov had with Gennady Yevstafyev, head of the department of control over arms and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction of Russia's External Intelligence Service. MOSCOW NEWS correspondent: Do you share concern about the "new nuclear encirclement of Russia?" Gennady Yevstafyev: Only partially. Let me remind you that a conference for the prolongation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is scheduled to take place in 1995. I hope that it will be possible by that time to broaden by joint efforts the composition of the Treaty's participants and to prevent the appearance of new nuclear states, even in intermediary or temporary terms. But there still remain places in the world which give me cause for real worry... Correspondent: Can you give examples? Name at least three of them, in the order of diminishing danger. Gennady Yevstafyev: First, North Korea; second, Israel; third, India and Pakistan. [Boxed item] MOSCOW NEWS File According to the date of Western research centres Israel may possess nearly 200 nuclear warheads or material for their immediate manufacture; India has 60 nuclear warheads and Pakistan 15. North Korea is capable of manufacturing one or two nuclear bombs. Iran will be able to have nuclear weapons of its own after eight or ten years. [end boxed item] Correspondent: Let us consider North Korea. Gennady Yevstafyev: We agree with the common conclusion of international experts. The leadership of North Korea has been trying for a long time to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Delivery vehicles have also been developed successfully. One of the stages of this development were the recent tests of the improved Scud missile. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been actively pursuing an applied military programme in the nuclear sphere which is today, in the opinion of the External Intelligence Service, at an advanced state of development. Correspondent: Why then has North Korea "frozen" its military nuclear programme? Gennady Yevstafyev: There are two reasons. The first one is international pressure. The second is financial and technical difficulties within North Korea which is unable to carry the burden of the immense cost of the development of weapons of mass destruction. I know that it is understood in Washington that the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] has not yet developed such weapons, and has not yet made real combat devices. Nor does Hans Blix, Director-General of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency], believe that the DPRK has nuclear weapons. The External Intelligence Service also believes that the DPRK's nuclear programme is now in a frozen state and that in certain conditions the North Koreans are evidently prepared to stop it altogether and open it fully to inspection. Pyongyang's recent consent to have "gas-graphite" reactors replaced with light-water ones is a sign that the DPRK is ready to suspend part of its military programmes. But there is one point which requires explanation. The fact that the DPRK decided to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty and sought to prevent control by IAEA inspectors has caused another knot to develop. Pyongyang has held up its withdrawal from the Treaty as a result of the dialogue between the DPRK and the United States and the monolithic position of the world community. But the interruption in IAEA control activity is not a point in favour of the North Korean leadership. I would further like to note that the process of the transfer of power in the DPRK is still being completed. In these conditions everyone should display special caution and discretion in order not to fuel the situation which is already tense as it is. The Americans display admirable firmness when they state to Pyongyang the view of the world community on the unacceptability of deviating from international treaties. At the same time it is no secret that the United States is fulfilling its own national foreign-policy interests in the region. The DPRK, on its part, plays for its own high stakes in its "nuclear dialogue" with the Americans. The conclusion follows that Russia, too, should proceed for its own interests in the matter of ensuring security in the Far East. Correspondent: Israel is next on your list. It is no secret that it unofficially possesses nuclear weapons as well as advanced missile delivery vehicles... Gennady Yevstafyev: Israelis themselves confirm this with pleasure in informal talks. Nuclear material of weapon purity is accumulated with the help of a heavy-water reactor and an installation for processing irradiated fuel (they are not controlled by IAEA). Their capacity is enough for manufacturing nuclear material for 5-10 warheads a year. A reactor of 26 megawatt capacity was commissioned in 1963 with the help of France and was modernized during the 70's. After its capacity was increased to 75-150 megawatts the production of weapon plutonium could have grown from 7-8 to 50 kilogrammes a year. The installation for the processing of irradiated fuel was also built with the help of a French firm. It can produce 15-40 kilogrammes of weapon plutonium a year. In other words, Israel could have manufactured up to 20 warheads during the 70's-80's and now may possess as many as 200. These calculations can be corrected, of course, depending on the specific technical conditions. The high scientific and technological potential enables Israel to improve the designs of nuclear weapons, for instance, to develop small-size versions as well. Correspondent: As far as I know Israel is now capable also of producing chemical weapons of all types, including nerve and blister agents and agents causing temporary disability... Gennady Yevstafyev: Yes, Israel has highly developed chemical and petrochemical industries, qualified specialists and stocks of raw materials. Frankly speaking, this greatly complicates international processes of disarmament as a whole. In particular, Arab states have not signed the convention prohibiting chemical weapons and will evidently not sign it until Israel's position in the military-nuclear sphere clarifies. Correspondent: The third place mentioned by you is Hindustan. Gennady Yevstafyev: Let us begin with India. I would assess its technological possibilities as being very high. Though Pakistan's technical possibilities are somewhat lower they are also quite high. Besides that, Pakistan has good sources of financing, including foreign ones. About a year ago the External Intelligence Service prepared an open report where it pointed to Pakistan's possession of a nuclear potential. Correspondent: But nuclear weapons are not the whole issue. There is also the problem of the proliferation of missile technologies. Gennady Yevstafyev: The use of missile arms is evidently an inseparable part of strategic and operational plans in some countries. Among states which have made the greatest progress in this direction are (besides industrially advanced countries) Israel, Iran, Syria, India, Pakistan, the DPRK and Brazil. It is well known that there are legal loopholes that pave the way for acquisition by Third World countries of necessary technical experience and technologies, such as the fulfilment of subcontracts of Western aerospace firms, the purchase of their shares, the setting up of joint or front companies, invitation of foreign specialists, the training of probationers, etc. Add to this the growth of industrial espionage. Incidentally the special commission of the UN Security Council on Iraq revealed the immense role which Western firms played illegally (or with the blessing of their governments?) in the development of Iraq's ramified missile complex. But it is impermissible to deprive some countries of access to peaceful technologies on the pretext of strengthening control over missile technologies. Specialists (including those in the External Intelligence Service) keep a careful watch over Iran's missile intentions, including the direction of its purchases and its interest in technologies. But the talk about "Iran's strengthening" and "danger emanating from it" sometimes camouflages the striving to deprive that country of access to modern technologies for purposes of development of its peaceful industrial potential. Correspondent: The open report of the External Intelligence Service published in 1993 says that about 100 countries now have an industrial base for making chemical weapons. Gennady Yevstafyev: While the situation with nuclear weapons can be controlled (through combination of space facilities with operational information), this is very difficult to do where chemical weapons are concerned. It is believed that the real requirement of chemical weapons amounts to only 100-200 tons even in a major and prolonged regional conflict. The stocks of chemical weapons are in practice greater than these figures. But it is practically impossible to detect 100 and even 500 tons of hidden chemical weapons. Chemical compounds and agents can be kept in containers smaller than an ordinary barrel. MOSCOW NEWS Commentary It may be presumed that the highly placed Russian intelligence officer has made public only part of the data at his disposal. But the accents made by Gennady Yevstafyev show that the world will soon face a new military-political situation. This was ultimately the factor in Russia's official decision in Nov '93 to reject the thesis of being the first not to use nuclear weapons. The basic points of the military doctrine do not preclude the use of nuclear weapons against states which have not joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty. What is more, cases have been stipulated when Russia can use nuclear weapons even against non-nuclear participants in the Treaty. In the words of Valery Manilov, Deputy Secretary of Russia's Security Council, this approach was a result of "painful revision" of Russia's nuclear policy "at the highest level: each member of the Security Council has expressed his view on this matter." The members of Russia's Security Council believe that nuclear weapons are above all an important political factor for Russia. "Having taken into account the growing number of countries which conceal their nuclear weapons, Russia has reconsidered its former approach," stated Valery Manilov. Thus Russia's new nuclear concept is one of nuclear deterrence. It looks like the military-political leadership of Russia is increasingly less worried about the nuclear arsenals of the United States. It is new nuclear countries that become the subject of its closest attention.
