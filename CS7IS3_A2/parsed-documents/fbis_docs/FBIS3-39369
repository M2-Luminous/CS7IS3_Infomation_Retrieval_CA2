The "fairly spectacular" emergence of former Minister of Labor Martine Aubry, daughter of EC Commission President Jacques Delors, proves that the socialist label has ceased to be a handicap in the public's view, Duhamel contends. In fact, a SOFRES/FIGARO MAGAZINE February poll showed that Aubry's popularity jumped 10 percentage points, placing her fourth after Delors, former Minister of Culture Jack Lang and PS leader Michel Rocard, but ahead of well-known PS officials such as Lionel Jospin, Pierre Mauroy, and Laurent Fabius. Additional proof that the PS is not quite "condemned to electoral banishment" as was believed not too long ago was furnished by some respectable scores in the last legislative by-elections, Duhamel continues. While Aubry's popularity is undoubtedly due to the publication of her recent book--praised by critics and the press--and her appearance on a television program that highlighted "her natural authority, clarity of expression and intellectual agility," her "energy, intelligence, independence, and vivacity" are beginning to be well-known. Nonetheless, Aubry's popularity does not stem solely from her personal attributes, Duhamel contends. It also reflects Rocard's present "political stagnation" and the convergence between Aubry's political image and the emerging social demands related to the "phantom of unemployment and the nightmare of exclusion haunting the French" that both the Left and the Right have failed to curb. It is well known that Aubry has made these issues her "obsession and specialty," Duhamel writes. Moreover, the French, "traumatized by the crisis and disappointed by political parties" are turning away from ideological and partisan politics. Aubry, who has kept her distance from parties and the politicians, only arrived on the scene three years ago and is untainted by the political maneuvering characterizing her fellow politicians. Finally, she also enjoys the advantage of being a woman in a field of men, presently the most popular in France with the exception of Minister of Social Affairs Simone Veil, Duhamel concludes.
