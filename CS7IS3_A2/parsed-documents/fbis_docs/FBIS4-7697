Is Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] also threatened with military aggression? [Gligorov] I am not plagued by excessive fear, but I cannot rule out the possibility of this conflict spreading to the south. [DER SPIEGEL] You called for UN protection as far back as in November 1992; since last July U.S. blue helmets have been patrolling the border with Serbia. Does this guarantee peace? [Gligorov] These units came when the danger of war was acute. The presence of the Americans should be sufficient warning to the Serbs. [DER SPIEGEL] The Serbian army could occupy Macedonia within a few days; in the war against Bosnia NATO reacted only after almost two years. Are you deceiving yourself by believing that you would be able to defend your young republic in case of an attack by Belgrade? [Gligorov] The Macedonian problem is far more complex than the Bosnian one. In Bosnia the war is a war in an enclave, which is hardly in danger of spreading. An attack on Macedonia would be a war on NATO's northern [as published] border, in which all the Balkan states would be involved. In addition, there could be a conflict between the two NATO states, Greece and Turkey. [DER SPIEGEL] Last spring Serbia's President Milosevic arrived unexpectedly for a brief visit to Lake Ohrid. What did he want from you? [Gligorov] He presented a proposal for intensive cooperation; however, when I asked him why he did not recognize our republic, his answer was: This will be done only when Greece has diplomatically recognized Macedonia. Because for him Athens is his only true ally in the Balkans.... [DER SPIEGEL] ...with whom Milosevic would like to divide Macedonia. [Gligorov] Athens' former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis says that Milosevic did indeed suggest this to him. But he refused. [DER SPIEGEL] The plans are probably not yet off the table. Three weeks ago Greek Foreign Minister Papoulias visited Belgrade to discuss the renaissance of the former Yugoslavia. [Gligorov] We will not join a new Yugoslav Federation voluntarily at any price. [DER SPIEGEL] Does the quarrel between Skopje and Athens really just revolve around the name of Macedonia, which the Greeks claim for themselves? [Gligorov] Nonsense. If this were so, the issue would have come up 50 years ago. This is how long we have used this name without anybody being bothered by it. Nationalism is reigning in Greece now. [DER SPIEGEL] How long can you resist the threat from the north and the embargo from the south? [Gligorov] We are waiting. Our economic situation is difficult; there are no alternative trading routes. However, in the long run, the routes to and via Greece will be open again to us. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you fear tensions with the Albanian minority, who, after all, constitute a third of Macedonia's population? [Gligorov] Even in our worst times we did not have any problems with our Albanian fellow-citizens. The only thing we do not permit is the demand by certain circles to declare them Macedonia's second state-constituting people. We give the Albanian minority all the rights that are set down in the Helsinki Final Act. [DER SPIEGEL] Will this prevent radical Albanians from striving for unification with the Albanian motherland in the long run? [Gligorov] It is no secret that there is the idea of a greater Albania. However, all these dreams of greater Serbia, greater Croatia, greater Albania -- what is their point?
