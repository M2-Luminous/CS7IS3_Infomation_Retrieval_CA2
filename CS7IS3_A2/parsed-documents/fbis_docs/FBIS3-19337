Speaking at a dinner in honour of Sweden's King Karl XVI Gustav, Balladur said Paris would continue to work "towards finding acceptable solutions" to the problems over voting rights in an enlarged EU. He was referring in particular to British refusal to give way in a row over how to change the voting rules in ministerial councils -- the EU's main decision-making organs -- to take account of the four new members. Balladur conceded that the agreement signed on March 1 setting out the terms of Sweden's admission to the Union "like all agreements, is not perfect." But he insisted it was "good for the Union and for Sweden." The French prime minister added that economic relations between France and Sweden should not be tainted by the "failure" of the merger between carmakers Renault and Volvo. He said the joint venture, which broke down earlier this year, "could have been a good adventure." Sweden is applying for membership along with Norway, Finland and Austria. If all four countries join the Union would be boosted to 16 members, possibly as early as the start of next year. Earlier Wednesday, some 20 leading Swedish businessmen, accompanied by the king, met their French counterparts at the National Council of French Employers. The two groups discussed boosting cooperation, reinforcing European competitiveness and the economic situation in Sweden, Council officials told a press conference.
