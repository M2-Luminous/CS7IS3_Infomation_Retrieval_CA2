Deputy Premier Murat Karayalcin told a press conference today that the Russian Federation which had so far opposed changing its route, had, for the first time accepted not to use the straits. During talks between 4 and 7 April in Moscow, the first deputy premier [title as received] Shokhin told Turkish officials that he favored the Turkish proposal. Turkish, Russian, U.S., Kazakh and Azeri officials will convene in Ankara at the end of this month or in May to discuss the details of this new plan, Karayalcin added. Giving account on the Russian-Turkish joint economic protocol signed in Moscow, Karayalcin said that this protocol was to be a milestone in relations. Russia assured Turkey in the talks that it will not interrupt its 6 billion cubic meters of annual natural gas supply to Turkey from now on and agreed on increasing this amount 2 billion cubic meters more for each year. Karayalcin said that the frequent accidents taking place recently in the Bosporus strait have justified the Turkish thesis that the strait was not convenient for such an intensive traffic. Turkey had to close the Bosporus strait shut for a few days in March after 20 people died when a Greek Cypriot tanker carrying Russian crude oil collided a Greek Cypriot cargo vessel. Sixteen seamen were also lost on the 30 km (19 mile) Bosporus which dissects the 10-million-population Istanbul. The accident was the worst in the Bosporus since a 1979 collision when an oil tanker exploded, killing 43 seamen. Turkey, worried about environmental risks, unveiled new safety rules for the straits in January and will enforce them on July 1.
