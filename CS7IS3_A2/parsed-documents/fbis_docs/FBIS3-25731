Alpha Mengar, our permanent correspondent in Poure, has the details. [Mengar] Rumors on the colonel's death spread all over Gao. While people were having tea in front of shops after prayers, the story on everyone's lips was that Col. Bilal had been attacked and that he was dead. It must be said that Col. Bilal is, above all, seen as one of the architects of the peace process which was embarked upon following the signing of the National Pact on 11 April 1992. He had survived several ambushes in the past. One person died in this recent attack and one was seriously wounded. A third was abducted by the attackers, and a fourth escaped. A reliable source close to the cease-fire monitoring committee stated: All we can say is that Bilal died following an attack by an unidentified number of armed bandits in a vehicle. Following the signing of the National Pact, Saloum Bilal married Bintu Shadeya, first runner-up in the Sike-Askia beauty competition.
