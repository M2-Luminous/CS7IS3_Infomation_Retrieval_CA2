To facilitate comparative analysis, we have divided the surveyed women into three groups: 1) those born before 1949; 2) Those born between 1950 and 1959; 3) those born from 1960 to 1972. I. The Childbearing Perceptions of Women Born in the Three Different Periods Women born from 1937 to 1941, on one hand were more deeply affected by the old society's ideology, culture, and customs, with the feudal ethical concepts of "the earlier the marriage, the sooner one has children," "the earlier one has a son, the sooner one benefits," passing on to future generations that received from the ancestors," and "regarding men as superior to women," deeply rooted in their minds. On the other hand, during their childbearing peak, as population growth restraint forces had not been officially established, leaving this group of women in the midst of the conversion from old to new population and childbearing forces, they essentially followed traditional childbearing perceptions, with their key childbearing motivations being "passing on to future generations that received from the ancestors," and "raising children to take care of them in their old age." As they were influenced by these childbearing motivations and restraints, they particularly favored boys, inevitably striving to achieve their sex bias in children through having many children, which was accompanied by early marriage, early childbearing, and multiple births. Marriage and childbearing are closely interrelated, with age at first marriage having a definite restrictive impact on childbearing age and number of children born. In China, early marriage is generally accompanied by early childbearing, with an earlier beginning-childbearing age. Early marriage and childbearing also extend the real childbearing-age period, increasing the possibility of multiple childbearing. Real survey results fully confirm this point.... As women born in this period had traditonal childbearing perceptions, their childbearing behavior showed up as early marriage, early childbearing, and multiple births. The number of women in this group who were married before the age of 19 made up 23.2 percent of the population in their age-group, with as many as 56.3 percent of early-married women bearing more than three children, and 33.6 percent having two children. Women born between 1942 and 1949 were 16-23 years old by the mid-1960s, beginning to be affected by traditional family-planning indoctrination. Restricted by family planning policy, this group of women had a controlled childbearing pattern. Their number of marriages before the age of 19 was down, with higher percentages of marriage between the ages of 20 and 29, one child, and two children, being respectively 75.2 percent, 71.5 percent, and 19.9 percent. This group of women were characterized by a composite childbearing pattern of both traditional and controlled forms coexisting. Women born in the 1950s were 21-30 years of age by the 1980s, by which time China had officially announced a revision of its family planning policy, advocating that, except for in minority nationality regions with sparse populations, a couple should generally have only one child. The CPC Central Committee issued an open letter on the matter of controlling China's population growth to all Communist Party and CYL members. China achieved marked family planning successes in the 1980s primarily due to the greater contributions made at the time by women from 30 to 40 years of age. This group of women's first-marriage age was generally higher, with an average first-marriage age of more than 26, or nearly three years later than that of women born before 1949. Those married at older than 25 rose in percentage from the preceding group's 28.7 percent to 70.1 percent. Due to comprehensive factors, such as later marriage age, shorter childbearing period, and longer time between childbearing, the percentage of women born in the 1950s bearing only one child was up sharply to 94.73 percent, with only 4 percent having two children, and the incidence of three children essentially stopped. As to the lower level of childbearing by women born in this period, it was the government's family planning policy that played the decisive role. Women born from the 1960s on reached marriage and childbearing age only by 1980, by which time it was universally advocated that a couple have only one child, with emphasis on a policy of late marriage and childbearing. Meanwhile, influenced by social and economic reform and opening and market economy, the traditional perceptions of Beijing women about women's values and childbearing had undergone a great change, with higher numbers wanting no children at all or only one child. This group of young married women had the lowest early-marriage percentage (0.3 percent), the highest percentage of no children, and very few bearing two children, basically achieving late marriage, late childbearing, and few births. The lower childbearing level of women born from the 1960s on resulted from the overall impact of childbearing policy and socio-economic development. II. The Change in Childbearing Perceptions 1. The Change in Childbearing Perceptions From the Perspective of Childbearing Aspirations and the Real Childbearing Difference As used here, childbearing aspirations means, under set socio-economic terms, and supposing no intervention by family planning policy, the voluntary choices made by women as to the number of children to bear and their sex. As to the women born before 1949 and in the 1950s, the childbearing aspirations to have no children, one child, or two children were roughly the same. But the childbearing perceptions of women born from the 1960s on underwent a marked change, with the percentages of those wanting no children or only one child up sharply, the percentage of those wanting two children lower than for those born in both of the previous periods, and not even one woman wanting a third child. As to the overall childbearing aspirations of the 2,162 women surveyed, the childbearing perceptions of Beijing's urban women are undergoing a conversion from traditional to modern form, with the numbers of women wanting less or no children growing steadily. As to the sex preference, since having a boy is no longer the key childbearing motivation of urban women, in the childbearing aspirations of the women surveyed, regardless of the child's sex, the percentage of women opting for only one child was the highest. In the aspirations for one boy, one girl, two boys, or two girls, more women wanted a girl than a boy, exactly the opposite from the old, traditional childbearing perception. 2. The Change in Childbearing Perceptions from the Angle of the Childbearing Aspirations of Women Now Having Varying Numbers of Children The women who have not had children were basically born since the 1960s, with their childbearing aspirations for no children at 28.4 percent, for one child at 43.2 percent, for two children at 24.7 percent, and for three or more children basically nonexistant. Of the women now having one child, 50.5 percent have had their aspirations basically satisfied, while 40.3 percent would like a second child. Of women with two children, 50.4 percent have satisfied their childbearing aspirations, with 47.4 percent having real childbearing levels higher than they had hoped for. As to women with three or more children, only a very few had wanted this many, with 92.6 percent having more children than they really wanted. [passage omitted] The childbearing aspirations of the women now having two or more children shows the obvious change in the childbearing perceptions of Beijing's urban women. Most women with more than one child were born before 1949. While their actual number of children is higher than they had hoped for, their childbearing aspirations were certainly not satisfied. As childbearing perceptions have changed from the past multiple births to less births, only one child, or no children, there is a phenomenon of real childbearing levels being out of line with aspired-to childbearing numbers. [passage omitted] 3. The Change in Women's Childbearing Perceptions as to the Value of Children The change in childbearing perceptions is restricted by many factors, with the benefits playing a key role, being reflected in many values about the children born. The survey questionnaire categorized the value of children as follows: 1) To keep you from being lonely; 2) to form a complete family; 3) to bring happiness; 4) to help the family make a living; 5) to avoid possible reproach for not wanting children; 6) childbearing is a woman's duty; 7) raising children to take care of one in their old age; 8) to please parents and relatives; 9) to preserve conjugal relations; 10) to give you honor; 11) to bring you love; 12) to pass on to future generations that received from ancestors. The value of children is closely linked to regional factors and economic conditions. Before liberation and in the 1950s, Beijing was closed to international intercourse, with very low living standards, where people often emphasized the economic value of having children, generally regarding the number of children born as a source of increased family income, and seeing boys as future family pillars, support in old age, and the "incense" of passing on to future generations that received from ancestors. But as Beijing has now become a modern, open city, with a relatively developed economy, higher per capita income, and adults with more years of schooling, it has experienced a qualitative leap from a social, economic, or cultural perspective, with many of the perceptions of Beijingers, including childbearing perceptions, having naturally changed sharply. Even the women born before 1949 have essentially abandoned their backward, traditional childbearing values and perceptions. In this survey, the two values of children, of passing on the generations and raising children to take care of one in their old age, ranked lowest of all values, being replaced by the "family happiness" and "sense of a complete family" of bearing children for the spiritual benefits and forming a complete family, bringing love, keeping one from being lonely, and bringing family pleasures. As the family focus shifts from blood to matrimonial relations, with children no longer being the "tie" that binds families together, the phenomenon of young married women not wanting children is growing steadily. As educational levels differ, so do the values of women about having children. For instance, as to passing on the generations, raising children to take care of one in their old age, bringing honor to one's ancestors, and childbearing as a woman's duty, women with grade school educations or less made up the highest percentage at over 20 percent, with the percentages for those with junior and senior high school eductions being very low, at 3.4 percent and 4.6 percent respectively, and college-educated women ranking lowest at only 2.3 percent. The value perceptions of "family happiness" and "sense of a complete family," such as holding that childbearing is to form a complete family, bring family happiness, provide parents love, and keep the family from being lonely, ranked high among women of all educational levels. As women's occupations vary, so do childbearing values and perceptions. For instance, among women in the three higher levels of occupation, such as professional technicians, officials in state organs, party and mass organizations, and enterprises and institutions; and office workers and related personel, less women held old, traditional perceptions, such as "passing on the generations, raising children to take care of one in their old age, and childbearing as a woman's duty," than in the three categories of business workers, service workers, and production and transportation workers and related personnel, with these values for the former three categories of women ranking respectively at 4 percent, 6.3 percent, and 9.3 percent, but for the latter at 12.6 percent, 15.2 percent, and 19.3 percent, respectively. The key values of "forming a complete family, bringing happiness, providing love, and keeping one from being lonely," ranked very high among women of all occupations. III. The Factors Affecting the Change in Women's Perceptions About Childbearing [passage omitted] 1. Economic Factors Affecting the Change in Childbearing Perceptions Economic factors are the most important ones promoting the change in childbearing perceptions. In recent years, as Beijing's economy has experienced impressive changes, the economic status of women has correspondingly risen. Of the married women from 20-54 years of age who we surveyed, the employment rate topped 90 percent, with specialized technicians, officials in state organs, Party and mass organizations, and enterprises and institutions; and office workers and related personnel, accounting for 47.7 percent of the workforce. Based on state occupational classifications, as these three categories of personnel are considered to be in high-level occupations, such a high percentage of them in the workforce shows that Beijing women have a higher economic status. As women have higher economic status, they no longer emphasize the past economic values of having children to take care of them in their old age, or in hopes that they will help the family make a living and earn money for family support, weakening their perceptions about early marriage, early childbearing, multiple births, and regarding men as superior to women, and strengthening them about less births, eugenics, and better educations, meaning that they generally make higher demands on their childrens' quality, involving sharp increases in the costs of educating and raising children. The monthly consumption in Beijing today of a non-adult child equals or even exceeds that of the monthly wages of a key family worker, with the younger the child, the higher the cost. This "high" cost of raising a child affects women's quality of life, with young and middle-aged married women in Beijing having an increasing sense of independence and money, and striving for personal freedom and happiness, as well as for cultural lives and material benefits, with correspondingly changed consumer perceptions. The survey showed that Beijing women's consumption ranks by money spent in descending order as "buying daily necessities, clothing, cosmetics, and beauty and hair care products, and paying for recreational consumption, such as restaurants, karaoke, dancing, and health clubs," with tourism and human relationship costs also accounting for quite a high percentage of their monthly incomes. The cost of having a child, plus the monthly spending of both husband and wife, leaves very little left over. Many women, in the interests of easier and more comfortable lives, are unwilling to sacrifice personal well-being and happiness for the fetters of a tied-down life. So the numbers of women not wanting children are growing steadily. 2. Policy Factors Affecting the Change in Childbearing Perceptions Population and family planning policies are hard-limitation factors affecting childbearing perceptions. Our survey of women's childbearing aspirations proves that many more women have had a child than had wanted or hoped to, with the most crucial factor in this being China's current family planning policy. Of the women with one child, most are of the new generation born and raised since the founding of the PRC who, on one hand were less affected by traditional childbearing perceptions and, on the other are better educated and have improved economic conditions, so can more easily understand and accept the state's childbearing policy, and can proceed from national and nationality interests to conscientiously practice family planning. Of the women born before 1949, there is a sharp gap between their childbearing aspirations and actual childbearing levels, a key cause of which is the impact of the propaganda and indoctrination in state family planning policy. 3. Social Factors Affecting the Change in Childbearing Perceptions Changes in perceptions follow closely behind social change. While most of the women born before 1949 still maintained the customary women's image of "virtuous wife and good mother," the tide of change, with the passing of time, change in social and economic system, and opening of Beijing's doors, has sharply shaken traditional women's values and childbearing perceptions. The young and middle-aged married women born since the 1950s, as to childbearing aspirations, increase in percentage by lower age as to not wanting children or wanting only one child, no longer focusing their time and energy on raising children, but preferring rather to develop themselves and enhance their own quality. By the mid-1980s, the intense competition formed by reform and opening had brought worries and concerns to young and middle-aged women, bringing many to understand that unless they strengthened their sense of competition, improved their educations, and pursued advanced technical studies, it would be hard for them to cope with the risks brought to women's employment by reform. ZHONGGUO FUNU BAO [CHINA WOMEN'S REPORT] has directly surveyed its readers on how women see the risks and challenges brought by reform. This survey shows that 73 percent of women feel that reform has brought more risk to women's than men's jobs, which figure is 67 percent for young and middle-aged women, and 73 percent for middle-aged women. And in our survey in Beijing on marriage and the family, almost all women held that as to promotion opportunities, men had more chance of promotion than women. Due to the historical image of the weak woman, it should be said that while the competitive climate is equal, the competitive terms for men and women are unequal, with the "priority" consideration of women at times of cutbacks being nothing new. So the masses of women can only face up to their historical disadvantage, by improving their own quality, so that they can compete with men in an unequal social environment. Educational level is a key inherent factor affecting childbearing perceptions and their change. The years and extent of education directly affect the rate and depth of human understanding of things. Better educated women focus their childbearing perceptions on less births, eugenics, and an emphasis on their children's quality, instead of striving for numbers. They have less sex bias, clearer childbearing objectives, and more distinct pre-conception rational thought and choice processes. Based on their own social environment, they can conscientiously consider and correspondingly adjust their childbearing behavior, to make it as consistent as possible with national policy.
