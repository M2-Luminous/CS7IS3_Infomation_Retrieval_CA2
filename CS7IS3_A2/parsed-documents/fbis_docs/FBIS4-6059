On 1 April, Ken Suzuki, managing director of the Japan Electric Industry Development Association, a computer industry organization, expressed his grievance after reviewing details of the "1994 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers" announced by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). The Japanese Government's procurement of foreign computers is steadily increasing following the Japan-U.S. agreement reached in January 1992. However, the USTR report pointed out that "the share of foreign products on the Japanese market is decreasing." "The United States Is Eager To Increase Items of Japan's Trade Barriers" The latest report claimed that barriers to trade in the Japanese market existed for 43 items, the most ever. There are 44 pages pertaining to Japan, more than double the amount of pages the Bush administration devoted to Japan. Masakazu Toyoda, chief of the America-Oceania Division of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], pointed out: "The Clinton administration is eager to increase the number of items listed as Japan's trade barriers. Most of them have been settled under the Japan-U.S. agreements." He added: "Moreover, a problem is that the U.S. claim that the Japanese market is closed is based on groundless, unclear data." As for government procurement of computers, a MITI survey shows that the share of foreign products at ministries and agencies increased from 4.1 percent in fiscal 1991 to 10.2 percent in fiscal 1992. However, the USTR report points out that the share decreased from 4.0 percent in fiscal 1991 to 3.7 percent in fiscal 1992. Mr. Toyoda stated that although there are differences in the means of arriving at the stated figures, it is exceedingly unusual that the results of the surveys were so different, especially in terms of the direction of change of procurement shares. The Japanese Government procured 11 supercomputers using supplementary budget funds allocated for fiscal 1993. Of these, six units are U.S.-made products. However, the USTR report still listed the sector as encumbered by trade barriers, saying: "U.S. companies were only able to receive orders in biddings in which Japanese companies did not participate." Originally, the Japanese industry had urged the government to place orders for the 11 supercomputers as a measure to stimulate the economy. Mr. Suzuki said: "We did not expect that U.S. firms would win the half of the orders. Conversely, this proves that the Japanese market is open enough." The U.S. Government Depends on Results of Industries' Surveys Such differences in figures as well as in evaluations are noted everywhere in the USTR report. In many cases, the USTR office, which is comprised of a select few people of superior ability, depends on statistics presented by industries when it compiles data on market surveys. The U.S. industries are liable to present figures favorable to them. Seikei University Professor Mitsuo Matsushita said: "The U.S. Government's practice of coming to one- sided judgment causes mutual distrust between Japan and the United States." Moreover, there are not a few cases where the U.S. Government easily reacts to requests made by industrial lobbyists." Many business managers maintain that Japanese and U.S. "private sectors are getting along with each other" in the semiconductor and automotive industries (as stated by Toshiba Corporation President Fumio Sato). There is a case noted in the construction sector that although private companies in the United States have no complaints against Japan, the U.S. Government itself is attacking Japan to eliminate the closed nature of the Japanese market. The Japanese Government compiles a Japanese version of an "unfair trade report" every spring, with Professor Matsushita playing a leading role. The Japanese report analyzes issues concerning the U.S. legal system, including the antidumping law and the buy-American law, in the light of such agreements as GATT. On the other hand, a "problem with the U.S. report lies in the fact that the United States evaluates Japan's business practices such as keiretsu based on its own value system" (as stated by Professor Matsushita). Such a gap in recognition between Japan and the United States is shown in their approach toward Japan-U.S. agreements. USTR Kantor and other U.S. officials stress: "Although 33 agreements now exist between Japan and the United States, Japan has failed to fulfill them faithfully." However, the Japanese Government refutes this, saying: "Somewhat more than 20 Japan-U.S. agreements exist. The U.S. way of counting them is obviously arbitrary" (according to the Foreign Ministry). "The Government Arbitrarily...." Nihon University Professor Tadakuni Nogimura points out that "the fact is that Japan also has a problem concerning a lack of understanding." For example, the duties of MITI division chiefs change about every two years. While documents on past agreements are kept at offices, there are many cases in which concrete details of negotiations are not completely handed over from departing officials to their successors. Because officials in charge of negotiations try to reach agreements of any sort during their term of office, they sometimes conclude temporary agreements. The 1992 Japan-U.S. agreement set a target for Japan's purchase of auto parts for fiscal 1994 of $19 billion. In this regard, many people in the automotive industry say: "The government, at its own discretion, compiled targets for efforts shown by the industry, and presented them to the United States." The aim of the Clinton administration is to have Japan fulfill all of the agreements reached in the past. A problem also lies in a lack of understanding between the Japanese Government and industries. Recently, it has been revealed that, in a document on the Japan-U.S. mobile phone accord worked out by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, there is an expression that could be interpreted as the government guaranteeing accords between the Japanese and U.S. private sectors. There is a famous case of a note attached to the 1986 Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement which stipulated that the share of foreign semiconductor products of the Japanese market should reach 20 percent. Professor Nogimura said: "The government seldom informs the private sector of unfavorable information." Even if the private sector is making efforts to open markets at the government's request, it cannot be said from the latest USTR report that its efforts are highly evaluated by the United States. At a time when the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are suspended, the computer industry is not the only industry that is indignant over the Japanese Government's negotiations with the United States.
