A petition for protection recognized the guerrilla's right not to remain in solitary confinement. There was intense activity at Itagui prison since early today. The unexpected transfer of Galan and Juan Fernando Ospina Montoya, alias El Gordo, a Medellin cartel member, was carried out without a great fuss. Galan was transferred from Santa Fe de Bogota aboard a National Police airplane after a judge ruled in his favor when a petition was filed requesting he be removed from the military garrison where he was being held and sent to a prison. Ospina Montoya was flown from Medellin to the capital aboard the same plane. He is to testify before a faceless judge, who is in charge of his case, in the next few hours. Ospina Montoya surrendered to justice on 4 July 1991 together with La Garra, El Angelito, and Icopur. He was one of the few who was unable to escape Envigado prison.
