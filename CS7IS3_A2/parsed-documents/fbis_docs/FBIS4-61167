This is, probably, the oldest political and social organization of Lithuanian peasants, which will celebrate its 90th anniversary next year. Having emerged during the czarist times, the Lithuanian Union of Peasants was a powerful party: It participated in the government and successfully resolved agrarian problems. The restored Union of Peasants currently unites 420 members. Certainly, it is not numerous, and it almost does not stand out among other agrarian organizations. Speaking about the period under review at the party's congress, Professor Petras Becius, chairman of the Lithuanian Union of Peasants, said primarily that the assets of rural people have almost been wasted, that weeds are growing in many fields, and that food processing enterprises are indebted to land workers. The professor, as well as subsequent speakers at the congress, criticized the government which is doing little to improve the situation in agriculture. One of the most critical speeches was delivered by Professor Ksaveras Purvinskas. "Recently," he said, "rumors have been spreading that Lithuania does not need agriculture, and that the latter is supported from the budget." At the same time, the professor provided the following figures: If the state procured agrarian produce from peasants for world prices, the latter would earn even 2.5 million litai per year. Therefore, said K. Purvinskas, they would not have to beg from the state. It is difficult to say where such statistics come from. One thing is clear -- the produce of the Lithuanian agriculture is overly expensive for consumers today. It is not accidental that food exports must be continuously increased. The government is doing its best to protect its own land workers. The delegates in the congress may not or do not want to know this. They should look for ways of getting out of this quagmire. Professor K. Purvinskas also acknowledged this. It is necessary to upgrade the cattle stock anew and produce a larger crop. Is it normal that in most agrarian companies the annual milk yield of cows does not reach even 3,000 kg, or that fertile soil produces only 20 quintals of grain [per hectare]? This used to be the case during the first years of collective farming. [passage omitted] Professor K. Purvinskas termed the government's program for developing agriculture a "program for fooling land workers." "Peasants have no other alternative than to unite in this party," he said in conclusion. According to the professor, neither rightists nor leftists have yet resolved agrarian problems. Many contradictory ideas were voiced at the congress. For example, the law on two-three hectare land plots was discussed extensively. Petras Becius said in his report that the party categorically speaks out against this law. However, Albinas Albertynas, member of the Lithuanian Union of peasants, who addressed the congress later, emphasized the pressing nature of this law. People are looking forward to the legalization of these two or three hectares. A. Albertynas berated the party program. According to him, such a program will not lead them to power. In general, the congress defended the interests of landowners. As the delegates themselves admitted, however, presently there are about 180,000 families whose parents or grandparents did not possess any land before 1940. Those two or three hectares are a source of subsistence for such families. The Peasant Party proposes that the land which these families have been working be granted to them free of charge. However, another clause in the program as if cuts this proposal -- in the first place, land must be unconditionally restored to descendants of former owners! Thus, if this occurred, 180,000 families, whose parents were landless, would not receive those two or three hectares, because there is a shortage of land in Lithuania. [passage omitted] The congress of the Lithuanian Union of Peasants devoted the most of time to the difficult situation in agriculture, which, incidentally, is no secret to every citizen. Both rightists and leftists were scolded for this. Thus, the party is likely to adhere to the centrist position. It is difficult to say how this organization, which on Saturday changed its name into the Lithuanian Peasant Party, will manage to attract rural people to its ranks. Will the latter approve of its program and vote for its representatives in the new elections? There is only one issue that bothers land workers today -- how to sow and plant this spring. In other words, how to survive. One could become convinced of that on the same day of the congress. The congress elected Seimas [parliament] deputy Albinas Vaizmuzis, who does not belong to any faction, chairman of the Lithuanian Peasant Party. Petras Becius, Stanislovas Liucvaitis, and Ksaveras Purvinskas were elected his deputies. The congress also elected the council and executive committee of the party. [passage omitted]
