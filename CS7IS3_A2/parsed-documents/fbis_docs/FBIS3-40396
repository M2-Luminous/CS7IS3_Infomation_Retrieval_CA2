It is also refocusing its activities in advanced technologies in an attempt to turn a profit. Blitzkrieg, or swift and sudden warfare. While Bull's operational organization is taking shape, after the breakup of its activities into 12 divisions, Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the Bull CEO, sends his troops to storm the market. Fighting to restore operational balance by the end of 1994, he opens the game by creating a dedicated FM subsidiary and overhauling several leading-edge activities (AI and EDI). The State and France Telecom's contributions (Fr11.1 billion), two thirds of which is earmarked to pay off the manufacturer's debts, might also be used to promote development in sectors deemed buoyant. The FM offensive is by far the strongest. Athesa, the structure just created, has Europe for its territory, and it ambitions to achieve sales of Fr3 billion within two years. Bull will therefore acquire 51 percent of the Athesa International holding, the remaining shares being divided among three French financial and industrial investors. Jacques Tordjman, former CEO of EDS France will be the president of Athesa International and its subsidiary, Athesa France. "The market is dominated by the Americans, but there may be a niche for a European group," he said. Within one month, he should have a full complement of shareholders, which he is negotiating with the help of Thierry Breton, the interministerial delegate to telecommuting who is now Bull's strategy manager and head of the FM division. The latter will consolidate the results of Athesa and Integris, the manufacturer's American FM subsidiary. Bulls maneuver in this sector is in every respect similar to that of IBM, which entrusted its FM activities to a subsidiary in order to strengthen Axone when it became its fully-owned subsidiary. At the start, Athesa International will control three subsidiaries: Athesa France (a joint subsidiary of CISI [International Company for Data Processing Services] and Bull, owned 50-50); Athesa Technical Support & Partners [Athesa TSP] (100-percent owned); and the Institute for New Technologies (100-percent owned). Foreign subsidiaries will be added progressively, starting probably with the United Kingdom, Italy, and Benelux. Athesa France should be worth Fr400 million, and it should bring together the activities of CISI Telematics (400 people) and two Bull subsidiaries: Methods and Information Processing, and SSIG (i.e. 250 people and Fr180 million in sales). It will be headed by Claude Moireau, the current CEO of CISI Telematics, and it is designed to be a multiplatform company (CISI will contribute its IBM hardware and its contract with the CEA [Atomic Energy Commission], worth Fr70 million per year) and to cover all outsourcing services. Next to it, Athesa TSP will be in charge of Bull's in-house data-processing activity (worth an estimated Fr500 million to Fr1 billion), and it will take over the data processing of the holding company's shareholders. As for the Institute of New Technologies, it will be in charge of training the personnel that Athesa will inherit when it takes over outside sites. By early January 1993, the holding company should be worth Fr1.2 billion, for a market estimated at Fr4 billion in France and Fr10 billion in Europe. Jacques Tordjman, who claims paternity of this project of a European group using French capital, hopes to attract a clientele of French administrations. Apart from the Reunion of National Museums, administrations until now have been wary of subcontracting their data processing to outsiders. While Bull has great FM ambitions, it is far more pragmatic in the field of advanced technologies. The Cediag, a body specialized in artificial intelligence, is now a full-fledged Bull subsidiary. According to Herve Yahi, the Cediag manager, it is dedicated to "solutions that make it possible to automate complex corporate functions" and will no longer develop software; software development will be subcontracted to outsiders. Reduced to a team of 60 for sales of Fr40 million, Cediag should be profitable by the end of the year. Finally, the computer-data exchange activity, the sale of which was mentioned by labor unions, will be assigned to Bull Engineering, a Bull France subsidiary.
