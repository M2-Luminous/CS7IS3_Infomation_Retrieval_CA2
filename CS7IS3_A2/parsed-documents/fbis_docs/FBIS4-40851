Our correspondent will tell you in more detail about the situation there: [Reporter Mikhail Nikulin in Tajikistan -- identified by caption] It was right here, on the so-called Pyanj sector, that a massive offensive by armed detachments of the Tajik opposition was supposed to take place on the eve of the inter-Tajik talks in Tehran. According to reports from military intelligence, such a decision was taken at a meeting of field commanders of several formations based in northern Afghanistan. Russian border guards, together with the command of the collective peacekeeping forces, have taken additional measures to strengthen this section of the border. [V. Novikov, chief of staff of Russian border guards in Tajikistan -- identified by caption] We can now say that those strategic schemes, which the enemy and the opposition were hatching, have effectively been thwarted. We can see that the situation here is stabilizing. But, on literally every centimeter of the border, you can still sense that it is explosive, ready to explode at any moment. [Nikulin] But this temporary lull prevails only on this section of the 1,200 km border. Elsewhere [pauses] [Novikov, interrupting] Shelling is continuing, attacks are continuing, provocations of various kinds are continuing. [Nikulin] During the first 20 days of June alone there have already been over 10 armed provocations on the border, as a result of which the opposition lost over 15 militants.
