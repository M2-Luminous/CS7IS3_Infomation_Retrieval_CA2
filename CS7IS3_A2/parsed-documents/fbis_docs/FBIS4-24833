The report, issued in mid-April, urges the British government to strengthen ties with Taipei, Beijing's rival, in a move described by some observers as playing the Taiwan card. In a meeting with a visiting delegation of Hong Kong media executives, Mr Hsu said Taipei's reaction to the British parliament report was positive. But, according to him, the Executive Yuan, Taiwan's cabinet, has yet to study the thick document. "The report indicated something new in British foreign policy towards the Republic of China," Mr Hsu said. China reacted furiously to the House of Commons 110-page report on China including Hong Kong and Taiwan, criticising it as an "infringement" of its internal affairs. The vice-premier dismissed suggestions that Britain was playing the Taiwan card to improve its position in dealing with China over thorny Hong Kong issues. Mr Hsu said Taiwan was eager to strengthen ties with all the western nations including Britain but relations between the island republic and the United Kingdom have not been smooth in years. He said one of the major targets of Taiwan's diplomatic strategy was to fight for larger international space and increased communications and exchanges with the world community. However, the vice premier said Taiwan's relations with the British could be influenced by two crucial factors -- the relationship between the two rivals across the Taiwan straits and that between Beijing and London. He said Taiwan's foreign policy was not hostile towards the mainland communist regime. Rather, it was aimed at ensuring the survival and development of the island. "We have no desire to produce a foreign policy that is hostile towards the mainland and what we are exploring in the process of policy-making is to seek survival and development for the island," he said. The senior ruling Kuomintang party official said he was optimistic about the prospect of reunification with mainland China and he himself was ready to return to and live on the mainland once the dream of reunification was realised. "I am very optimistic about the prospect because changes have been going on rapidly," he said. Mr Hsu said he would like to be a mainlander rather than a Taiwanese. Among the preconditions for reunification are the narrowing of living standards, lifestyles, ideology and social systems.
