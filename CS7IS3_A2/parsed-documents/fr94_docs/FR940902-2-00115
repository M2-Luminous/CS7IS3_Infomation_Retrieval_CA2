FR940902-2-00115 FR940902-2-00053 4. Under the terms of the Rights offer (the Offering), each shareholder received 0.56 Rights for each share of Common Stock held as of the close of business on Tuesday, February 9, 1993 (the Record Date). The Rights were treated as separate securities under federal securities laws and were traded on the NASDAQ national market system separately from the Common Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Offering, the Rights were exercisable until 5:00 p.m. E.S.T. on Monday, March 15, 1993. Thereafter, any unexercised Rights expired and became worthless. Each Right conferred upon the registered holder thereof the right (the Basic Privilege) to purchase one share of Common Stock at a stated exercise price of $4.75 per share (the Exercise Price). Each Right also carried with it the nontransferable right to subscribe, at the Exercise Price, for the shares underlying any Rights that remained unexercised upon the expiration of the Offering on March 15, 1993, subject to proration (the Oversubscription Privilege). 2 Only holders of Common Stock who exercised all their Rights pursuant to the Basic Privilege were entitled to subscribe for shares pursuant to the Oversubscription Privilege. 2 If the oversubscription requests exceeded the number of available shares, the available shares were to be allocated or ``prorated'' among the oversubscribers in proportion to the number of shares each purchased pursuant to the Basic Privilege. A total of 3,176,144 shares of the Common Stock were issued by BMJ pursuant to the Offering. Of this total, 2,444,565 shares were issued through the exercise of Rights, with 2,100,433 shares purchased through the Basic Privilege and 344,132 shares purchased through the Oversubscription Privilege. The remaining 731,579 shares of the total sold pursuant to the Offering were sold pursuant to standby purchase agreements with eight standby purchasers. Executive officers and members of the board of directors of BMJ purchased 207,883 shares of the Common Stock issued pursuant to the Offering. Gross proceeds generated by BMJ from the Offering totalled $15,086,684, including $3,470,000 raised through standby purchase agreements. All sales of Common Stock pursuant to the Offering were made at the Exercise Price, $4.75 per share. On February 8, 1993, prior to the Record Date, the Common Stock closed on the NASDAQ system at a price of $8.88 per share. The Plan received 68,343 Rights as a result of the Offering because the Plan had held 122,042 shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date. 5. The Fiduciary represents that it exercised due diligence to determine the most prudent response to the Offering on behalf of the Plan, and that all information relevant to the Offering was analyzed, including the following: (a) The terms of the Plan and its trust document; (b) the economic impact on the Plan under various alternatives, including selling the Rights, exercising the Rights, taking no action and any combination of these alternatives; (c) the cash balances available to the Plan, the Plan's expected cash flow and the Plan's ability to borrow cash; (d) the likely value of the Oversubscription Privilege and the likelihood of any shares becoming available thereunder; and (e) the procedures and methodology of the Offering. On the basis of its considerations of all options available to the Plan under the circumstances prevailing at the time of the Offering, the Fiduciary represents that it determined that the most prudent course of action was for the Plan to exercise the Basic Privilege with respect to all 68,343 Rights issued to the Plan. To do so, the Plan needed $324,629.25 in cash, which was $263,335.49 more than the Plan ultimately received in cash matching contributions before the close of the Offering on March 15, 1993. In order to generate the additional cash needed to exercise the Rights, the Fiduciary determined that the Plan should sell a portion of the Common Stock held by the Plan. In addition, the Fiduciary also determined that the Plan should borrow $60,000, if possible, to acquire an additional 12,500 shares of Common Stock, if such shares became available to the Plan pursuant to the Oversubscription Privilege. Although the Plan had additional shares of Common Stock it could sell to raise the cash necessary to exercise the Oversubscription Privilege, the Fiduciary represents that it had determined that very few shares of additional Common Stock would become available pursuant to the Oversubscription Privilege, and that the transaction costs involved in the Plan selling the additional shares were not justified. The Fiduciary determined that a short-term loan, on the other hand, permitted the Plan to raise the necessary cash at relatively modest cost.
