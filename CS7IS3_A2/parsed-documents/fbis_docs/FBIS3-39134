Even the threat of resorting to air raids if the Serbs do not withdraw their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo cannot be considered a move of fundamental strategic importance within the context of the Bosnian civil war. Indeed, the international community has for months been issuing a series of palliative and half measures, consistently presented as decisive, always crowned by success. Consider "Deny Flight," the operation to impose a no-fly zone in the skies above Bosnia: It was preceded by a great publicity campaign and was perfectly executed by the NATO politicians, but no real results were achieved, partly because in the few instances when a violation of the flight ban was detected, they were not authorized to intervene. Similarly (and fortunately) there has been no response to the provocations of the Serbs -- from the antiaircraft batteries' radar which "floodlit" allied aircraft to Belgrade's fighters which "shadowed" NATO's reconnaissance aircraft as they tried to look beyond the borders. When the same kind of provocation was attempted by the Iraqis, the response was immediate and sharp. Of course, the situation in Bosnia is different, but.... Be that as it may, since the Bosnian Serbs are able to crush their adversaries without recourse to Belgrade's aircraft, the NATO operation did not alter the outcome of the land battle in the slightest. As for the watertight naval blockade, before it was implemented in earnest, innumerable "violators" succeeded in bringing through consignments of weapons and supplies for the fighters. For the past several months it has been more stringent, and the embargo has been implemented resolutely, but consignments continue to pass easily across the land borders with Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, which either are unable or unwilling to implement a total blockade. Of course, the Croats and the Serbs in Bosnia receive all kinds of assistance from Zagreb and Belgrade, whereas supplies to the Muslims are insufficient, despite the Islamic community's efforts. Even the "ultimatum" currently being discussed is of symbolic, rather than real, value: How can we forget that a similar sequence of events occurred some months ago when NATO aircraft were ready to intervene if the Serbs did not leave the strategic heights around Sarajevo? After an exhausting trial of strength, the Serbs did withdraw from Mount Igman and other high places. Everyone was happy, but after a few months we now find ourselves in the same situation again. It is just as well that Sarajevo was "saved." So it is entirely in the Serbs' interests to agree to "submit" to the NATO-UN ultimatum: Indeed, it is better that they display their goodwill by announcing the withdrawal of their artillery even before the NATO bureaucratic monster sets itself in motion. It will take only a matter of hours, not days, to withdraw the guns and rocket launchers. Light weapons, such as mortars, can merely be hidden. If necessary, personnel and equipment can return to battle quickly. This, because NATO is only demanding that the guns be removed and that the bombardment of the city cease, not that the Serbs abandon their positions. And in order not to lose its role as "third agent" in the conflict, the United Nations cannot demand further concessions from the Serbs, notwithstanding Izetbegovic's continuing efforts to reverse at the negotiating table the defeats that he is suffering in the field. So the vise around Sarajevo will not be loosened, and there will be another stalemate. Even the proposed demilitarization of the city would not alter the overall strategic military picture. Be that as it may, even after media interest in the capital's tragic plight has ceased, the war would continue with the usual ferocity throughout the rest of the country. It does not take much to calm people's consciences, since nobody intends to become really involved in Bosnia. In the form in which it has been formulated, the ultimatum does not serve much purpose and it discredits the international community even more: Principles of equity would have required the simultaneous imposition of identical conditions on the Croatian artillery units bombarding Mostar and on the Muslims occupying Tuzla, as well as on the Serbs who surround them. We can just imagine the paeans of triumph that the media will issue over the "liberation" of Sarajevo. Let us not delude ourselves; nothing has changed; the tragedy continues.
