Detained are Association President Li Guotao, 40, Secretary General Wang Fuchen, 38, painter Lin Muchen, 46, a member of the board of directors, and another board member who was not identified. The activists said the clampdown on the association may aim at curbing dissident activities ahead of the fifth anniversary of the suppression of pro-democracy demonstration at Tiananmen Square in Beijing on June 4, 1989. Wang left for the southern island of Hainan on Wednesday and nothing was heard of him since. Li disappeared Monday, while the unnamed board member was arrested Tuesday, the activists said. Painter Lin was arrested at Shanghai Airport Tuesday before leaving for the United States, where the artist planned to study. Only a month ago, police in Shanghai temporarily detained a number of activists including Wang in advance of the arrival of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to the city. Wang was also detained during the visit to China by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in March. U.S. President Bill Clinton has said unless China makes substantial progress in human rights records, he will not extend China's most-favored-nation trade status in the U.S., which guarantees Chinese goods access to U.S. markets at lowest tariffs, when it comes up for renewal in June.
