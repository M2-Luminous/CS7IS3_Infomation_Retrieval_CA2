According to economists, in the 1980's, which were marked by the single traditional planned economy, any reforming effort, even if superficial, could produce some results. In contrast, the reform in the 1990's is conducted in a double-track environment, where it is necessary to coordinate the reform measures and deepen the reform drive under the friction of two coexisting systems. Compared with the former, the reform in the 1990's is harder and has greater resistance. As economists point out, it is confronted with striking difficulties: One of the difficulties is the placement of surplus personnel laid off by enterprises, especially old enterprises--a problem caused by "unemployment during the transitional period" in the reform of the enterprise system. Economists opine that the transformation of operational mechanisms in state-owned enterprises and the establishment of a modern enterprise system both mean the acceleration of job rearrangement, which will inevitably result in the layoff of some employees. It is, therefore, necessary to make an unremitting effort to build a job market. However, under the present circumstances where work units distribute public housing, retirement pension, and price subsidy to their employees and pay their medical and health-care bills and where an unemployment relief fund system has yet to be established by the government, the following questions have arisen: How should we, on the one hand, solve the problem of overstaffing of state-owned enterprises through the bankruptcy procedure or by the mechanism of keeping the superior and eliminating the inferior and, on the other hand, properly place the surplus personnel and ensure their well-being? How should we speed up the socialization and marketization of welfare distribution while accelerating the transformation of operational mechanisms in enterprises? These are difficult questions that must be solved in the 1994 reform. Economists hold that if we continued to take the "double-track approach," that is, "a new method for new people and the old method for old people," it would take several generations' time to solve the above questions. That could not meet the needs of building a market economy. On the other hand, it would be a formidable political task to drastically adjust the present interest pattern. Besides, our country has not fostered sufficient economic strength for the institution of an extensive, equitable, and socialized security system. In view of this, all that we can do is to make some transformations in mechanisms on the basis of the reality. As far as we know, departments concerned are presently contemplating a package plan to solve the problems. With regard to housing, efforts will be made to privatize housing units as soon as possible. To solve the unemployment problem, apart from the expansion and improvement of unemployment insurance, new outlets and diversified placement measures will be sought for those employees laid off by enterprises. Principal proposals in this regard are making all-out efforts to develop employment agencies and improve and perfect the employment service system, beefing up job training and job-transfer training to improve workers' quality, energetically promoting service enterprises and various tertiary industries to create more job opportunities, and establishing a policy to encourage people to work in township enterprises, the "three-kinds of foreign-funded" enterprises, and private enterprises. Meanwhile, efforts will be made to reduce the current administrative restrictions on capital raising and to simplify the company registration procedure so that laid-off employees can raise funds or borrow loans to open stores or workshops and act as their own bosses. In so doing, they can also hire some surplus personnel. This will provide an outlet for the extra employees laid off by state-owned enterprises. Another difficulty concerns the relationship between central and local authorities. Economists are of the opinion that reform efforts over the past 15 years have done away with the over-centralized system and made it possible to delegate power to enterprises and local governments, thus arousing to a great extent the initiative at the local level. However, they say, these efforts have also resulted in the over-expansion of local government power. In the past reforms, local governments often showed a greater enthusiasm than central government departments. While storming the old systems, local governments also unwittingly impacted the statistical and reporting systems and even the basic financial work discipline, especially in the fields of banking, financial management, and taxation. This situation, if allowed to continue, will affect the authenticity of the information on which the state's macroeconomic management is based. Yet the fact is that, as the local party and government election systems develop, local leaders will continue to take the development of their local economic and welfare programs as their basic goal. At present, three problems on local government activities deserve attention: one, counter-regulatory action affecting the higher level; two, direct interference in the work of the lower level; and three, blockades imposed upon peers at the same level. According to economists, a pure tax revenue sharing system can only solve the question of tax revenue distribution between the central and local governments. It can in no way serve the purpose of redefining the government functions to meet the needs of the market economy. We should combine the reform from the bottom up with the reform from the top down and beef up the central government's guidance for the reform as soon as possible. It is imperative to clearly define the administrative powers of the central and local governments and take this as an important task in reforming the government functions. The objective should be that authority for currency issuance and macroeconomic regulation and control is held by the central government, while administrative powers closely related to local work targets are by and large delegated to local governments. Examples of the latter are local finances, transportation, urban construction, housing reform, social security, environmental protection, education, and rectification and improvement of loss-incurring enterprises. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to adjust those functions inappropriate for local governments. The only direct link that the two levels of government should maintain with enterprises is taxation. All government regulatory activities must be conducted through the intermediary of law or market. The third difficult problem lies in financial reform, a task closely connected with the question of interests of the government versus enterprises and of the central government versus local governments. An urgent question in this regard, say economists, is how to change, in accordance with the needs of the market economy, the present practice that the government deals directly with matters of finances, banking, and interest rates. It is learned that the central authorities have decided to reorganize the specialized state banks into state commercial banks, beginning 1994. The reorganized banks will operate in line with modern commercial banking practice and will be fully responsible for their respective fund mobility and payment ability. Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China will enforce the nation's monetary policy independently under the leadership of the State Council. It will assume centralized control over the issuance and basic turnover of the currency and regulate the scale of loans. The principal goal of the monetary policy is to maintain currency stability. With respect to the prospects and difficulties of the 1994 reform, economists say that China's reform has entered the most difficult, challenging, and hopeful stage where efforts must be made to tackle the hardest problems. Whether we can break with the old traditions or not has a great bearing on the success or failure of this reform. Now, as China's reform is developing in depth, those engaged in the work of reform should, as well, raise their awareness of the need to reform themselves. Also, it is imperative to guard against the distortion of the reform by vested interests either deliberately or unknowingly. Recently, the central leadership has pointed out that only through reform is it possible to grasp the "high technology" required for the swift running of the economy, and the new systems are exactly such "high technology." We must get a good grasp of that "high technology" and do our best to drive the "express train."
