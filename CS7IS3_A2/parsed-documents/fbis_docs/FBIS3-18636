Hello, Minister Fabbri. In a few words, is it realistic to think that our troops might now go to Bosnia? [Fabbri] I do not like calculating probability -- let us stick to the facts. As far as we know, the UN position -- that they do not want troops from bordering countries to participate -- has not changed. We realize that there is a real need to reinforce the numbers of blue helmets in former Yugoslavia. If we receive a request from the United Nations, the government, as a whole, will calmly study the request, giving it all the consideration the case demands. We will take all aspects of the situation into consideration. Among other things, I want to stress that it would be important to know what stance was being taken by the warring parties in former Yugoslavia. How would they react to the possible future presence of armed Italian forces? This does not mean that we are laying down hostile conditions about our possible involvement. We are already playing our part by ensuring logistic and operational support for all operations headed toward former Yugoslavia. Moreover, the Italian Armed Forces have already demonstrated in Mozambique and Somalia that they are able to carry out peacekeeping, peace-enforcing, and humanitarian aid missions in a professional manner. [Announcer] One last thing, are you saying that the UN Security Council would have to effectively reexamine the matter, along with the conditions concerning the involvement of neighboring countries and then make a formal request? [Fabbri] That is right. The decision already made by the United Nations would have to be revised and a request then made to the Italian Government. [Announcer] Thank you, Minister.
