Arbnori, who is leaving for China Monday [11 April] at the invitation of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) for the first visit of its kind in about 20 years, will be the highest- ranking Albanian official to travel to China since the Albanian Democratic Party came to power in 1992. He said that significant changes have taken place in both Albania and China and ideology is no longer the condition for developing relations of cooperation. Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in China in various areas and that is to the credit of, above all, the introduction of a market economy, Arbnori said. "Sure," the Albanian speaker added, "China is developing a market economy with Chinese characteristics in the light of its specific conditions. That is positive." Noting that there exist no obstacles to expanding ties between the two countries, which have broad prospects for cooperation, he predicted that the bilateral relations will further improve and develop. He stressed that "Albania adheres to a very important principle, that is to recognize only one China -- the People's Republic of China." He hoped that China will contribute to the peaceful solution of the Balkan issue as it is playing an important role in major world affairs as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. During his visit to China, Arbnori said, he will learn more about the NPC's work, China's experience in building the legal system and the progress in China's economy.
