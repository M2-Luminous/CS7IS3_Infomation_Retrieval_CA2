The accord, aimed at strengthening the ongoing ceasefire accord, was signed on Saturday at Luglw-Goobweyu, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) outside Kismaayo. The pact was endorsed by leaders of two warring factions in southern Somalia, General Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan of the Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM) and Osman Atoo, a representative of General Mohamed Farah Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA). The two leaders were cheered when they shook hands and hugged one another after the signing ceremony, which was preceded by a peace march by residents of the area. The two were due to endorse another nine-point statement either on Sunday or Monday which would further pledge support for Saturday's nine-point agreement, the source added.
