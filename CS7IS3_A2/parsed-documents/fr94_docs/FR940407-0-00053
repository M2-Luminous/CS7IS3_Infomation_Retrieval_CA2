FR940407-0-00053 FR940407-0-00011 EPA has reviewed North Dakota's application, and has made an immediate final decision that North Dakota's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to North Dakota. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until May 9, 1994. Copies of North Dakota's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the Addresses section of this notice. Approval of North Dakota's program revision shall become effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. EPA's comments on the draft application were addressed in the final application. Thus, the North Dakota program is only granted final authorization for those provisions specifically listed in Table 1.
