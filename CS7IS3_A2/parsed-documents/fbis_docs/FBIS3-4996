The U.S. Government is yet to officially confirm the reinstatement of the Super 301 clause, a government official said Thursday. Nevertheless, Seoul has already told Washington that reintroduction of the retaliatory trade act runs counter to the multilateral dispute settlement capacity of the World Trade Organization [WTO], which will replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) after the Uruguay Round pact is signed next year. The American press reported that President Bill Clinton has decided to reauthorize Super 301 in an executive order raising tariffs on Japanese imports following the collapse of Washington-Tokyo trade talks last month. Though initially aimed at Japan, Super 301 will eventually be used to widen U.S. access to Korea and affect Korean advancement into the American market. Washington has made it clear that it will apply Super 301 on non-WTO-bound countries and areas so that its impact is less pronounced, the official said. The 1988 omnibus trade act was largely denounced as the most retaliatory U.S. tool against countries with which it suffered a trade deficit and was finally killed toward the end of 1990. Korea will seek multilateral steps and act strongly against any unilateral retaliation by the United States, he said.
