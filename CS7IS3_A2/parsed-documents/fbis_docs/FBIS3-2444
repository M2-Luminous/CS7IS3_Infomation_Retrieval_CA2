The highlighted keynote was still that China wishes to have a peaceful environment to promote economic development. As to bilateral relations with other countries, special emphasis was laid on diplomacy with the United States, indicating the latter's importance to China. But he made no mention of relations with Britain. To counter the "China threat theory" discussed by foreign media in recent years, the work report made a point of creating a "peace-loving" image of the CPC. The portion of Li Peng's report on diplomatic work is under 1,300 characters, shorter than those of previous years, which devoted nearly 2,000 characters to this topic. Therefore, almost all the topics that were given much space in previous years were mentioned only briefly this time. Also, there was not much originality, but much of the same old tune. On the overall international situation, Li Peng first highlighted that the world is moving toward multipolarization and that hegemonism and power politics still exist. This has been a consistent viewpoint held by the CPC authorities in recent years on the post-cold-war period, especially after the Gulf War in 1991. But Li Peng made a special point that the economy is becoming a dominant factor which influences the development of international relations. On the topic of bilateral relations with other countries, apart from the Sino-U.S. relations that took up quite some space, all other relations were mentioned briefly with such wording as "the relations made progress" and "the friendly and cooperative relations gained further development." Last year, China devoted much space to emphasizing the importance of improving relations with surrounding countries, but the treatment of this topic in this year's report simply cannot be compared. Besides, the part on the Third World, which China used to set great store by, was almost completely left out this time. On the front of diplomacy with West Europe, Sino- German relations have obviously become China's focus in its Europe diplomacy and in the meantime, France's restoring friendship with Beijing was also praised. In last year's report, when talking about relations with the United States, Li Peng only emphasized the importance of observing three communiques, saying that it would lead to the improvement of bilateral relations. This year's report, besides repeating this idea, held Deng Xiaoping's 16-character statement, i.e. "increasing trust, reducing trouble, developing cooperation, and refraining from confrontation," as the standard and emphasized the importance to have in mind the whole world and the 21st century. This shows that the two sides restored their relations after mainland President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Clinton met each other last year, and that China needs the U.S. market, technology, and cooperation in security affairs. Unlike previous years, in the final two parts on China's role in the United Nations and China's opinion on international issues, Li Peng strongly expressed the hope for peace and refuted the "China threat theory." Li Peng said: China stands for overall prohibition of nuclear weapons and the conclusion of agreements on banning all nuclear tests through negotiations. China does not engage in the arms race, does not join any military bloc, and does not seek its sphere of influence. He also emphasized that since there are many differences between countries, the relations between any two countries should be built on generally recognized norms of international relations. China is against hegemony. It does not seek hegemony now and will not do so after its economy is developed. It will not pose a threat to the world and the region. This effort to create a "peace-loving" image indicates that China's diplomatic policies in the coming years will serve its economic construction.
