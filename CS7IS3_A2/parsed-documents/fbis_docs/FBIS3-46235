Mao Zedong thought on army-building is a key integral part of Mao Zedong Military Thought and Mao Zedong Thought and the most complete and scientific army-building thinking with the most Chinese characteristics. Mao Zedong's army-building thought reaches deeply into the CPC's great army-building practices; its formation and development fully display an ingenuity never seen before. We all know that early in the founding period of our Army, old China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, politically disunited, economically underdeveloped, and culturally and educationally very backward. Setting up a new-type proletariat-led People's Army in such a country was a task which had never been addressed by the revolutionary teachers Marx, Engels, and Lenin. In the New Democratic Revolution period, our Army was far worse off regarding weapons and installations than our enemy, with far less troops and much worse material conditions. How were we to complete the historical tasks of developing our Army into a powerful People's Army and toppling the "three great mountains" of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratism? There were no ready-made answers in the Marxist canon. But, in a heaven-shaking style, the Chinese Communists opened up the most glorious page of Chinese history with superhuman courage and boldness. After the founding of New China there were great improvements in the objective conditions for army-building. On the other hand, our army-building efforts faced many special situations; for example, for a very long time imperialism and hegemonism had encircled, blockaded, and militarily threatened our country and, constrained by the country's economy, there was limited military spending, repeated disruptions from "leftist" and rightist opportunism, and the sharp contradiction between the Army's low levels of modernization and the demands of modern warfare. Mao Zedong's army-building thought evolved from such special national and military situations and it: Absorbs, but is not hamstrung by, foreign experience; is grounded in China's practical situation; takes up all the good points of ancient, modern, Chinese, and foreign military thought; reveals, in a profound way, the basic characteristics and objective laws of building a People's Army; and it provides guidelines for the People's Army throughout its entire development from nothing into a powerful force, during which time miracles were created one after another. The road traversed by our Army repeatedly proves that when we pursue army-building according to Mao Zedong's army-building thought, our army will develop and grow and win victories forever; but it will go astray and suffer setbacks when we deviate from it. Remembrance of things past teaches us to treasure Mao Zedong's army-building thought. Mao Zedong's army-building thought is erudite and profound, with rich contents and encompasses all areas and aspects of army- building. Its basic tenets and principles apply to the past, present, and future. This is because Mao Zedong's army-building thought, like Mao Zedong Thought, is the most revolutionary and creative, will develop along with changes in historical conditions, and always maintains a strong vitality. Any sayings or thinking which deprecate the true vale of Mao Zedong's army-building thought are untenable. Mao Zedong's army-building thought is the crystal of the collective wisdom of Chinese Communists. Comrade Mao Zedong is the most distinguished representative of Mao Zedong's army-building thought. As the core of our party's leadership collective of the second generation, Comrade Deng Xiaoping creatively developed Mao Zedong's army-building thought in the new historical era and made brilliant contributions toward enriching Marxist army-building theories. Comrade Deng Xiaoping thought on army-building in the historical era scientifically answers a series of important questions about building our Army in a new era and points out a direction for our Army's efforts to revolutionize, modernize, and regularize itself. His advocacy of the guiding principles for strategic changes in army-building--the call to: Uphold the principle that army-building obeys the country's overall economic construction; center on modernization; make a comprehensive effort at building a modernized, regular, and revolutionary army; uphold the party's absolute leadership over the army; strengthen and improve political and ideological work; ensure that our Army is politically qualified; put military training in a strategic position; work actively to raise officers' ability to cope with modern warfare; work actively but steadily, and proceed in an orderly and progressive manner while pressing ahead with reforms in the Army; insist on ruling the Army with stern measures and according to law when the Army must be rectified; develop weapons and installations and reform the Army structure and size; vigorously strengthen troops' combat power; advocate five kinds of revolutionary spirit" and give play to our Army's fine traditions; maintain the true color of veteran Red Army soldiers; study people's war under modern warfare conditions; develop military science; and to grasp the truth that science and technology are the primary productive forces--these important thoughts and theories of Deng Xiaoping pushed Mao Zedong's army-building thought to a new stage. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in his report to the 14th Party Congress: "It is necessary to act in accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought about army-building in the new era; walk the path of turning our soldiers into crack troops with Chinese characteristics; build the PLA into a powerful, modernized, regular, and revolutionary army; continuously strengthen the national defense of our country; and provide a solid and powerful security guarantee for reform, opening up, and economic construction." This was a call from the Central Committee collective leadership, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, to the whole Army. We must obey the instructions of Comrade Jiang Zemin, conscientiously study Mao Zedong's army-building thought, especially Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on army-building in the new era, to grasp its essence; learn to use its position, viewpoints, and methods; emancipate minds; seek truth from facts; continuously study new situations and solve new problems; and actively work to press ahead with the building of our army. I believe that this will be the best way to commemorate the centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong's birth. The "General Introduction to Mao Zedong Though on Army-Building" tries hard to make an in-depth study of Mao Zedong's army-building thought; systematically exposes from, different angles, the formation and development of Mao Zedong's army-building thought and its basic theoretical viewpoints; and touches on the hitherto unexplored areas of Mao Zedong's army-building thought, putting forward some new viewpoints and understanding. It will help us to understand and comprehensively and systematically grasp the entire theoretical body of Mao Zedong's army-building thought. The author made a great effort in writing the book, though inadequacies still remain. It is hoped that in the future there will be continued effort to strengthen the study of Mao Zedong's army-building thought and further explorations combining theory and practice. At present, our country's reform, opening up, and economic construction are in a most critical stage. The People's Army shoulders a key historical mission. Led by the party Central Committee and Central Military Commission, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, we must actively study and use Mao Zedong's army- building thought, especially Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on army-building in the new era; act in accordance with Comrade Jiang Zemin's general demand of "be qualified politically, have a perfect mastery of military affairs, and maintain a good style, strict discipline, and effective guarantees;" continuously strengthen our Army's comprehensive construction and actively raise our army's combat power under the condition of modern technology, especially high technology; and actively struggle to complete satisfactorily the noble mission in the new era given us by the party and people!
