"We can talk at any time anywhere in Krajina," he added. "We know we are a state and nothing can make us change our mind. We are prepared to meet them in Plitvice whenever they want." Expressing the willingness to resume talks, Martic doubted at the same time whether the Croatian side will accept it, because "Krajina will remain adamant in its stand that one cannot go below what is known as reciprocity and equal terms." Martic claimed that the latest talks in Plitvice failed because they did not suit Croatia's needs and that journalists were used only as a pretext. "They do not suit Croatia's needs, the Croats are even prepared to sacrifice their own people at the expense of a war option," the RSK president claimed. "They were brought into this situation because we agreed to the talks and they had obviously not counted on it." Martic said that in Geneva the Croats asked that the meeting be held anywhere in "Croatia, including the RSK." Hence their surprise when we agreed to the talks in Plitvice, because they counted on the Serbian side's refusal. In this way they would have precipitated the war and found international sponsors for this attempt. "We really wanted to discuss economic issues, primarily the opening of communication lines. But, we are determined about one thing -- we cannot talk about it unless [UN] Security Council Resolution No. 820 is abolished." According to Martic, there are many issues to discuss. The RSK will ask to be allowed to use the ports of Zadar and Rovanjska and for access to Europe through Croatian territory, that is, through Italy, Slovenia, Austria, and Hungary. "In exchange for that, we would let them use our communications and, of course, we are ready to give water to Bigrad and Zadar, but it seems that this does not suit Tudjman and his policy," Martic says. Martic believes Tudjman does not care much for the Croats in Dalmatia. "If we were pounding Zagreb he would be concerned, but the fact that Zadar has no water supply is in fact good for him because he uses it to keep people under control and motivate them to fight against us." Milan Martic says the Croatian leaders are to blame for the lack of a regular water supply in Biograd and Zadar because they are refusing to hold talks. "Everything they are doing is leading toward the war option, and they will surely strike," he said. "At the moment they are prevented by huge rifts in the political and military leaderships, but the opposition is forcing Tudjman to go to war." "Their parliament is nonexistent. It is not functioning. Everyone is working to undermine it, and Tudjman can use that situation to arrest all his opponents. This is why he needs an attack on Krajina," Martic said in conclusion.
