He explained that at a social gathering high-ranking military officers had uttered "offensive remarks" about the president of the nation. Saguier added that according to the information he has, the whole thing is nothing but a rumor. He made it clear, however, that should the rumors come true the members of the Legislative Branch will be prepared to defend the nation's institutional order even if they do not agree with President Wasmosy. Deputy Saguier told the journalists that the rumors about a coup d'etat began after a high-ranking military officer in the course of a social gathering threatened to arrest President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. "At a ceremony to launch a new brand of beer, a drunken division general apparently said that he could arrest Wasmosy any time he wanted. The general even threatened to prevent the president from addressing Congress. A colonel who also attended the party uttered similar remarks. He stated specifically that they would take the president by the ear and put him in a cell," Saguier explained. The deputy said that according to his sources, several businessmen were present on the occasion and they heard what the military officers said. "The officers did not restrict themselves to the above remarks but went on commenting offensively about the president of the nation," Saguier stated. "Rambo" Sanguier explained that the conflict between the abovementioned division general and President Wasmosy apparently cropped up because the two support different candidates to chair the Colorado Party Executive Board. In the morning on 28 February Saguier and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Francisco Jose de Vargas went on a fact-finding expedition to see whether the rumors could be confirmed. Saguier said that they talked with several military officers and diplomats to find out whether a coup d'etat was actually in the making. Saguier added: "We talked to several key embassies and they told us that they had heard the rumors but had no information that gave them a clear idea of the situation. The embassies also told us that they had checked the main military units which did not appear to be getting ready for action." Later on the deputy stated that all congressmen are prepared to defend the nation's institutional order. "I deeply disagree with the president on several matters but I will defend the country's institutional order all the same. You may rest assured of this because yet another rumor indicated that Congress would surrender to the coupists. We are totally committed to the Constitution and we will defend it in spite of General Lino Oviedo or even Wasmosy himself," Saguier said.
