More credit is expected to be extended to foreign-funded ventures in 1994, said Liang Jin'e, deputy general manager of the bank's first credit department. But Liang declined to specify how much the total credit will amount to. The bank last year supplied $4.3 billion in foreign exchange to foreign-funded ventures, 28 percent more than in 1992. It also granted 42.5 billion yuan ($4.88 billion) in loans denominated in renminbi, a rise of 34.4 percent from 1992. Last year's total credit amount and the rate of increase were records for the bank. While promising active support for foreign-funded ventures, Liang warned that the Bank of China will not be able to meet the demands of all firms. She said the bank will channel its limited capital into supporting selected firms according to the country's industrial policy. The beneficiaries will include enterprises in the energy, transportation and telecommunication industries. Priority will also be given to export-oriented and technologically-advanced firms. Liang said those with high profitability and strong ability to repay debt will also be on the preferred list. To boost the economic links between the mainland and Taiwan, priority will be given to Taiwan-funded firms. The bank is trying to organize specialized loans for these firms. The bank will closely watch the investment activities of large and well-known overseas companies, believing that any interest by them in investing in large projects in China deserve priority. Lians said the bank will be cautious in lending to foreign-funded ventures engaged in real estate speculation or the importation of outdated equipment. It will also be careful with firms that have not repaid, on schedule, loans already granted by the bank. To those able to make up losses in the near future, the bank will continue to give its support. But to those with no hope of making profits, the bank will press for repayment. Liang said the bank will supervise and urge foreign-funded enterprises to operate efficiently. She said the bank will try to improve its regulations on lending to protect the bank's assets. "It is time for us to make use of our experience and solve the problems," Lians said. To better manage its loans to foreign-funded ventures, the bank will also strengthen the training of its staff. As a major channel for utilizing foreign investment, the Bank of China has been following a credit policy that favours foreign-funded ventures. Since 1980, the bank has provided foreign-funded ventures with $18.3 billion in foreign exchange and 135.6 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) in renminbi. About 50 percent of the foreign-funded ventures in China have opened accounts with the Bank of China. Of these, 20 percent have received loans from the bank. Analysts said the bank's active support of foreign-funded ventures should be strengthened by the growth in savings deposits. By the end of last year, the outstanding savings in renminbi had surpassed 204.86 billion yuan ($23.5 billion) while savings denominated in foreign exchange totalled $27.8 billion.
