FR941206-0-00114 FR941206-0-00017 The Commission has received numerous comments with respect to a la carte issues. Most of the commenters requested greater clarification of the Commission's a la carte rules and guidelines. Commenters also made suggestions concerning the treatment of a la carte offerings that are found not to meet Commission guidelines. Some suggest that cable operators should not be penalized for failing to satisfy the Commission's test for a la carte packages because it is unclear. 2. Discussion The evidence obtained in response to the letters of inquiry issued to cable operators offering a la carte packages and the comments we received from cable operators convinced the Commission that it should reconsider its approach. It seems clear that some cable operators have evaded rate regulation by purporting to offer channels a la carte, when in fact the individual offerings were not a realistic service alternative. On the other hand, there is merit to the industry's claim that neither the Commission's original two-part test nor its interpretative guidelines provides a clear answer with respect to the permissibility of some a la carte packages that have been offered. Indeed, it is perhaps inevitable that the test would not be capable of precise application in many instances because it is not clear how various factors should be weighed and applied. The Commission's analysis leads it to conclude, contrary to its prior decisions, that a la carte packages are CPSTs within the meaning of the 1992 Cable Act. The conclusion that all packages are ``cable programming services'' is supported by the language of the statute, the legislative history, and practical considerations as well. Section 3(l)(2) of the 1992 Cable Act defines CPSTs as ``any video programming provided over a cable system, regardless of service tier, including installation or rental of equipment used for the receipt of such video programming, other than (A) video programming carried on the basic service tier, and (B) video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis.'' 47 U.S.C. 543(l)(2). A package of channels, whether or not the channels also are offered a la carte, plainly is ``video programming provided over a cable system,'' and hence is a ``cable programming service.'' The package is not ``video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis;'' the individual channels are. Accordingly, it is apparent from the statutory language that a la carte packages are cable programming services. The conclusion that a package of a la carte channels is a CPST is further supported by the legislative history, which focused on the fact that bundled offerings of cable programming would be subject to rate regulation. A conclusion that rate regulation does not apply at all to video programming packages if the channels are offered individually would fatally undermine the rate regulations rules Congress enacted. If a package of a la carte channels is not a CPST, any cable operator may avoid rate regulation simply by announcing the offering of channels on an a la carte basis even if very few subscribers would choose the a la carte offerings rather than the package. However, as the Commission recognized in the Rate Order, there are sound policy reasons to treat as reasonable any price offered for a package of channels that traditionally have been offered on a per-channel basis. Indeed, the Commission can not envision circumstances in which any price of a collective offering such as the commonly offered ``HBO/Showtime'' package would be found to be unreasonable. For the future, the new rules authorizing ``new product tiers'' should provide cable operators with sufficient flexibility to offer such packages at whatever price they choose. Although cable operators may not remove channels from regulated tiers and offer them on NPTs, they are free to create packages of a la carte channels under the new rules governing NPTs. Moreover, as stated above, the Commission previously ``grandfathered'' packages available on April 1, 1993. The difficult question concerns the treatment of a la carte packages created between April 1, 1993, and September 30, 1994. In some cases, the Commission thinks it is clear that the package at issue was not a permissible package under a fair reading of its test. In other cases, however, it is not clear how the test should be applied to the package at issue. In those cases, the Commission thinks it is fair, in light of the uncertainty created by its test, to allow cable operators to treat existing packages as NPTs even though it would not qualify under the new rules, provided that such packages involve only a small number of migrated channels. 2 The Commission sees little reason to require an operator to ``reverse migrate'' a package that was not clearly ineligible for unregulated treatment under our a la carte policy. The Commission intends to address whether specific operator packages should be treated as NPTs in rulings on individual cases in the near future. 2 As noted above, competition between an NPT and a BST and/or CPST is the primary reason that we conclude rates for NPTs will not be unreasonable.
