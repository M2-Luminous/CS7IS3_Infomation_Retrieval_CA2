This report was denied yesterday by sources close to the government. The sources said that Algeria has been continuing to service its foreign debt. Nasira Bouzid reports: [Bouzid] Algeria continues payment of its external debts by the required time. Sources close to the prime minister's office have told APS that Algeria has paid in succession $900 million and $600 million as debt principal and services, for the payments due in December last and this month, January, alone. Likewise, in December 1992 and January 1993, Algeria paid in succession $911 million and $694 million. The same sources said that the reorganization of debt management procedures in order to improve them had led to a purely administrative delay. The prime minister's office stressed that Algeria continues to make all efforts to preserve its policy of respect for foreign commitments. The same sources thereby denied the reports carried by some Western newspapers, especially LE MONDE, which had a headline on its front page yesterday saying: Algeria Suspends Payment of its External Debt. The government sources described these reports as groundless.
