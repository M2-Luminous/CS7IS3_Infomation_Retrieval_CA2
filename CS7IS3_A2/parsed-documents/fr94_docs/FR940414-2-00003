FR940414-2-00003 FR940414-2-00002 Forest Service Use of Bait in Hunting AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice of withdrawal of interim policy, notice of proposed policy; and request for public comment. SUMMARY: On March 14, 1994, the Forest Service published an interim policy, with a request for public comment, on the agency's role in regulating the placement of bait on National Forest System lands (59 FR 11765). This notice withdraws the interim policy and republishes it as a proposed policy. The intended effect of the proposed policy is to clarify the agency's role in relation to the role of the States and, thus, to provide a consistent approach to the regulation of baiting resident game. Public comment is invited and will be considered in the adoption of a final policy, notice of which will be published in the Federal Register . DATES: Comments must be received in writing by June 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to Director, Wildlife, Fish, and Rare Plants (2640), Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6090. The public may inspect comments received on this proposed policy in the Office of the Director, Wildlife, Fish, and Rare Plants, 4th floor Southwest Wing, Auditors Building, 205 14th Street SW., Washington, DC. Those wishing to inspect comments should call ahead at (202) 205&hyph;1159 to facilitate entry into the building. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tom Darden, Wildlife, Fish, and Rare Plants Staff, (202) 205&hyph;1206. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background State fish and wildlife agencies have the primary responsibility for protection and management of wildlife populations on National Forest System lands, including adoption of State fish and wildlife laws and regulations affecting the taking of resident game animals. The Forest Service enters into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each State which governs Forest Service/State cooperation on matters of Statewide fish and wildlife policy or procedure affecting the National Forest System (FSM 2611.1). The States issue regulations regarding hunting licenses, methods, seasons, locations, and bag limits for resident game and have the primary responsibility for enforcement of fish and wildlife laws and regulations on National Forest System lands. Federal land management statutes acknowledge the States' traditional role in managing fish and wildlife; see the National Forest System Organic Administration Act at 16 U.S.C. 480, the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act at 16 U.S.C. 528, the Sikes Act at 16 U.S.C. 670h, and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, at 43 U.S.C. 1732. The Forest Service, therefore, is generally reluctant to override State fish and wildlife regulation, except where federal interests, such as protection of forest land, resources, and users, require federal intervention.
