Germany and Russia shared the same positions on the main political events of the moment, they stressed. During a joint news conference, Kinkel reaffirmed that Germany "will support with all its power the signing of a long-overdue cooperation agreement between the European Union and Russia." Germany would have ample scope for this when it assumed the EU Presidency on 1 July. He said Russia remained a reliable partner, both multilaterally and bilaterally. Kinkel gave the Russian Minister of Culture Yevgeniy Sidorov a personal message from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl regarding the return of cultural items. Kinkel and Kozyrev said they also discussed preparations for the planned visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Germany in May. Kinkel said he had gained the impression during his stay that Yeltsin was in full control of the situation in Russia. The ministers said their meeting also covered international issues such as the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Middle East. Kinkel praised Russia's involvement in securing a compromise between the warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted]
