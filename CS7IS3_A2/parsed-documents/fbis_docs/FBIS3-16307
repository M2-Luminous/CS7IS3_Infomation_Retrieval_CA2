For his part, Crimean Parliamentary Chairman Nikolay Bagrov defeated by Meshkov in presidential elections in January, in a speech in Sevastopol said that on a number of points the new president's first decrees were out of line both with Ukrainian and Crimean legislation. INTERFAX Note: Crimean deputies have not accepted Bagrov's resignation as parliamentary leader that he tendered after a crushing defeat in the presidential elections. Bagrov said the Crimean president's decree sacking the cabinet included a number of officials who were not cabinet members, among them -- heads of the Ukrainian security services for the territory and of "Crimea" TV company. Bagrov said it was not sensible to try to make 1994 a year of continued elections, pointing to a parliamentary resolution saying it was pointless to call local elections in Crimea on June 26 timed to coincide with a similar vote in Ukraine. Bagrov called for local elections to be held later in the year instead of this summer at the height of a harvesting and holiday season. He praised the parliament's performance over the past four years saying "Crimean statehood was the main achievement" over the period. However, Bagrov believes that on the negative side, the parliament has failed to set in motion a mechanism for an "open economy" in the territory. But local observers think this is something that Russian economist Yevgeniy Saburov, appointed as vice premier last Friday, will be able to make progress in. Many point to the fact that Saburov's first steps as virtual head of government are clearly intended to ease tension in relations with Kiev. INTERFAX Note: Shortly after his appointment, Saburov appealed to the Ukrainian president to be granted Ukrainian citizenship. And at a news conference later, he spoke of wanting "to nudge Meshkov towards rapprochement with Kiev." Saburov said Crimea would maintain very close ties with Ukraine. He praised the professional skills of Ukrainian economics and finance ministers Roman Shpek and Grigoriy Pyatachenko describing them as "highly pragmatic." At the same time, Saburov said the core of his cabinet would be made up of leading economists, to be invited from Russia, and whom he described as "highly competent professionals."
