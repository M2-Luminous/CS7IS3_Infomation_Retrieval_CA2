Speaking on television he declared that such assemblies will be carried out constantly from now on, and all the Armenian citizens liable for call-up will take part in them. The State Minister confirmed that after a short military training the participants of the assembly are usually sent to the Armenian- Azerbaijani frontier. However, they serve not at the front line, but in rearguard.
