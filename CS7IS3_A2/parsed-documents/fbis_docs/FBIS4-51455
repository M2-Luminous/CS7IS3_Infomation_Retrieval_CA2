FBIS4-51455 "drchi103_w_94014" FBIS-CHI-94-103 Daily Report 27 May 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Government `Likely' To Grant Visa to Dissident Government `Likely' To Grant Visa to Dissident HK2705054694 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 27 May 94 p 2 HK2705054694 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [By Rain Ren] [Text] The Government is likely to grant a tourist visa to Wu'er Kaixi, a leading Tiananmen Square student activist, if he promises to maintain a low profile and does not declare his intention to take part in open political activities during his planned July visit. Despite intense Chinese criticism, the Government also intends to continue giving sanctuary to Han Dongfang, one of China's best-known labour activists. A senior government official said last night that Wu'er's application for a visa would be considered on its merits, adding that the decision would also have to take into account public interest. However, it is understood that Wu'er has not yet applied for a visa. Last week, Wu'er said he intended to visit Hong Kong "to see friends" in late June and July. A Chinese official reacted to this angrily on Wednesday, and accused the Government of intending to turn Hong Kong into a "subversive base" by sheltering Han, who has returned to Hong Kong from the United States. China's condemnation was rejected yesterday by the Government. A spokesman said Han's case had nothing to do with allowing him to use Hong Kong as a "subversive base". "We simply gave him a visa to stay here so that he can continue to press his case with the Chinese authorities to return to China." The deputy to the Governor, Anson Chan, said yesterday that it was for the Government to maintain and safeguard the basic freedoms of the Hong Kong people. "These basic freedoms include the freedom to express one's views freely in a peaceful and lawful manner. "The question of offering hospitality for visitors to Hong Kong who might use Hong Kong as a base for subversion is quite a different matter. Neither the Hong Kong government nor the Hong Kong people wish to see Hong Kong being used as a base for subversion and we intend fully to abide by the concept of "one country, two systems" and, of course, this is a two-way street." It is understood that Chan's remarks were in response to rumours that some Chinese democratic movement activists were heading for Hong Kong to attend or organise public gatherings to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the June 4 massacre.
