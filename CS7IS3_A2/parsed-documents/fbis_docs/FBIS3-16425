In an interview with ITAR-TASS, V. Mikhaylov disclosed that one of the main objectives of the visit and the business meetings which began at the Department of Energy on Monday is to get the U.S. side to make a decision on ways to help Russia to end production of enriched uranium-239. On the American side the meetings are being chaired by Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary. The visit is taking place in the context of the work done by the bilateral intergovermental commission chaired by U.S. Vice President Albert Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian minister said. The members of this commission have already agreed that Russia will be given U.S. financial assistance to build a store for weapons-grade materials, which could subsequently be used as fuel for nuclear power stations. Washington has already allocated the first $75 million for the purchase of equipment for this project, Mikhaylov noted. We now intend to ask the Americans to speed up the handover of another $75 million for actual construction of the store. In return we are prepared to speed up a decision on halting production of weapons-grade plutonium -- which, incidentally, is our objective anyway. However, it has to be remembered that the capacities which produce plutonium also generate electricity and heat. Therefore, the replacement of these capacities with alternative forms of energy production is a pressing matter. We also intend to discuss this question during the visit to Washington. Concluding the interview, Mikhaylov noted that Russian experts have developed a good working relationship with their U.S. colleagues, and this fact gives grounds for hoping that the results of the present visit will be useful. Our joint aim is to assist with the practical implementation of the agreement reached in Moscow last December by Albert Gore and Viktor Chernomyrdin on the closure of Russia's three remaining plutonium reactors -- two at Krasnoyarsk and one in Tomsk -- and their replacement with alternative sources of energy production, Birls, special assistant to the U.S. energy secretary on Russia and other CIS countries, told ITAR-TASS. Birls, who is also attending the working meetings, says he is sure that a detailed report, including all the technical details, will be prepared in time for the third session of the intergovernmental commission, chaired by the U.S. vice president and the Russian prime minister. This will be held at the end of May.
