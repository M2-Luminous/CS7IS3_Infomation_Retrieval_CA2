Yesterday, China announced the names of another batch of advisers on Hong Kong affairs, including a number of Legco members. Also, as expected, Beijing has appointed a couple of prominent liberals, in a significant gesture intended to enhance the credibility of the new group and to help split the pro-democracy camp. We would like to believe China's motivation is less cynical and more straightforward than the announcement suggests. In other words, that the Chinese government was keen to appoint a wider spectrum of members and therefore receive a broader range of local opinion. This view would be sustainable if China had enrolled political leaders who secured the highest numbers of votes in past elections. Instead, Beijing has opted for a clutch of politicians who have never stood for office or have done so and been rejected by the electorate. There is one significant exception to this general rule of Chinese appointments: Elsie Tu. Tu is undeniably a popular politician, who made her reputation as a champion of the underdog and as someone who was fearless in standing up to the authorities. Idealists may believe China is soliciting Tu's advice because the government in Beijing is keen to have an outspoken campaigner hammering away from inside. Realists are more likely to conclude that Tu has been appointed as a reward for her unflinching opposition to Governor Patten's democratic reform plans. Here is the rub. China's appointments appear to have been made on the basis of reward for services rendered. In this case the service of opposing the reform proposals. The appointment of Frederick Fung, the leader of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood and Anthony Cheung, a Meeting Point leader, appears to be even more cynically motivated. China has rightly identified the weak links in the democracy camp's chain and has employed a tactic frequently used by the rulers of the British Empire at the height of their powers. The divide-and-rule tactic was a hallmark of British colonial policy. Chinese leaders seem to have been studying these methods and concluded that one of the best ways of weakening the democracy camp was to pick off those most likely to wobble when pushed. Having started with the appointment of advisers who were either very rich, very loyal to China or very adept at changing sides, the government in Beijing has grown wise and realised appearances are important. Thus, this third batch gives every appearance of creating balance. The clutch of liberals are joined by a number of establishment politicians and some respected professionals. Yet, are there any signs the Chinese government really wants to receive Hong Kong advice from a genuine cross-section of the community? China stoutly refuses to contemplate talking to members of the United Democrats, the territory's largest political party. This is in sharp contrast to its willingness for dialogue with the Kuomintang -- the Communist Party's bitter rival in the civil war. Aside from the United Democrats, there is a large pool of people who have become involved in politics and shown their ability to understand the issues facing Hong Kong. There also are a great many genuinely independent personalities who would have much to offer an advisory body; not the least because they would provide blunt advice, however unpalatable. China should know some of the best advice comes not from friends, nor from sycophants who are anxious to please, but from impartial sources or even enemies. The latter have an uncanny knack of zeroing in on weaknesses which more sympathetic parties might be inclined to overlook. Interestingly, however, some of China's most outspoken advice has come from some of its oldest Hong Kong allies, who clearly feel secure enough to speak bluntly on occasion. Some of these long-term supporters of China are firmly entrenched in grassroots organisations which provide a good sounding board for popular sentiment. Hopefully, some of the newer advisers, appointed yesterday, will seize this opportunity to treat their new position not as a Chinese version of the British honours system, but as a serious opportunity to keep China informed of Hong Kong sentiment. China would do itself a favour if it was prepared to cast the net wider in searching for advice but, as this is unlikely, a heavy burden of responsibility lies on those chosen to act as a bridge to the new regime. If they dodge that responsibility by simply mouthing lines they believe their new masters want to hear, they will have much to answer for.
