"President Li expressed Taiwan's intention to share its experience in economic development with other countries during his three-country Southeast Asia tour," Raymond Tai, deputy secretary-general to the president, explained at a forum sponsored by the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY. Tai said Li's visit was also aimed at promoting trade and economic cooperation with Taiwan's neighboring countries. "The president hoped to find new regional cooperation fields through his visit to The Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand," noted Tai who accompanied Li on his Feb. 9-16 visit, also billed as a "vacation trip." Speaking on the same occasion, opposition legislator Lu Hsiu-yi praised Li's pragmatic attitude in expanding Taiwan's international presence. "Albeit unofficial," Lu said, "the eight-day visit has spotlighted Taiwan's existence, which Beijing has persistently tried to ignore or deny." "Li's effort to promote economic cooperation with Southeast Asian nations also complies with the post-Cold War world trend," Lu noted. Regional economic cooperation is the catchword in today's international relations. "It is a correct strategy for Taiwan to strengthen economic ties with Southeast Asian nations as a way to balance its rapidly growing investment in Mainland China which remains hostile toward Taipei," Lu added. Jeffrey Ku, chairman of Chinatrust Commercial Bank and a dollar-a-year adviser to the cabinet, said at the CNA forum that Li's Southeast Asia visit would help encourage more Taiwan industrialists to invest in the region. Ku, also a member on Li's entourage, said Beijing had tried every possible means to block Li's unofficial visit. "We quietly swallowed all disgrace on many occasions in order to accomplish our task," Ku recalled. "Li's low profile and sincerity have won him friendship and respect of political leaders in the three countries, including Philippine President Fidel Ramos, Indonesian President Suharto and Thai King Phumiphon Adunyadet," Ku observed. The business tycoon added he believes that following Li's visit, the three countries will take gradual steps to improve services for Taiwan investors.
