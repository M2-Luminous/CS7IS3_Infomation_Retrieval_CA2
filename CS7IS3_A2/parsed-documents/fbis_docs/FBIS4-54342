The nationwide student organization will hold its main event Saturday at the Choson University stadium, where Friday evening's celebration is also being held. On Sunday, Hanchongnyon plans to stage a parade after a citizen-student resolution rally in front of the South Cholla provincial government building. The local police agency, estimating over 30,000 students from throughout the nation will attend, plans to mobilize 14,000 riot troopers from 117 police companies to handle any emergencies. Scores of illuminators and loudspeakers have been installed around a large podium and other places on campus in preparation for an inauguration rally and other celebratory functions. Hundreds of placards and flags are waving at every corner in the campus area, trumpeting the festival organized by the student group. Hanchongnyon has completed arrangements for lodging 50,000 students from across the country it expects to attend while preparing some 200,000 lunch boxes and thousands of printed leaflets for the event. Those involved in printing and supplying food for the lunch boxes are doing a booming business in Kwangju. Furthermore, the Choson University student organization has organized a corps of 1,500 volunteers to assist participants. Hanchongnyon leaders said students from other parts of the country started to head for Kwangju early Friday morning, adding that all preparations for the event are progressing smoothly.
