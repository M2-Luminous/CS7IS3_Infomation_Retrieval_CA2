FBIS4-23286 "drafr106_c_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Delay in Provincial Government Budgets Expected Delay in Provincial Government Budgets Expected MB0106162494 Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 1 Jun 94 p 1 MB0106162494 Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY English BFN [By Tim Cohen] [Text] Cape Town -- Provincial Affairs officials expect that it will take up to a year before provincial governments pass their first budgets. Department sources said the long delay in the establishment of functioning provincial governments was inevitable considering the need to amalgamate some regional authorities and to split others. The comments came as ANC local government negotiator Thozamile Botha was on Monday [30 May] appointed chairman of the commission on provincial government by Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer. SAPA [South Africa Press Agency] reports he will be assisted by former MEC [Member Executive Council] and NP [National Party] member Tjol Lategan. The commission is to facilitate the establishment of provincial governments and advise the Constitutional Assembly on developing provincial constitutions. Other members are R. Jager, P. Lephunya, T.R. Benecke-Jordaan, P. Daphen, N.N. Gwagwa, D.E.T. le Roux, J. Malatji, Y. Muthien, Z. Titus, T. Tlhacoane, J.W.A. van der Merwe, V. Vedlanker and M. Webber. Only Botha and Lategan will serve in full-time capacities. The departmental sources said although "those in the know" realised it would take time before provincial governments were up and running, the extent of the difficulties involved was not foreseen. The holding of provincial and national elections simultaneously was a "political decision" which did not take into account the likelihood that the provincial administrations would take time to be established. However, representatives of provincial governments have since expressed frustration at the time it will take before they will be able to exercise their powers, but national government representatives say the delay is unavoidable. Meanwhile, regional bureaucracies will be required to continue delivering their existing services, as stipulated by the constitution. During the interim period, provincial governments will not be able to change existing structures without the backing of the national government. Pivotal in the process will be the establishment of the financial and fiscal commission, which will recommend the division of tax income between the national and provincial governments. The constitution states that provinces may levy taxes -- but only after they are authorised to do so by an Act of Parliament. The provinces will be entitled to "an equitable share" of national revenue once Parliament has fixed these amounts. The allocation of national tax revenue will be made after the national interest and the recommendations of the financial and fiscal commission have been taken into account, the constitution states.
