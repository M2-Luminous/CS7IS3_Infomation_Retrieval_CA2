Yi said he was told by Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu over the telephone that Han and his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher coordinated their position over the phone a day earlier. If Pyongyang refuses any either of additional IAEA inspection or inter-Korean envoy exchange, the third-round high-level talks with Washington cannot take place and Team Spirit will be held this year, Han was quoted as saying. Under such circumstance, North Korean nuclear problem will be inevitably referred to the Security Council, which likely will create tension in the Korean peninsula, Han told Yi. But Seoul and Washington will make efforts to persuade Pyongyang in agreeing to extra IAEA inspections and continue inter-Korean dialogue to realize envoy exchange, Han said. "It now looks like the (North Korean nuclear) problem has returned to the starting point and all channels blocked, but in the long run, there is room for hope if we continue dialogue," Han was quoted as saying. Through dialogue efforts in the past year, North Korea has lost sympathy from the international community and Seoul and Washington have obtained sufficient grounds to persuade China to follow their steps in regards to possible decision by the Security Council, he said. The government and DLP [Democratic Liberal Party] will meet next week to discuss the North Korean nuclear problem.
