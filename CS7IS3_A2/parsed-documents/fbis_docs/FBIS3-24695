The rebels are pinned down in the northern Tadjoura area, where they claim to be giving the government a lot of problems by launching hit-and-run raids on a wide range of targets including military convoys, and there are reports of a sizable clash in the region on Wednesday [26 January] this week. Raggi Omar asked FRUD's Europe representative in Paris, Ismael Ahmed, what information he had about this week's fighting. [Begin recording] [Ahmed] Yes, we have made lots of action in the Tadjoura and Obock area against governmental positions and against even convoys, and the FRUD fighters had success in all those actions. [Omar] And how many convoys have you hit, and what kind of convoys were they? [Ahmed] They were military convoys. We had a lot of them, approximately 16 or 17 in this month and a lot of positions of government. [Omar] Is this fighting still going on? [Ahmed] It is, yes. In some areas, it is still going on, but we are moving guerrillas, and we cannot say when and how we will wage future actions. [Omar] So let me get this straight. Your military tactic is to effectively make large parts of northern Djibouti ungovernable by the Djiboutian forces that are there. [Ahmed] No, our objective is to withdraw the Gouled government. We are convinced that the fundamental problem of Djibouti cannot get a solution other than a political solution, so we are doing everything in our possibility to withdraw that government. [Omar] It sounds like--from what you are saying--FRUD has been pinned down in that northern Tadjoura area and that all you are able to do effectively is to launch these hit-and-run attacks and that there is not much more than you can do apart from that. [Ahmed] No, because we have done other actions. We have liberated, you know, at the beginning of the armed struggle, two-thirds of the territory, but we have faced a lot of logistical problems because we are not the state and we are not helped by another state. So now, we are doing--with our own means--the armed struggle, and we have adapted ourselves according to our means. [end recording]
