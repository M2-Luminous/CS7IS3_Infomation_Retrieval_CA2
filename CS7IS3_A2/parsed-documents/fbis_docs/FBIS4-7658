I would like to strengthen our bilateral relations but I must take the opportunity to discuss Bulgaria's contacts with the European Union as well as the problem of stability and security in Central Europe, he said upon his arrival. Diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Belgium were established in 1879 and were suspended between 1941 and 1947. The latest visit of a Belgian foreign minister to Bulgaria took place 10 years ago. In a televised interview last night Bulgaria's ambassador to Belgium, Ms. Lea Cohen, described the visit of Mr. Claes as a "revival of active contacts between Bulgaria and Belgium". Tomorrow morning Mr. Claes will have talks at the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry. In the afternoon he will be received by President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. On Tuesday Mr. Claes, who has graduated from a music-school and has conducted almost all symphony orchesrtas in Belgium, will conduct the Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra in the National Palace of Culture.
