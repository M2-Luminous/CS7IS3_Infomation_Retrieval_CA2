FR941117-2-00154 FR941117-2-00103 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [Docket No. 94&hyph;75; Notice 2] Automobili Lamborghini; Grant of Application for Temporary Exemption From Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 214 Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. of Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy, (``Lamborghini'') applied for a temporary exemption from the dynamic side impact protection requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 214 Side Impact Protection . The basis of the application was that compliance would cause substantial economic hardship to a company that has tried to comply with the standard in good faith. Notice of receipt of the application was published on September 28, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 49462). This notice grants the exemption. On May 16, 1994, Lamborghini petitioned NHTSA to permit Chrysler Corporation to include Lamborghini vehicles in its vehicle fleet for the purpose of compliance with Standard No. 214's phase-in calculation for enhanced side protection. In the alternative, it petitioned NHTSA to grant the company a temporary exemption from the side impact standard's new performance requirements until September 1, 1996. On August 5, 1994, NHTSA denied Lamborghini's request to be included in Chrysler's fleet because Chrysler had sold its interest in Lamborghini on January 31, 1994, to a group of investors led by MegaTech Ltd., a Bermuda corporation. At the same time, NHTSA informed Lamborghini that it would proceed to consider the question of temporary exemption. Lamborghini supplemented its application on August 22, 1994. Lamborghini has manufactured only 1,475 motor vehicles over the past five years, approximately 25% of which have been sold in the United States. Denial would therefore mean loss of the important U.S. market until compliance could be achieved, an estimated 250 sales of 670 produced between January 1, 1995 and August 31, 1996. The applicant had operating losses in 1993 of approximately $5,000,000, and in 1992 of approximately $28,000,000. For 1991 it had an operating profit of almost $5,000,000. While it was owned by Chrysler, Lamborghini vehicles were scheduled to be modified during the last year of the phase-in period which ends with vehicles produced on August 31, 1996, because of the low number of vehicles produced and the lead time necessary for engineering and tooling modifications. Chrysler's sale of Lamborghini, therefore, has placed the applicant in a difficult position since, before the sale, ``Lamborghini had a good faith basis for believing that it would not need to meet the requirements of Standard 214 until the production year beginning September 1, 1996 *␣*␣*.'' Lamborghini was left without sufficient lead time to comply 100% of its production by either September 1, 1994 or September 1, 1995, and, since it produces only a single model, cannot avail itself of the phase-in requirement.
