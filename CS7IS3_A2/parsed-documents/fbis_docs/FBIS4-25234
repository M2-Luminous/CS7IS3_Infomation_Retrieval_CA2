On 14 May, this reporter had an interview with Comrade Shi Wensheng, director of the provincial coal industrial administrative bureau and head of the preparatory leading group of the provincial coal department, on the issues of how our province's coal enterprises can overcome their difficulties and extricate themselves from the difficult position. Shi Wensheng introduced: The party Central Committee and the State Council fully understand and have been extremely concerned with the difficulties of state-owned coal enterprises cropping up since the development of the market economy. In March and April, Vice Premiers Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua sponsored meetings on several occasions to especially study the coal industry's problems cropping up in the operation of the economy. In mid April when Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and the leading comrades of the state departments and commissions concerned conducted investigation and study activities and handled official business on the spot in our province, they concentrated more energy to study and resolve the difficulties of the state-owned coal enterprises in Heilongjiang and also adopted a series of supporting measures as follows: The value added tax rate of the coal enterprises should be reduced from 17 percent to 13 percent. Four million yuan of loans will be granted to the Jixi, Hegang, Shuangyashan, and Qitaihe coal mining administrative bureaus to ensure the payment of wages to their staff members and workers as well as the supply of funds urgently needed in production. The time limit for the return of the loans that were granted to the Jixi and Hegang coal mining administrative bureaus before the Spring Festival to ensure the payment of the wages to their staff members and workers will be extended from three months to nine months. Loans will be granted to the power, metallurgical, and chemical industrial trades to help pay off the arrears of the payments for goods to the Jixi, Hegang, Shangyashan, and Qitaihe coal mining administrative bureaus. These measures have been or are being implemented in a step-by-step manner and will greatly help promote the reform, development, and stability of the state-owned coal enterprises in the province. It can be said that this is a historical turn in the development of Heilongjiang's coal industry. The situation ahead of the coal industry of the province at present can be summarized as good opportunities, many advantages, great difficulties, and heavy tasks. The key to grasping favorable opportunities, using advantages, overcoming and tiding over difficulties, and welcoming challenges hinges on the enterprises themselves. The coal enterprises should ultimately rely on the deepening of self-reform, make painstaking efforts to enhance internal strength, and strengthen management. Shi Wensheng pointed out: Deepening reform and changing mechanisms is the fundamental way for coal enterprises to extricate themselves from the difficult position. The coal industry of our province should comprehensively popularize Kailuan's experience to carry out the simulated legal persons' operation method and to set up the internal market mechanism. It is necessary to reform the highly centralized management pattern of mining administrative bureaus, determine small accounting units, and carry out the internal economic contacts. The auxiliary production units of all mining administrative bureaus, such as machine repair plants, water works, power plants, and transportation departments, should assume responsibility for their own profits or losses, settle accounts for themselves, externally offer services, and push themselves to markets. At the time of offering internal services, the units in service of the people's livelihood, such as guesthouses, vehicle teams, and administrative services, should positively create income from the outside places to make up for the deficiency in internal services. The enterprises subordinate to these coal mining administrative bureaus, such as water and heat supply units, should create profits. Production plants and sections are allowed to carry out either the two-level legal persons management method or the simulated legal persons management method; keep separate accounts; settle different accounts among different levels; and gradually change from the simple relations between higher levels and lower levels, the relations between the first line of administrative management and the second line of administrative management, and the relations between to serve and to be served to the relations with the focus on economic contacts. Reducing the staff and increasing efficiency is a major measure for the coal enterprises to halt deficits and increase profits. This year, the four bureaus in our province plan to reduce 50,000 staff members and 10,000 raw coal production personnel. According to this target, all bureaus should reduce the existing pit management personnel, reduce the quotas of the office cadres at various levels, remove unplanned employees, and strive to basically realize the goal of three-line separations within 2 years. Simultaneously, it is necessary to accelerate the setup of the modern enterprise system. The bureaus and collieries where conditions permit should carry out the corporate system on a trial basis, strive to gain experiences in carrying out the system, and gradually popularize it. We should pay attention to summing up the small-sized mines and plants' experiences in implementing, on a trial basis, the state ownership and civilian management system, the decontrolled management system, the leasing management system, and the shareholding system; gradually perfect and develop these systems based on the existing conditions; and expand the implementation of the systems. It is necessary to continue to achieve the auxiliary reform; to deepen the reform of the labor, wage distribution, and social insurance systems as well as the organizational structure; and to reduce enterprises' burdens on developing social undertakings. All bureaus and mines should exert efforts to reasonably readjust structures and upgrade overall economic quality of enterprises. We should optimize the product mix, grasp the washing and processing of raw coal, expand the raw coal washing volume, and promote a big increase in coal products. According to the demands of markets and consumers, we should readjust the production volume of pits. Under the current situation that supply exceeds demand, we should adopt resolute measures to close down and suspend the operation of those pits with poor production conditions, without guarantee for safety in production, with poor coal quality, without good sales, with low economic results, and whose deficits surpass their wage bills and the extra-business expenses. Although our province is rich in coal resources, the resources are, after all, limited and will not be produced forever. Some of our pits have become withered through the development in the past decades. Thus, we are required to grasp the current work, make long-term arrangements, appropriately readjust product mixes, and accelerate the development of the non-coal economy. Not only collieries but also plants should develop a diversified economy and the tertiary industry. We should extend the orientation of development from coal bases to coal-power, coal-steel, and coal-chemical industrial bases and take the paths of increasing value through processing and making overall development. We should prominently lay stress on the investment in the development of a diversified economy and the tertiary industry; strive to build a group of key larger-scale projects with strong competitiveness and good economic results; develop the projects with "less investment, short construction periods, and rapid efficiency" that are closely related to coal production, the construction of coal industry, and the livelihood of the staff and workers; ensure that a project that has been completed can promote the development of a number of other projects, and increase the input and output rates. Objectively speaking, our coal enterprises are extensively managed and still have to tap great potential for production, washing and processing, sales, and supply. Thus, we must turn our eyes inward, tap potential, and strengthen management to seek high efficiency. We should set up a system of responsibility for control of fixed-quota production costs, perfect accounting and management systems, stop up loopholes, strengthen the management of capital, reduce all expenses, strengthen the management of the supply of goods and materials, and strive to enliven capital. In short, all bureaus, collieries, and units should make concerted efforts, firmly grasp the main contradiction and the central task of being extricated from the difficult position, attach primary importance to implementing and expanding the achievements in resolving the problems in coal industrial development, and organize and mobilize the broad masses of party members, cadres, and staff and workers to make self-improvement and be independent and regard the rejuvenation of Heilongjiang's coal industry as the primary task. Only by doing will our province's coal enterprises be developed rapidly.
