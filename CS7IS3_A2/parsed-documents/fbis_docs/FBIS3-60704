Terming their visit as fruitful, they said the discussions with Pakistani officials had provided them a greater understanding and a better perception of the importance of Pak-U.S. ties and of nurturing these relations in future. The Senators also tried to explain that all endeavours of the United States, including the Pressler Amendment, were basically mounted to stop the spread of nuclear weapons as more countries joining the present five nations nuclear club could endanger world peace. Throughout the Press conference, the U.S. Senators harped on the same tune although, at times, they did not agree with each other's view. Senator Larry Pressler clearly took pride in his amendment and did not deny singling out Pakistan for its application. He said there were reports in the media during mid-80s that an Islamic Bomb was being prepared and that the technology might pass from one country to another. However, Senator Brown dismissed this idea and said there is no such thing as an Islamic Bomb and the United States had not focused only on Pakistan but on every country wherever the threat of a nuclear device existed. Both he and Senator Cochran made it clear that they did not share Pressler's views on singling out Pakistan under his amendment. Senator Cochran claimed that the Amendment was not against any particular country as ``Pakistan is on top of the countries we like.'' However, the most significant statement made at the Press conference was by Senator Larry Pressler when he said that both Pakistan and India are ready for the inspection of their nuclear facilities. ``The Pakistan Prime Minister told me exactly what the Indian Prime Minister had said in this context,'' he said. This is the first indication given at such a high diplomatic level by India that it may open its facilities for international inspection. If that is so, why does India refuse to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) when Pakistan has several times stated that it is prepared to sign it simultaneously with it? It is strange Senator Larry Pressler did not put this question to the Indian Prime Minister. Although Senator Cochran accepted that ``very persuasive evidence has been given to us to show that the implementation of the Pressler. Amendment was against the interests of Pakistan and we will explore the options to do an evenhanded application of the law,'' Senator Pressler still refuses to support the move to bring changes in his amendment. It is hoped the Clinton administration would not let him have his way and make special efforts to have the new foreign assistance bill adopted by the Congress.
