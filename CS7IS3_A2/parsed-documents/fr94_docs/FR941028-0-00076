FR941028-0-00076 FR941028-0-00009 Moreover, the statute is silent as to how an applicant may demonstrate that he or she does not own or control a surface coal mining operation. Under the Act, it is the duty of OSM, the administrative agency charged with implementing the Act, to ``publish and promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and provisions of *␣*␣* [the] Act.'' See section 201(c)(2) of the Act. Thus, OSM proposed, and today is finalizing, a regulation which carries out the purposes of section 510(c) of the Act and places the burden of evidence production and persuasion upon the person challenging an ownership or control link to a current violation. This is consistent with the provisions of that section of the Act which clearly place the burden of going forward with proof that a violation has been corrected or is in the process of correction upon the applicant who owns or controls a surface coal mining operation which is in violation of the Act. Moreover, in the absence of some means of showing that he or she does not own or control a particular surface coal mining operation which is in violation of the Act, an applicant who owned or controlled such an operation would only be able to receive a permit if he or she could produce proof that the current violation was corrected or was in the process of correction. As indicated above, consistent with its statutory role to propose regulations, OSM has provided the ``means'' for an applicant to show that he or she does not control a surface coal mining operation by establishing the burden of proof and evidentiary standards contained in paragraph (c) of proposed §773.26. Finally, OSM must reject the notion that the burden of proof contained in the proposed regulation is inappropriate for use by State regulatory authorities. Burdens of proof are used in formal litigation before tribunals because they are helpful to the resolution of such litigation. Such burdens establish the parameters of what parties to litigation must do to prevail in their claims. Similarly, challengers of ownership or control links need to know what parameters they need to meet in proceedings before regulatory authorities to challenge such links. Also, in making decisions with respect to ownership or control or with respect to the status of violations, regulatory authorities need guidance in assisting their decisionmaking process. In the absence of guidance establishing burdens of proof and evidentiary standards, the resulting decisions made may be inconsistent and based upon uncertain standards. For instance, one regulatory authority may believe the any quantity of evidence, including a mere scintilla, is sufficient to successfully challenge an ownership or control link to a violation. Another regulatory authority may believe that a successful challenge requires a challenger to demonstrate that an ownership or control link is rebutted beyond any reasonable doubt. Thus, OSM's proposed rule has provided a single standard of persuasion and production, a preponderance of the evidence, to be required for the successful challenge of an ownership or control link. OSM believes that such a standard represents a prudent middle ground between the possible extremes of burdens of proof requiring a mere scintilla of evidence and those requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt. OSM is confident that State regulatory authorities will be able to implement such a standard and that it will prove helpful. Accordingly, OSM rejects the commenters' assertion that the use of the evidentiary burden of production contained in the proposed rule is inappropriate for State regulatory authorities. Industry commenters further criticized paragraph (c)(1) of proposed §773.26 for requiring, as one of the bases to rebut a presumption of ownership or control, proof that the facts relied upon to establish such presumption do not or did not exist. The commenters asserted that such a test may foreclose a demonstration that the regulatory authority which established such presumption reached the wrong legal conclusion, notwithstanding the truth of the facts. Further, the commenters asserted, in substance, that the provisions of the proposed section imply that the challenger would have to disprove all of the facts which were considered by the agency which established the presumption of ownership or control, not just the relevant facts which support the presumption. OSM does not agree with commenters' assertions. Paragraph (c)(1) of proposed §773.26 was intended to provide the parameters as to what factual demonstration must be made by a challenger of an ownership or control link. Accordingly, paragraph (c)(1)(i) of proposed §773.26 provision provides for the challenge of a link by proof that the facts necessary to invoke the presumption of ownership or control did not or do not exist. Nothing in such proof of facts precludes legal arguments which could be made, including those questioning the application of the presumption under the operative facts. Further, facts relevant to that legal issue could be presented under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of proposed §773.26 which provides that a person could demonstrate that he or she does not or did not have authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations are or were conducted.
