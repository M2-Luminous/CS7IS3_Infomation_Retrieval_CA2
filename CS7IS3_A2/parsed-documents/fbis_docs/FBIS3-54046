In its latest issue, the bilingual weekly referred to the crimes committed by Jalal Talebani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) against members of the Islamic movement in northern Iraq. According to the weekly, the PUK "attacks were seen as an attempt by Talebani, under the aegis of the U.S. and its allies, to squeeze groups who have no sympathy towards his pro-Western approach." Noting that the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) has remained neutral in the conflict, it said there remains no doubt "about the meddling by U.S., Britain and France whose troops are serving their national interests in Iraq's northern no-fly zone." It referred to Talebani's Washington visit in 1992 and his talks about establishing an opposition government in the northern no-fly zone. Stressing that Washington's policy is to get rid of Kurdish groups, it said "the West makes use of Kurds as a leverage to put pressure on Saddam Husayn's government and influence developments in Iraq. "To any analyst there is an important question unanswered. If there are troops to protect Kurds from attacks by Saddam's army in the northern no-fly zone for humanitarian reasons, why are there no troops to protect Shiite Muslims in marshlands in southern Iraq for the same reason?" It said that Washington considers Muslims as troublesome and dangerous for America's interests and perhaps for this reason the anti-Iraq alliance abandoned the idea to topple Saddam's regime. The weekly concluded that there is no accurate evidence to prove that the West supports the establishment of an independent state for Kurds but that their meddling in northern Iraq is threatening the regional security and integrity.
