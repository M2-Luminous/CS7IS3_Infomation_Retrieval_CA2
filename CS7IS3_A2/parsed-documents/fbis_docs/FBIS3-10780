However, several deputies believe the presence of U.S. troops could be justified if they are used to combat drug traffickers or to perform tasks that benefit the population. Recently, President Carlos Roberto Reina said he favored the withdrawal of those soldiers. His opinion is shared by other sectors of Honduran society. However, on more than one occasion, U.S. embassy officials have asserted that the presence or withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed here depends on the Honduran Government's decision. Liberal Deputy Valentin Suarez said: "The clashes between Honduras and El Salvador have ended, and the Nicaraguan and Salvadoran guerrillas no longer exist. Thus, the gringo troops should be out of Honduras." Suarez added that Hondurans, especially the people in the central departments, need Palmerola Military Base to turn it into an international airport. "In our country's situation, we cannot continue to invest in more airports," the deputy emphasized. National Party Deputy Jose Rubio said the withdrawal of U.S. troops "is a decision the government must make and the Comayagua people should be asked if they want the troops to stay in Palmerola or not." Liberal Deputy Donaldo Dominguez asserted that "the Cold War era has ended, but we now have to fight other things such as drug trafficking. In this respect we could use the help of foreign troops. However, we believe that in exchange for this, the Honduran Government should receive more from the U.S. Government." National Party Deputy Salomon Padilla said that "we have to see the positive and negative aspects of the troops' presence. The presence of soldiers in our country is no longer necessary because the period of violence is over." However, he considers that the presence of the U.S. soldiers could be justified if they stay to improve roads, build schools, and implement other community programs.
