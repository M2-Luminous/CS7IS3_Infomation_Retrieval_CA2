Portnikov: "Crimea: A Bridge or Barrier? Elimination of the Regrettably Known Methods for Resolving National Problems Required"] [Text] Russia and Ukraine found themselves facing the barrier of the Crimean problem, by the way, not for the first time in the several tense years of building bilateral relations. The victory of Yuriy Meshkov, who did not conceal his intention of altering the status of autonomy, in the presidential elections in Crimea compelled Kiev to take a close look at the contours of the drifting peninsula while confronting Moscow once again with an unresolvable dilemma--the choice between desire and possibility. The desire to "recover" Crimea is so clear that it would be unwise to conceal it. At the same time, it is specifically Russia, along with the USA, that is the guarantor of territorial integrity of Ukraine which is parting with its nuclear armament. It is specifically Russia, which is building relations with its own ex-autonomies with difficulty, that is interested the least out of all the countries in the world in any territory proclaiming recognized independence and possibly shifting into another state. In other words the Crimean issue appears far more complex in Russian policy than in the Ukrainian one. It seems that the first Crimean president, Yuriy Meshkov, who, in the course of his visit to Moscow, talked of political stability on the peninsula in a tone reminiscent of his recent opponent, Nikolay Bagrov, head of the Crimean Parliament, is beginning to understand this. Stability for Crimea, however, is maintenance of the status-quo. Attempts at sharp changes in it are no longer stability but the start of a civil war, a Russian-Ukrainian confrontation, activization of the movement of Ukrainian Tartars which will swiftly transcend constitutional bounds, and destroy the resort. It is possible that this will not signal the end of the political career of Yuriy Meshkov himself as he would be able to establish himself in Simferopol with the aid of the Black Sea Fleet, just as Vladislav Ardzinba did in Sukhumi. But who needs a second Sukhumi today? The Crimean president, who evidently expected to become an equal partner of Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, could have convinced himself at negotiations about the future of Crimea that more influential political forces in both countries are transforming him into a hostage of the situation on the peninsula. In that sense Meshkov, known only for his activity at meetings, is much more convenient than Bagrov from whom few expected any uncoordinated actions. For Russia, which is striving today for the return of "spheres of influence" lost following disintegration of the Soviet Union, needs not Crimea as part of it, but a lever for pressure on the most ambitious of the former Soviet republics (even though very soon Kazakhstan will easily surpass Ukraine here). For Ukraine Crimea is important as a real demonstration of the "sinister" intentions of the neighboring country and as proof of political pluralism: in our country even declared antagonists achieve success, Kiev is not London which acted far more rigidly and energetically in a similar situation in Ulster. That is the way it will be as long as Crimea is a barrier. But even Yuriy Meshkov is already speaking of a Crimean bridge. But is the building of such a bridge possible given the initial positions of Moscow, Kiev, and Simferopol? I fear that up to now the stones used in building the foundation of such a bridge might prove to be merely new boulders for the barrier. The money which Russia plans to grant for the return of Crimean Tartars and the special emphasis which Ukraine makes on its financial participation, indicates that both countries know about the existence of another way. After all Crimea gained the status of a republic not because of any special position it has by comparison with other Ukrainian oblasts, but because the republic was already there and ceased to exist after the tragic deportation of indigenous people, primarily of Crimean Tartars. They remain the only deported nation which has not restored its statehood even formally. Simply speaking: their past, their tragedy was utilized by completely different people. Political careerism, however, which is noticeable in the case of the former Yugoslavia, leads only to slaughter. Before Crimea becomes the next hot spot Moscow and Kiev should use all possible channels of influence to legitimize the status of indigenous nations of the peninsula, naturally, taking into consideration the rights of those who enjoyed their hospitality. By the way, the latter form a majority anyway. They can elect a president and a parliament. The returnees only have a few seats consolidated by quota. That decision, however, will hardly secure true political stability on the peninsula. The principal problem of Crimea is that it may prove to be a ticking bomb even without becoming "a bone of contention." They might come to their senses in Simferopol after it is too late. Moscow and Kiev should help the Crimeans realize the unique position in which their land has been placed by historical circumstances and find nonstandard political moves--in other words, exclude the possibility for resolving national problems by the regrettably known methods. Believe me, that is more important than success or failure of the loudmouthed promises by Yuriy Meshkov, the economic experiments of Yevgeniy Saburov, and even the fate of the Black Sea Fleet.
