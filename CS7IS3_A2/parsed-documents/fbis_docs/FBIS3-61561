Glass composition materials consist of a glass matrix of a given composition in which the radioactive components are distributed as a dispersed phase. They are universal in waste composition and therefore using them makes it possible expand the class of treated wastes. Specifically, it is possible to immobilize in a glass matrix radioactive wastes containing insoluble compounds such as sulfates, molybdates, and oxides of heavy metals. Also, the technological process of radioactive waste immobilization presupposes a shorter high temperature action on the waste material than that of traditional methods of glassification. In the present work a comparative analysis was made between the two glasses. A maximum limiting value was determined for the particle size of the included radioactive phase in the glass composition and this value was found to be a function of the properties of the glass matrix and the coefficient of distribution of the radionucleide phase in the matrix.
