The Filipino fishermen from South Cotabato were reportedly operating along the Philippine-Indonesian border and reports reaching Manila indicate that they are being "detained and harassed" in Indonesia. On Friday, President Ramos ordered the Bureau of Immigration to ban foreigners attending the Manila conference scheduled between May 31-June 4 in a bid to appease the Indonesian government. This rather unfortunate action was taken after special envoy Raul Manglapus failed to mollify an angry Jakarta on why the Philippines could not cancel the meeting of NGOs and academics. Manglapus explained that it would be unconstitutional to do so because the Philippine Charter allows for freedom of association and free speech like all truly civilized nations of this world. But free speech and freedom of association and respect for the constitution are completely alien to the Suharto government. Because of this, before Ramos made his decision on Friday, Jakarta had already resorted to the following acts of diplomatic blackmail to show its displeasure: -- Threatened to scrap a meeting scheduled for mid-June in Jakarta arranged by Indonesia between the Philippine government and a Muslim separatist group, the Moro National Liberation Front, to end more than 20 years of fighting between the rebels and Manila; -- Forced a number of industrialists affiliated with the local chapter of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, to cancel a planned investment involving billions of dollars in 15 strategic sectors in Davao, Philippines; -- Forced three Indonesian business delegations to cancel their trips to the Philippines, and a visit to Manila by a student delegation from Jakarta's Jayabaya University was put on hold in reaction to the Manila conference; -- Forced 200 Indonesian businessmen to withdraw from a regional conference due to be held this week in the southern Davao city to flesh out President Ramos' East Asia Growth Area (EAGA). It seems that Indonesia now is acting like the region's bully boy and rather unfortunately Ramos has allowed the Philippines to be cowed into toeing the Jakarta line over East Timor. Indonesia's actions over the week are not the true mark of a regional leader, but rather that of a regional thug. Till the November 1991 Dili massacre, in which scores of East Timorese were shot dead in front of Western journalists, East Timor was the typical story of a war in the Third World -- a messy struggle in a faraway country of the sort that perhaps makes headlines in the West for a day or two, then gradually slips out of view and out of mind. Jakarta quite clearly wants misinformation and lies to prevail over the truth of its invasion and forceful annexation of East Timor in December 1975. The fact of the matter is that within a few weeks close to 60,000 Timorese were killed -- 10 per cent of the population -- when Indonesian commandos invaded the island. Since 1975, aid agencies have estimated that 200,000 East Timorese have died from various causes. The sad fact is that civilized Western countries share the guilt of this slaughter by virtue of actively giving the Suharto government military and diplomatic support in its monstrous war crimes, support given in the name of the crusade against international communism. The East Timor issue has been silenced for two decades, but it would be wishful thinking on the part of Jakarta to expect it to continue to be silenced now in the region.
