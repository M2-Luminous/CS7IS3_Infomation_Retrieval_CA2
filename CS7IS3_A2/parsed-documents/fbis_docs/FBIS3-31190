The president's speech was recorded in Thailand, during his visit there. "Our foreign policy is aware of the world's current interconnections," Havel continued, adding that especially now that the Czech Republic had become a member of the UN Security Council it did want to carry a "commensurate portion of responsibility for the current state of the world." Havel also said that talk is often heard of the chasm separating the wealthy north and the poor south, but many who speak of the problem do not even know enough about it or do not really care. He noted that the Indian section of his tour was planned a little unconventionally, in that it did not include those locations usually seen during state visits, and was informal. The president pointed out that India was a functioning democracy despite the great problems it was experiencing, and its enormous number of citizens, nationalities and religions. Havel called it a "phenomenal" fact, even more so when viewed by someone who comes from a country where "we are constantly fighting to find a political culture under conditions of a relatively prospering, relatively homogeneous nation of ten million." Speaking about his visit to Thailand, Havel said democratic structures were beginning to function in that country. Its earlier "more authoritative" government had protected Thailand from communism, he said, adding that he found it interesting that the country had always managed to resist "various dangers from the outside" and had never become a colony.
