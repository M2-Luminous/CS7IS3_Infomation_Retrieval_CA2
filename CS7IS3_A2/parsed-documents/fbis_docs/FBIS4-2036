One is how we can accelerate the reform, opening up, and economic development of the areas around Bohai Sea. The other is how we can make cadres' work serve reform, opening up, and economic development more vigorously and effectively. Based on the investigation and study, I will speak on several opinions. 1. The reform, opening up, and economic construction of the three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou have made marked headway and have been further accelerated since the publication of the important speeches given by Comrade Xiaoping during his south China inspection tour. With the guidance of the guidelines of the 14th party congress, leading bodies at all levels and the vast number of cadres and the masses of the three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou have devoted plenty of painstaking efforts to the reform, opening up, and economic development of their own localities in the past few years and scored notable achievements. They have attained a fairly rapid economic development; substantially increased the input of fixed assets to further enhance their strengthen for sustained development; stabilized and improved agriculture and accelerated rural economic development; gradually deepened the reform in various fields focusing on establishing the modern enterprise system; and opened wider to the outside world. They are high-spirited and determined to attain still higher goals. All the work for reform and construction is making headway in a healthy manner, and the general development trend is good and encouraging. However, judging from the expectations and demands of the provincial government and the people throughout the province, the positions of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou and the role they should play, the advantages and tremendous potential of these three cities, and a comparison with advanced coastal localities, we should realistically and frankly admit that the three cities have yet to achieve major breakthroughs in opening to the outside world and in economic development. First, they have yet to attain a big leap in economic development. Although the annual GNP growth rates of the three cities were higher than the provincial average in the past few years, not many of the overall indicators were higher than the provincial average, and some of them were even lower than the provincial average, making their gap from other advanced coastal open cities of the country still wider. Second, they have yet to make a bigger stride in both the range and quality of opening to the outside world. Among the first group of 14 coastal cities designated by the country to open to the outside world, Qinhuangdao ranks among the four at the bottom in terms of major economic indicators, effecting little change as compared with the early period for opening to the outside world. As Hebei's only national-level development zone, the Qinhuangdao Economic and Technological Development Zone has planned many projects, but few of them are enterprises that produce high- and new-tech products and that conduct business as conglomerates. Tangshan and Cangzhou are still in the initial stage in opening to the outside world. Third, some important measures for taking advantage of the position around Bohai Sea to achieve substantial development are still being prepared or in the initial stage. Major breakthroughs have yet to be made in seizing the opportunity and developing the advantages to develop large-scale association and cooperation with other provinces, municipalities, and regions, and to strengthen economic, technological, and trade exchanges with the various Northeast Asian countries. Fourth, many old enterprises have made slow progress in introducing funds from abroad to carry out technical transformation, in transforming their mechanisms and systems, and in achieving technological advance. Some large and medium-sized enterprises are half-dead, and some of the enterprises and products which used to rank "first" in the country have lost their "first" positions and are faced with the danger to be pushed behind. Fifth, some major work that should be made successful is not satisfactory. Among the 100 key projects of the three cities to be developed in the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, 26 are still lacking the conditions for starting construction or have not been planned; and some which have started also have many problems that require urgent solutions. Correct understanding of our own deficiencies and shortcomings constitutes the prerequisite for continued advancement. Comrades of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou should not only fully affirm their already scored achievements but also fully understand their own deficiencies and shortcomings as well as their existing difficulties. Only by doing so can they set forth even more definite and feasible goals to be attained and can they do their work more realistically and purposefully. In this new year, the fundamental principle for our work is: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, by comprehensively implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we should accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, maintain the sustained, rapid, and sound development of the national economy, safeguard political stability, and promote the all-round progress of society. We should conscientiously carry out this fundamental principle and resolutely subject and orient ourselves to the overall situation of the whole party work, that is to "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and safeguard stability," in order to push forward reform, opening up, and economic construction in an even better way. 2. Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities have conditions and are able to effect an even faster and even better development. Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities are in an important position and play an important role in Hebei Province. These three cities account for 18.7 percent of the province's total in terms of territory and 24.5 percent in terms of population. All of the 487 km of coastlines of the province are within these three cities. As early as ten years ago, Qinhuangdao city was approved by the state as one of the 14 coastal open cities of China, and a state-level economic and technological development zone was established. And six years ago, 12 counties in Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities were included in the coastal economic and technological zone. The practice from the decade of reform and opening up shows that Hebei's pace of reform, opening up, and economic construction should be accelerated further, and Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities should develop before others to serve as a window to promote the reform, opening up, and economic development of the whole province. When viewed from the practical situation, Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities are completely provide with the condition for effecting an even faster and better development. First, these cities have geological advantages and are located in important position of strategic importance. Second, these cities are faced with the development opportunity that is hard to come by. To implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress and to accelerate the opening up and development of the Around Bohai Sea Area, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have already done a series of work. Recently, the State Council has again held a seminar on economic planning for the Around Bohai Sea Area in Tangshan city to further research and define ideas, goals, and major measures to be adopted for accelerating the opening up and development of this area. Along with the gradual implementation of many major policy decisions of the state, the opening up and development of the Around Bohai Sea Area will certainly be accelerated. Third, natural resources are rich and economic foundation is solid in these three cities. Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities are extremely rich in land, mineral, agricultural, marine, and labor resources. These three cities account for more than 30 percent of the province's total in the number of industrial enterprises exercising independent accounting and in the original value of fixed assets. Large and medium-sized enterprises in these three cities also account for one third of the province's total, thus having considerably great industrial advantages. A large number of on- going key projects will be completed and commissioned one after another to display their efficiency. The comprehensive economic strength and the momentum for further development will be enhanced obviously. Fourth, the pattern of opening to all directions of the world has taken shape. Over the past several years, these three cities have all brought in many funds, technologies, and professional persons and have initiated a group of foreign-funded enterprises of three types, that are relatively good in product and efficiency. The projects at the beginning district of the Qinhuangdao City Economic and Technological Development Zone has already been arranged to the full, and the projects covered by the second stage of construction are about to begin. Beidaihe, Beijing-Tangshan Harbor, and Huanghua City economic and technological development areas and a number of other development areas of various categories tend to promise a good future. These areas will certainly play a guiding role in further accelerating opening up. Fifth, infrastructure facilities, such as energy, communications, and telecommunications, have been strengthened, the investment environment has been further improved, and the ability of the three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou to participate in the division of labor, coordination, and competition among various coastal cities around Bohai Sea will be greatly enhanced. Sixth, through the practice and tests of more than 10 years of reform and opening up, leading bodies at all levels of these three cities have unceasingly strengthened their ability to organize and develop the socialist market economy and enriched their experience every day. A batch of men of action who have upheld the party's basic line, reform, and opening up, have strong pioneering spirit, and are capable of undertaking major affairs have come to the fore. Seventh, a number of good examples on actively blazing new trials and seeking rapid development have emerged in these three cities. For instance, the rapid economic development in Fengnan County, the jumping economic development in Banbidian Village, the large-scale development of Haomen group, the rate of building the medium plate plant with the joint efforts of Qinhuangdao and Shoudu Iron and Steel Company, the pioneering spirit of technical workers of Qinhuangdao vehicle door manufacturing plant in creating first-grade products, and the efforts and determination of Haixing County to create favorable conditions and to end backwardness are all very encouraging and inspiring, and each of which has its own characteristics and played a pioneering and exemplary role. With the needs of the objective situation and all essential conditions, the three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou have no reason not to take the lead in development in the province. Therefore, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have called on these three cities to seize the opportunity during the last seven years of the 1990's, use export- oriented economy to bring along the whole economy, combine the efforts of places around Bohai Sea, Beijing, and Tianjin, proceed from establishing cooperation at home, and make breakthroughs in introducing foreign capital, rely on the existing economic foundation and natural resources advantages, develop places around Bohai Sea, Beijing, and Tianjin in an in-depth and down-to-earth manner, develop cooperation and coordination with Beijing and Tianjin and with advanced regions in China so as to bring along opening up and development, accurately aim at Northeast Asia and other countries, work purposefully, strive to make breakthroughs in selecting major clients for major development and cooperative projects, strive to make the major economic targets and the comprehensive strength of these cities enter a higher grade and move one place forward in places around Bohai Sea and coastal cities by the end of this century and to become one of the places in the province comprehensively linking with the international economic track, operating in line with market mechanism, and with a high degree of opening up, good market cultivation, rapid development rate, strong economic strength, prosperous life, and good spiritual civilization, and lay a good foundation for making these three cities take the lead in realizing modernization during the early period of next century. 3. To achieve a more rapid and better development, we must further emancipate the mind. We must persist in meeting high standards in emancipating the mind. We should make the emancipating of mind meet the standard of strengthening reform, expanding opening up, and accelerating development and further renew our ideology and concepts to promote a rapid development in reform and opening up and to realize our set objectives. Comrade Xiaoping believed that poverty is not socialism and slow development is also not socialism, and that this is determined by the essence of socialism. To realistically show that socialism is better than capitalism, we must accelerate development. Otherwise, we cannot display the superiority of socialism if it always lags far behind capitalism, and the masses of people will not be satisfied with this. He also said: As long as the project yields economic efficiency and is export-oriented, we must not prevent people from doing it if they can do it more rapidly. With all the given objective conditions for accelerating development, these three cities should seize the opportunity actively, and take the lead in development and making breakthroughs. Of course, stressing this never means that we can daydream in defiance of the objective reality, never means that we can blindly pursue high economic growth rates and define still higher targets. As early as 1985, Comrade Xiaoping emphasized that the development rate should withstand the test. In my understanding, withstanding the test means that the development rate should be based on reality and should stress efficiency. We must strive to avoid a high growth rate that is divorced from reality and brings no efficiency because it not only brings negative influence on the economic environment but also increases the pressure on reform and social stability. In carrying out economic work, we should both work according to our capacity and exert utmost efforts; and both refrain from pursuing merely high growth rates and strive for necessary and possible rapid development. Only this means unity between mind emancipation and truth-seeking. To emancipate the mind, we should bear reality in mind. As far as Hebei is concerned, it should particularly address the following four problems. First is the slow reaction and a feeling of uncertainty toward the series of changes resulting from the development of the market economy and the series of reforms put forward by the party Central Committee and State Council based on the requirements of the market economy system and the lack of initiative in adapting oneself to them; or the fears of various kinds, helplessness, and passive attitude toward them. Second is a lack of dialectical understanding of the current opportunity for development, the failure to free oneself from the outdated concepts and ideas and "leftist" views that have taken shape under the planned economy system, and the practice of acknowledging the rare opportunity theoretically but attempting nothing in view of the numerous difficulties of one's own locality and unit. Third is the practice of paying lip service to the call for building an economically strong province but following the old road when organizing and arranging specific work and lacking the courage to achieve breakthroughs based on the advantages and conditions of a locality. Fourth is mechanically copying of the central line, principles, and policies, the lack of in-depth investigation and study, the lack of ability to work in a creative manner in line with one's actual conditions, and the failure to blaze a development road compatible with one's characteristics. Comrades at all levels and of all departments should bear reality in mind, conscientiously make analysis of the specific reflections of these problems in their thinking and work, and conscientiously solve the problems one by one in the practice of reform and opening up. By solving these problems, we should further enhance the awareness of reform, take the initiative in adapting ourselves to the changes resulting from the development of the market economy and the various reform measures put forward by the central authorities, and seize the current favorable opportunity for reform to accelerate our own reform and development. We should further enhance the awareness of opportunity, be determined to overcome all difficulties, and truly seize and use well the favorable opportunity for accelerating development. We should enhance the awareness of "breakthrough" and make the best of our favorable conditions to achieve faster development in economic construction. We should enhance the awareness of innovation, study the new ideas for development, and strive to successfully blaze our own road of development. In emancipating the mind, leading bodies and leading cadres should take the lead. Party committees, governments, and leading cadres at all levels, especially city, prefectural, and county party secretaries, mayors, and county heads, should regard themselves as the first to emancipate the mind and address well the problems in their thinking and concepts. 4. We should adopt every means to organize, discover, and develop new growing points of the economy and increase total supply and total demand and the per capita share. Accelerated reform and opening up and faster economic development should ultimately be reflected in the increase of the total supply and total demand and the increase of per capita GNP and per capita income. For this reason, Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities should implement "one strategy," build well the "two projects," strengthen the "three foundations," develop the "five major industries," and facilitate the growth of the "six economic factors." The "one strategy" means the strategy of promotion through the export-oriented economy. Guided by the world market, the cities should pay attention to and promote foreign capital, foreign trade, and foreign economic relations simultaneously. The "two projects" are the Shenmu-Huanghua Railway and Jingtang Harbor construction projects. Strengthening the "three foundations" means to strengthen the position of agriculture as the foundation, to achieve success in building infrastructural facilities (including railways, highways, harbors, airports, and telecommunications facilities), and to accelerate the development of basic industries (energy and power industries). The "five major industries" are the metallurgical, building materials, chemical, machinery and electronic, and light and textile industries. Facilitating the growth of the "six economic factors" means 1) to further increase the input of fixed assets and strive to develop a number of key capital construction projects and technical transformation projects of which the investment exceeds the stipulated norms and which conform to the state's industrial policy, produce readily marketable products, and yield good economic efficiency, 2) to transform the enterprise operating mechanism more rapidly, establish a modern enterprise system, invigorate enterprises, and expand the scale and improve the quality and level of state-own enterprises, especially large and medium-sized ones, through renovation with foreign capital and technical transformation projects, 3) to bring in and use more foreign capital, introduce more investment from abroad and expand lateral economic ties at home, build and develop the various categories of development zones with great efforts, give full play to their role, establish a large number of three types of foreign-funded enterprises and enterprises that have lateral ties at home every year, and continuously develop foreign economic relations and trade, 4) to do a better job in restructuring the agricultural sector of the economy, continue to ensure the growth in the production of basic farm products, such as grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, and accelerate the development of forestry and fruit production, vegetable production, animal husbandry, and aquiculture; and to greatly develop township enterprises, especially township industrial enterprises, transfer large numbers of labor forces to township industrial enterprises, and substantially increase GNP and peasants' income, 5) to actively develop urban collective, individual, and private economies, and 6) to further facilitate the development of the tertiary industry and the development of transportation, post and telecommunication, commercial and catering service, and markets for consumer goods and essential elements of production and, in particular, attach importance to the development of a number of commodity and material markets that have their own characteristics and are geared to the whole country. To ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development of the three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou, we should handle well the relationship in five aspects when organizing and arranging reform and development. First, while attaching importance to the development of the secondary and tertiary industries, we should never neglect or slacken efforts in agriculture. Farming focusing on the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, forestry and fruit production, aquiculture, and animal husbandry are both the foundation for rural stability and the important prerequisites for peasants to achieve a fairly comfortable life. Therefore, while accelerating the development of the secondary and tertiary industries, we must put agriculture in the first place and greatly develop the high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture on the premise that the rural reform is deepened, the material as well as scientific and technological input in agriculture is increased, and grain and cotton production grows steadily. Only when we have the steady growth of the primary industry can we have a reliable guarantee for the faster development of the secondary and tertiary industries. Second, we should not only plan for the future but also grasp the present well. Now, all of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities have their own long-term key development projects. These key development projects not only have a bearing on the interests of these three cities but also have a bearing on the overall situation of the reform, opening up, and economic construction of the whole province. Therefore, not only these three cities should regard the construction of these projects as the most important task, the provincial party committee, the provincial government, and various pertinent departments of the province should also put these projects in a prominent position and give great support to them. Realistically speaking, however, these projects cannot truly play a major and promoting role until 2000. At present, to accelerate development and make the people better-off, we must primarily depend on down-to-earth efforts, including the effort to use the influence of these projects to vigorously expand international and domestic markets, the effort to build a large number of foreign-invested projects and key capital construction projects, the effort to tap potential and renovate existing enterprises, large and medium-sized state-owned projects in particular, the effort to readjust agricultural structure, and the effort to develop township and town enterprises. Third, we should not set the enhancement of the levels and grades of products against the development of the ordinary labor-intensive products and industries. Spreading the strategy of promoting the entire economy through export-oriented economy, developing new high-technology industries, and developing the products with high added value are the necessary choice to accelerate economic development, improve economic quality, and enhance market competitiveness and are always the orientation of our endeavor of development. The more tight we grasp this work, the better; and the greater results we achieve in this work, the better. It must be noted, however, the shift of numerous rural labor forces from farming to industry cannot be effectively resolved through the development of the export-oriented economy, the formation of the new and high technology industries, and the development of the products with high added value. And, without the shift of large number of peasants from farming to non-agricultural industries, it is impossible to make peasants become better-off. Therefore, we should not only engage in fund- and technology-intensive industries and enterprises as more as possible, but also try every possible means to develop some labor-intensive industries and enterprises in order to make even more rural laborers shift from farming to industry. Fourth, we should pay attention to not only investment but also reform. Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou as well as the province as a whole have the long-standing problem of insufficient investment. Although such a situation has changed somewhat over the past several years, the change is not nearly enough if compared with advanced provinces. We should continue to strengthen the work in this aspect and try our best to ensure a sufficient investment to promote economic development. However, we cannot merely depend on investment to promote development. We must primarily depend on reform. Changing the administrative function of the government, changing the operational mechanism of enterprises, establishing modern enterprise system, strengthening the internal management of enterprises, increasing the vitality of enterprises, implementing all preferential policies of the party towards rural areas, and popularizing on a large scale the shareholding cooperative system among township and town enterprises are the essential ways to emancipate and develop productive forces and are the fundamental measures to tap the potential of existing assets and accelerating economic development. All these should be grasped firmly by party committees and governments at all levels by listing them as an item on their daily agenda. Fifth, in addition to actively promoting reform and development, we must also strive to maintain social stability. We should correctly handle the relations of reform, development, and stability, and, in addition to maintaining a rapid and good economic development, guarantee the implementation of all central reform policies and measures, not hesitate or waver in this work, and pay great attention to safeguarding social stability. We should pay special attention to studying with grert concentration all one-sided and incorrect understanding, new contradictions, and problems, particularly the influence in the immediate interests of the masses of people which may possibly emerge in reforms. We should adopt purposeful measures in a timely manner, strengthen propaganda and explanation, properly handle all contradictions and friction, and create a good social environment for smoothly carrying out reform. 5. The key to accelerating development is to install good leading bodies and make a good choice and use of cadres. During this investigation and study activity, we have given priority to conducting an inspection to get an initial understanding of the party and government leading bodies of the cities and counties of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou (city, prefecture). Generally, we notice the following three points: First, most of the leading bodies and leading cadres are good or fairly good, and a considerable number of cadres, particularly the top party and government leaders, are in the prime of life, full of vitality, and have skills and achievements in their work. Second, places where reform, opening up, and economic construction are good, have leading bodies of higher quality, enjoy greater stability, and have stronger fighting strength; on the contrary, problems of one kind or another may exist in varying degrees. Third, a general comparison of the county leading bodies and leading cadres of these three cities shows that Tangshan city's leading bodies are better and stronger in general. However, if we set high demands on these cities, we notice that the leading cadres of Qinhuangdao, Cangzhou, or Tangshan all have problems of varying degrees which are in compatible with the new situation and the new tasks. The main manifestations are: They are easily content with their existing achievements and present situation, and lack the spirit of daring to surpass other localities and to create first-grade achievements; some are willing to do something and to create some achievements, but they fail to broaden their views and lack resourcefulness and courage to plan their act and to seek development; some have good work ideas and measures, but they fear hardships, fail to stand the difficulties they encounter and to cope with the changes in economic environment, and lack an indomitable spirit; a small number of cadres are poor in character and have unhealthy work style and poor work performance; and a small number of leading bodies are knotty and ununited, bringing unfavorable influence to their work. We must pay full attention to these problems. On the one hand, we must unceasingly attend to education and the ideology and work style of leading bodies; and other the other hand, we must establish a mechanism which combines incentive with restraints for cadres as quickly as possible in an effort to accelerate and improve the quality and ability of cadres in the course of competition. The fundamental purpose of establishing an effective mechanism of incentive and restraints for cadres is to better mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and urge them to do their work earnestly and wholeheartedly. Here, we have a key issue which we must resolved first. That is, our party committees and organizational departments at all levels must judge cadres in line with party spirit and use cadres according to their actual achievements. To uphold and enhance party spirit, the most fundamental thing we should do is to persist in taking Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guidance and to comprehensively and correctly implement the party's basic line. Specifically speaking, attention should be paid to the following several points in implementing the party's basic line: 1) We should always act highly in unison with the CPC Central Committee ideologically and politically, resolutely implement various principles and policies of the party and country, and ensure the smooth circulation of the party and government orders. 2) We should uphold reform and opening up, proceed from the principle of three advantages, as well as boldly pioneer the road of advance and boldly think or act in doing what we have fixed. 3) We should uphold the principle of development being an essential criterion and exert all-out efforts to wholeheartedly make contributions to developing the local economy and to helping local people become better-off. 4) We should uphold the party's democratic centralism, consciously safeguard the solidarity and unification in the party and among leading bodies. 5) We should set strict demands for ourselves, perform official duties honestly, and tighten the ties with the mass. All party-member cadres including leading cadres at all levels, who have possessed conditions conforming with the aforementioned points, should be regarded as being better in the party spirit. Party committees and organizational departments at all levels, which have truly been able to check their cadres in line with these points should be basically regarded as being insightful, impartial, and upright in appraisal. As for leading cadres, we should not, of course, simply regard their party spirit as being equal to their official achievements. Generally speaking, personnel who have been strong in party spirit are often able to score official achievements and the party spirit of those who have scored prominent official achievements is also often stronger. However, there are cases in which personnel who are good in party spirit have not scored prominent official achievements because they have shortcomings relating to ability and educational levels. Therefore, while making personnel arrangements for leading bodies and employing cadres, emphasis should be placed on examining their achievements on the premise of upholding the principle of party spirit. Only cadres who are strong in the party spirit, capable, and able to score official achievements, are needed by us. Thus, the official achievements of leading cadres should embody the following six aspects put forward by Secretary Cheng Weigao at the seventh plenum of the fourth provincial party committee: 1) Conducting reform and opening up. 2) Achieving economic development. 3)Performing official duties honestly. 4) Maintaining the public security. 5) Increasing the per capita income. 6) Enhancing the family planning work. Of these aspects, the most important one is economic development that includes the task of increasing per capita income and the total supply and demand. The party's fundamental task for the new historic period is to develop productive forces. The key to implementing the party's basic line lies in persistently regarding economic construction as a center. The fundamental duty of leading cadres is to lead the people to push reform and opening up forward and to accelerate the economic development. If personnel who have worked in the locality for three or five years and even longer are unable to have the locality achieve great economic development, bring about great changes to its outlook, and greatly improve its people's lives, how can we regard them as being prominent in their official achievements? There was an erroneous tendency in some localities in employing cadres, in which the party spirit was stressed without attention paid to official achievements and perfection was demanded while stressing the party spirit. As a result, a large number of cadres who are capable, had scored official achievements, and had had some shortcomings, were not promoted or employed for important posts. Hereafter, in promoting and employing cadres, we should uphold and pay attention to official achievements on the premise of strong party spirit and good morality. We should protect or support cadres whose official achievements have been openly acknowledged by the most majority of people and the main parts of their achievements have been good though they have one shortcoming or another. We should promote them to important posts as long as they deserve to be promoted. We should be determined to readjust the posts occupied by cadres who have no or no prominent official achievements though they have got along well with the locality in other fields. Readjustment does not mean that they should be handled but means to let them do the work suitable to their capability. In establishing the mechanisms for encouraging and restricting cadres, the general demand is to institutionalize, through the mechanisms, the appraisal, reward and punishment, and use of leading cadres and to implement them conscientiously so that there will be clear rewards to those who are diligent and clear punishments to those who are lazy, leading cadres at all levels will be encouraged to pioneer the way forward and vie to be the best, and the targets and tasks of building an economically strong province will be implemented at every level. The provincial party committee tentatively considered to establish the mechanisms first in the leading bodies and leading cadres at the county (city, district) level. In establishing the mechanisms, the following principles should be reflected and mastered. 1) The principle of attaching importance to true performance. Based on this principle, we should set both qualitative and quantitative requirements in appraising cadres, quantify as many requirements as possible, and make the targets scientific and reasonable as much as possible so as to stimulate the enthusiasm of cadres and make the systems more operable. 2) The principle of treating different cases in different ways. As the basic conditions are different for the work of coastal open areas, the areas around Beijing and Tianjin, the areas along railways and highways that enjoy good transport service, ordinary plain areas, mountainous areas, and upland areas, the targets and requirements in appraising them should also be different. We should determine their categories and levels in a reasonable manner and put forward targets and requirements accordingly to avoid uniformity. 3) The principle of strict appraisal. Cadres should be appraised at regular intervals based on the stipulated targets and requirements, the requirements should not be made higher or lower at will, and no perfunctory work or accommodation is allowed. Appraisals should be led by organization departments and participated in by discipline inspection departments, auditing departments, planning commissions, economic and trade, family planning, public security, procuratorial, judicial, and other relevant departments. We should also pay attention to the opinions of various quarters and organize the masses to participate in the appraisals at regular intervals or when necessary. 4) The principle of selecting the superior and eliminating the inferior. We should distinguish two situations. One is to see whether the cadres are qualified to their leading posts. If they fail to fulfill even the basic targets, we should consider their reshuffle. The other is to see whether their performance is remarkable. Those with remarkable performance should be promoted on a priority basis or granted with proper political rights or material rewards. 5) The principle of persistently keeping promise. We should see to it that cadres are rewarded, punished, put in important places, reshuffled, or dismissed as required, and that no personal relations or the feelings of the cadres concerned are considered. We may conduct study to see whether these principles are correct or should be supplemented. Specific matters related to this work should be carried out by the organization department of the provincial party committee, and specific methods for implementation should be formulated after in-depth investigation and study. 6. We should work hard and in a down-to-earth manner to ensure the attainment of the target of faster development. Practice shows that in addition to the numerous objective reasons, an important reason for some localities to fail to open up a new prospect or successfully carry out some work for a long period is some leading cadres' lack of the idea of painstaking efforts and lack of painstaking work and painstaking work styles. Judging from the situation of the entire province, we should pay great attention to the way of thinking and work styles of a small number of leading cadres. First are leaders who give only vague, general directions, rest content with things as they are, do not use their brains, and lack characteristics, breakthroughs, and innovation in doing work, which is merely mediocre. Second are leaders who exercise leadership by giving principles. They are used to explaining major truth, principles, and concepts but lack thorough analysis when studying issues and lack penetrating judgment and countermeasures when giving guidance to work. Third are leaders who wait for instructions to exercise leadership. They wait for instructions form higher levels in doing everything, do whatever the higher-ups say, do not conduct investigation and study, lack opinions of their own, consider a task finished after it is explained, and lack the initiative in performing work and solving problems. Fourth are leaders who pass the buck. They shirk to others the responsibility for their own work and find excuses and objective reasons and blame others for the failure or problems in their work. Fifth are leaders who are weak. They always try to be good men to ensure votes and lack the courage to tackle difficulties, hold responsibility, face up to contradictions, and solve knotty problems. Sixth are leaders who exercise amateur leadership. When the situation changes, instead of taking the initiative in learning new knowledge and new skills, they carry out work according to their old experiences, old propositions, and old methods and even feel proud for this, considering themselves in the right. Seventh are leaders who indulge themselves in formalism. They do work for show, pursue "sensation," write articles and spin experiences to praise themselves, and disregard realistic results. Eighth are leaders who carry out routine work only. They are busy attending welcome and farewell activities, meetings, parties, and foundation-lay and ribbon-cutting ceremonies, and reading speeches all day, waste much energy on this, and miss the essentials of work. Ninth are leaders who do work at random. To keep up appearances and satisfy the higher levels, they give empty talk, tell lies, make false accounts and false reports on achievements, and make promises they do not have the intention to keep. Tenth are leaders who curry favor with others. They are enthusiastic in establishing personal ties, strive for fame and profits, and even openly ask for official posts and powers. The above-mentioned cadres, although small in number, have created very bad influence. They have not only delayed plenty of work in some localities, lost many opportunities, and impeded better and faster development in reform, opening up, and economic construction but also damaged the image of the party and government and arouse dissatisfaction among the masses. The nationwide general situation in deepened reform and accelerated development has provided us a new opportunity for development and many new conditions and new issues that need urgent study and solution. Leading cadres at all levels must pay great attention to and be determined to avoid and correct the above- mentioned numerous unhealthy phenomena, step up efforts to study and to train and improve themselves, and strive to make their way of thinking and leadership more suitable to the needs of the new situation. We should greatly advocate throughout the province the work style of more study, more thinking, and industrious work, the work style of painstaking and down-to-earth work, the work style of carrying out work vigorously and speedily through to the end, the work style of courage to tackle difficulties, and the work style of plain living, arduous struggle, and selfless devotion so that our cadres will speedily suit their way of thinking and work to the new situation and new conditions and will gain the initiative in creating a new situation in reform, opening up, and development. During the investigation and study activities, we, together with the leaders of the three cities, listed the major work that should be carried out in 1994 and 1995. Leaders of these three cities must pay close attention to the work, carefully plan for it, and carefully organize its implementation to ensure that the work is completed on schedule. Based on the lists of work of various localities, pertinent departments of the province should actively render service and coordinate with each other to support and help the various localities in fulfilling their work. Leading cadres at all levels should have clear knowledge of their responsibility, fully estimate the arduous tasks to accelerate development and build an economically strong province, and further enhance their confidence in attaining our targets. In this way, we will have the good mindset and work styles to promote our undertakings continuously and attain our target of building an economically strong province at an early date.
