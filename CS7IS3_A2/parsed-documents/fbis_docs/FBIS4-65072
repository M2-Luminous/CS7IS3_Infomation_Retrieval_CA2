In his toast at a dinner with Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker, Yeltsin said in Bonn on Wednesday [11 May] at the beginning of his three-day visit to Germany: "For the first time in a long time Russia is entering the international stage as a major power that does not threaten anybody." Just like Germany, Russia wants to integrate all countries of the continent into European security structures. "It is important that the fences and roadblocks, which have been dumped on the garbage heap, do not reappear." Yeltsin added: "We are sincerely trying to establish friendly ties with neighbors near and far, with all those who feel committed to the ideals of humanity and the standards set by international law." The head of the Kremlin spoke out in favor of "trade without obstacles," and of economic integration in Europe. Yeltsin said that "a historic reconciliation" was currently taking place between Germany and Russia. "I am convinced that we can eliminate the term `war' from the Russian-German vocabulary for good." Yeltsin expressly praised the role of the outgoing federal president. "Your successor will not have things easy because he will be compared with Mr. Weizsaecker, who has set very high standards." Weizsaecker managed to remain beyond the emotions of everyday politics and managed to reconcile people, Yeltsin concluded.
