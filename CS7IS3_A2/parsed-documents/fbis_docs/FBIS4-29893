U.S. battleships frequently enter and leave port at the Yokosuka base, the sortie ground of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. The flagship Blue Ridge left port on the morning of 17 June, following the sailing out of port by the large naval destroyer (Pipe). Four U.S. warships -- including the missile cruiser Mobile Bay, the naval destroyer O'Brien, and an oil tanker -- are at anchor at this base, and the aircraft carrier Independence that participated in the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, will return there. The Independence abruptly made an unplanned call at this base to be refueled on the evening of 3 June and left port on the following day without any accompanying ship. Foreign media reported that this aircraft carrier had received an order from the U.S. secretary of defense to stay in waters, from which it can get to the Korean peninsula within a week. The U.S. ammunition ship Mauna Kea recently made port in this base and brought a large amount of ammunition in the (Urago) ammunition repository for two days. U.S. military planes are busy conducting exercises in the Iwakuni base, an air base of the U.S. Marine Corps where 38 military planes including various attack planes and electronic warplanes are deployed. Witnesses said that FA-18 attack planes were carrying out an exercise of flying toward the North, AV-8B attack planes carried by the amphibious assault ship Belleau Wood were conducting a vertical taking off and landing exercise. Nuclear-powered submarines have unusually and frequently entered and left port at the Sasebo base in Nagasaki Prefecture since the beginning of the year. The number of ammunition ships and refueling ships entering port is also increasing. The number of ammunition and refueling ships that entered port in this base this year is 82, up 60 percent from the same period last year. Most of those refueling ships come from South Korea. The U.S. Forces in Okinawa are carrying out exercises, under the simulation of sanctions and use of arms with Okinawa as the supposed battlefield. Troops of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed there are frenzied particularly in special operations training and exercise. These busy moves in U.S. Army bases in Japan are arousing our extensive alert [kipun kyonggyesim].
