Yesterday at dawn, Aden came under a missile attack aimed at civilian residential quarters. The missiles were engaged by our air defenses, which shot down one of the missiles in flight while another missile fell into the sea. This morning two enemy aircraft tried to bomb the little Aden refinery, one of the vital and important economic installations belonging to our Yemeni people. Our air defenses succeeded in foiling this treacherous attempt, which failed to achieve its objectives. However, one of the houses of the innocent citizens in little Aden was hit, killing a number of women and children. The Command of the Armed Forces in the Democratic Republic of Yemen, while condemning these barbarous acts which violate all the rules of war, reserves the right to respond strongly and decisively to this kind of aggression. Let those who are warned take heed.
