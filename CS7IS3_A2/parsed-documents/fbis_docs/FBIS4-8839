This is what Vladimir Suman, chairman of the Defense and Security Committee, told the CESKY DENIK correspondent after meeting [NATO representatives] Loic Bouvard and Peter Corterier. Furthermore, according to him, it is in NATO's interest that a country with our strategic location and economic stability become a member. Suman said that the NATO representatives' assessment of our republic was unequivocally favorable. Only Partnership for Peace will test our specific military ability to cooperate with the NATO armies and the possibility of joining this structure. In his opinion, the security development in Europe may electrify the situation.
