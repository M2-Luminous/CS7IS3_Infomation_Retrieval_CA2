FR941012-2-00147 FR941012-2-00099 If an article is classifiable according to the use of the class or kind of goods to which it belongs, Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS, provides that: [i]n the absence of special language or context which otherwise requires_ (a) a tariff classification controlled by use (other than actual use) is to be determined in accordance with the use in the United States at, or immediately prior to, the date of importation, of goods of that class or kind to which the imported goods belong, and the controlling use is the principal use. In other words, the article's principal use at the time of importation determines whether it is classifiable within a particular class or kind. While Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS, provides general criteria for discerning the principal use of an article, it does not provide specific criteria for individual tariff provisions. However, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) has provided factors, which are indicative but not conclusive, to apply when determining whether merchandise falls within a particular class or kind. They include: general physical characteristics, the expectation of the ultimate purchaser, channels of trade, environment of sale (accompanying accessories, manner of advertisement and display), use in the same manner as merchandise which defines the class, economic practicality of so using the import, and recognition in the trade of this use. See: Kraft, Inc, v. United States, USITR, 16 CIT 483, (June 24, 1992) (hereinafter Kraft ); G. Heilman Brewing Co. v. United States, USITR, 14 CIT 614 (Sept. 6, 1990); and United States v. Carborundum Company, 63 CCPA 98, C.A.D. 1172, 536 F. 2d 373 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 979. Tariff classification of goods controlled by actual use is specifically provided for in sections 10.131&hyph;10.139, Customs Regulations [19 CFR 10.131&hyph;10.139]. According to these regulations, an actual use provision is satisfied if: (1) such use is intended at the time of importation, (2) the article is so used, and (3) proof of such use is furnished within three years after the date the article has been entered. Currently, tariff classification under both subheading 7010.90.50 and 7013.39, HTSUS, is determined by the use of the class or kind of articles to which the imported merchandise belongs. As such, they are considered provisions controlled by Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS. Customs current position regarding subheading 7010.90.50, HTSUS, is in accord with the findings of the CIT in Group Italglass U.S.A. v. United States, USITR, 17 CIT XXX , Slip Op. 93&hyph;46 (Mar. 29, 1993). Italglass held that the language of heading 7010, HTSUS, implicates use as a criterion of classification for that entire heading, which includes subheading 7010.90.50, HTSUS, and that principal use was the controlling use. Additionally, the court held that the phrase ``of the kind'' preceding the words ``used for'' did not constitute a special language or context. See Sturm, Ruth, Customs Law and Administration, vol. 2., sec. 53.3, p. 28. Customs proposes no changes in this regard. Subheadings 7010.90.50 and 7013.39, HTSUS, would remain principal use provisions. Therefore, for an imported good to be classifiable in either of these subheadings, it must be of the class or kind of articles classifiable in these subheadings. Whether it is of the class or kind of articles classifiable in either subheading will be determined by its principal use. Principal use will, in turn, be determined by the specific criteria formulated to determine to what class or kind the imported goods belong. Based on the plain language of the provision, Customs is of the opinion that subheading 7010.90.50, HTSUS, includes the classes ``glass containers of a kind used for the conveyance or packing of goods'' and ``preserving jars of glass''. Containers of a Kind Used for the Conveyance or Packing of Goods Customs understanding of the principal use of this class and the factors which indicate acceptance of a particular article in the class, is based on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (ENs), relevant Headquarters Rulings Letters (HRLs) and the Kraft case.
