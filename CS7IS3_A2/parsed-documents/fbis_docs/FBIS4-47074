"Perhaps, we would not assemble in the street," says Valery Lyubushin, deputy of the regional assembly, freed recently, "had it not been for the arrest of Boris Suprunyuk, one of the organizers of the meeting." Valery Lyubushin and Boris Suprunyuk were detained on April 12 when it became clear that despite the ban by the authorities, the protests by the Russian-speaking communities -- Ukrainians, Russians, Germans and others -- would take place all the same. A week before the non-sanctioned meeting Suprunyuk and Lyubushin were arrested without an accusation. The picket of Cossacks near the Procurator's office demanded that they be set free. But only Valery Lyubushin was released, and a meeting with Suprunyuk was promised. But instead of that Petropavlovsk learned from Radio Liberty and Voice of America broadcasts: "Boris Suprunyuk has been accused of fomenting national discord and has been transported to Alma-Ata." `Down With Tyranny!' The participants in the marches in support of the prisoner were emboldened by the protest of Russia's Foreign Ministry and the status of a civil rights champion, given to Boris Suprunyuk by Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch. "Had it not been for international support, people would not dare to speak aloud about the oppression of "non-natives," deputy of the city Soviet Galina Kalyuzhnaya said with conviction. The reputation of Suprunyuk, an extremist and rebel, restrained the suppressed irritation of those non-Kazakh, who were dissatisfied with the national policy of President Nazarbayev. But his arrest caused an explosion in society. The cause of the persecutions of Suprunyuk in Petropavlovsk is believed to be from his consistency in demanding re-registration of the Russian community of Kazakhstan. The thing is that on the eve of elections to the new parliament all national associations of the republic were shut for re-registration by a decree of Nursultan Nazarabayev, issued in December 1993. As it was promised -- till the opening of the new parliament. More than two months have passed since its formation, but so far only the Kazakh movement "Kazakh-tili" has been officially registered. The others are still outlawed. "We, Germans, participated intentionally in the meeting of April 26 together with other Russian-speaking communities," says Viktor Shlotgauer, member of the presidium of the society "Revival." "We are not registered under the pretext that we are rejecting the wording: 'Kazakh Germans.' It is clear that this is being done to split all the Russian-speaking people -- Poles, Byelorussians, Armenians, Germans." Every year around 200,000 Germans, allowed by the quota, leave Kazakhstan for Germany. There is a queue for many years, but the 37,000 who remain prefer to move to Russia where, according to them, life is easier. The outflow of Germans increased, as soon as Alma-Ata compelled everyone to choose their citizenship by March 15, 1994. This date has been extended for another year. This is due to the requests and protests by the Russian-speaking communities against combining the adoption of citizenship with the transfer of all documents to the state language -- Kazakh. Before the spring of 1994 the keeping of documents in the Kazakh language seemed to be a distant future, but at the meeting of April 26 in Petropavlovsk the demands were clear: to set up a free economic zone with Russia and introduce the second state language -- Russian. South Against the North "We are called chauvinists, but what can be done if in Kokchetav, Pavlodar, Ust-Kamenogorsk and Tselinograd up to 60% of the population are Russian-speaking, and in Petropavlovsk and Kustanai almost 100%," says Valery Lyubushin. "Should all these people move to the Kazakh language? It would mean shutting down schools, institutes, factories. It's absurd!" Therefore, those participating in the rallies demand that the border with Russia be opened, that settlements of accounts be made easier with the enterprises of neighbours -- Novosibirsk, Omsk, Kurgan, as well as equal taxation with the South. It is already "equal" -- 100% of the profit the regions assign to Alma-Ata. But the greater part goes to the Kazakh South, which has created a free economic zone with China and Central Asia, and a lesser part -- to the Russian-speaking North. "So far the conflict is not of a vividly outlined national character," says Valery Ilyin, leader of the local branch of the Socialist Party. "People went out into the street because they are not paid wages for six months and spend a year on an emergency leave -- the plants stand idle because of ruined contacts with Russian suppliers. But even the ordinary citizen, mostly indifferent to politics, is not blind. He sees that for him there is no money, but Kazakh migrants from Mongolia are paid substantial travelling expenses, loans, even interest-free." Their actions run into absurdity: the wave of renamings swept the cities which never had other names. Petropavlovsk participated in a meeting, on learning that the city had been renamed into Kzylzhar. "It is fantastic only at first glance," says Valery Lyubushin, teacher of the local pedagogical institute, "but our lecturers teaching in the Kazakh language get 15-20% more than Russian-speaking teachers. All the leading posts are occupied by the representatives of the Kazakh nation." The election results to the new parliament show that this policy contributes to the formation of Kazakh statehood, infringing the national self-consciousness of other people. Out of 170 deputies 105 are Kazakhs. And this happens when over 60% of the republic's population are Russian-speaking. The privileges for the Kazakh nation together with unemployment played their role: in 1993 a total of 365,000 Russian-speaking people left Kazakhstan and moved to Russia. From Mongolia and China 105,000 Kazakhs returned to the republic and are now settled in the North. The results of the "soft" forcing out policy on Russians and the resettlement of Kazakhs on their lands were not kept waiting. In 1994 alone there were clashes in 5 Cossack villages (stanitsas) between the local Cossacks and Kazakh migrants. Cossacks and Kazakhs "We are not questioning Kazakhstan's sovereignty, but we are not going to leave our lands," says Viktor Achkasov, chieftain of the banned association of Siberian Cossacks. "Six percent Serbs succeeded in upholding the right to existence and we are more than 70%. We shall withstand!" Viktor Achkasov openly wears the Cossack uniform and carries a whip, banned by a decree of President Nazarbayev, whose stand is unequivocal: "In the socio-political forces of Kazakhstan there are no Cossacks," he told Boris Yeltsin at the latest talks in Moscow. As is known, Russia kept mum. The Cossacks believe this is "in reply to the right of taking Baikonur on lease." "In this way the life of one million people has been crossed out," Achkasov argues with the President of Russia. He is convinced that non-recognition of the Cossack community leads to the radicalization of that part of society. "You see, if earlier a mere juridical recognition suited us, then today many chieftains insist on autonomy, right up to the reunification with Russia," says Achkasov. These demands made at the meetings set the Kazakhs against Cossacks, threatening the republic with a split. After the events in Petropavlovsk the North grew quiet in expectation, Alma-Ata promises to release Boris Suprunyuk "after the completion of the investigation." Suprunyuk, according to his wife Luiza, continues his hunger-strike and will insist on an open political trial. He was backed up by all the national communities of the North and Cossacks who declared that they will openly carry arms, just like in Russia. "If the events that took place in Topolevka and Pokatilovka continue, we shall put force against force," ataman Achkasov says openly. -- Petropavlovsk [Box, p 3] MN File: Boris Suprunyuk, 58, is a journalist and chairman of the Russian-speaking community in North Kazakhstan. In August 1993 he turned down Kazakhstan citizenship and adopted Russian. Twice he was arrested. In 1988 the communist nomenklatura suspected him of a "mental disorder". He was set free two months later with the diagnosis: "healthy". In April 1994 he was arrested for refusing to give a written undertaking not to leave his residence in Petropavlovsk. [Box, p 3] MN File: On March 14-16, 1994 there was a clash in Topolevka and Pokatilovka stanitsas (Taldy-Kurgan Region) between Cossacks and Kazakhs during the celebrations of the Moslem holiday Navruz. Up to this day the villages are cordoned off by the forces of Kazakhstan's Interior Ministry. Twenty-five representatives of the Cossack community and 15 Kazakhs were arrested.
