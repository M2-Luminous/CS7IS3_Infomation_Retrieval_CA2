He also held discussion meetings with some teachers' representatives on reforming and developing education programs for adults and teachers. Li Lanqing inspected the new premises of the Beijing Municipal Adult Education College, teachers' families, the Beijing Radio and Television University, and the Beijing Teachers' University. He visited administrative and teaching personnel and examinees writing admission examinations for graduate programs. Li Lanqing extended his hope that the broad masses of administrative and teaching personnel will achieve better results and maintain good health in the new year, and wished them, in advance, a happy spring festival. After ending discussion meetings with teachers' representatives, Li Lanqing said: Adult education is a very important component of China's educational undertakings. At present, only a small number of people are able to receive higher education. Yet China's current national situation dictates that our society needs professionals of various skills. Therefore, we should strive to develop vocational and adult education programs, including radio and television education programs. The road to become a professional should not be limited to the "difficult path" of passing through an institution of higher education. We should, however, construct more "open roads" that will enable people to become professionals through various channels. We should gradually strive to realize the objective whereby willing students will be able to attend school. Consequently, after completing compulsory education, as many people as possible may have the chance for further studies by attending various education programs including vocational, adult, and radio and television education programs. Only if we provide many avenues to train professionals can we avoid the situation whereby once children enter primary schools, they begin to prepare for college matriculation examinations and thousands of applicants try to squeeze through a "single-plank bridge." Only then can we avoid cultivating and developing so many "narrow-minded and nearsighted" students so that secondary and primary school students will truly develop morally, intellectually, and physically. Therefore, the issue currently facing China's adult education programs, including radio and television education programs, is not that we should weaken these programs; on the contrary, we should continually strive to develop them. Li Lanqing said: When reforming and developing higher education in China, we should learn from and apply certain experiences in the operation of adult education programs including the latter's operating system, format, and methods. A program of higher education is not the ultimate objective. Even if we have a university degree, we should not regard it as the end of our educational progress in life. Higher education only provides the student with a relatively solid foundation of basic knowledge. Adult education programs will be mainly responsible for imparting special technical knowledge and for renewing an old knowledge base once a person joins the work force. We should pay attention to avoiding adult education program models that are "small but complete" and narrow-minded. He said: Adult education programs have played an important role in history by supplying educational opportunities to a generation of people who missed their studies because they had been transferred to remote mountains or rural areas. China is establishing a socialist market economy which involves economic and industrial restructuring which, in turn, leads to corresponding restructuring in China's old macroscopic education formats and content. Consequently, adult education programs will play increasingly important roles because more people need to renew and supplement their existing knowledge base. When evaluating whether a certain education system is doing a good job, we should use the most basic criteria to determine whether the education system can cultivate and produce various professionals for society who are needed both now and in the long run. Li Lanqing said: How to properly conduct socialist educational undertakings with Chinese characteristics is a new topic. As China has its own national conditions, we may refer to foreign countries' experiences in operating various educational programs, but we cannot copy them without reservations. We should strive to explore specific ways to reform and develop our educational programs in accordance with the requirements of "China's Program for Reforming and Developing its Educational Undertakings." He stressed: Leading cadres at various levels must change their concepts, must pay attention to education and truly grant it strategic importance so that it will receive top priority for development, and must respect teachers and attach importance to education. He reiterated: Any city or county that fails to properly operate its basic education programs or settle wages owed to teachers shall not be allowed to buy sedan cars or construct buildings of two or more storeys. Furthermore, leading cadres there shall be barred from going overseas. When discussing higher education, Li Lanqing said: At present, in addition to gradually solving the problem of investment in education, institutions of higher education should devote their primary efforts to further raising teaching quality and to increasing the benefits that they bring to society; they should also promote educational development through working out reform measures. He pointed out: As the "211 Project" is a project in process, it is necessary to gradually bring it to fruition in line with stipulated standards. In addition, those colleges and universities which stubbornly refuse to work out reform measures should be barred from joining the "211 Project." Institutions of higher education are encouraged to help promote the "211 Project" through cooperating with one another, compensating for each other's deficiencies, and bringing their respective advantages into play. Colleges and universities should not be allowed to join the "211 Project" if the regions where they are situated are found to have poorly managed basic education. To help increase academic exchanges, further bring into play teachers' potential, and increase the benefits that schools bring to society, institutions of higher education should allow teachers to give lectures outside of their own schools on the premise that they fulfil their own teaching duties. Li Lanqing spoke of the need to improve moral education [deyu jiaoju 1795 5148 2403 5148]. Regarding conducting education on national conditions, he suggested relying on and using more "current events" to carry out such education and called on leaders at all levels to enhance education on the current situation among faculty and students. As comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the Marxism that integrates with the reality of contemporary China [shi jiehe dangdai zhongguo shiji di makesi zhuyi 2508 4814 0678 3981 0108 0022 0948 1395 7139 4104 7456 0344 1835 0031 5030], we should earnestly study it. When conducting moral education, it is necessary to adopt different content and methods for different age groups. We should guard against "insipid" and stereotyped presentation when conducting moral education. Efforts shoud be made to enhance art education and attention paid to nurturing youngsters' noble spirit. We should extract the cream of 5,000 years of tradition and incorporate it into the spirit of the times. It is necessary to adopt various ways to extensively spread, popularize, and develop the excellent traditions of the Chinese nation. Accompanying Li Lanqing during the inspection were Zhang Xiaowen and Zhang Tianbao, vice ministers of the State Education Commission; Li Qiyan and Hu Zhaoguang, mayor and vice mayor of Beijing Municipality; and Chen Dabai, vice chairman of the Beijing Municipal CPPCC [Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference].
