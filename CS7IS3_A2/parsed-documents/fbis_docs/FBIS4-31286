If everything proceeds according to the schedule just accepted, and if the sides are able to agree on the details, the new Hungarian Government could be set up by the end of the month. Here is a report by Kata Peli-Nagy on the press briefing by [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn and [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan Peto. [Begin Horn recording] We agreed that we would set up experts committees for the purpose of coordinating, working out, and finalizing the individual topics. [end recording] [Peli-Nagy] In accordance with the announcement made by the MSZP's prime ministerial candidate, Gyula Horn, the coalition talks begun today will be continued and the government agreement will be prepared in 10 committees. The MSZP and the SZDSZ each charged one leading expert with continuing the discussions. The leaders of the working group dealing with economic policy issues are Laszlo Bekesi [MSZP] and Marton Tardos [SZDSZ]. The leaders of the agricultural committee are Laszlo Lakos [MSZP] and Pal Juhasz [SZDSZ]. Those heading the committee dealing with health and social issues are Pal Kovacs [MSZP] and Andrea Szolnoki [SZDSZ]. The leaders of the committee on cultural, minority, and church policy are Gyoergy Janosi [MSZP] and Gabor Fodor [SZDSZ]. The discussion of issues concerning public law and safety will be led by Zoltan Gal [MSZP] and Peter Hack [SZDSZ]. Ferenc Baja [MSZP] and Ferenc Wekler [SZDSZ] are dealing with self-government issues. Laszlo Kovacs [MSZP] and Istvan Szent-Ivanyi [SZDSZ] are dealing with foreign and security policy; Mrs Kosa, nee Magda Kovacs [MSZP], and Tamas Bauer [SZDSZ] are dealing with social interest coordination. A separate committee will discuss the government structure, and it will be headed by Imre Szekeres [MSZP] and Gabor Kuncze [SZDSZ]. Imre Szekeres and Balint Magyar [SZDSZ] will discuss the coalition agreement guarantees. The leaders of the committees are not the individual parties' minister-designates. The work could involve experts too. This was said by Gyula Horn, and then he added: [Begin Horn recording] We would like the experts committees to schedule their work so that the first version of the coalition agreement will be prepared by 20 June, so that we can put the final touches on it, and so that it will be ready for signing, at the latest, by 24 June. I must say that this discussion was characterized by a fully constructive approach. We thought in a virtually identical manner concerning the great majority of issues. [end recording] [Peto] I would also like to highlight what Gyula Horn said -- that what we have experienced indicates extremely encouraging and very effective talks in the future. Naturally, tough and long debates can be expected in the questions of content, but we agree -- and we agreed on this too -- that the date for convening the National Assembly is a firm framework for us to which we would like to adhere under all circumstances.
