FBIS3-50458 "drlat001_t_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-001 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Jan 1994 Venezuela Value-Added Tax at Retail Level Approved PA2912160893 Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 28 Dec 93 p D-1 PA2912160893 Caracas EL NACIONAL Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Report by Victor Manuel Reinoso] [Text] Ramon Espinoza, minister of the Presidency Secretariat, has reported that the Council of Ministers approved yesterday the implementation of the value-added tax (VAT) at the retail level starting on 1 January 1994. Espinoza added that the implementation was approved with certain new exemptions that the ministers of finance and Cordiplan [Ministry of Coordination and Planning], along with a special commission, were drafting as late as yesterday afternoon. The approval of VAT by the government of President Ramon J. Velasquez is also contemplating a 15-percent tax hike on luxury items, an area led by cars with prices of more than 4 million bolivares. Today we reached the goal given to us by the Special Powers Act. The Public Registry Law was approved, and minor modifications were introduced to the VAT Law, particularly in the area of exemptions. The exemptions were expanded in areas dealing with goods and services of low-income sectors, but in general the law's basic principles will remain. It was also agreed to increase taxes on luxury items by 15 percent to compensate and make this law more equitable and fair, Minister Espinoza explained. The official added that the expansion of exemptions includes such items as oil, sugar, paper, and mass consumption goods, as well as pensions for low-income people and cultural and sports events. The new table of exemptions also includes airplane tickets but not international airplane tickets. Espinoza said that the commission would meet yesterday and was especially designated to determine which products and services will be exempted. The luxury items that will have an added 15-percent tax are vehicles worth more than 4 million bolivares, yachts, billiard tables, and products such as caviar and salmon, which are consumed by high-income sectors. Alcoholic beverages and cigarettes have a special tax that went into effect before VAT approval. Among the exemptions, the Finance Ministry and Cordiplan experts--led by Ministers Carlos Rafael Silva and Hernan Anzola--are studying medicines sold by the private sector. Espinoza explained that the new exemptions are added to the other, comprising 30 percent of the basic market basket. Among the exemptions are products consumed in cafeterias, corporate dining rooms, and whatever is purchased in education establishments. Espinoza said that the 15-percent tax hike on luxury items compensates for the exemptions to keep VAT revenues unchanged for 1994, which had been estimated to be approximately 250 billion bolivares. This amount will be important to correct the fiscal deficit and somehow reverse inflation and interest rates, which are adversely affecting the production sector. It will also serve to balance the bolivar with respect to foreign currencies, Espinosa said. The minister said that VAT will allow the government to reverse the current picture, adding: "We believe that this is a temporary, provisional sacrifice, and if it is implemented quickly with certain correctives on public spending, especially on debureaucratization, privatization, and decentralization, we can correct the fiscal deficit during the next government's first or second year." We could have a one-digit inflation figure, stabilizing interest rates so that the production sector can generate more goods, services, more jobs, and satisfaction, Espinoza added. 80 Million in Propaganda Meanwhile, Rosana Ordonez, director of the Central Information Office [OCI], has said VAT approval means that the tax will be effective on 1 January in its second stage with the application of Regulation Two, namely, at the retail level. This is so because until now VAT is only being applied at the importer level. Therefore, the government, Finance Ministry basically, will initiate an information campaign that consists of explaining to consumers how VAT is paid, of what the crossed tax [impoesto cruzado] consists, what the exempted items are, what the tax-paying items are, and how bills are made and in what outlets, Ordonez said. She said that this campaign, which has had international advisers' support, will be publicized on radio, television, and in the written press, and a series of short television spots were aired yesterday informing the public about the details. The OCI minister has said the modifications the economic advisers made to the government regarding exemptions are being incorporated into the latest regulation, while luxury items are being taxed more. Ordonez concluded that aside from the free information on VAT reported by different media, which makes it the more important campaign due to its explanatory nature, the official executive campaign will cost an estimated 80 million bolivares.
