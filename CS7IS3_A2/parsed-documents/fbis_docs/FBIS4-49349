The historic scene, witnessed by more than 2,000 dignitaries and guests at the Cairo International Conference Center, marks a "new dawn" to the people in Gaza and Jericho, as chief PLO negotiator Nabil Shaath put it. It opens a new page in the Palestinian annals which up till now have been soaked in blood and tears. For the Palestinians in the occupied land, what the self-rule agreement means most is that it gives them sovereignty symbols -- the power of legislation, their own passports, postage stamps and area code, their own airline, radio and TV stations, the right to fish freely in their own territorial seas and above all, they will see their own armed policemen patrolling the streets instead of facing the black barrels of Israeli guns. To run the self-rule regions, the PLO Executive Committee has named a 25-member National Authority Council. It will be headed by 'Arafat, who is expected to enter into Gaza and Jericho in early June, and made up of 12 people from the occupied territories and the diaspora respectively, assuring a political leadership at long last to the Palestinians in the occupied territories. Poor and neglected as it is in the occupied land, economic development occupies a top priority for the Palestinian autonomy government, and it has its chances. Of the several joint PLO-Israeli coordination committees, the economic coordination committee has reaped good results in their negotiations. They signed an economic pact in Paris on April 29. The self-rule authority will establish a monetary mechanism, manage foreign currency reserves, conduct its own direct tax policy and run its own import and export business. Long sufferings of the Palestinians have drawn world-wide sympathy. More than 40 countries have offered to supply 2 billion U.S. dollars to aid the self-rule which also provides good investment opportunities for the successful Palestinian financers and entrepreneurs in the diaspora. With a level of self-controlled economic institutions at home and assistance offers worldwide, the self-rule authority could do something to the occupation-shattered economy. From being occupied to self-rule is a drastic turn that unavoidably invites post-occupation frictions and uncertainties. Besides the continuing joint committees on liaison, security and civil affairs, two dispute committees and a trilateral cooperation and coordination mechanism set up by the self-rule agreement are meant to this rescue. As 'Arafat put it Monday [2 May], the Gaza-Jericho self-rule agreement is an initial step toward the establishment of a Palestinian state and Israeli withdrawal from all occupied lands including Jerusalem. The more difficult negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories lie ahead and there is a long way to go to achieve a complete resolution of the Palestinian issue. This initial step, which leads to partial Israeli withdrawal from the occupied land, will have political and psychological effects on the Palestinians and Arabs. It will enable the Arab parties concerned, Israel and world powers to focus their efforts on other tracks of Arab-Israeli negotiations, particularly the Syrian-Israeli track. In two weeks time, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will begin another diplomatic shuttle in the Middle East region. He said he would mainly push forward the Syrian-Israeli talks. The impetus the agreement on the implementation of the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho gave to the whole Middle East peace process is obviously felt.
