The paper quoted a senior Russian fleet official as saying that the contract was concluded at secret instructions from the Naval Headquarters in Moscow and that he couldn't disclose the price of the 2,500-ton submarines. The official added that ostensibly North Korea is buying the vessels for use as scraps. Another fleet official said, however, that North Korea could update the submarines and create a new submarine flotilla or dismantle them to salvage parts for use in repairing those they already have. The four submarines were built in the 1960s. The Russian Navy is known to possess 38 Fox-Trot-type conventional attack submarines.
