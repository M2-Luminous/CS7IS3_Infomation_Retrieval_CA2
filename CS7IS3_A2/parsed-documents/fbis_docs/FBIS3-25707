This was stated by an opposition leader to AFP today. "We are not ready to go to a third round. If they impose it on us, we will withdraw," said the source, who preferred not to be named. The opposition, represented by the Action Committee for Renewal, CAR, and the Togolese Union for Democracy, UTD, unofficially won 43 seats -- 36 by CAR and seven by UTD -- which is two seats over the number required for absolute majority. The parties from the presidential camp obtained 37, and the remaining one was won by Joseph Kokou Koffigoh, the transitional prime minister, who is a centrist. This opposition leader disclosed that the CAR and UTD representatives this morning went to the International Followup Committee, which comprises Burkinabe, French, German, Egyptian, and American delegates, to denounce the "illegal attitude" of the National Electoral Commission, CEN. Yesterday evening, this commission transferred the entire results of the second round to the Supreme Court, but refrained from officially publishing those concerning the challenged five constituencies. Waiting for the magistrates' decision -- to be made on 13 March at the latest -- political consultations continued in Lome yesterday. UTD General Secretary Ata Messan Ajavon described as "erroneous" the rumors that his party allegedly held contacts with the Rally of the Togolese People, RPT, the pro-Eyadema party. From a reliable source within the UTD it was, however, confirmed that many meetings had taken place since yesterday with the CAR leader to "coordinate the attitude" of the two opposition parties. "In view of the electoral results, which force us to be a small party, we do not ask for anything. Our condition does not allow us to do so," this source stated, adding that the UTD intended to play its role as a "buffer-party." Mr. Koffigoh, who is the only elected candidate of the Convention of New Forces, also wants to play this role. He reminded AFP that he was not an "RPT member" and that his party represented "a completely different leaning."
