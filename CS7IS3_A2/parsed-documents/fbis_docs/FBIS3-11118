In an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA, the Cuban foreign minister, who in addition to Thailand has already visited Indonesia, Laos, and Myanmar (formerly Burma), said that his hosts have expressed interest in negotiations with Cuba in the fields of health, biotechnology, and sports, among others. He said that Cuba does not go around making only appeals, that Cuba has much to offer the world also, especially this part of the world. He noted that right now his country is facing many needs and that other countries could make investments based on those needs. In his opinion, Cuba must analyze the economic boom in this region and determine what can be tailored to fit Cuba's needs. Robaina emphasized that our diplomacy's main objective is to contribute, within the framework of an economic model that must be, above everything else, Cuban and viable, to the solution of the problems we have. Robaina said that so far the most important aspect of his tour, which will also include India, Malaysia, and Vietnam, has been the understanding and opportunities he has found for explaining Cuba's true situation. Robaina noted that the persons with whom he has held meetings so far have expressed respect for the way the Cuban people have resisted and for how, in the midst of difficulties, the island has begun to show recovery symptoms. At times like this we have to function with a new-style diplomacy, one mindful of the main problems all nations face. After intense sessions in Myanmar and Thailand, Robaina left for Cambodia where he is scheduled to meet with the prime minister of that kingdom, Sdeth Krom [as received], and National Assembly President Chea Sin, among other government leaders. This is the first official visit of a prominent Cuban Government leader to Cambodia since the establishment of peace and stability in that nation.
