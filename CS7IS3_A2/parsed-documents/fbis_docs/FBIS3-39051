Replying to questions by a Turkish Radio and Television correspondent, Aliyev said that he does not foresee any changes regarding Turkey's share in the agreement. Pointing out that there are various oil pipeline projects, Aliyev added, however, that in most of these projects having the pipeline cross Turkey is a high consideration. He noted that Azerbaijan's relations with Russia are continuing on their normal course but that the cease-fire plan that has been proposed was not found suitable. Aliyev stated that Azerbaijan will be deciding on which countries might participate in the peacekeeping forces to be stationed in Karabakh and that his country wants Turkey to participate in these forces. He noted that the unconditional withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied Azerbaijani territory is the first condition for a possible peace agreement with the Armenians.
