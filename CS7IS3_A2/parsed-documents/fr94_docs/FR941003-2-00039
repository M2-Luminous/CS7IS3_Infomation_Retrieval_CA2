FR941003-2-00039 FR941003-2-00031 The administration charge cap applies to all VFC Program-registered providers that administer the vaccine to a Federally vaccine-eligible child. It does not apply to children receiving free vaccines under State purchase programs or any other arrangement. In accordance with the statute, physicians participating in the VFC Program can charge non-Medicaid eligible children the maximum administration charge (if that charge reflects the provider's cost of administration) regardless of whether the State has established a lower administration fee under the Medicaid program. However, there would be no Federal Medicaid matching funds available for such administration. Although the cost of the vaccines for the VFC Program is funded under Title XIX of the Act, Medicaid will not pay for the administration of vaccines provided to children under the VFC Program who are not eligible for Medicaid. A provider may only bill Medicaid for the administration of a vaccine if the child is Medicaid eligible. Because the VFC program is mandated by law to become operational on October 1, 1994, we are announcing these regional maximum administration charges and guidelines for documenting access on an interim basis, subject to comment and revision. We will issue a final Federal Register document setting forth the applicable requirements and responding to public comments on the provisions of this notice that we receive on a timely basis. B. Methodology Used to Establish Administration Charges We used the following methodology to establish the regional maximum charges for administration of qualified pediatric vaccines set forth under section II.C. of this notice. 1. Basis for Using Charge Data versus Cost Data As noted above, the statute provides that these maximum charges are to be based in the actual costs of vaccine administration, as determined by the Secretary. This provision posed a serious implementation problem for HCFA because of the unavailability of usable actual cost data on a nationwide basis and the urgency of promulgating maximum fees before the VFC program begins operation. We searched thoroughly for appropriate data on the costs of vaccine administration. We also consulted with several organizations and with individuals with knowledge and expertise in issues regarding physician payment, including the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC). We were informed that there are no data readily available on physicians' actual costs that would provide a valid basis for setting these maximum charges on a nationwide scale. It also was apparent to us that it would not be possible to generate such data via field research within the time available to implement the VFC program on October 1, 1994. A proper analysis would require detailed, expensive, and time-consuming collection and evaluation of data on each element of both direct and indirect costs, including equipment, supplies and labor, as well as an appropriate verification and allocation of ``overhead'' costs. On the basis of this information, we concluded that we should explore setting the maximum charges based on data regarding actual charges for the administration of vaccines in physicians' offices. This, too, posed a problem. We consulted with insurance companies, physicians' groups, trade associations, the PPRC, and other knowledgeable experts. Again, we concluded that accurate, consistent data on charges were not readily available. There are a number of concerns about the data that are available, including inconsistencies in the coding of procedures and the fact that most payers do not differentiate, or pay separately for, the cost of the vaccine and its administration. In light of these problems, we were unable to construct a reliable data base by integrating data from existing information sources. We concluded that it would be necessary to generate a data base specifically for this purpose. For the reasons stated above, it was not feasible to generate a data base using actual costs, but it was feasible to do one based on charges. In the absence of valid studies to the contrary, we think that, for this particular service, charge data is a reasonable proxy for setting these maximum fees until we are able to obtain cost data. Our conclusion is reinforced by the provision of the statute requiring physicians to agree not to refuse to vaccinate a child because of the family's inability to pay the administration fee and by the knowledge that many physicians currently either do not bill indigent patients their full charge or accept less than full payment from them. Given the statutory requirements that the administration fees not exceed the costs of administration, we recognize the importance of utilizing cost data in developing the regional maximum charges. We also realize that the use of charge data in developing the maximum charges may result in maximum charges that are too high. While it appears that there are no useable cost data readily available, our goal is to obtain information that can be used in setting maximum charges in the future. We will be conducting a study to accumulate accurate cost data, and will revise the maximum charges based on cost as soon as possible. The fiscal year 1995 Department of Health and Human Services appropriations bill specifically addresses the use of charge versus cost data. (140 Cong. Rec. H9306, Sept. 20, 1994) The Secretary is directed to compute the actual cost of administering vaccines and to revise the fees in accordance with the requirements of the law. Because the appropriations bill also states that this directive is not intended to delay the start-up of the VFC program, we will utilize the interim maximum charges. However, as stated above, we will conduct a study with the goal of obtaining accurate cost data and will issue revised maximum charge amounts as soon as possible. 2. Charge Data Methodology To obtain a data base of physician charges, we contracted with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to purchase data on the normal fee charged by its members for administering the vaccines to be covered by this program. (We note that AAP did not believe it could obtain cost data by directly surveying its membership.) The AAP had gathered these data from a national, sample survey of its members. The sample was large enough (approximately 1,114 responses) to give us confidence in the national average, but not large enough in each State to allow us to set state-by-state maximum charges without further adjustment. The preliminary results of the survey indicated that the overall average administration charge was $14.48. The final national average administration charge we obtained from the AAP was $15.09.
