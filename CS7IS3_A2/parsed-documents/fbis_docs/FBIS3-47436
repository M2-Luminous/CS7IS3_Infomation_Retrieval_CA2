FBIS3-47436 "dreas008_d_94022" FBIS-EAS-94-008 Document Type:Daily Report 12 Jan 1994 South Korea Ministry Announces Plans To Ease Investment Process SK1201035894 Seoul YONHAP in English 0232 GMT 12 Jan 94 SK1201035894 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- The procedure for direct foreign investment in South Korea will be improved to require only the filing of an investment plan with the government, while tax breaks and financial support for foreign firms investing in high- tech and other specific industries will be greatly expanded this year. At present, investors must obtain government approval of their investment plan. The foreign exchange market will be further liberalized, with the exchange rate fluctuation range increased from the current 1 percent of the previous day's average market rate. To minimize farmers' losses due to market opening, a specific duty system will be introduced for cheap farm products whereby tariffs will be set on the basis of a fixed sum of money for each unit of quantity or weight. These are among the salient points of the Finance Ministry's operating program that Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong reported to President Kim Yong-sam on Wednesday. Hong said the Citizens National Bank will be denationalized and equity totaling 688 billion won of four state-run banks, including the Korea Development Bank, in 29 firms will be sold, along with equity worth 211.2 billion won in 18 subsidiaries. Ceilings on investment in foreign securities markets by institutional investors, such as securities, insurance and investment trust companies, will be lifted altogether for free investment abroad, and individual investors, now allowed to invest in foreign securities only through investment trust firms, will be free to invest directly in foreign equity markets. The introduction of foreign commercial loans will be limited to importing equipment needed in infrastructure expansion projects, while terms of foreign exchange loans from the Bank of Korea will be eased for increased capital investment by corporations. These loans will be excepted from credit controls. The tax credit system for investment in equipment and plant, where 10 percent of the investment cost is deducted from taxable profit for small firms and 7 percent for large firms, will be extended by the end of the year. All listed firms in the manufacturing sector will be allowed to increase their capital by issuing new shares, if they meet certain requirements. To stabilize prices and at the same time to ensure smooth flow of funds, growth of the total money supply (cash in circulation plus demand and time deposits) will be pegged at between 14 percent and 17 percent this year, Hong said. Bank loans supporting government policies will be gradually reduced, while the Bank of Korea will impose ceilings on commercial banks when rediscounting notes they have already discounted. Corporations will be allowed to set up sales finance firms overseas to help them increase exports, and companies developing their own trademarks and designs will be accorded tax breaks to encourage such development efforts. Later, Construction Minister Kim U-suk revealed the creation of a Computer Data Bank on 25 million lots of land across the country by the end of the year in briefing the president on his ministry's operating program in 1994. Private capital will be invited for construction of selected roads, tunnels and bridges, to make up for fund shortages in infrastructure expansion projects, he said.
