Airbus 330 Flies More Economically Than Expected"; first paragraph is an introduction] [Text] Testing of the efficiency and reliability of the new Airbus 330 in daily scheduled use was the focus of the route tests that the European consortium conducted in cooperation with Malaysia Airlines and Air Inter. The first phase of the so-called route tests as the concluding part of the certification program for the new Airbus Wide-Body Twin A330 began at the end of August in Kuala Lumpur in conjunction with the Asian first customer, Malaysia Airlines. By 6 September the aircraft had passed in a total of 30 flights just under 103 flying hours on the Asian airline's domestic and international route network. In addition, in more than 40,000 nautical miles (74,000 km) to Perth in Australia, Johannesburg, Tokyo, Kuching, Bangkok or Hong Kong, the Airbus offspring achieved 100 percent reliability, according to the company's data. The second phase from 14 to 17 September with the short-route test on the routes of French launching customer Air Inter was just as successful. Equipped in a single-class configuration with a seating capacity of 412, the maxi-twin's so-called high-density/high-frequency qualities above all were challenged here. Its ground handling characteristics--from docking at the gate and the passengers getting off, to new passengers getting on, and leaving the gate position--had to prove themselves during an average of five to six flights per day over routes with a time in operation of between 60 and 80 minutes--like, for example, from Paris-Orly to Toulouse, Bordeaux, Marseilles or Nice. The company says that there were striking results during the route tests, but above all even for the efficiency data obtained during flight. "The total weight of the A330 is approximately 1.5 tons below the airline guaranteed values of 217 tons maximum. Not least, its take-off and landing properties could be improved because of this. But it is much more important that the fuel consumption was able to be lowered once again by a good two percent," stated GÃ©rard Guyot, head of Airbus Flight Division's testing and development department. In comparison with its competitors--the Boeing 777 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-11, the A330's fuel burn on a 2000-nautical-mile (3704-km) segment is between 17 and 21 percent more favorable, according to Airbus statistics. This would represent a saving of between $600,000 and $1 million per year per aircraft. Lastly, for operating costs even a reduction of up to $3.1 million per year is realistic. The two U.S. manufacturers are doubtlessly of a different opinion in this matter. Last but not least, in addition the A330 also successfully passed the certification test for long over-land and over-water flights by twin-jet aircraft. These ETOPS (Extended Range Twin Engine Operations) certification flights are for proving the safe continuation of a flight in case of an engine failure with multiple system failures at the same time--depressurization and failure of the electrical system and the generation of fumes, for example. Airbus Industrie will be supplying the A330 version furnished with Pratt & Whitney PW4168 or with Rolls- Royce Trent 700 engines with 90-minute ETOPS certification for the time being. Aircraft with the now proven General Electric CF6-80E1 are being offered with 120-minute ETOPS certification, which means that, with the problems named above, an alternate airport has to be reached within two hours. Certification for the new Airbus is to occur some time in October after lastly approximately 1000 hours in flight testing. The delivery of the first of a total of 15 aircraft to Air Inter is to take place towards the end of the year. Malaysia Airlines is to receive the first aircraft from the middle of 1994, at an estimated price of about $115 million apiece.
