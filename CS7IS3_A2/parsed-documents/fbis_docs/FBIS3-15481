In an interview with INTERFAX today, he said that apart from the neighbors' suppositions of their disproportional expenses, the Americans have no other evidence to prove that the Ameses worked for the Russian intelligence. Stepashin said he had met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin shortly before he was appointed as FCS director, but he declined to give any comments on it. Asked whether the Russian special service will be reformed once again, Stepashin said it was "quite a natural thing" under the conditions when society is going through dramatic changes. At the same time, he pointed out that the president's bid to carry out no more purges in counterintelligence officers in order not to squander the potential was strictly observed during the present reformation. Stepashin hoped that FCS will manage to retain its high-class professionals, and that they will efficiently fulfil their tasks. According to the FCS director, Russia needs a stronger special service capable of ensuring the state's security.
