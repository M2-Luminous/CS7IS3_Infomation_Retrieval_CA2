"Although large-scale combat operations are hardly possible, armed clashes between various groupings may destabilize the situation," he told Interfax on Monday. Kondratyev favors the earliest possible despatch of peacekeeping forces to this zone. He said, however, that the final decision is to be taken by the Russian president, who chairs the Council of the CIS Heads of State. To quote Kondratyev, a peacekeeping operation might facilitate the return of refugees and a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. He also announced that the Russian peacekeeping contingent was ready to begin the operation three to five days after the decision was taken. A total of 1,500 Russian peacekeepers, consisting of two divisions based in the Leningrad and Volga military districts, are expected to be sent to the conflict zone. Subsequently, peacekeepers from other CIS countries are to join the operation.
