On Monday, a large group of journalists from various publications, information agencies, and radio and tv stations arrived at the top secret garrison in Mirny. They will be able to acquaint themselves with some of Russia's latest military technology, in particular, with the "Topol" experimental missile system which is expected to become part of the armed forces in a couple of years. The journalists' arrival corresponded with celebrations of Cosmonaut's Day. In Mirny, this holiday is widely celebrated, since much has been done here for progress in space.
