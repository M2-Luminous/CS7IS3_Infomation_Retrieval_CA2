Speaking to reporters at the Japan National Press Club, Haas said Germany has intensified its relations with East and Southeast Asia, adding Bonn's new Asia policy, adopted in October, "singles out Japan as major partner in the region." A cooperation council for high technology proposed during German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to Japan in February 1993 will likely be formally established when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa visits Germany as part of a European tour in May, he said. Through the council, representatives of both governments and the high-tech industries of both countries and research and development personnel will meet on a regular basis to exchange views on the latest technological developments and sound out possible joint projects. Haas, who will leave his Tokyo post on April 29 after more than three and a half years in Japan, said Bonn "very warmly welcomed" the priorities set by the Hosokawa cabinet, citing political reform, decentralization and deregulation. However, he indicated that political developments since August, when Hosokawa's coalition government took power ending almost four decades of Liberal Democratic Party rule, have put a damper on Bonn's initial enthusiasm. "We had high, possibly too high expectations and may have to prepare ourselves for some disappointment," Haas said. "You sell twice as much as you buy from us," said Haas, urging more Japanese efforts to adjust the bilateral trade imbalance which reached 930.44 billion yen in Japan's favor in 1993. "The Germans feel that Japan can and should be more open to its competitors and to international division of labor," the ambassador said, adding that Germany hopes to solve trade problems in a multilateral context. Turning to cultural relations, Haas acknowledged that Germany should correct another imbalance -- the number of Japanese studying in Germany is seven to eight times higher than the number of Germans studying in Japan, he said. Haas, who is fluent in Japanese, said, however, "it is simply not true" that speaking the partner country's language is a prerequisite for mutual understanding. With the increasing global interdependence English will become the mode of communication in German-Japan relations anyway, he said. "This is not a bad development," Haas said, adding that bilateral relations need to be taken somewhat "out of the hands of specialists." Son of a career diplomat, Haas spent almost his entire childhood in Japan and China. In the 1960s he served as a junior officer under his father, who was then the German ambassador to Japan. Bonn has not decided yet who will succeed Haas.
