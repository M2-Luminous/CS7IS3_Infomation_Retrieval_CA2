He made a speech in which he explained his reasons for leaving the government. Yegor Gaydar gave as one of his reasons for resigning the government's adoption of a decision to allocate $500 million toward the construction of a new parliament building. In his words, "To carry out a policy envisaging the adoption of such decisions is to go beyond the bounds of morality." Yegor Gaydar believes that the disagreements that were clearly visible in the work of the government over the past year were linked to the fundamental question of "what kind of Russia we want to have." He explained that the reformers favored a "cheap and moderately sized state that serves society," and in particular, reducing the state apparatus and bringing to a minimum the number of government functionaries. However, there exists another approach in Russia as well, he said. This is "a strong, powerful, and expensive state, which will intervene in all spheres of public life and will have a powerful apparatus of functionaries merging with a new emerging bourgeoisie." Nevertheless, Yegor Gaydar said that Russia's Choice was ready to support any constructive decisions by the government. Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the future work of Anatoliy Chubays in the government, Yegor Gaydar said that "it will be difficult for Chubays to work." He explained that "the privatization process has gathered a certain momentum, and if people begin actively and systematically to wreck it, it will nevertheless continue until 1 July, when privatization checks expire." Yegor Gaydar expressed the hope that Anatoliy Chubays "will do all he can to fulfill our obligations." The participants at the assembly supported the creation of a New Civic Movement. It will be formed on the basis of Democratic Russia. The adopted manifesto of the New Civic Movement [Novoye Grazhdanskoye Dvizheniye] proclaims the need "to build a civic society by peaceful means, improve the socio-economic situation of working people, and ensure a normal standard of living for ourselves and our children." Lev Ponomarev, co-chairman of the Democratic Russia movement, said that the movement's founding conference should be held as early as the beginning of March.
