Karadzic said that he had proposed a ceasefire between Serbs and Muslims in the area, and the deployment of an Unprofor force there. He also claimed that the Serbs would arrange a unilateral ceasefire if the Muslims would not agree to one. While saying that the meeting had been helpful in promoting the peace process, Akashi would only promise more UN military observers for Brcko. Brcko is a key strategic town bordering Serbia, the Serb- controlled area of Bosnia and the Serb-controlled part of Croatia. The Bosnian Muslim government is reportedly preparing to launch a "war of liberation" in the area. The Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, while inspecting the Muslim military front line near Brcko yesterday, said that the Muslims were ready for a decisive battle with the Serbs there. Serb sources claim that the United States has promised to "take tough action" against the Serbs once the Muslim attack begins.
