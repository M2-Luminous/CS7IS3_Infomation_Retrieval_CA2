FR940318-2-00057 FR940318-2-00044 (4) Manufacturers could choose any combination of California certified vehicles to meet average NMOG fleet emission standards in the OTR as follows: 1999_0.113 g/mi 2000_0.073 g/mi 2001_0.070 g/mi 2002_0.068 g/mi 2003 and later_0.062 g/mi Regarding California's ZEV sales mandate, the OTC recommends that, to the extent it must apply to satisfy section 177, it shall apply. But if it is not required under section 177, the OTC recommends that the ``individual States within the OTC may at their option include such a requirement and/or economic incentives designed to increase the sales of ZEVs in the programs they adopt.'' (5) The effective date for the OTC LEV program would be January 1, 1996, allowing two vehicle model years prior to applicability of the standards in 1999, but does not preclude earlier State implementation. EPA believes that its decision whether to approve the OTC's recommendation raises substantial and difficult questions that must be made in the context of the Northeast States' overall emission reduction needs to attain the ozone standard. The Agency thus believes that the scope of its review should be broad enough to encompass the context of the particular LEV measure that the OTC recommends. The States are currently developing their overall strategy (including emissions inventory work, modeling work, and analysis of the full range of potential control measures), in preparation for the November 15, 1994 attainment demonstration deadline. The Agency believes that this November 15 deadline is critical to the States' progress toward timely attainment. The Agency expects to undertake thorough consultations with the members of the commission and the affected States, and to provide an opportunity for all interested members of the public to provide data, views, and other information that may assist EPA in reaching a decision. The Agency believes that, in determining whether the recommended LEV measure is ``necessary'' under section 184, it should consider the measure as part of the overall emission reduction needs for the region, and anticipates gathering information regarding the recommended measure as it relates to the overall emission reductions needs through consultations and public hearings. The EPA urges those who intend to prepare testimony and written comments to begin considering this issue in the context of the total attainment requirements for the region, and to provide comments on the overall emission reduction needs of the region. As noted above, the Agency will provide a further Federal Register notice in late March or early April that will provide specific information about the time and place of the public hearing and more detail about the process EPA intends to follow in reaching a decision. EPA also expects to describe a framework for reaching its decision and to discuss significant issues for public comment in this forthcoming notice. Dated: March 10, 1994. Mary D. Nichols, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6452 Filed 3&hyph;17&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
