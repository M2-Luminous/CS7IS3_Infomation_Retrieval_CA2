The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article by reporter Pak Tu-sik on the ROK Government's moves. The article reports government authorities were "quite at a loss" with the IAEA report and "the trend is leaning toward the inevitability of referring the issue to the UN Security Council." The article notes that the government showed an attitude quite different from previous ones quoting Nuclear Ambassador Kim Samhun as saying: "Our patience has come to a limit. We doubt if North Korea is a dialogue partner." The article analyzes that such a shift to a hard-line position was based on the judgment that only "dialogue with sanctions" could solve the problem. CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article on U.S. reaction by correspondent Chong Hae-yong from Washington. Describing that "the United States is enraged and embarrassed to be cheated again," the article reports that although voices demanding stronger measures are increasing, the U.S. Government will not completely close down the communication channel with North Korea but seek a resolution through dialogue while pressing it with UN sanctions. The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 2 a 500-word article on the background and prospects of the IAEA Board of Governors' special meeting by correspondent Kim Uk-hui from Bonn. While expecting a strong IAEA resolution against North Korea, the article speculates that the IAEA will not immediately announce that the continuity of safeguards has been broken and impose sanctions. The article expects that "the resolution will focus on demanding additional inspections." TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article by reporter Kim Cha-su analyzing ROK Government's view on the nuclear issue. The article says the government is preparing to resume the Team Spirit exercise and expedite the deployment of Patriot missiles. The article also reports that a government official explained that "dialogue is meaningless under the situation in which the international community is heading for ultra-hard measures." The article also speculates that North Korea might not come to the 19 March North-South working-level contact for the special envoy exchange due to the ROK Government's drastic change of attitude. TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article on Washington's view on the IAEA inspection results by correspondent Nam Chan-sun from Washington. The article reports there are various analyses as to why North Korea had not open the radiochemical laboratory. One of them is that North Korea intended to use the last inspection during the special envoy exchange negotiation or the third-round of talks with the United States to do so. Another is that North Korea really has something to hide. The article says "if the latter is the case, the nuclear negotiation will completely fall into a deadlock which can only be resolved by a dramatic change of North Korea's attitude." The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Is There Any Way To Secure North Korea's Cooperation?" The editorial says it is time that the ROK Government develop more effective measures to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue. Stressing that "the most imperative goal of North Korea at the moment is to maintain its establishment," the editorial says the ROK Government should first decide whether it wants to support or interfere with North Korea's efforts to maintain its establishment in order to develop a strong initiative for the negotiation. SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 an 1,200-word article by correspondent Yi Kyong-hyong from Washington on the U.S. view. Along with an ultimatum for the complete acceptance of nuclear inspections, the article expects that "the United States will exercise various types of pressures including the deployment of Patriot missiles and the mobilization of the aircraft carrier currently conducting sea exercises in the north Pacific." The article states that "the U.S. pressure will still be based on its policy to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue." The article also expects that UN sanctions will not immediately begin with ultra-hard ones but be taken in a phased manner. SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article by reporter Yi Sung-chol on ROK Government's view. The article contends that the government believes that the direction for the resolution of the nuclear issue should be changed now but would still like to wait to see how serious the IAEA was when it said the inspections were "insufficient" and continue with dialogue effort. SEOUL SINMUN also publishes on page 5 an 800-word article by reporter Yu Se-chin on the IAEA view. Noting that the inspection result, which is usually announced two weeks later, was announced only one day after the inspection team returned, the article reports that "this implies the suspicion over military use of nuclear material is very serious." The article also speculates that the IAEA "was prepared" for the negative result. The article says the only choice left for the IAEA is to refer the issue to the UN Security Council after giving North Korea one last chance to unconditionally accept thorough inspections. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Wake Up From Fantasy of North Korea." The editorial says "the broken seals no doubt mean that North Korea used nuclear material for other purposes" and urges both ROK and U.S. Governments to stop mollifying North Korea because "Pyongyang will never come back to shake hands." KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article by reporter Yi Sung-chol reporting that "the moderate Foreign Ministry wants the resumption of Team Spirit exercise to be announced after a final conclusion is reached that the North Korean nuclear issue can no longer be resolved through dialogue while the hard-line National Defense Ministry wants the decision made based on the result of IAEA special 21 March Board of Governors meeting." KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article by correspondent Yi Chong-yon from Washington reporting that hard-line voice is again rising in the United States. The article reports that "diplomatic sources in Washington expect a dramatic change of attitude from North Korea around Kim Il-song's birthday, which falls on 15 April." KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 700-word article on the prospects of the 21 March IAEA Board of Governors special meeting by correspondent Son Tong-u from Bonn. Noting that the two undeclared facilities had not been included in the check list of the recent inspection, the article says that it is clear that the IAEA is conducting the inspection in accordance with "political negotiations" and therefore "the IAEA is not expected to take a decisive countermeasure during the 21 March meeting."
