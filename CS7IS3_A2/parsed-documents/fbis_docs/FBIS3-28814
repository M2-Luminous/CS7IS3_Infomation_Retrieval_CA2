This sets a mood that permits a calm look even at very tense situations. But we did not see even a hint of remarks of this kind at the news conference by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who visited Japan in search of a breakthrough in the framework trade talks. This reminds us of the severe circumstances surrounding the Japanese-U.S. summit scheduled for 11 February. Is there not a clue to solving the dispute? In this respect, we would like to propose that the Japanese-U.S. vice-ministerial talks starting on 7 February in Washington be held in a relaxed atmosphere. We would regret it if the Japanese-U.S. relationship is impaired by bilateral disputes over such issues as the trade in autos and insurance services. To settle the bilateral trade negotiations and ensure that the Washington summit will be successful, it is essential that Japan implement the business stimulus package, including an income tax cut, as soon as possible. A delay in the compilation of the economic package has greatly influenced the trade talks, thus forcing the United States to take a more rigid stand. This is because the U.S. economy is steadily recovering and because the United States has begun to regain its confidence about curbing its fiscal deficits and strengthening the international competitiveness of its enterprises such as its automakers, which is why the United States is adopting a bullish attitude. In fact, the United States may well be on its way to achieving its medium-range targets in the bilateral framework trade talks. Japan, on the other hand, is a far cry from its medium-range target of achieving sustained growth based on domestic demand. In his talks with U.S. President Clinton last November, Prime Minister Hosokawa promised that Japan would effect a business-bolstering package. More than two months have passed since then. We have to doubt that either the prime minister or the ruling coalition parties understand the gravity of the situation. In addition to the business stimulus package, the government must rapidly improve the government procurement system and promote deregulation, both of which the government alone can do on its own responsibility. In his talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa and other important cabinet ministers, Kantor asked Japan to establish numerical targets for individual fields as criteria to measure the openness of the Japanese market. In his news conference, the U.S. trade representative confirmed that the United States reiterated its "results-oriented" stand in the framework trade negotiations and suggested that the United States might impose sanctions on Japan if the talks proved unsuccessful. Both U.S. economists and their Japanese counterparts have expressed objections to the creation of numerical targets. Such targets should not be adopted because such an action threatens to bring about managed trade. Moreover, we do not wish to see the United States threatening the imposition of one-sided sanctions. If the United States tries to take advantage of the change of Japan's government to press Japan and ignores Japan's past efforts in completely liberalizing the import of beef and oranges and increasing government purchases of computers, the result may be to stir up antipathy in Japan against the United States. Calm should not be lost. Japan experienced trade frictions with the United States during the 12 years of the Republican administration of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, but now the atmosphere in Japan among industry and consumers has changed considerably. They have come to understand the need to open markets and to eliminate the price differences between Japan and the rest of the world. As a result, wider private-sector cooperation has been promoted between Japan and the United States. Business enterprises of both Japan and the United States have seen further international expansion, and therefore they can no longer be termed single-nation enterprises. We hope that both countries' negotiators will not ignore this phenomenon.
