ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Under the authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended, the EPA is promulgating air standards that will further reduce organic emissions from hazardous waste management activities. The air standards apply to owners and operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDF) subject to RCRA subtitle C permitting requirements and to certain hazardous waste generators accumulating waste on-site in RCRA permit-exempt tanks and containers. Under these standards, air emission controls must be used for tanks, surface impoundments, and containers in which hazardous waste is placed on or after June 5, 1995 except under certain conditions specified in the rule. Air emission control requirements are also added to the RCRA permit terms and provisions specified for TSDF miscellaneous units. In addition, this action establishes a new EPA reference test method (Method 25E) to determine the organic vapor pressure of a waste. EFFECTIVE DATE: The final rule is effective as of June 5, 1995. The EPA has specified in the final rule a schedule that establishes the compliance dates by which different requirements of the rule must be met. These compliance dates and requirements are explained further under SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION . The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 5, 1995. ADDRESSES: Background information document.
