The outlying districts of Bihac and Cazin are being systematically destroyed -- Gornje Prekounje [words indistinct]. The extent of the damage is enormous. There is also a high number of casualties. Over 2,000 destructive shells have landed on the defenders' lines on the Grmusa-Grabez-[name indistinct] plain. There is hardly a square meter that has not been hit by at least one shell. In addition to this the chetniks are continuously launching combined infantry-artillery attacks on an area on the Grmusa-Crnanjski plain along the Grmusa-Prpici-[name indistinct] line. This hell has been raging on throughout this evening. The fighters of the 5th Corps have been putting up heroic resistance as fierce battles continue. Provocations are also continuing unabated along the demarcation lines with the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomous province. This has been compounded by mortar fire, especially this afternoon.
