His star rose on the political firmament all of a sudden Having received a right to form a provisional commission in charge of studying the activities of the commercial structures attached to the power structures, the 39-year-old state farm director essentially created a political scandal. It led to the resignation of Stanislav Shushkevich, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet. The "trunks" of compromising material he collected on top officials in the government and local Soviets earned him the nationwide recognition as a daredevil fighter against the mafia. Probably both Stanislav Shushkevich and Vyacheslav Kebich wanted to use deputy Lukashenko, unaware of the rules of the game at the top. The "narrow-minded" Lukashenko played his part brilliantly, having eliminated Shushkevich and frightened Kebich. Having won the hearts of thousands of electors, Lukashenko made those "higher-ups" discard their previous skepticism and recognize in him a real and dangerous rival. "But can you imagine someone changing at once from the position of state farm director to that of the president?" complained in the corridor one of the aides to the prime minister. "After all, I spoke to him, persuaded him, offered him a fairly prestigious position. But no, he wants to be the president. It's absurd." From the standpoint of the nomenklatura's hierarchy this is truly unrealistic. A small economic manager from the Shklov District in the Mogilev Region is trying to oppose the prime minister, seen by the apparat as the only worthy candidate to the presidency. Nevertheless Lukashenko has experience in competing with Vyacheslav Kebich, both of them once passed to the second round of elections to the Supreme Soviet. Despite the fact that Kebich had for many years headed the State Economic Planning Committee and had the backing of a powerful party-bureaucratic machine, the absolutely unknown politician "from the plough" ceded a mere 1 percent of the votes. Lukashenko came to the Supreme Soviet as a reformer. He always had a dislike for the party nomenklatura and had frictions with the district authorities, earning the reputation of being "excessively independent." However, he kept the Gorodok state farm afloat, which evidently has given him confidence that he will also be able to run the state. In the framework of his state farm enough room was found for both private peasant farms and cooperatives. Although from time to time some in parliament love to recall how the state farm director used to maintain order -- with his fists. At that time he was active in building the Communists for Democracy faction in opposition to the ruling party nomenklatura. Today Lukashenko dissociates himself from any party or faction whatsoever. He preaches the renunciation of "political mongering", calculatingly targeting the apolitical and most dispossessed sections of the population -- the rural provinces. Alexander Lukashenko speaks on behalf of ordinary, down-trodden and dispossessed people. He is the leader of repulsion and destruction, capable of electrifying the mob. There is hardly a question in the Supreme Soviet on which deputy Lukashenko has not voiced his opinion. As his opponent aptly remarked in parliament, Lukashenko has proved his mettle as an expert on all problems without exception, "from abortion to missiles." Taking a superactive part in debates, Lukashenko has not been noticed for any "passion" for lawmaking. He has neither a political nor an economic program, apart from the nostalgic theory -- "back to the USSR." Lukashenko used to be the most furious opponent of privatization and private property. He is convinced that "state ownership has not exhausted itself today. In the past it created a sufficiently high level for people's life which we have destroyed by throwing these people into a pit." Long before the scandalous struggle against corruption and on the eve of the October events in Moscow, at a joint Russian-Byelorussian meeting of the Officers' Union, one of the Byelorussian colonels sadly stated: "Of course, we have no Rutskois and Terekhovs of our own..." "But we have Lukashenko," a voice was heard from the hall. "Lukashenko, Lukashenko," rolled approvingly over the rows. He is even more successful at meetings with electors in the provinces. He doesn't philosophize, but repeats whatever is being said in overcrowded buses and rural shops where people stand in queues waiting for cheap bread. He plays his own game. Having systematized and classified hundreds of facts, mostly gathered from the materials of the KGB, the Ministry of Interior, the Procurator's Office and the Control Board, Alexander Lukashenko earned a personal political capital already by the fact that he grew indignant together with the people. He has already promised that in the immediate future he will present yet another group or corrupted persons to the people. The government's inaction in this situation has fuelled Lukashenko's activities. The struggle for moral integrity seems to be growing over into a mania. With touching sincerity Alexander Lukashenko announced, speaking live on TV, that there were but a few honest persons in the deputy corps. Already lining up behind the lone Lukashenko's powerful shoulders in parliament are grey cardinals -- young talented pragmatist who have no chances of battling their way through the tightly closed ranks of those presently in power. Moreover, they believe that it is certainly they, not the "uncouth president," that will rule. But Alexander Lukashenko is already declaring: "It is time at last to give them (the minority, the opposition -- L.S.) to understand who is the boss here." Apparat politicians shrug their shoulders. It's absurd if "this" boss comes to power. But don't we have the most fertile ground for absurdity? Or is whatever is permitted for Russia forbidden for Belarus? MN File: Alexander Lukashenko is 45 years old. Upon graduation from the Byelorussian Agricultural Institute he worked as an agronomist at the Shklov District of the Mogilev Region. His wife is the head of a kindergarten. They have two sons. The younger goes to school, and the older is in his first year at the University, studying at the International Department and hoping to become a diplomat. The people's hero is an ascete. His favorite meal is potatoes, milk and hard-boiled eggs. His favourite books are "Ivan the Terrible" and "Stepan Razin."
