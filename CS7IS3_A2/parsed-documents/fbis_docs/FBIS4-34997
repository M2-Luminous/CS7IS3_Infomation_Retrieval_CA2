The surge in prices is seen in commodities such as coffee, the price of which has gone up 66 percent so far this year; wool, up 45 percent; and cotton, a 35 percent increase. As for crude oil, the WTI [expansion unknown] currently is being quoted at more than $20 per barrel rising from $14 in March. Grains have recorded heavy gains. Wheat jumped to the forefront in Chicago, rising 21 percent in the last 12 months. Corn increased 32 percent in the same period, and soybeans were up 18 percent. Argentina's exports stand to benefit from this surge in the value of grains and oil seeds. This year export earnings will be $600 million higher than last year. It also will benefit from the increase in the value of oil, and its exports will total at least $1.25 billion. Notwithstanding this, within an international context characterized by great volatility in quotations, the drop in the value of the U.S. dollar over the last few days leads one to forecast an increase in international interest rates (not only in the United States, but also in Europe) on account of the need for attracting capital and also as a move to defend their respective currencies (the U.S. trade deficit grew 22 percent in April compared with the previous month, amounting to $8.4 billion). The "climax" of the increase in interest rates, also prompted by the inflationary syndrome -- a rise in the value of raw materials and commodities [preceding word in English] -- probably will offset the benefit derived from better export prices. The negative effect for our country would be the incidence of higher international prices on domestic prices, which would adapt to the increase in prices.
