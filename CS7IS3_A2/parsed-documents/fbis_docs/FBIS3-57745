The serious work that has begun in the country will be continued, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said in Davos. Chernomyrdin is in Switzerland to attend the world economic forum that is in progress here. "Russia will not divert from the path on which its has embarked. Russia will not backtrack because market mechanisms have already been created. But these mechanisms need to be filled with substance. I have already said and I will say it again that we will not lead our country to the point of shock... But we will not be able to do without therapy either," the premier said. Among the main tasks of the government in 1994 Chernomyrdin named the continuation of efforts to fight inflation in the country.
