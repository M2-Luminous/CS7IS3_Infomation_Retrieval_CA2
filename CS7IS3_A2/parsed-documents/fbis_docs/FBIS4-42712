"More than three years after the end of the war in that country, which is now isolated and forgotten, tens of thousands of people, including many children, are in a serious condition but receive little health care because of insufficient medicines," wrote Costa in a letter delivered to the U.S. embassy here. "Thousands of people have died or are dying of malnutrition, in epidemics, or as a result of the war," said Costa who added that humanitarian organisations and Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro were amongst those who have pressed him to act to better the lot of suffering Iraqis. According to the health minister "the government there is prepared to pay (for medical supplies) but cannot receive them, or receives them after a long delay, due to the extremely strict controls and major obstacles imposed by the embargo."
