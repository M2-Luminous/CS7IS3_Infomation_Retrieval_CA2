The importance of trademarks in opening up markets and building economic strength requires greater attention from Chinese enterprises. A good trademark can bring huge economic benefits and a bright future for an enterprise. But many firms, especially those large- and medium-sized ones, have not fully realized the importance of registering trademarks as an intellectual property right. Consequently, their sense of protecting their own trademarks is rather weak and some have suffered grave economic losses due to infringement cases. Since the Trademark Law was issued in 1983, China has set up a registration and administration system as a legal guarantee for developing the market economy. Such a legal system is important because, first of all, it directly regulates the performance of market competitors--both manufacturers and sellers. The trade mark system is a basic legal set-up for China's socialist market economy. And as a very important part of the legal system protecting intellectual rights, trademarks cover registrations application, administration, and the protection of property rights. Secondly, it is a necessary guarantee of fair competition for enterprises. Being independent economic bodies and facing an open market, enterprises must seek as much profit as possible to maintain their own interests and win market competition. Big profits can only be achieved with quality goods and services. Thus enterprises need to improve the quality of their products and develop their own markets with credible trademarks. For instance, if an enterprise develops a new product, gives it a trademark, and has it registered it will then have made the necessary preparations for the product to enter the market. Its property rights will then be protected by law in case the trademark is infringed upon by others, whether the violation was intentional or accidental. China is using both administrative and legal functions to maintain fair economic order and encourage product improvements. Thirdly, trademarks are the basis for conducting international economic cooperation and exchanges. The material resources and technologies of a country are limited. A nation can only develop more quickly and meet domestic material demand with aid from international businesses. In today's world economy, intellectual property is rapidly increasing as property rights are becoming critical factors in economic cooperation. Thus, setting up a law for intellectual property rights, like the Trademark Law, has become indispensable. Such a law conforms to the interests of developed and developing nations. This is because, without a law protecting trademark holders, international sales of high-quality products becomes impossible. It is quite clear that no one wants to invest and sell goods in a country which does not protect intellectual rights and leaves loopholes for counterfeits of advanced foreign products. As for domestic enterprises, their initiative for improving product quality will be hurt if their special right for registered trademarks is not well protected by the government and fair competition will not be well established. The Chinese law has promoted the rapid development of its economy and also provided a legal basis for this rapid development. Trademarks, in addition, are a part of the commercial culture. Apart from meeting the legal requirements, a producer has to carefully study whether its trade mark will be accepted by the public. Popular foreign trademarks, such as Coca-Cola, Kodak, and Mercedes Benz symbolize the economy, culture, and political and national spirit of a country. While indicating their countries' economic strength, they also reflect the nation's spiritual pursuit for superb quality and perfection. China's trademark system has basically met the needs of the country's market economic system. However, problems still exist. One is that public awareness about the law is generally low and the quality of administrative workers needs to be upgraded; more efforts are needed to protect the special rights of trademark holders and more importance should be attached to trademark administration in China.
