He made the remark during his speech at the end of the Iranian press festival, where he said the Iranian staff at the embassy could discover the hidden microphones, installed by the British MI-6. "The British Government has launched propaganda moves in order to overshadow the issues," said the president. Britain has accused Iran of collaboration with the Irish Republican Army (IRA), in a bid to prevent a blatant fiasco against the British Government. Details of the president speech will be aired later. The president said the British Government made the accusation of Tehran's collaboration with IRA after Iran charged the British Government with planting a microphone at Iranian Embassy in London to spy on the activities of the embassy staff. "In fact the (British) accusation was made almost immediately after the discovery of the microphone," stressed the president. President Rafsanjani said the British accusations were "white faced lies" and unfounded for which Britain did not provide any evidence. He said the discovery of the microphone could lead to a big scandal for London but the British Government launched a propaganda ballyhoo in coordination with the British press to create a smoke screen and cover up the issue. Hashemi also expressed surprise that all dailies and magazines in Britain, even the ones on the left, began attacking Iran "in unison", a fact that showed the press in Britain was not that independent after all. Elsewhere, the president said imperialism has launched a conspiracy to undermine the people's morale, and force them to believe that they had achieved nothing from the victory of the Islamic revolution. He regretted that a few local press follow the imperialist press, however, he asked the Iranian press to cover both the weak points and strong points. "The press should avoid biased attitudes, and refrain from proposing factional issues, but try to fullfil their duties by taking into account the national interests," said the president. President Rafsanjani said that he had tried to create a free atmosphere for the press, and added that he would never allow a writer to come under pressure because of expressing his or her ideas. "The total press system in Iran have rendered very good services, and I expect them to take a more fair position concerning the issues."
