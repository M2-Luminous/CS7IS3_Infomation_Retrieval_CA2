FR940630-1-00017 FR940630-1-00005 Adequate Tools and Resources_40 CFR Part 51.354 The federal regulation requires the state to demonstrate that adequate funding of the program is available. A portion of the test fee or separately assessed per vehicle fee shall be collected, placed in a dedicated fund and used to finance the program. Alternative funding approaches are acceptable if demonstrated that the funding can be maintained. Reliance on funding from the state or local General Fund is not acceptable unless doing otherwise would be a violation of the state's constitution. The SIP shall include a detailed budget plan which describes the source of funds for personnel, program administration, program enforcement, and purchase of equipment. The SIP shall also detail the number of personnel dedicated to the quality assurance program, data analysis, program administration, enforcement, public education and assistance and other necessary functions. The Pennsylvania State Constitution prohibits monies received from test fees or any other fees received to be deposited in a proprietary account. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PADOT), which implements the I/M program, has no means to fund the I/M program and must rely on future uncommitted annual appropriations from the General Assembly. The federal I/M regulations allow for this funding method if, as in Pennsylvania, doing otherwise would be a violation of the State Constitution. The submittal demonstrates that sufficient funds, equipment and personnel have been appropriated to meet program operation requirements. The SIP indicates that the average per vehicle cost for oversight of the program will be 59 cents per vehicle. Other states are planning to spend roughly $4 per vehicle for oversight of an enhanced I/M program. EPA is concerned that Pennsylvania's level of oversight committed may be too low. However, the federal regulation does not set a prescribed amount to be spent for oversight. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve the current level of funding for program oversight. But, EPA will monitor program implementation closely to ensure that the current level of funding devoted to oversight is sufficient. The Commonwealth's submittal meets the adequate tools and resources requirements set forth in the federal I/M regulations and is approvable. Test Frequency and Convenience_40 CFR Part 51.355 The enhanced I/M performance standard assumes an annual test frequency; however, other schedules may be approved if the performance standard is achieved. The SIP shall describe the test year selection scheme, how the test frequency is integrated into the enforcement process and shall include the legal authority, regulations or contract provisions to implement and enforce the test frequency. The program shall be designed to provide convenient service to the motorist by ensuring short wait times, short driving distances and regular testing hours. The Pennsylvania enhanced I/M regulation provides for a biennial test frequency. The Commonwealth has submitted modeling that demonstrates that the performance standard is met using the biennial test frequency. Act 166 and the Commonwealth's I/M regulation provide the legal authority to implement and enforce the biennial test frequency. The Pennsylvania I/M Request for Proposals (RFP), and the Pennsylvania I/M contractors' proposal (hereafter the contractors' proposal) provide sufficient evidence that convenient services will be provided to the motorist. The Pennsylvania submittal meets the test frequency and convenience requirements of the federal I/M regulations and is approvable. Vehicle Coverage_40 CFR Part 51.356 The performance standard for enhanced I/M programs assumes coverage of all 1968 and later model year light duty vehicles and light duty trucks up to 8,500 pounds GVWR, and includes vehicles operating on all fuel types. Other levels of coverage may be approved if the necessary emission reductions are achieved. Vehicles registered or required to be registered within the I/M program area boundaries and fleets primarily operated within the I/M program area boundaries and belonging to the covered model years and vehicle classes comprise the subject vehicles. Fleets may be officially inspected outside of the normal I/M program test facilities, if such alternatives are approved by the program administration, but shall be subject to the same test requirements using the same quality control standards as non-fleet vehicles and shall be inspected in independent, test-only facilities, according to the requirements of 40 CFR part 51.353(a). Vehicles which are operated on Federal installations located within an I/M program area shall be tested, regardless of whether the vehicles are registered in the state or local I/M area. The federal I/M regulation requires that the SIP shall include the legal authority or rule necessary to implement and enforce the vehicle coverage requirement, a detailed description of the number and types of vehicles to be covered by the program and a plan for how those vehicles are to be identified including vehicles that are routinely operated in the area but may not be registered in the area, and a description of any special exemptions including the percentage and number of vehicles to be impacted by the exemption.
