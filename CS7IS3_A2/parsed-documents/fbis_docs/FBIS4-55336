[Bicakcic] This issue -- establishing the external borders of the federation -- was one of the easier issues, and the Bosniak and Croatian delegations relatively quickly reached an agreement on it. The territory of the federation covers 58 percent of the territory of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the 3 percent of the Sarajevo district territory. On this territory the Bosniaks and the Croats are in the majority, which means that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly's decision that territories with majority Bosniak and Croatian populations should be included in the federation, has been followed to the letter. Apart from the 58 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, the Croatian and the Bosniak delegations also expressed an interest in places that would remain under the Serbian aggressor's occupation where Bosniaks and Croats were in the majority. These are larger cities such as Bosanski Petrovac, Bosanska Gradiska, Bosanska Dubica, Bijeljina, Janja, and [word indistinct], which cannot be covered by the federation territory, but -- in future negotiations, when they take place -- we will try to obtain from the Serbian aggressor the protection of human rights for the population in these areas.
