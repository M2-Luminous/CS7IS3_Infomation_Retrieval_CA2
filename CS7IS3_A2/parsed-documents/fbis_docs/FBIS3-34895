The French foreign minister would like the Israeli Government and the PLO to keep to the schedule of the agreement signed in Washington on 13 September of last year. Otherwise, Juppe said, the supporters of war may have the last word: [Begin Juppe recording] A failure would be a tragedy; everyone agrees about that. Everything must be done in order to have every chance of succeeding. I have already said that time does not work for those who want peace; it works for those against it. We believe that the announced schedule must be kept to as much as possible. I hope that a global agreement on Palestinian autonomy and its implementation will be reached in the near future. I believe that the global atmosphere must be changed, that measures of detente and trust must be developed. This is why, when I went to Gaza, I advocated the freezing of settlements in the occupied territories, as well as the imminent release and rehabilitation of prisoners. I would like to add, however, that I also understand Israel's concern after the historic leap that was made last September. I understand the concern of the people for their security. [end recording] That was Alain Juppe speaking in Jerusalem last night during his news conference recorded by Pierre Weill.
