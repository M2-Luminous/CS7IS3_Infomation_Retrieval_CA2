Yu Yongbo said that the current National Propaganda and Ideological Work Conference is an important meeting of overall significance held by the CPC Central Committee at the crucial period when China is establishing a socialist market economic system and carrying out the socialist modernization program. It is the concrete embodiment of Deng Xiaoping's principle of doing two kinds of work simultaneously and attaching importance to both. It fully reflects the complete and accurate understanding and mastery of the party's basic line by the third generation of collective leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. The implementation of the spirit of the conference will be of great significance to strengthening and improving propaganda and ideological work in the new situation and strengthening the building of socialist spiritual civilization and also be of far-reaching influence on China's reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization program. Yu Yongbo pointed out: In light of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the 14th party congress, and in view of the new problems and circumstances facing reform and opening up, particularly the establishment of a socialist market economic system, General Secretary Jiang Zemin, in his report delivered at the conference, made comprehensive and profound expositions on the principles, fundamental tasks, and guiding ideology for propaganda and ideological work, which illuminated the direction for doing well propaganda and ideological work at present and for a period in the future and served as the ground for strengthening and improving Army ideological and political work. The party committees and political organs at all levels must earnestly study, understand, and resolutely implement them. In practical work, we must also implement the guiding important speeches made by Comrades Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Ding Guangen. To implement General Secretary Jiang Zemin's report and the spirit of the current National Propaganda and Ideological Work Conference, Yu Yongbo emphasized, the most fundamental and important task is to pay attention to the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The primary task of the whole Army's political work this year is to study well Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. At the crucial period of reform, opening up, and establishing a socialist market economic system, the study of Deng's works is required for the Army to toe the CPC Central Committee's line ideologically, politically, and in action as well as to establish a powerful spiritual mainstay in the Army and fundamentally enhance unity and increase combat effectiveness. In accordance with the requirement of the Central Military Commission and the General Political Department, we stepped up the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping at the previous stage and launched a new drive of study throughout the Army. It was indeed a good beginning. Through the implementation of the spirit of the National Propaganda and Ideological Work Conference, we should further increase our understanding of the importance of applying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the mind of officers and men of the whole Army, and make the activities of studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping more profound, solid, and fruitful. In the new situation, Yu Yongbo pointed out, it is the great historical responsibility of the comrades engaged in political work, particularly those engaged in propaganda work, to follow General Secretary Jiang's instructions, arm people with scientific theories, guide them with correct opinion, mold them with lofty spirit, and encourage them with outstanding works. Yu Yongbo made a three-point requirements for cadres of the whole Army engaged in propaganda work: First, step up self-study, which should be currently focused on studying well Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Second, cadres engaged in propaganda work should be good at making thorough investigation and study. Third, take an active part in central work and expand the sphere of education work. At the conference, Xu Caihou, deputy director of the General Political Department, made specific proposals on studying General Secretary Jiang's important speech: First, realize the historical responsibility of propaganda and ideological work from a high plane of the times and overall situation, brace up, and attain better achievements. Second, keep a firm grip of the fundamental principle of propaganda and ideological work and make strenuous efforts to implement the fundamental task of propaganda and ideological work. Third, carry out propaganda and ideological work closely around the Army's central task and offer ideological guarantee and spiritual motivation to the modernization program. Fourth, enhance political firmness and awareness and have a firm grasp of the correct ideological guidance for the media. Fifth, focus attention on training "people with lofty ideals, moral integrity, better education, and a sense of discipline" and further strengthen ideological and political work. Sixth, strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological work and build up a contingent of propagandists who are political aware, professionally proficient, and honest and upright in their ways. The current All-Army Conference of Propaganda Chiefs is a part of the National Propaganda and Ideological Work. We have listened to the important reports at the conference, held serious discussions in connection with the Army's reality, further realized our mission, and enhanced our confidence. Directors of the political departments under the major units of the troops garrisoned in Beijing were present at today's conference.
