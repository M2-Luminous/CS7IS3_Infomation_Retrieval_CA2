Consistently advocating the creation of a common economic zone, the governments believe that the implementation of agreements reached within the framework of the CIS -- providing for the strengthening of direct ties between economic entities on the basis of the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor as well as coordinated financial, monetary- credit, price, convertible currency, and customs policies -- can be accelerated by expanding bilateral cooperation. The Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation have similar economic systems, common borders, and historically similar national fates. Reflecting the drive for economic integration voiced by the citizens of their states, the governments have taken a number of measures aimed at further expanding this cooperation without damaging national sovereignty. The implementation of the agreement on unifying the monetary systems of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation will become the decisive factor for strengthening economic ties between Belarus and Russia. The agreement stipulates conducting coordinated monetary-credit, budget, convertible currency, taxation, and social policies, as well as the creation of a common customs zone with a common system of prices. The leaders of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus point out that coordinated measures were carried out between September and December 1993, in accordance with the agreement on the unification of the monetary systems, and it was concluded that these systems have been brought to a high state of readiness. The leaders of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus declare that preparations for the final unification of the monetary systems has been completed. The governments have charged appropriate ministries and departments with drafting agreements determining the mechanism for the functioning of the Belarusian monetary system after the unification of the systems, as well as a common mechanism for managing the budgets of the two states and documents determining foreign economic, trade, and customs policies. Technical aspects necessary for the functioning of the unified system should also be discussed, so as to sign the documents on forming a bilateral economic union within the framework of the CIS in Minsk in January 1994. The Governments of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation believe that the unification of the two states' monetary systems will serve the cause of safeguarding the two nations' economic progress and improving mechanisms for cooperation within the framework of the CIS.
