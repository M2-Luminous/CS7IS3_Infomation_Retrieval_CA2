Chaisit said police had photographs of the two suspects, but he did not identify them as Thais or foreigners. He said information gathered by police was the same as that received by the National Intelligence Agency. Police discovered a truck wired with explosives in Bangkok last month. They speculated it was destined for the Israeli Embassy in Soi Langsuan before it was involved in a minor traffic accident. Witnesses said the truck driver, who later fled, was of Middle Eastern appearance. Chaisit said he could not say whether the bomb had anything to do with international politics. "I can say only that police already know who the culprits are and their intention. The suspects may still be in Bangkok," he said. Police would discuss with the Interior Ministry whether arrest warrants should be issued.
