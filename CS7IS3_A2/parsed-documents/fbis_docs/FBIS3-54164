PLO relations with Riyadh and with the other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] deteriorated as a result of the PLO's support for Iraq's attack on Kuwait and its occupation of Kuwait; and this has had a detrimental impact on the PLO. The GCC member states stopped their financial assistance to the PLO because of its stance in the oil war. Some 600,000 Palestinians living in the Persian Gulf shaykhdoms were placed under severe pressure and about half of them had to return to Jordan. The voluntary tax, based on an agreement among the countries in the Arab League and levied on the Palestinians and deposited in the PLO's bank account, has been blocked. PLO officials allege that all these problems have led to a financial crisis for the PLO. Six months ago the PLO started warning of a financial crisis and stopped paying benefits to the families of Palestinian martyrs and the salaries of part of its military forces in Lebanon. According to a PLO-Saudi Arabian agreement, during his visit to Riyadh 'Arafat will meet Saudi King Fahd. This meeting will probably be the prologue to an improvement in Saudi-PLO relations. Since 'Arafat approached Israel and the United States four months ago with the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord, PLO relations with GCC members have started to improve gradually and PLO embassies have been set up in all the GCC member states except Kuwait. 'Arafat's current trip to Riyadh will probably pave the way for similar visits to other GCC member states.
