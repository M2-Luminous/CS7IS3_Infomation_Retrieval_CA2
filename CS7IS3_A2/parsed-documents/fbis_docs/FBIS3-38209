Defense circles emphasize that this was the first trilateral meeting of its kind. They say this meeting has shown that France wishes to move closer to military integration with NATO. Britain, on the other hand, seems to have changed its course in the Partnership for Peace policy. Of all the NATO members, London to date had voiced the strongest reservations against NATO's opening toward East Europe. During the "informal meeting," Britain's Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind and his French and German counterparts, Francois Leotard and Volker Ruehe, discussed ways of strengthening European defense through the WEU, the defense arm of the European Union. In this connection, the defense ministers mainly discussed the Combined Joint Task Force. A resolution adopted at the latest NATO summit provides for this force to be positioned in Europe and its commando units to be such that they can be taken out of NATO structures. Ruehe pointed out that no structures running parallel to NATO must develop in this connection. British reports say that Germany was also asked about its undecided approach to missions abroad. A decision on Bonn's future role in this is particularly important because it is linked with the part Germany plays in the task force, its stationing, and the distribution of posts. Ruehe stressed that German participation has to be envisaged. He said it is impossible not to include Germany in the task forces. Observers think that the reason Britain is stepping up involvement in the WEU has something to do with its fear of a German-French axis in Europe. France's Leotard, on the other hand, sees the linking of WEU and NATO structures as an opportunity to move his country closer to military integration with the alliance. France seems to have come to the conclusion that WEU structures can only be strengthened in cooperation with NATO. The ministers also discussed the Partnership for Peace program, which provides for NATO's cautious opening toward the East European states. Britain, the fiercest opponent of the program prior to the NATO summit, seems to be embarking on a different course now, not least because the United States has clearly expressed its determination to include East Europe. Ruehe will discuss this issue with his Polish counterpart Piotr Kolodziejczyk today.
