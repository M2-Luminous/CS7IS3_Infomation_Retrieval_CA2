FBIS4-30023 "dreas121_m_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-121 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 Thailand Vaccine Tests Slated for Discontinuation Vaccine Tests Slated for Discontinuation BK2306095194 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 23 Jun 94 p 6 BK2306095194 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] Thailand's first HIV/AIDS vaccine tests are expected to be discontinued after it has been found they violate the HIV/AIDS National Vaccine Development Plan. The Thai Red Cross Society's AIDS programme director, Praphan Phanuphak, earlier this month injected 30 volunteers with an initial dose of the candidate vaccine, GP 120, to test its safety. A senior official with the National AIDS Prevention and Control Committee said yesterday the AIDS programme had not followed the National Vaccine Development Plan's guidelines which state that any institution testing vaccines should be equipped with laboratories. The results of the candidate vaccine on the volunteers are not tested by Dr Praphan. They are sent to the vaccine producer, United Biomedical Incorporation of the United States, for testing. A member of the World Health Organisation (WHO) steering committee on AIDS vaccine development, Nat Phamonprawat, said Thai researchers should carry out any vaccine tests even if the vaccine is obtained from abroad. He said Thai researchers should head the tests and any foreign researchers should only act as advisers. Dr Nat said Thailand should set up laboratories to test vaccines so it can obtain maximum information about the results. The Public Health Ministry's AIDS Division director, Wiphut Phuncharoen said it was unacceptable for the blood of volunteers to be sent to the United States for testing. "How can we be sure the manufacturing firm is not biased towards its own product?" he asked. Mr Wiphut said it was the responsibility of the National AIDS Prevention and Control Committee's Data Safety Monitoring Board to look into locally conducted HIV/AIDS vaccine tests. The committee chaired by Dr Prasoet Thongcharoen of Mahidon University now cannot function officially because Public Health Minister Athit Urairat has not approved the committee's appointment. Dr Athit, the chairman of the Sub-Committee on National AIDS Prevention and Control, cannot sign the appointment because he is in hospital. The deputy chairman of the House Committee on Public Health, Wichai Chaichitwanitchakun of the New Aspiration Party, warned Dr Praphan to stop the tests of the HIV/AIDS vaccine following reports from the US that six of 300 volunteers being tested there have become infected with the deadly disease. But Dr Wiphut of the AIDS Division said the consent forms signed by volunteers injected with the vaccine in the US clearly states the volunteers were not infected with the virus due to the vaccine. Dr Wichai said the Red Cross Society should be responsible for the volunteers' health for three to five years after the tests, not simply for the nine months while the tests are being conducted, as side effects may develop later. He said he would also propose to Parliament that it issue a law providing up to two million baht in social security benefits for medical staff working with AIDS patients. The Red Cross's Dr Praphan was unavailable for comment yesterday.
