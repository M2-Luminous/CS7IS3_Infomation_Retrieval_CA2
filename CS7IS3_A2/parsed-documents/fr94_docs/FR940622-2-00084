FR940622-2-00084 FR940622-2-00063 [Docket No. 50&hyph;397] Washington Public Power Supply System Nuclear Project No. 2 (WNP&hyph;2); Exemption I Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;21 which authorizes operation of the WNP&hyph;2 Nuclear Plant at steady-state reactor power levels not in excess of 3323 megawatts thermal. The WNP&hyph;2 facility is a boiling water reactor located on Hanford Reservation in Benton County near Richland, Washington. The license provides, among other things, that it is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. II Paragraph III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 requires, in part, that ``Type C tests shall be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than two years.'' By letter dated April 29, 1987, the staff issued an exemption from the requirement for Type C testing during each reactor refueling shutdown, and an extension of the maximum interval from 24 months to 27 months for Type B and C testing. This exemption specifically excluded Containment Purge Supply and Exhaust Valves, which the staff required to continue to be tested at the existing 6-month interval. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), the NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations (1) which are authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) where special circumstances at present. III By letter dated March 25, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50 Appendix J to allow Type C testing of Containment Purge Supply and Exhaust Valves with metal-to-metal seats at 27-month intervals. The licensee plans to replace approximately half of the valves during the 1994 refueling outage, and the remainder at a future date. No change to the 6-month test interval is requested for the remaining Containment Purge Supply and Exhaust Valves that have resilient seats. In a letter dated December 20, 1993, regarding an associated technical specification change request, the licensee stated that the new valves have been proven by industry experience and design to be capable of maintaining design requirements for leakage over an extended period of time. The licensee indicated that the replacement valves will be required to meet even tighter permissible leakage limits. Extending the maximum allowable interval between tests to 27 months is requested to allow for variations in the weather-related length of the approximately annual operating cycle from year to year. Details concerning the justification for extending the Type C test interval from 24 to 27 months are contained in the staff's letter granting the exemption dated April 29, 1987. IV Accordingly, the Commission concluded that the licensee's proposed test schedule for the metal-to-metal seated Containment Purge Supply and Exhaust Valves is acceptable, and can be tested at a 27-month maximum interval. The remaining valves with resilient seats will continue to be tested every 6 months. The special circumstances for granting this exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12 have also been identified. As stated in part 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), special circumstances are present when applicable of the regulation in the particular circumstance is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. Application of the resilient-seated valve leak test requirements to metallic-seated valves would increase surveillance and maintenance costs for no increased safety benefit. The vendor certifies that appropriate leakage criteria are met, as applicable. The licensee states that the valve design, specifications, and qualification documentation for these valves verify that Type C leakage testing intervals are appropriate. The special circumstance of 10 CFR 50.12(as)(2)(ii) for extending the Type C leakage test interval from 24 months to 27 months is as described in the staff's letter granting the exemption dated April 29, 1987. Consequently, the Commission concludes that the special circumstances of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) exist in that application of the regulation in these particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. V Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, this exemption as described in Section III. above is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security. The Commission further determines that special circumstances as provided in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) are present justifying the exemption. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants an exemption from the requirement for Type C testing during each reactor refueling shutdown, with an extension of the maximum interval from 24 months to 27 months for Type C testing, as described in Section III. above. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant impact on the environment (59 FR 27075). Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 15th day of June 1994. This exemption is effective upon issuance. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Elinor G. Adensam, Acting Director, Division of Reactor Projects_III/IV, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15132 Filed 6&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
