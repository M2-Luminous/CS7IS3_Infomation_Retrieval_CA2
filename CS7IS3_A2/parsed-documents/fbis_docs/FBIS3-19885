[Visentini] No. It is against the threat of the Right, but first and foremost in favor of the possibility that civilized--bourgeois, if you like--culture can make its essential contribution to this country's emancipation... [Riva] Actually, both [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi and [Northern League Secretary Umberto] Bossi now portray themselves as the champions of liberal-democratic culture. [Visentini] The vision of politics that they display conflicts with all the teachings of liberal and democratic culture. Do you remember what [German philosopher] Max Weber wrote? According to his vision, the politician must base his actions on two kinds of ethics--of conviction and responsibility. In other words, he must always be able to adjust his means to the end. Consider the spectacle provided by the acrobats of the so-called pole of freedoms: They promise the moon -- a million new jobs, tax cuts, increased pensions, prosperity for all -- but without explaining how and by what means. They have reduced the election campaign to something like a circus or a Brazilian soap opera. It is a distressing and frightening spectacle that degrades politics and insults Italian society. [Riva] So let us come to the constructive part of your candidacy: In whom and in what should Italian society believe? [Visentini] First, it must start by squarely confronting the real nature of its problems and realize that it is a sick society, because the high level of unemployment we have now is the symptom of a serious illness that could undermine the bases of civilized coexistence. [Riva] But this phenomenon is not confined to Italy. Unfortunately, unemployment is a major problem in the rest of Europe, too. [Visentini] Yes, but elsewhere they are trying to approach the problem in earnest. In our country we are witnessing a very paradoxical process: While the Left has ceased to regard unemployment as the effect of a historical crisis of the capitalist system, the Right speaks and acts as though it is capitalism that is to blame and is not suggesting suitable treatments but confining itself to demanding more power in order to defend itself... [Riva] But if the blame does not lie with the capitalist system, whose fault is it? [Visentini] It is rather like it was in the twenties. At that time the recession and unemployment were the result of excesses in the deflationary policy. Do you remember Keynes' The Economic Results of Sir Winston Churchill? Something similar could be written now in connection with certain restrictive strategies pursued by some Western governments in the past decade. In Italy the crisis stems -- as well as from other factors such as the backwardness of our public structures, the weakness of our industrial and financial system, and certain social rigidities -- also from the state's excessive and disproportionate debt and from the constant stopgap measures every six months which have acted as a curb, instead of a comprehensive reform to open the way to development. [Riva] If I understand you correctly, the solution is a rather more expansive economic policy. [Visentini] Precisely. [Riva] But this is what the Right says -- Berlusconi, for instance. [Visentini] Oh, no, there is a big difference. They are promising to eliminate public intervention in the economy, whereas what I am saying is that the targets of this intervention must change. For instance, they are proposing a single income tax rate, which would ultimately give more to the rich and take more from the poor. I believe, on the contrary, that the path to economic growth must be taken above all in order to improve the situation of those with the lowest wages. The development and expansion of our economy and our GDP must not favor the most prosperous sectors but must create or increase the incomes of the sectors currently excluded or barely subsisting. This necessity was stated in a very perceptive article in THE WASHINGTON POST a few days ago. [Riva] So are you more sensitive to the factor of social equity? [Visentini] It is less a matter of equity and more a matter of considerations intrinsic to economic development. Old Ford understood that the expansion of his business depended not so much on purchases by wealthy people as on the opportunity for his own workers to buy the cars that they produced. This rule is all the more applicable today. By helping those earning the lowest incomes, who are most numerous in society, you create a new demand that can set in motion a circle between production and employment, thus also reducing overall savings, which are now invested idly in government stock. [Riva] I understand that, but would a rather more expansive policy not have major repercussions on inflation and public finances, which are already in a precarious state? [Visentini] Assuming that inflation at acceptable levels is always better than recession, I would like to make it clear that the public finance situation would derive substantial advantages from a growth directed toward improving the situation of those earning the lowest wages. Let us consider health, for instance. As long as there are a lot of poor people, public finances will be burdened by expenditure on health care. By the same token, if the proportion of prosperous people is increased, so too will the number of those able to provide for themselves without burdening the state. [Riva] Professor, I feel like I am talking to a combination of Keynes and Robin Hood. [Visentini] This is no joking matter. In fact it is a matter of pursuing social equity as a means of achieving economic recovery and the recovery of the public finance situation. This country's troubles stem from the excessive rigidity of the social scale. The concentration of wealth produces neither growth nor development, and in fact weakens the very cohesion of the system. If we want to avert even worse troubles, we must increase social mobility, that is, make society as a whole more efficient. [Riva] Now perhaps I begin to understand why part of the middle class felt rather afraid when they heard you were standing as a candidate of the Left: You are outlining a political plan that challenges many social privileges and established positions. [Visentini] The nice thing about capitalism, Galbraith once wrote, is that in its evolution something always happens whereby fools and their money are always separated. This is a rather paradoxical joke, but it does make one essential point. In Italy Galbraith's law has prevailed too infrequently. Therefore, we live in a paralyzed society that has absorbed the lack of mobility between classes and placed the burden on the state budget. This is the exact opposite of what is required to ensure the vitality of a capitalist system. Therefore, it is crazy -- as well as anticapitalist -- to believe that it is possible to resolve this impasse by stubbornly defending established positions. This path leads only to economic disaster, uncontrollable social tensions, and a real crisis of the capitalist system. [Riva] When Roosevelt became U.S. President, his adversaries called him "that Bolshevik at the White House." If the Left is victorious, is that what they will say about Bruno Visentini? [Visentini] I do not know, and I do not much care. But I would like to remind reluctant and hesitant members of the bourgeoisie that "that Bolshevik" revived American society, boosted its economy, consolidated democracy, and salvaged capitalism.
