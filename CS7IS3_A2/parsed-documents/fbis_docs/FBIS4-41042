The members of the Agrarian Party and specialists who had promised during the election campaign to modify the law on the functioning of languages have kept the word given by parliament. Unlike the members of the Moldavian People's Front, who try to exploit this law to carry out ethnic cleansing, the new authorities have abolished the Moldavian-language proficiency exam for those already working. As all business correspondence and technical documentation is already translated into the state language, knowledge of it remains a sine qua non. But no one is going to be dismissed for paucity of vocabulary. Parliament has ordered the government to draw up a new Moldavian-language instruction program, recognizing that the previous ones were extremely complicated. The range of people to be tested will also be specified, but this will be done regardless of the categories of specialists who fall within it. The examination will be mandatory for the Dniester Region and the southern regions, where there is a high density of Russians, Ukrainians, Gagauz, and Bulgarians, only when people are being recruited for jobs and contracts extended. This has been stipulated by a special amendment to the Law on the Functioning of Languages since the determination of the special status of these two regions.
