The word activation is a loose enough term. It might mean just going through the motions, or might, on the other hand, imply a more significant and far-reaching action. Activation can be either the mere formality of calling the negotiators back to the conference table or a meaningful and purposeful exercise. We do not think the U.S. secretary, who is known for his seriousness, would take the trouble to come to the region just for the formal activation of the negotiating tracks that have been suspended in Washington--that is, the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks--or for the sake of securing a new round of negotiations that will be added to the previous rounds, as far as achieving limited results. We believe the activation required in the peace process and on which Secretary Christopher will focus during his tour very much depends on how this U.S. effort tells us what the term honest and unbiased partner means. We realize Israel does not want the United States to be a partner or an unbiased and honest broker. Israel wants the United States to be biased toward all its stands. Despite the fact that more than two years have passed since the Madrid conference, these have prevented the achievement of the aspired peace. We, as Arabs, continue to wait for the United States to translate its role as an honest and unbiased partner in the peace negotiations into pressure on more than just the Arab side alone--pressure that sometimes has reached the point of cheapness, as happened in the drug list issue--and also pressure the Israeli side. Indeed, the Israeli side was encouraged by the continuous U.S. and Western support of its aggression, occupation of the Arab territories, and disavowal of Arab people's rights to continue its intransigence and refuse to comply with the bases of the peace process. Without these bases, it is hard to imagine the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in this region. Syria has always welcomed and encouraged effective U.S. efforts to push the issue of a just and comprehensive peace in the region forward. Syria continues to pin hopes on an honest and unbiased U.S. role, based on its conviction that there is no room, in any way, to depend on Israeli intentions to achieve this peace. The obstacles placed by Israel for more than two years of negotiations have shown the accuracy and soundness of Syria's position that Israel is not serious about peace, which should be comprehensive and just in order for it last. What Israeli officials are announcing these days in terms of preconditions and rejection of full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, as stipulated by UN resolutions, reinforces the conviction that the Israeli stand shows no signs of hope concerning the future of the negotiations. Therefore, the way to achieve an actual and meaningful activation of the peace process depends, as we said earlier, on the U.S. secretary bringing something new with him. We do not think we are exaggerating when we say a priority task for the first sponsor of the peace process is to use its influence on the obstructive Israeli side in order to reinforce the chances for achieving a just and comprehensive peace.
