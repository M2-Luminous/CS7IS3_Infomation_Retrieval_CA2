Germany and the European Union (EU) urgently need to take initiatives to expand information highways for multimedia applications of the future so as not to fall behind America and Japan in the competition. This was the conclusion of a conference among high-level representatives of business and science which was called by Federal Research Minister Paul Krueger. Information highways refer to rapid, high-volume transmission networks which include such applications as video conferences, the individual ordering of movies or news, home shopping, or the exchange of data among computers for scientific and business purposes. Krueger, Heinrich von Pierer (the chairman of Siemens AG), and Mark Woessner (the chairman of Bertelsmann AG) emphasized that Germany has good technical prerequisites for the multimedia services of the future. The network infrastructure is very good, Krueger said. Based on a study which his ministry contracted, however, Krueger pointed out infrastructure shortcomings which hamper innovations. There are gaps in the technical and organizational integration of the systems, in the development of specific software, and in the availability of services which do not utilize all the existing possibilities, he said. Krueger and von Pierer said that fees in Germany are too high in comparison with international norms. The Siemens head questioned whether the postal reform will change this situation. According to the study, the level of tariffs for leased services was three to seven times higher than in other industrialized nations. Deutsche Telekom contested this finding. Krueger specifically supported the demand by Professor Eberhard Witte (University of Munich) and the industrialists that more competition and deregulation was needed in the telecommunications infrastructure. Only then will one obtain an extensive array of services, low prices, rising investments, and new jobs in the telecommunications sector, they said. In the conversations, concern was expressed that delays would arise which would be difficult to overcome if the Telekom's network monopoly were not be eliminated until 1998, as is currently planned. Krueger said that one must reconsider this situation in connection with the postal reform. Krueger, a CDU member, also pointed out that the agreement of the SPD would be needed for the reform project. During the conversations, Krueger was urged to take an initiative in the field of data highways during the German chairmanship of the European Union (EU) in the second half of 1994. He agreed to do so. Von Pierer said that something concrete must be done in this area as soon as possible on both the German and EU level. As a first step, progress must be made in standardization on the European level. Moreover, there should be specific pilot projects. Thus the planned data highways between Bonn and Berlin should be rapidly tackled, Von Pierer said. To open up the multimedia services, a change in the broadcasting law is necessary, said Woessner. The previous concept of broadcasting does not fit the new applications. When the broadcasters' state contract is amended, one must drop the previous limit, according to which a company may not own more than 49 percent of the shares of a broadcaster, said Woessner. Those participating in the conversation stressed that the large number of future television channels, which is controversial with the public, is only one of the new applications.
