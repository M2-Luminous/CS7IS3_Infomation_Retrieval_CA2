These subunits were brought up to strength mainly by means of enlisting reservists and volunteers. The structure of the Ministry of Defense Military Police does not correspond to contemporary needs. Military Police subunits are carrying out the same activities as the law enforcement bodies. In order to create a unified system of commanding and controlling single armed forces, organize effective control over the activities of troops, and form and strengthen the principles of unity of command, I order: 1. Republic of Georgia Ministry of Defense individual military units and subunits, in addition to fulfilling functions prescribed in accordance with the organizational and authorized structure of the Armed Forces, to be incorporated into the motor rifle brigades. 2. The Military Police Directorate existing in the Republic of Georgia Ministry of Defense system to be abolished and those subunits subordinate to it to be disbanded. The personnel making up these subunits and their combat weapons and equipment to be used in order to bring up to strength other army combined units, units, and military commandant's offices at military garrisons. 3. It to be pointed out that Military Police personnel fulfilled an important role in carrying out the orders of the commander in chief and the Ministry of Defense and in fighting for Georgia's state interests for which I express my gratitude to all officers and combat soldiers. 4. Town and rayon [administrative] heads to be entrusted with resolving the question of finding employment for those serving in the Military Police who do not wish to continue to serve in the Republic of Georgia Armed Forces. They are to report the execution of this order directly to me. 5. Military garrisons and commandant's offices to be created in all towns and rayons where military combined units and units are based; they are to be entrusted with establishing strict military discipline and order among military servicemen. 6. Armed groups and formations located on the republic's territory that do not form part of the Armed Forces to be disbanded and their personnel, weapons, combat equipment, and military property to be used in order to bring up to strength the motorized rifle brigades . 7. The heads of the Republic of Georgia Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the State Security Service to be entrusted with implementing those measures stipulated in the order.
