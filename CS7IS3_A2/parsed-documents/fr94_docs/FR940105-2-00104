FR940105-2-00104 FR940105-2-00050 The Licensee concludes by requesting that the NRC exercise its discretion to reduce the civil penalty associated with the violations in Section I of the Notice. NRC Evaluation of the Licensee Response to Violations in Section I While the NRC agrees that the doses to members of the general public resulting from the loss of the source were small, the source was, nonetheless, missing for a period of time in excess of twenty-three hours. During that time, the source was in the hallway outside the patient's room for at least seventeen hours, in a basement laundry closet and in a laundry service truck for at least an hour each, and on the floor of the laundry facility or in the laundry washing machine for at least four and one half hours. None of these locations was controlled by the Licensee for the purposes of radiation protection. Therefore, since the radiation levels were in excess of applicable levels for unrestricted areas for periods of hours, this created a significant potential for an exposure in excess of regulatory limits to personnel or members of the public, and the NRC maintains that this is a significant lack of control of licensed material. As noted in Section C.1 of Supplement VI of the Enforcement Policy, violations involving a failure to control access to licensed materials for radiation purposes (as specified in the NRC requirements) constitute Severity Level III violations. Therefore, Violation I.B could have been individually classified at Severity Level III. However, the NRC chose to aggregate the Licensee's violation in failing to control licensed material with its root cause (failure to survey_Violation I.A) as well as the effect of the violation (the creation of radiation levels in excess of that allowed in NRC regulations_Violation I.C) since the three violations were all related to the one incident. In view of the above, the assertion that Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C were classified in the aggregate at Severity Level III because they represent a programmatic breakdown is incorrect. In addition, the Licensee's contention regarding corrective action, involving the prompt location and recovery of the source are not controlling in determining the severity level of the violation. The severity level is determined by the safety or regulatory significance of the violation. The Licensee's request for mitigation of the civil penalty is discussed below. In conclusion, the violations were properly classified in the aggregate as a Severity Level III problem. Restatement of Violations_Section II II.A. 10 CFR 35.32(a) requires, in part, that each licensee shall establish and maintain a written quality management program to provide high confidence that byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material will be administered as directed by the authorized user. Pursuant to 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4), the quality management program must include written policies and procedures to meet the objective that each administration is in accordance with the written directive. Contrary to the above, as of November 30, 1992, the licensee's quality management program did not include written policies and procedures to meet the objective that each administration was in accordance with the written directive. In particular, the licensee did not establish written procedures to identify if a brachytherapy source was not properly implanted or inadequately secured against accidental removal. As a result, on November 30, 1992, during a therapy procedure that involved a gynecological implant of four cesium-137 sources, one source was either not implanted as required or it was implanted properly but inadequately secured because the source came out of the applicator and lay undetected in the patient's bed. As a result, the dose administered to the patient was less than that prescribed by the physician and the patient received a radiation dose to the leg, an area not intended to receive radiation. B. 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4) requires, in part, that each licensee shall establish and maintain a written quality management program to provide high confidence that byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material will be administered as directed by the authorized user. The quality management program must include written policies and procedures to meet the specific objective that each administration is in accordance with the written directive. On January 27, 1992, the licensee implemented a quality management program for the use of byproduct material. Section 3 of the quality management program entitled ``Policies and Procedures for Brachytherapy'', paragraph 3.1.3 of the ``High Dose Rate Remote Afterloading Devices'', requires, in part, that the treatment site be confirmed with the written directive and treatment plan by the administering person before administration of the treatment dose.
