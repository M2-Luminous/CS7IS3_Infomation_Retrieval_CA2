At a meeting of the party's central executive committee, SDP leaders agreed to leave the seven-party coalition if Hosokawa refuses to reconsider the 7 percent rate of the "welfare tax" and the timing of implementing it. At a predawn news conference, Hosokawa said that the government wants to introduce the tax from April 1, 1997 in place of the current 3 percent consumption tax to offset revenue shortfalls stemming from a 6 trillion yen tax cut. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama accused Hosokawa at a separate news conference of waging a disinformation campaign in order to implement a virtual raise in the rate of the consumption tax. Murayama said it would be very difficult for the SDP to continue cooperating in the coalition government. The possible defection of the SDP, the largest group in the seven-party coalition, would bring Hosokawa's government to its greatest crisis since it was inaugurated last August after toppling the 38-year-old rule by the Liberal Democratic Party.
