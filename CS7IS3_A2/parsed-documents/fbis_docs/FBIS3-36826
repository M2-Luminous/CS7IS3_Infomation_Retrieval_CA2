DPRK's senior representative at the IAEA made public a statement to this effect. Although a statement of this nature is made adding to the skeptic atmosphere for the solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, there are also statements which add to an optimistic mood for it, says station commentator (Aleksey Kondrachev). For instance, in his verbal message to U.S. President Bill Clinton, DPRK President Kim Il-song noted that the DPRK does not intend to develop nuclear weapons. However, the world community cannot dispel suspicion of Pyongyang's nuclear program. The suspicion of the nuclear program remains unresolved because the North does not permit international inspection of its nuclear sites. Although the DPRK is holding talks with the IAEA, the talks are falling into a stalemate again. The talks are coming to a blind alley which could bring a disadvantageous result to Pyongyang, because in 12 days the IAEA is supposed to disclose a report on the result of its talks with the DPRK. If no progress is made in the talks, the United Nations could take sanctions on the DPRK. The delegates of some countries, including Russia, think that the countries should not put enormous pressure on Pyongyang, thus driving it into a corner. The economic and political sanctions will not be able to change the Pyongyang position easily. If sanctions are taken, followed by such steps as (?economic embargo), it could further stiffen the DPRK stance on the nuclear issue. Suggestion is, therefore, made that dialogue be carried on between the DPRK and the United States, between the DPRK and the IAEA, and between the North and the South. This is the best way, as noted by delegates from many countries. The ROK president also called for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The issue of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula should, in the first place, be a task to be resolved by the people of the North and the South themselves. Hence, inter-Korean dialogue should be resumed as soon as possible.
