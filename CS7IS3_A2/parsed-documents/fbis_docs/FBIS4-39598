And Immediately Shared It Out"] [Text] Yesterday the State Duma began to examine the draft federal law "On the Federal Budget for 1994" at its second reading. However, the previous day, Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Budget, Taxes, Banks and Finances, briefed journalists on his colleagues' stance. The deputy stated that they had received about 300 amendments to the draft law and studied them all carefully. The committee recommended that the State Duma and government find reserves in the sum of 8.5 trillion rubles [R], mainly from foreign economic activity and state administration. Mikhail Zadornov proposes that this money be channeled into defense (R3.5 trillion for the purchase of arms and equipment on a targeted basis), into the financing of programs for the transfer, in Federation components, of funds from the balances of enterprises and departments into the local authorities' balances, and into research and development. There was also some for the development of fundamental science (R600 billion) and for public education and the preservation of cultural monuments (R130 billion). Mikhail Zadornov believes that the development of the economic situation in the first four months of this year confirms the worst fears -- the decline in production is continuing, collection of taxes is declining, and the deficit is already equivalent to approximately half the expenditure side of the budget. "The situation regarding nonpayments in a number of respects is worse than in summer 1992, when the nonpayments problem was at its peak," Mikhail Zadornov stressed. "That means that the income side of the budget as a whole is in jeopardy." According to the deputy, the committee refused to pledge income that is not realistic. Journalists recalled the words of Russian Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin, to the effect that there are no "secret stashes." And they inquired pressingly: Who is deceiving whom? The chairman of the budget committee avoided giving a direct answer and blamed the government for having no clear budget policy concept itself yet failing to accept the legislators' wishes.
