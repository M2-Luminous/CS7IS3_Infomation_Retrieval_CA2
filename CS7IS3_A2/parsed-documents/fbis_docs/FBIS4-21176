He referred to an alleged U.S. plot designed to get back at him because his government defended coca farming at an international level and because he invited Fidel Castro to visit Bolivia. Paz: I hope the commission agrees with me when I say that we run the risk that our ineffective struggle against drug trafficking may be used within our country for political or other purposes. [passage omitted] Do you not think, when I saw the regrettable way in which the FELCN and the Prosecutor General acted, I did not wonder how they acted in previous cases and how many people may have been victims of this irresponsible, corrupt, and superficial management of our prisons throughout the country? Pando: During his administration, Paz Zamora was asked to safeguard our sovereignty in light of the obvious intervention by the U.S. Embassy. At that time Paz Zamora talked about a sham [pacotilla] sovereignty. Paz: We must not let the FELCN, in the name of the noble struggle against drug trafficking, become a nightmare for the citizenry as was the case of the Tonton Macoutes in Haiti. Pando: The former president then made a series of charges which had been reported by the media throughout the four years of his administration. Paz: Higher ranking FELCN officers, district prosecutors, and the special prosecutors for drug cases receive their salaries directly from the financial cooperation granted by the United States. This is not normal. I would say this is a typical case of cooperation--which we need--but which could turn into intervention. After all, you obey the one who pays you your salary. Pando: He ended his attacks against the FELCN and the prosecutors in a categorical manner. Paz: Nothing of what was said was true. [passage omitted] [end recording]
