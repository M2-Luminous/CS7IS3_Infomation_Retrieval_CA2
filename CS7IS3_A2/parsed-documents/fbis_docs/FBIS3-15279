The President Is Looking for a Fulcrum"] [Text] The role of the Security Council may increase substantially in the near future. Observers do not rule out that this year already this consultative presidential body may rank next to the government and parliament or in some respects even rise above them. That the Security Council is preparing for a new role can be seen from the purge under way there: a special commission is studying cases of leaks, as a result of which the security regime will obviously be tightened. Yesterday, meanwhile, the reorganization of the council apparatus began. The reorganization itself is a purely apparatus action aimed at limiting the independence of the numerous interdepartmental commissions. To this end the Security Council sectors that ensure its activity are to be placed under the control of Oleg Lobov's deputies. One of the three deputies -- General Valeriy Manilov, responsible for preparing council sessions -- will apparently become first deputy. Reshuffles in the apparatus deck appear routine only at first sight: This is the Security Council's fifth reorganization over the relatively short time of its existence. Everything depends on who will decide to use the apparatus, how, and for what purpose. According to information in possession of KOMMERSANT-DAILY, Security Council secretary Oleg Lobov, who has failed to overpower the inveterate economic manager within himself, although he has been close to Boris Yeltsin ever since the Sverdlovsk days, will apparently leave his post and go on a prolonged business trip abroad. According to one version, he will replace Ivan Silayev as Russia's representative to the EC. Yuriy Baturin, the president's national security adviser, is tipped to be the next Security Council secretary. His confusion in the amnesty situation may have diminished his chances in the public eye. Yet the main criterion for Boris Yeltsin is personal loyalty, and judging by Mr. Baturin's breathtaking career, everything is quite all right here. Naturally the new Security Council secretary will need some time to establish contacts with the power ministries. But having asserted himself in this post, Mr. Baturin will head an organization more structured than before, cleared of people responsible for information leaks, and permeating practically all spheres of the country's life -- from protecting the population's health to defense and security. Given that the government, which cannot be called pro-presidential by any stretch, is headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin -- a man capable of independent moves -- while in parliament the president's supporters are in the minority, it becomes clear that Boris Yeltsin urgently needs a structure he can lean on. A renewed Security Council appears to be the best support with whose assistance Boris Yeltsin can regain his slipping grasp on power without any anti-constitutional moves. Under certain circumstances (it is enough to recall Vladimir Shumeyko's recent slip of the tongue about the need to introduce a state of emergency to fight crime) the Security Council can be placed above the government and parliament as a body coordinating the activity of all branches of power for the sake of national security interests.
