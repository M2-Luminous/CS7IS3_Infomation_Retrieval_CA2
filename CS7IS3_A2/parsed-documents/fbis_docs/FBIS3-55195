He is Vyacheslav Alekseyevich Nikonov, doctor of historic sciences, adviser of the International Reform Fund, and deputy of the new State Duma. I would like to congratulate you and ask you: How do you see the coming year? [Nikonov] First of all, good morning and greetings on the coming new year, as well as the new political year. What will happen in terms of political stability? It seems to me that the political stars will not be too kind to Russia next year, although I am sure that things will not go as far as the acute conflicts we had in October of the past year. [Lomakin] You mean this year? [Nikonov] Yes, October of this year. We can see that a new constitutional order has been created, new representative organs of power have been elected, yet nevertheless the composition of these representative organs and the very content of the constitution are not something that inspires too much optimism. As you know, the content of the State Duma is such that opposition forces will predominate in it. The constitution also includes a whole series of hitches and careless points which could be used by the opposition in order to destabilize the situation. Naturally the question arises: How fruitful will the future Federal Assembly be, and how effectively and quickly will it be able to adopt laws? I would not harbor too many illusions in this regard. We are, after all, entering into a completely new constitutional system. A fundamentally new state organ of legislative power is being created which must organize itself, and this too will require some time. A lot of time will be taken up by questions relating to the location of this organ. Obviously it will not agree with the proposals made by the president about putting it in the CEMA Building or the Russian Press House, about which there has been talk. I am sure that the question of assessing various political events of the past year will arise. Unfortunately, the new constitution gives the State Duma a fairly serious opportunity to move a vote of no confidence in the government and to force it to resign. According to the new constitution, it turns out that if the State Duma passes a vote of no confidence in the government twice, consecutively, the President must either disband the Duma or ask the government to resign, but it includes a rule according to which the President cannot disband anything on these grounds during the first year of the Duma's work. So the president would have to ask the government to resign. This would create a situation of fairly serious political instability, even though the president has some counter options. The fact is that after the resignation of one government, he can nominate a premier unacceptable to the Duma. He can do this three times, after which he can disband the Duma. So the constitution includes a whole series of points which will promote confrontation in the relations between the two branches of power. [Lomakin] Tell me please, Vyacheslav Alekseyevich, I think this concerns many people: How will Zhirinovskiy act, taking into consideration his victory at the elections? [Nikonov] First of all, I do not consider that Zhirinovskiy won at the elections. Obviously he made a very strong showing, but we know that Zhirinovskiy got his representatives only into that half of the lower house, the State Duma, which was elected according to party lists. As far as the second half of the State Duma -- which was elected from electoral districts -- is concerned, there are not too many Zhirinovskiy supporters in it, while in the Upper House, the Federation Council, there are practically none. I think that Zhirinovskiy will undoubtedly play a fairly active role through the coming year. I imagine that his tactics will be to demonstrate the utmost constructivism. He will try to show himself to be a loyal supporter of President Yeltsin's course, a course of reforms. Essentially he will be telling people: I, together with Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, will do everything possible to establish order in this country. [Lomakin] Will this be some kind of smokescreen? [Nikonov] It will be a serious smokescreen, since it is quite obvious that as soon as there is any whiff of the next elections, his tactics may change 180 degrees and he will say: We tried, we did everything to achieve order in the country together with the president, but it turns out that the president has insufficient strength in order to fulfill this task. I attach fairly great hopes to the elections that we will have next year. As you know, we will have elections in all the subjects of the federation -- in republics, krays, and oblasts -- and they will be held in accordance with legislative norms that will be developed within the subjects of the federation themselves. Local elections will also be held. In essence, the entire system of power, from bottom to top, will take shape next year. Unfortunately, it was in disarray in recent times. [Lomakin] Thank God, Vyacheslav Alekseyevich, that we have arrived at an optimistic end. There is nothing more thankless than making forecasts; however, we tried to do this today and Vyacheslav Alekseyevich Nikonov played first-chair violin in our orchestra today. He is one of the newly elected members of the State Duma, a doctor of historical sciences, and an adviser of the International Reform Fund. Thank you. [Nikonov] Thank you and once again, a happy new year.
