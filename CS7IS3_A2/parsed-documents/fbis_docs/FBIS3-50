FBIS3-50 "cr00000015994001" 23 March 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-036--JAPAN JAPAN: SPOTLIGHT ON JAPAN ASSOCIATION OF DEFENSE INDUSTRY The Japan Association of Defense Industry (JADI), existing in its present form since 1988 and tracing its origin back to 1951, is an industry association under the supervision of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the Japan Defense Agency (JDA). JADI promotes the development of Japanese defense technology and equipment, monitors foreign technology, lobbies on behalf of its corporate members for government defense spending, and cooperates with the government on export controls. ASSOCIATION OVERVIEW JADI (Nihon boei sobi kogyokai), an industry association (shadan hojin) of over 130 corporations, promotes the development of a strong Japanese defense industry. According to the latest edition of the annual guide to MITI's public corporations (TSUSHOSANGYOSHO KANKEI KOEKI HOJIN BENAAN 1993 May 93), JADI seeks to "work towards the sound development of the defense equipment industry and, in so doing, contribute to the establishment of Japan's defense base" by promoting research and development of defense equipment and improving production technology. The association's stated activities regarding defense equipment are as follows: conducting surveys and research; gathering and disseminating information, supporting R&D; offering proposals on modernization, greater efficiency, and support for Japan's defense production base; hosting seminars; cooperating with other organizations related to the defense industry; carrying out contract research, helping devise Standards; and cooperating with the government's export control Policies. Central to the association's activities is the promotion of R&D and Japan's independent development of defense technology and product ion capacity (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 3 Jun 87, NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 1O Jan 87). CLOSE TIES TO GOVERNMENT The association has existed at three different levels of organization, each successively closer to the government. In October 1951, five steel companies led the way in establishing the Japan Technology Production Association (Nihon gijutsu seisan kyoryokukai), a private company (kabushiki kaisha). In October 1953, the organization changed its name to the Japan Weapons Industry Association (Nihon heiki kogyokai) and became a voluntary association (nini dantai) (YOMIURI SHIMBUN 26 Sep 88). In September 1988, the organization assumed its present name and status as an industry association under joint MITI and JDA administration. One month prior to the change, NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN (4 Aug 88) reported that the organization had experienced "difficulties" as a voluntary organization in securing long-term loans and government subsidies. YOMIURI SHIMBUN (26 Sep 88) reported that the organization would now receive government subsidies due to its "upgrading" to the status of a legal entity (hojin). Along with the Promotion in status came enhanced government supervision. Chairman Kosaku Inaba, president of Ishikawajima- Harima Heavy Industries (IHI), and the three vice chairmen, all corporate executives, retained their positions. But the insertion of three members of the government "old boy" network signalled JADI's closer ties to the government (ASAHI SHIMBUN 17 Sep 88, NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 17 Sep 88, YOMIURI SHIMBUN 26 Sep 88). Tomoyoshi Kabaya, a former MITI official who headed the JDA Equipment Bureau, assumed the newly created post of JADI director- general. Takeshi Moriyama, former chief of JDA's Central Procurement Office, assumed office under him as executive director. Both Kabaya and Moriyama continue to hold those positions, according to the latest edition of TSUSHOSANGYOSHO KANKEI KOEKI HOJIN BENRAN 1993 (May 93). In contrast, IHI's Inaba and the three corporate executives under him vacated their seats after serving out their two-year terms. JADI's chairmen and vice chairmen are drawn from the top ranks of Japan's defense industry. Yotaro Iida, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), has chaired JADI since June 1992 (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 28 May 92). IHI Vice President Kunio Minamizaki, Fujitsu Vice President Kimio Otsuki, and Asahi Chemical Industry Chairman Nobuo Yamaguchi are listed as the current vice chairmen (TSUSHOSANGYOSHO KANKEI KOEKI HOJIN BENRAN 1993 May 93). The association's chairmen have been chosen from among Japan's top seven defense companies: MHI, Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI), IHI, Mitsubishi Electric, NEC, Toshiba, and Japan Steel Works (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 12, 28 May 92). Preceding Iida as JADI chairman were KHI President Hiroshi Oba (199O-92) and IHI President Kosaku Inaba (1988-9O). The association's top post has also rotated among companies according to three categories of defense equipment: firearms/special vehicles, ammunition/missiles, and electronics (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 May 9O, ASAHI SHIMBUN 3O May 87, NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 2O Mar 85). MONITORING U.S. TECHNOLOGY The association has been monitoring U.S. defense technology as part of its mission to gather and disseminate information on foreign developments. For example, Washington and Tokyo reached an agreement in July 1987 for Japanese corporations to participate in the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). JADI's predecessor organization joined the Keidanren's Defense Production Committee and the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies (SJAC) in a joint conference to learn the details of Japanese corporate partici- pation in SDI research from MITI, the "point of contact" for Japanese companies interested in the project (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 4 Aug 87). The association was also to join SJAC and Keidanren's Defense Production Committee in an "SDI Information Center" slated to begin operations in early 1988. The association would cooperate in gathering information, primarily open-source documents in the United States, on SDI-related technology (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 17 Nov 87). Moreover, at a New Year's party in January 1988, association chairman Kosaka Inaba and JDA Equipment Bureau Director- General Masaji Yamamoto gave speeches on Japanese corporate participation in SDI, stressing that companies study the technology involved and maintain liaison with the Japanese Government (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 9 Jan 88). LOBBYING GOVERNMENT JADI also lobbies government officials and politicians. Chairman Iida joined SJAC's chief and other representatives of defense- related organizations in an October 1993 "round table discussion" on the Mid-Term Defense Plan (1991-95) with then-JDA Director-General Keisuke Nakanishi. JADI joined the call for increased defense R&D sPending to sustain the employment and expertise of JaPanese researchers and engineers in the field (ASAHI SHIMBUN 19 Oct 93). During the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) years in power (1955- 93), JADI kePt channels of communication to the succession of JDA chiefs and LDP defense experts. Among the guests at the association's annual New Year's party, for example, have been then- JDA Director-General Koichi Kato (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 10 Jan 86). (AUTHOR: MERCADO.
