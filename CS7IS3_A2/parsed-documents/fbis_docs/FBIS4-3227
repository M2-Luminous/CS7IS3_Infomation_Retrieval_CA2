They called on Air Force officers and men in Tibet, and were accorded a warm welcome by the latter. In a conference room, (Zhang Guanying), political commissar of the command post, briefed the autonomous regional leaders on the development of Air Force units in Tibet, their relations with local governments and the people, and their support for local construction. (Zhang Guanying) said: [Begin (Zhang) recording] Respected chairman Gyaincain, respected secretary Guo, respected vice chairmen Yang, and respected secretary general Li, leaders and comrades, on the eve of the 1 May Labor Day, leading comrades of the autonomous regional party committee and government have managed to find the time to come and inspect the work of Air Force units in Tibet, and to visit us. This fully shows the deep concern of the autonomous regional party committee and government and the people of all nationalities in Tibet for Air Force units. It fully shows the close friendship between the armymen and people, and between the Tibetan Nationality and the Han Nationality. It also fully shows the two inseparable things pointed out by General Secretary Jiang during his inspection tour of Tibet [sentence as heard]. The leaders' visit here today is very inspiring and enlightening for us; we are very pleased. On this occasion, please allow me to speak on behalf of the party committee, headquarters, and more than 3,000 officers and men of the Air Force units in Tibet, to extend our warm welcome to the autonomous regional party and government leaders and to express our heartfelt thanks to them and the people of all nationalities in Tibet for their profound concern. [end recording] Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and chairman of the autonomous region, said after hearing political commissar (Zhang Guanying's) briefing: [Begin Gyaincain recording] Political Commissar Zhang, leaders of the Air Force command post, [word indistinct] and comrades, on the eve of the 1 May International Labor Day, deputy secretary Guo Jinlong of the autonomous regional party committee; vice chairman Yang Chuantang; secretary-general of the autonomous regional party committee (Li Liguo); vice chairman Yang Song, and myself are making this special trip to call on the officers and men of the air force command post. At the same time, we are here to thank you on behalf of the autonomous region's party committee, government, and more than 2 million people. As Political Commissar Zhang has just mentioned, I think that in the three decades and more since the establishment of the Lhasa air force command post, the officers and men have indeed fully adhered to Comrade Xiaoping's thought on army building in the new period, and to General Secretary Jiang's 20-character instruction -- the PLA must be qualified politically and competent militarily, and it must have a fine workstyle, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of adequate logistical support. During these three decades and more, the air force command post has also been among the few top PLA units here which have excelled in the joint army-people campaign to build spiritual civilization, in army building, in logistical self-sufficiency of non-staple food and [word indistinct], and in implementation of the party's policies concerning nationalities and religions. The party and government are always (satisfied). [end recording] Then, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu, accompanied by leaders of the Lhasa air force command post, visited the (Ganbala) radar station, called on the officers and men there, and inquired about their work, study, and everyday life. Gyaincain zealously wrote an inscription for the radar station: Work hard, make selfless dedication, and keep the (Ganbala) spirit eternal.
