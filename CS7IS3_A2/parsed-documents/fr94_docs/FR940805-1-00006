FR940805-1-00006 FR940805-1-00001 When this regulation and other related rules are effective, these publications will be rescinded, in whole or in part, or revised. In the future, REA bulletins will be used to provide certain procedural information, illustrative examples, and other guidance to assist borrowers in complying with REA's published rules. REA believes the amended parts 1710 and 1714 will clarify pre-loan policies and requirements, bring them up to date, facilitate understanding and compliance by borrowers, and improve program effectiveness. List of Subjects 7 CFR Part 1710 Electric power, Electric utilities, Loan programs_energy, Rural areas. 7 CFR Part 1714 Electric power, Loan programs_energy, Rural areas. 7 CFR Part 1785 Electric power, Loan programs_energy, Rural areas. For the reasons set out in the preamble, REA proposes to amend 7 CFR Chapter XVII as follows: PART 1710_GENERAL AND PRE-LOAN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES COMMON TO INSURED AND GUARANTEED ELECTRIC LOANS 1. The authority citation for part 1710 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 901&hyph;950(b); Public Law 99&hyph;591, 100 Stat, 3341&hyph;16; Delegation of Authority by the Secretary of Agriculture, 7 CFR 2.23; Delegation of Authority by the Under Secretary for Small Community and Rural Development, 7 CFR 2.72. 2. Section 1710.2 is amended by removing the existing definition of ``Loan Period'' and adding two new definitions in alphabetical order to read as follows: §1710.2 Definitions and rules of construction. (a) *␣*␣* Fund advance period means the period of time during which the Government may advance loan funds to the borrower. See 7 CFR 1714.56. * * * * * Loan period means the period of time during which the facilities included in a loan application will be constructed. It commences with the date shown on page 1, in the block headed ``Cost Estimates as of,'' of REA Form 740c, Cost Estimates and Loan Budget for Electric Borrowers, which is the same as the date on the Financial and Statistical Report submitted with the loan application. The loan period may be up to 4 years for distribution borrowers and, except in the case of a loan for new generating and associated transmission facilities, up to 4 years for the transmission facilities and improvements or replacements of generation facilities for power supply borrowers. The loan period for new generating facilities is determined on a case by case basis. * * * * * 3.

The loan period for new generating facilities is determined on a case by case basis. The loan period for DSM activities will be determined in accordance with §1710.355. The Administrator may approve a loan period shorter than the period requested by the borrower, if in the Administrator's sole discretion, a loan made for the longer period would fail to meet REA requirements for loan feasibility and loan security set forth in §§1710.112 and 1710.113, respectively.
