He added that a situation has been reached whereby "those entrusted with the mission of safeguarding national sovereignty are the persons who endanger it." Jonassaint was appointed provisional president by a group of senators headed by Bernard Sansaricq and with the support of the Armed Forces and Army Commander Raoul Cedras. Malval, who resigned in December but who remained as acting prime minister until constitutional President Jean Bertrand Aristide appoints his replacement, called on "patriots and responsible people to oppose this forceful coup, which is against the Constitution and the Governor's Island agreements signed" in New York. This agreement establishes Aristide's return to power, who was overthrown on 30 September 1991 by a group of military officers. Meanwhile in Washington, President Aristide's spokesman, Jean Claude Martinau, said Jonassaint was president of an illegal supreme court, therefore his presidency is illegal. Martinau upholds that this government will have the same fate as previous governments appointed by the military and that he will be used as a puppet. Victor Benoit, leader of the National Congress of Democratic Forces party, condemned the action and called it "illegitimate and illegal." Benoit said he will stay home and stop going to the Ministry of National Education, Youth, and Sports. Hubert de Ronceray, leader of the extreme right Mobilization for National Development, backed Jonassaint's appointment as acting president. De Ronceray believes the Senate carried out a patriotic act by designating Jonassaint and that the decision will "put the house in order." He added that "we must prepare to successfully face all international community challenges." U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William Lacy Swing sent Jonassaint a letter requesting that he respect the Haitian Constitution, in which the judge took part. [sentence as received] Swing described the act as illegitimate and called on Jonassaint to join those who wish to defend that Constitution. Likewise, the union sector condemned Jonassaint's appointment and said this will facilitate U.S. diplomatic games to occupy the country. A Haitian Workers Central leader said Sansaricq, Jonassaint, and those who back this maneuver will be the persons primarily responsible for a military intervention. The labor leader believes that all Jonassaint's acts as president are null and without a future. The labor leader also said that Jonassaint's appointment is a coup within a coup d'etat against Aristide. The National Federation of Popular Organizations [Confederacion Nacional de las Organizaciones Populares], through its Secretary General Banes Cherestal, described the appointment as a new coup d'etat that will worsen the situation of extreme poverty the people of Haiti are in. Cherestal asked himself who does Senator Sansaricq work for and what is his true goal. The union leader made several proposals to resolve the crisis and mentioned among them that Gen. Cedras resign, as he promised within the framework of the Governor's Island agreement. He also proposed amnesty for the military members, that Aristide appoint a prime minister, Aristide's return in a reasonable time period, and that UN sanctions be lifted.
