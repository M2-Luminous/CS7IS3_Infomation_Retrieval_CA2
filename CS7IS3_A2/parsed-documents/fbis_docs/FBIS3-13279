This region, while being important from a strategic military standpoint, has rich natural resources; arable lands; and an efficient, creative, and active work force. China is one of the most important countries in this region of the world. It is growing at an increasing rate and developing in military and economic areas with astonishing economic dynamism and moving towards becoming another world power. This situation, alongside such important economic centers as Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, has caused the center of economic and strategic gravity in the world to shift to the Pacific Ocean area. Concerning the importance of this region, 100 years ago, the secretary of state at the time had said: "Even though trade and political affairs are expanding in Europe, it will gradually become less important; on the other hand, the Pacific Ocean will become the arena of major world events in the future." Ronald Reagan, the former U.S. president, also said in 1984 in connection with the extraordinary importance of Asia and the Pacific Ocean region: "I look at the Pacific Ocean as the future of the world." Because of the above-mentioned factors, the attention of the West and the United States has been focused on Asia and the Pacific Ocean more than ever before. For this reason, in 1989, a treaty called the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC], was signed between the United States, Europe, and the economically powerful countries of Asia and the Pacific Ocean region and now has 17 members. In the last meeting of this economic treaty, which was held in Azar [22 November-21 December] this year in Seattle, in the United States, it became clear that this region has continued to receive the attention of the West, and the leaders of those countries hope to expand their presence in that region. In this connection, U.S. President Bill Clinton stated in that meeting that the Asia and Pacific Ocean region will have a central role in U.S. foreign policy. He also pointed out that the Asia and Pacific Ocean region will be the most important political, economic, and military pole in the world. In the opinion of political experts, the above statements show that the United States is determined to pursue an active diplomacy in that region. In order to attract the attention of Chinese officials, prior to the meeting with the government officials of that country, the U.S. President ordered the sale to China of a very advanced super computer. U.S. Reasons for Presence in Asia A) The U.S. economy, like the economies of European countries, is facing a great crisis. Economic experts have projected that U.S. economic growth this year and next will decrease by 2.7 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, and hence result in a wave of bankruptcy for many U.S. companies. On the other hand, the Pacific Ocean region, with a population of 2 billion people, has the most rapid economic growth in the world and is considered a great market for American and European products. Hence, the increase in the U.S. economic and commercial presence in the region can change the market in that country and attract the work force in various economic sectors of the United States. B) With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the end of the cold war, and the world moving toward a multipolar system, as the world military superpower and one of the important economic centers of the world, the United States is trying to stop the establishment of such world powers as the former Soviet Union, so that, so it reasons, it will become the only world power. Hence, under the circumstances of countries such as Japan, China, and Russia moving toward becoming world powers, in which case the Asia and Pacific Ocean region will become the center of gravity for world powers, in order to prevent the transfer of the center of power from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, the United States is making an effort to shape the security and economic structure of the region before these countries become pivotal centers. C) Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and especially the removal of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of West and East Germany, Europe is moving towards unification and becoming a powerful, united complex. Hence, the success of the Maastricht Treaty in the future will lead the Europeans towards a closed economic complex day by day, in which case, an end will be put to the presence of the United States. Under such circumstances, the most favorable position for the United States is to transfer its center of trade from Europe to Asia and the Pacific Ocean region. Another benefit of such a policy is that it will allow U.S. leaders to increase pressure on the European Community several times through the APEC treaty and in this way achieve its wishes in the GATT (tariff and trade agreement), which was ratified last month by the representatives of more than 100 countries. Special Attention of the United States to China China, as one of the powerful countries in Asia and the Pacific Ocean, is of special importance. Hence, the United States, alongside its efforts to make its presence felt in the region, pays special attention to the most populated country in the world and in its future political and economic relations will allocate a special position for China. In the opinion of political analysts, after the end of the cold war, the relations between the United States and China entered a new phase, which, in contrast to the past, has become more important at the international level. Previously, the Chinese tried to take advantage of the existing rivalry between the United States and the former Soviet Union and by establishing positive equilibrium between Washington and Moscow obtain maximum concessions from both sides. But after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the final failure of international communism, as the leaders of new socialism, the Chinese, by continuing the process of reforms that they had started in 1976 after the death of Mao, established new relations with the United States and other Western countries. Economically, the Chinese combined socialist ideology with the free-market economic system, which they call a socialist economic system based on the open market. Even though the nature of such a system is not clear to U.S. officials, because China has veto power in the UN Security Council, in order to have their proposed resolutions, which are mostly to cover up their meddling policies, ratified in the Security Council, the United States needs the vote of the Chinese Government in this council. On the other hand, the economic growth of China in recent years has been significant, and this has been important for Western governments, especially the United States, that in the early years of the 1990's have faced economic recession. For this reason, Americans try to temporarily forget the issue of human rights, which in the past four years has been the main center of anti-Chinese propaganda for the Americans, in order to prepare the grounds for expanding relations. To this end, the U.S. president, a little before meeting with the government officials of that country, in order to appeal to Chinese officials, issued instructions to sell a very advanced super computer to China. For the Chinese, who hoped to be a center of power in East Asia after the end of the cold war, access to advanced technology and attracting investments by large Western companies are important. For this reason, the Beijing government, on the one hand, tries to show itself as the defender of Third World countries in its relations with them and, on the other hand, due to the need for Western technology and investments by multinational companies in China, weighs political considerations in relation with these countries and even in some instances gives concessions. For example, the Chinese positive votes for the proposed U.S. resolution concerning Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia, Haiti, and the like, are precisely evaluated in the framework of such an objective. U.S. Obstacles and Problems Even though all existing evidence and signs indicate the completion of American multilateral political and economic policies in the region in question, attention to hindering factors, which exist in this area, does not provide a clear perspective for the economic and political experts of the West. The most important of these factors are: A) While the grounds for full cooperation and coordination between Beijing and Washington have been completely prepared, a sort of new rivalry is forming between the two countries. As one of the most powerful countries in Asia, China, even though it needs the West and the United States in numerous areas, is not prepared to become an instrument for the United States to become the sole world power with regard to its economic needs and at the same time considers itself the economic, political, and military rival of the United States. B) The significant economic growth of the countries in the region has freed them from dependence on Western countries. In fact, the interest of those countries in more economic development in cooperation with the United States and Europe is evaluated. Hence, as soon as countries such as China and Japan face the oppressive actions of the United States, they are capable of returning to cold political relations. C) The growth of nationalism and political development in the countries in the region will also confront the United States with problems in continuing its presence and the interference by Washington in the internal affairs of those countries. Even though countries located in Asia and the Pacific Ocean region have achieved significant economic advancement, this situation has not hindered change in the view of the Americans as regards the people of Eastern countries being inferior, and they continue to look down on the people of the East. D) America's failure to understand the cultural and social issues of the countries in the region is another problem facing the United States in expanding its influence in the Pacific Ocean region. Even though countries such as Japan and China began to move toward corruption and debauchery years ago and now face many problems in the area of the moral decline of their youth, the people of these countries believe in a set of cultural and traditional principles, and this has created a duality regarding the presence of U.S. forces, which makes the continuation of their establishment in the region problematic.
