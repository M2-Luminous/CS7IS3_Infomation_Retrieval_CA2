The curtain has risen on the drama of the European auto industry's reorganization. There are two major factors driving the reorganization. One is the rapid deterioration of the European auto market. The number of new passenger cars registered in the 17 European countries from January through July was 6,965,800. Compared to the same period last year, this was a decrease of 18.3 percent. The Japanese new car market also dropped off during the same period, but only by 7.1 percent. Regarding this rapid market shrinkage, the research department of a major automaker said, "The European economic recession is largely to blame, but another cause is that auto emission standards have become stricter due to EC integration, which began this January." And about the current sales slump, an auto analyst in Europe predicted, "Just as the wave of prosperity from 1985 to 1989 was long, this slump will also be long." This analyst is thus of the view that "the sales slump will continue for a while." The Threat of Japanese Cars The second factor driving reorganization is the Japanese auto offensive. In 1980, 1,220,000 Japanese cars were exported to Europe, whereas in 1992, that number was up to 1,600,000. Since last year, Nissan has increased the models being produced at its British plant. Honda and Toyota are also starting up new plants in England. And Mitsubishi Motors, in a joint venture with Volvo, plans to begin production in 1995. The number of Japanese cars is thus expected to increase still further. "The Japanese auto industry has 30 percent greater productivity than the German," said Mercedes' Environmental Policy Director Lacheem, who fears that competitiveness. The view of one auto analyst in Europe--that "Japanese market share here, as in the U.S., will rise to near 30 percent (it is now 12 percent)"--is not necessarily an exaggeration. Against this offensive from Japanese autos, the EC Committee has established monitoring levels for them and implemented import volume restrictions. Moreover, despite the fact that on April 1 the committee decided to reduce the 1993 monitoring level to 1,089,000 vehicles--9.4 percent less than the previous year's actual number of imports--on September 4 it cut this level by nearly 10 percent more, to 980,000 vehicles, 18.5 percent less than the previous year's number of imports. "This was because the drop in the European market became even more serious than at the time of the April agreement," said EC Committee Vice Chairman Bangeman. Even so, it could probably still be said that the Europeans acted precipitously. The main reason for this is that, amid the severe slump in the European market, Japanese cars have steadily been extending their sway. Although the volume of Japanese cars continues to be down by a double-digit rate from last year, their 12 percent market share for January-July represents an increase of 0.2 points from the same period last year. And in 1999, the restrictions on the import of Japanese cars will be lifted. It will soon be impossible [for the Europeans] to rely only on politics. Mergers, More Car Models, Personnel Reductions; Manufacturers Also Frantically Restructuring In particular, "Mercedes Benz of Germany has been undergoing a major transformation since its new president took over this May," said Nobuyoshi Yoshida, Director of the Automobile Management and Development Research Center. Until now, Mercedes has limited its annual production to 600,000 vehicles, and has covered rising personnel expenses by increasing car luxury and price. It recently announced, however, that it will begin local production in the United States; moreover, it will begin making cars for the masses. It has thus embarked in a new direction. And though it reduced its work force by 13,000 people in 1992, it plans to cut another 27,000 by the end of 1994. "Mercedes' entry into mass cars is especially significant," said Director Yoshida. "It's because the European automakers, which, until now, have existed through a certain degree of isolation, have been caught by the competition." At the Motor Show held in Frankfurt, Germany in September, there was an abundance of concept cars in the compact category. They included Mercedes' Vision A, with a displacement of 1.2 liters; BMW's E1; Opel's Tigora; and Ford's Sub B. Competition in the compact car market is likely to become quite fierce. Accordingly, in addition to making cars that are appealing, a major point will be how to reduce their cost. In this connection, the use of common parts by different companies, which is already being done, should develop even further. And to strengthen the benefits of this practice, companies will probably form tie-ups--that is, mergers. Here, the company that might be mentioned first is Fiat, which has survived due to Italy's protective policies. When EC integration was decided and market liberalization began, Fiat rapidly lost competitiveness. In 1989, it had the top share in the European market, whereas in 1992 its share dropped to fourth. Rumors are circulating that it will merge with France's Peugeot. There is also a report that the company with the ninth-ranking market share, Rover of England, will be acquired by VW. This spring, VW, whose position in England is weak, converted its distribution subsidiary there to a full-faceted subsidiary. This is thought to be a preparatory step for acquiring Rover. Moreover, Mercedes and many other European companies, aware that their productivity is inferior to that of Japanese companies, want production technology from the latter. The Dutch commercial vehicle manufacturer, Dafu, due to, among other things, administrative difficulties, has asked Mitsubishi Motors to buy its plant in England. But Japanese companies are also in dire straits and cannot vigorously lead the way in reorganization. If the yen continues to appreciate, however, it will become hard for them to export to Europe, forcing them to switch to producing there. The number of tie-ups between Japanese and European automakers is still limited. Nevertheless, one possible approach is, like Mitsubishi Motors, to form a joint venture with a Europeanmaker and produce a new line in an existing European plant. In the future, the relationship between Japanese and European makers will probably extend beyond sales cooperation in the Japanese market to production cooperation in Europe.
