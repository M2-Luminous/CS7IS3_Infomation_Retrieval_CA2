The development of the situation demands that we further promote army building and reform, and raise the troops' combat capability in an all-round manner so as to provide a solid and powerful security guarantee for the country's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. In the coming year, we should persist in taking Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his concept of army building in the new period as our basic guidelines; earnestly implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; further intensify army building in accordance with the general requirement of "being qualified politically and competent militarily, having a good work style, maintaining strict discipline, and being assured of adequate logistic support" set by Jiang Zemin; make the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping the first and most important task; and use the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the minds of all officers and men. We should continue to apply the principles of military strategy in the new period to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the work situation related to the army; and enhance the political awareness of the party commanding the gun, the awareness of the importance of being good at the strategy of making overall planning, the awareness of our profound responsibility toward state security and army building, and the awareness of being a role model in setting strict demands on ourselves, thereby raising the ideological awareness and military competence of the vast officers and men in the long run. We should reinforce the quality of the rank-and-file cadres, especially leaders at all levels; pay keen attention to the implementation of the "Outline for Grass-Roots Construction in the Army" re-issued by the Central Military Commission; and take new strides and score fresh achievements in improving party work style and promoting clean administration and socialist spiritual civilization in the coming year.
