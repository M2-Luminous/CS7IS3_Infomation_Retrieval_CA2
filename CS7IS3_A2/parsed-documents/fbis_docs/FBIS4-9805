A U.S. Army colonel was killed early this morning after a fragmentation grenade blew up when the aforementioned military officer was taking it from inside one of the offices of the National Civilian Police [PNC] in Zacamil Neighborhood. According to the report, the incidents developed in the following manner: A U.S. Embassy international mission vehicle was passing near Zacamil neighborhood at midnight. It was going at a very high speed. The vehicle was occupied by a driver and two other individuals who accompanied him. According to a confidential report provided to the YSKL news center, the vehicle's occupants were drunk. At midnight, the U.S. Embassy international mission vehicle was passing by the Zacamil neighborhood when a PNC patrol ordered it to stop. The individuals inside the vehicle did not heed the call to stop made by the PNC. Minutes later the PNC officers proceeded to contact other nearby units and the vehicle was stopped. The three occupants of the vehicle were arrested. The three were Salvadoran citizens and they were drunk. Three drunk Salvadorans were driving the U.S. Embassy vehicle. When the police registered the vehicle, they found a Beretta pistol and a fragmentation grenade. The police then proceeded to turn over the three U.S. Embassy security officers, who are Salvadoran nationals and whose names are being withheld for the time being, to the PNC's Zacamil Barracks. As usual, the PNC, following precise instructions, allowed the drunk Salvadorans to make a telephone call. They were able to contact Lt. Col. Julio Guzman Ramon Rivera, a U.S. national.
