EU finance ministers, meeting here, approved establishment of such a group, which will make proposals for simplifying EU and national legislation, he said. German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt had sent a memorandum to other EU countries suggesting creation of a panel of experts to study deregulation. But European Commission President Jacques Delors strongly opposed the idea at a finance ministers' meeting in Brussels on May 16, giving rise to a lively debate between Delors and the German ministers -- backed by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke. Germany wanted the experts group to be fully independent of the Commission --but Delors thought that would mean entrusting outside experts with decision-making power. The EU finally decided that the experts could belong to the Commission or be independent, and the group will meet under Commission aegis. Its first conclusions are expected some time next year.
