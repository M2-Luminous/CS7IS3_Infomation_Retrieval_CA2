Yeltsin expressed his view to President Martti Ahtisaari who started his visit to Moscow this morning. Matti Torma reports from Moscow: [Torma] [passage omitted] Both Ahtisaari and Yeltsin attended a meeting of the delegations from the two countries. After the meeting ended, Yeltsin and Ahtisaari gave a joint news conference, at which both Yeltsin and Ahtisaari announced that there are no political problems between the countries. As for actual matters of substance, Yeltsin expressed hope that Finland and Russia will rapidly achieve an agreement on avoiding dual taxation as well as on investment protection for Finnish investments. As regards the economy, Yeltsin also hinted that new big projects may be forthcoming, but he would not specify what they might be. Ahtisaari also said that economic relations between Finland and Russia have developed well in the last few years. Already trade has increased to 70 percent of the 1990 level and the economic commission's work has gotten off to a brisk start. According to Ahtisaari, Finland's possible EU membership will also further consolidate cooperation with Russia. In the economy, there is room for improvement in the financing of trade -- which was indeed raised during the talks, Ahtisaari said. In answer to a question about whether Yeltsin condemns the Soviet Union's seizure of Karelia during the Stalin era, Yeltsin replied playfully that "We don't allow that." Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, for his part, at the end of the press conference put an end, at least for the time being, to the debate concerning Finland's possible mediation in settling the disputes between Russia and the Baltic countries. The mediation is not needed, Kozyrev said.
