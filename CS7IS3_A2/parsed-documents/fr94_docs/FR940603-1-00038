FR940603-1-00038 FR940603-1-00009 The current policies and procedures that will be affected are set forth in REA Bulletin 40&hyph;6, Construction Methods and Purchase of Materials and Equipment; REA Bulletin 40&hyph;8, Construction Specifications, Drawings and Contract Forms for Distribution, Transmission and Generation Facilities; REA Bulletin 81&hyph;6, Closeout Procedures and Documents for Contract Construction of Distribution and Transmission Facilities; REA Bulletin 85&hyph;1, Closeout Procedures and Documents for the Contract Construction of Generating Facilities and Associated Buildings; REA Bulletin 86&hyph;1, Closeout Procedures and Documents for the Construction of Buildings Other than Generating Plants; and REA Bulletin 86&hyph;3, Headquarters Facilities for Electric Borrowers. The current policies and procedures will be changed and updated by this proposal. The major substantive proposed changes are as follows: (a) This proposal applies to procurement and construction for all projects which will or may be financed, in whole or in part, with loans made or guaranteed by REA. REA Bulletin 40&hyph;6 currently contains the requirements for all procurement and construction, regardless of the source of funds. (b) This proposal would eliminate the current requirement that REA approve subcontracts. (Subcontracts for generating projects are already exempt from REA approval.) (c) This proposal would change the dollar thresholds that determine which procurement procedure is to be used for a project. (d) This proposal would raise the dollar thresholds that determine whether REA approval of a contract is required and eliminate the requirement of REA approval of certain contract amendments. (e) This proposal would eliminate the requirement of REA approval of borrowers' contracts for headquarters facilities. (f) This proposal would add procedures for procurement of communication and control facilities. (g) This proposal would simplify the procedures for the closeout of construction contracts by reducing the number of forms to be submitted to REA. (h) This proposal would revise the REA standard contract forms. The major changes in the contract forms would be as follows: (1) Change the forms to reflect the changes listed above. (2) Change the insurance and bonding dollar limits as outlined in 7 CFR part 1788. (3) Change the forms to require prequalification of all bidders. (4) Change the interest rate on overdue accounts. (5) Change the ``Buy American'' provision to include Mexico and Canada in accordance with the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of December 8, 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;182. (6) Change the indemnification clause (also called ``hold harmless clause'') to reflect REA's current policy. (7) Incorporate certain technical changes relating to wood treating and right-of-way clearing chemicals. In order to reduce printing cost and volume, the forms to be included in this part are condensed, especially the tables. Also, several forms refer to guide drawings, which do not contain requirements, and, hence, will not be included. It is intended that once the forms are finalized, REA will reformat these forms similar to their current configuration (including the tables and drawings) and make them available in that format either from REA or for purchase from the Government Printing Office.

In view of the above, REA proposes to amend 7 CFR chapter XVII by revising part 1726 to read as follows:
