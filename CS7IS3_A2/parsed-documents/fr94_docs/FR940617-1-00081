II. The Agency's Amended Tentative Final Monograph A. Summary of Ingredient Categories and Testing of Category II and Category III Conditions 1. Summary of Ingredient Categories The agency has carefully reviewed the claimed active ingredients submitted to this administrative record (Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183), which includes the following: the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (39 FR 33103) and previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210) for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC topical alcohol drug products (47 FR 22324), and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC topical mercury-containing drug products (47 FR 436). Based upon the available information, including clinical and marketing history, as well as the recommendations of the Miscellaneous External Panel, the agency is proposing a tentative classification for OTC health-care antiseptic active ingredients. Many of the ingredients included in the tabulation below are in Category II and Category III because of no data or a lack of data on use as a health-care antiseptic. However, all the ingredients have been included as a convenience to the reader. The agency specifically invites comment and additional data on these ingredients. The advance notice of proposed rulemaking for alcohol drug products for topical antimicrobial OTC human use (47 FR 22324, May 21, 1982) is being incorporated into this amended tentative final monograph. In that proposed monograph, the Miscellaneous External Panel recommended that alcohol 60 to 95 percent by volume in an aqueous solution denatured according to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms regulations at 27 CFR part 21 and isopropyl alcohol 50 to 91.3 percent by volume in an aqueous solution be classified as Category I for topical antimicrobial use. The following indications were proposed: (1) ``For first aid use to decrease germs in minor cuts and scrapes.'' (2) ``To decrease germs on the skin prior to removing a splinter or other foreign object.'' (3) ``For preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' (See the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol drug products for topical antimicrobial use, in the Federal Register of May 21, 1982, 47 FR 22324.) Based upon submitted data and the conclusions of the Miscellaneous External Panel, the agency is including alcohol as a Category I surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin preparation, and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash (see section I.E., comment 10). While no comments submitted data on health-care uses of isopropyl alcohol, the agency notes that one comment (Ref. 1) from a manufacturer requested that the OTC alcohol drug products monograph provide the labeling indication, ``antibacterial handwash.'' The same manufacturer provided a submission (Ref. 2) to the Miscellaneous External Panel on a combination product containing isopropyl alcohol 50 percent and oxyquinoline sulfate 0.125 percent for use as a germicidal-fungicidal wash. However, the Panel disbanded before it was able to review the submission, which contained labeling for a currently marketed product and in vitro studies of the product's bacteriocidal activity. No in vivo effectiveness data were submitted for the use of isopropyl alcohol as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, or surgical hand scrub. Based on the lack of data for the use of isopropyl alcohol as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and surgical hand scrub, the agency is placing the ingredient in Category III for these uses. The agency invites data on these uses of isopropyl alcohol. As discussed in section I.E., comment 10, the agency is including the Panel's recommended indication ``for the preparation of the skin prior to an injection'' as an additional Category I indication for patient preoperative skin preparations containing alcohol. Based on the Panel's recommendations, the agency is also proposing isopropyl alcohol as a Category I patient preoperative skin preparation for this indication. However, based on the lack of data on the use of isopropyl alcohol for more general patient preoperative skin preparation use, the agency is not proposing isopropyl alcohol as Category I for the other patient preoperative skin preparation indications included in ยง333.460(b)(1), i.e., ``for the preparation of the skin prior to surgery'' and ``helps to reduce bacteria that potentially can cause skin infection.''
