I initiated this action, proceeding from the realization that the reform was blocked and, what is more, the whole Romanian economy was in a state of blockage, something that is still being felt today by both our economic units and the population as a whole. This is something I was able to ascertain wherever I went during my visits through the country. From my discussions in various enterprises, I realized the meaning of this economic blockage, particularly for the citizens in the street, who are desperate since they can no longer cope with their daily needs. The danger of this situation must be obvious to everyone. We are witnessing some of the most aggressive manifestations of demagoguery -- an almost incredible thing four years after the revolution -- from the extremist and nationalist left-wing forces, which have begun to eulogize the communist regime, especially the Ceausescu regime, with a kind of shamelessness, which I no longer thought possible in our days. Their demagoguery relies on a very simple statement: "We gave the people work." It does not really matter how we have reached such a situation and whether it has anything in common with the 1989 revolution. The fact is that we are faced here with a most dangerous kind of demagoguery. On the one hand, there is the danger of public opinion moving toward their choice, which would be a disaster for Romanian society, and, on the other hand, there is the inherent need to think out what we can do to maintain the idea and process of reform in our country and to move closer to the developed and civilized world. Moreover, as I have said on other occasions, too, it is known that in times of distress and hardship -- as the period of transition is -- democracy is impossible without a solid national consensus. You will find this statement in any manual of democracy, you will find this statement in any serious political analysis of the embarrassing moments that each democracy has had to go through. This supplements perfectly what I have just said about the danger of sliding off the course toward progress and modernization. We must fill up the huge void inherited from the former regime as far as the modernization of the economy and the ability to be competitive in economic, technological, and scientific matters are concerned. I raised this matter for the first time last August. It was concretely embodied in the national pact formula, while the national pact was, in its turn, concretely presented in the letter you are all familiar with, namely the open letter sent to Romania's president, which specified the content of this pact in three spheres: political, economic, and social. This was the basis of our strategy, which, on the one hand, meant to convince the CDR of the usefulness of this idea -- an endeavor that crowned with success, as can be seen from the statement signed by all opposition parties on 14 January 1994 -- after which we launched this initiative toward the PDSR. The PDSR was obliged -- part of that party probably wanted to do it anyway -- to engage in negotiations with the two components of the parliamentary opposition. Therefore, our proposal was for tripartite PDSR-CDR-PD(FSN) talks. Of course, the ugly and unqualifiable maneuvers of the current parliamentary majority, made up of the so-called pentagon, have never ceased to manifest themselves in this period. Despite these maneuvers and the fact that the PD(FSN) has concretely been the target of these attack, we started these talks. Our delegation had two rounds of meetings with the PDSR. As far as the CDR is concerned, things were clarified with them through the signing of the 14 January convention. The fact is that the latest governmental reshuffle took place at a time when we were in the process of discussing ways and means to come to an agreement on certain matters. I honestly tell you that, even now, I still cannot rationally find any explanation for this reshuffle. If I go beyond the boundaries of the rational and enter the backstage corridors of the political game, then I might find an explanation. However, there is no need to speculate at a time when we want to keep the door of the dialogue open, since we are categorically opposed to the principle "the worse it is now, the better will be for us later." This reshuffle does not ring true. It raises several question marks. First of all, the act as such is outside the spirit of the Constitution. We cannot imagine that there can be two categories of ministers: those who are approved by Parliament, and those who are not. Likewise, it is at least an inelegant gesture, as far as the chosen moment is concerned, that is exactly at the time of the start of the inter-party negotiations and without any kind of consultations. We are referring here to the replacement of General Spiroiu, thus giving satisfaction to some very well-known calls. Spiroiu has been engaged in a very active dialogue with NATO. The first thing I am asked in my capacity as NATO rapporteur is: What is your opinion on this or that? Well, in this respect, I can either say that I have no opinion or that it is a serious thing. By that, I can endanger our effort to draw closer to this organization. Therefore, some level of concern with promoting our national interests should have been shown. There should have been a minimum effort to explain the reasons for the reshuffle and its meaning, the wrong things done by the replaced people, and the qualifications brought by the new ministers for making the governmental act more efficiently. The absence of all this proves that the state of blockage has turned into a true state of chaos. We have thus reached a situation whereby the administration acts contrary to the country's laws, by abusively imposing the government's arbitrary will, without it actually solving anything, other than further complicating the process of reform. This blockage is extremely dangerous for the overall situation in which we find ourselves.
