ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at Springdale, AR.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donald J. Day, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Southwest Region, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Fort Worth, TX 76193&hyph;0530, telephone (817) 222&hyph;5593. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On July 6, 1994, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Springdale, AR, was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 34585). That action proposed to establish Class E airspace at Springdale, AR, during the hours that the control tower is closed to contain IFR operations at the airport. Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Coordinates reported for Springdale, AR, were incorrectly identified in the notice, and are corrected in this amendment. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as surface areas for airports are published in paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated June 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace at Springdale, AR, to provide controlled airspace for IFR operations during the hours that the control tower is closed. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them orperationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
