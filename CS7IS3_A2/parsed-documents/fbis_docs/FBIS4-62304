But Is Ready To Consider a Draft Temporary Cease-Fire Agreement"] [Text] A recent statement made by the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs following aggravation in the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border has caused discontent in Tajik opposition circles. The statement said that the "leadership of a number of intransigent opposition groupings affiliated with the Tajikistan Islamic Revival Movement [TIRM] is getting ready to launch a spring-summer `onslaught' which is planned to begin with armed provocations on the Tajik-Afghan border. In these circumstances the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs deems it necessary to state that the Russian leadership regards the planned armed provocations as a threat to the interests of security not only of Tajikistan but also Russia ... and it... will take adequate steps to stop them." On 11 May the TIRM came out with a response statement which says, "We have fought for our civil rights, for the possibility freely to live and work in our motherland, and we shall continue to fight for this.... We have nothing against the CIS Collective Peacekeeping Forces present in Tajikistan to protect the republic against foreign intervention. But they, under the treaty, must not interfere in the internal Tajik conflict." The document also notes, "...the statement by the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs in which Russia's foreign policy department... threatens to take `adequate' measures arouses bewilderment. ...Neither Afghanistan nor any other country is going to threaten the security of Tajikistan or other CIS countries. We, the citizens of Tajikistan, temporarily staying outside the Republic, including in Afghanistan, want to return to our Motherland," while "the real threat to security... are those forces that prevent a peaceful settlement of the conflict," the authors of the document point out. Nonetheless the TIRM declares its readiness to consider a draft temporary cease-fire on the Tajik-Afghan border and to observe the terms of the agreement after it has been signed. The statement stresses that in the course of inter-Tajik negotiations in Moscow in April the opposition delegation proposed a draft temporary cease-fire agreement but "the other side did not want to discuss it, which testifies to the destructive position of the Dushanbe regime."
