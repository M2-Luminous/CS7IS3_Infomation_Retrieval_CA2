Higher inflation, higher interest rates and a dearth of foreign investment are just some of the worries if we don't bring violence under control. The precipitous 13 percent collapse of the financial rand R5.71 [rand] to the US dollar on Monday is a stark warning to all South Africans that unless violence in the country abates, we may not have an economy left after the election later this month. The freefall in the investment currency was sparked off by a failed four-leader summit, coming on top of television images of bodies lying in the streets in central Johannesburg after an Inkatha Freedom Party protest march. As such it is a stark indication of just how jaundiced a view foreign investors are taking about our flirtation with anarchy. They've voted with their feet and sold at any cost. They'll also be hard to entice the second time around. Although overseas investors may succumb to attractive yields as the discount between the financial and commercial rands widens on political uncertainty, it's not speculation we want to encourage by long-term confidence in the country. Without foreign investment, massive reconstruction has little chance of going ahead. And the expectations of the electorate of free homes and education under the ANC's ambitious R39 billion Reconstruction and Development Programme will likely be dashed. The finrand is specifically designed to protect and absorb political shocks and to discourage foreign investors from removing their money from the country -- and it's arguably the best barometer of overseas confidence in South Africa. Unfortunately, bearish sentiment in the finrand market inevitably spills over onto the commercial rand market, as happened on Monday when the commercial rand fell to historic lows of R3.75 to the dollar. If the devaluation of the rand continues, imported inflationary pressure will start to hot up, which could encourage higher domestic inflation. This in turn could delay the long-awaited cut in interest rates -- in a worst-case scenario they could even rise. This could stop credit demand and retail sales picking up -- and consumer spending is a crucial factor in economic recovery. Although many economists were predicting growth of more than 4 percent for 1994 after more than four years of grinding recession, many are now predicting a deceleration of growth in the first quarter of 1994 because of the endemic violence and political uncertainty in the run-up to the election. And growth of at least 3 percent is needed simply to offset burgeoning population growth.
