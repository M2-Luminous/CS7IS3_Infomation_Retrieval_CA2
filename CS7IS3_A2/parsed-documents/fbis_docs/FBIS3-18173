However, recent developments in the conflict over security guarantees in East Europe, as well as the Yugoslav crisis permit us to reach some conclusions about the relative character of U.S. and West European support for a status quo. Clearly by now and for the foreseeable future, there are no prospects for a trustworthy dissuasive security guarantee by the West for East Europe. The vital interests of important West European powers in this region are mainly defined by the attempt to minimize the repercussions of social and nationalist conflicts--the principal concern being how to avoid a wave of refugees and immigrants--rather than by the preservation of the order that prevailed after 1945. The statements made last week by U.S. State Department officials and by German Chancellor Kohl, regarding the prohibitive costs of a military intervention in Bosnia, shed light on the limits of the West's trustworthiness in guaranteeing stability in East Europe. Throughout the 19th century and the period between the two world wars, the status quo and its preservation were part of the balance of power system. Today, the common denominator of the goals of the main Western powers in East Europe and the Balkans is the attempt to minimize the repercussions of a long-lasting destabilizing situation. In light of the above, the West's real security policy in East Europe and the Balkans seems to be the handling of a troublesome change in the postwar order of things at the least possible cost. This development is of the utmost importance to Greece, a country that links its vital interests with the defense of the present order of things in the Balkans. Close to our northern border and centering on the fragile Skopje republic, there are foci of crisis that can threaten the status quo of international borders at any moment. Under present conditions, the probability of a decisive preventive and stabilizing diplomatic intervention by the West in Kosovo or in Skopje aimed at a political settlement of the problems of the Albanian-speaking population must be excluded. The West's intervention in a potential conflict in the southern area of former Yugoslavia will be limited to restraining the expansion of an ongoing confrontation that already has abolished the present order of things, without the possibility of applying pressure for a return to the "status quo ante." Consequently, the statement that Athens is a force in the preservation of the status quo in the Balkans is insufficient. The United States and West Europe's limited intervention capabililities in support of this status quo bring into focus the planning of a Greek foreign and defense policy aimed at handling the change in the present order of things in the Balkans. The fluidity of today's order of things there and the West's inability to provide essential guarantees in its support militate in favor of a flexible Greek Balkan policy that would avoid bilateral obligations and inflexible positions in conflicts and arguments that, according to all indications, will follow their own course. When, for the umpteenth time, Washington repeats that the importance of the Bosnia conflict in its foreign policy ranks lower than the Middle East and developments in Russia, it is clear that this hierarchization applies to all Balkan conflicts. The prohibitive cost of a land intervention in Bosnia will also apply to Kosovo and Skopje. Undoubtedly, the emphasis with which Athens--through the statements of both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition--confirmed its alignment with the policy of the United States and of its European Union partners to support the Balkan status quo was positive and stabilizing. However, this was not sufficient to avoid doubts, and does not make the West's verbal guarantees any more credible.
