It reviewed Arab and domestic activities that took place in the Kingdom during the past few days, particularly the results of yesterday's visit to Jordan by Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. The JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY has learned that the prime minister explained to the council that during this visit, the negotiating position on all fronts was reviewed, with an emphasis on the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Cairo, which were held with an Egyptian participation to arrive at an agreement on the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Dr. al-Majali indicated that 'Amr Musa explained that there are three major points which are still being negotiated between the Palestinians and Israelis. The first is supervision of traffic over bridges and sovereignty over them. The second is the size of the Jericho region from which the Israeli Army will withdraw. The third point is the security control of border areas which will be evacuated, especially in the Gaza Strip. During the visit, Musa affirmed that contrary to the Israeli Government's allegation, the Palestinian and Israeli sides have not reached an agreement in Cairo, but that a paper was presented by the Israeli side which proposed that the Palestinian side study it and agree on it with competent PLO authorities. During Musa's visit, bilateral relations were also discussed, especially with respect to the meetings of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Joint Committee. It was agreed to activate this committee and to convene it under the chairmanship of both countries' prime ministers. In accordance with the regular order of its meetings, the committee will hold its next meeting in Amman soon. During the session, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs, reviewed the most important results that have been reached on the bilateral level with the Qatari side during Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabir Al Thani's recent visit to Jordan. It was agreed to set up a joint bilateral committee under the Jordanian minister of state for affairs and the Qatari foreign minister to discuss all bilateral issues of interest to the two countries, including economic, political, and media issues, as well as joint investments and cooperation between the private sectors in both countries.
