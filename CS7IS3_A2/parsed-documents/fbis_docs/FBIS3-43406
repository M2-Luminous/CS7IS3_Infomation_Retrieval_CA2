Speaking at the end of a tripartite meeting attended by the government, Renamo, and UN Operations in Mozambique officials in Maputo today, Maj. Lauchande said Renamo agreed to inform the chairman of the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] by tomorrow morning about the area where its men will be deployed. The government has rejected Renamo's suggestion that its forces withdraw up to 700 meters from where they are stationed. CCF chairman Colonel (Sitela) says the dispute could be resolved if Renamo accepts the proposals that have been made. Renamo is supposed to withdraw 30 km south of Salamanga or 10 km northeast of the town, instead of 700 meters.
