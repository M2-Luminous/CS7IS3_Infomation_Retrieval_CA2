After debating a list of eight candidates presented by an ad hoc high-level commission for several weeks, Orellana Mercado and Florentino Alvarez Alvarado [the new deputy prosecutor general] were elected by the congressional plenary last Thursday. Orellana Mercado addressed the deputies briefly after he was sworn in and promised to do his work with loyalty to the country, people, and God. He said he would make efforts to strengthen the pillars of democracy and guarantee that all Hondurans are finally able to enjoy a state of law and happiness together with their families. "I will contribute so that, together with you, we can build the country's future," Orellana Mercado told the deputies. Alvarez Alvarado was not sworn in as deputy prosecutor general last night because, due to personal reasons, he was unable to attend the Congress session. He will, thus, be sworn in the coming days.
