FBIS3-46509 "dreas001__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-001-A Document Type:Daily Report 3 January 1994 ANNEX Japan MITI on Joint U.S. Plane Development Plan OW2612130393 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 Dec 93 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2612130393 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] will review a plan, which Boeing Corporation of the United States and Japanese aircraft manufacturers jointly have been promoting, for the development of the next-generation medium-sized passenger airplane (YXX). It will do so because the YXX development plan became virtually dead in the wake of Boeing Corporation's decision to give priority to the development of new passenger airplane (737X), which will carry almost the same number of passengers as the YXX. Starting in fiscal 1994, the ministry wants to suspend the development plan for the time being and ultimately start it afresh. The YXX development plan is the first joint project, which Japan and the Untied States started on equal terms. Together with a plan to develop short-range medium-sized passenger airplane (YSX), it has been considered as a pillar of Japan's aircraft development. The YXX is a medium-sized passenger airplane, which can carry about 150 passengers. Japanese manufacturers, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries, and Boeing Corporation started the joint development in 1981. The Japanese Government and industries joined the project to take over 25 percent of the share in the development project. So far, they have conducted research to improve energy efficiency of the aircraft and studied the trend of market demand for the aircraft. MITI earmarked 613 million yen for the project in its fiscal 1994 budget request. MITI wants to start the YXX plan afresh because Boeing Corporation officially decided recently to develop medium-sized passenger airplane called 737X, which can carry from 100 to 160 passengers. It is an aircraft that will succeed the Boeing 737 series. More than 3,000 Boeing 737's have been sold so far. Since it is not a completely new development project, development costs of the 737X will be kept low. Also, it is expected that the aircraft will be in great demand. Because of this, MITI concluded that they cannot expect a big demand for the YXX and that the development of the YXX, which will compete with the 737X, is not commercially feasible. MITI plans to suspend the development starting in fiscal 1994 after consulting with aircraft manufacturers and Japan Aircraft Development Association, which acts as a contact point for the YXX plan. MITI, which wants to start the project afresh ultimately, plans to inform the Boeing Corporation of its intention in the near future and call for its understanding. Regarding the budget request, MITI will ask the Finance Ministry for 500 million yen, which will be used to pay for the interest of development expenses spent so far.
