In Delhi Havel will meet Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma, at whose invitation the visit takes place and Indian Premier Narasimh P. V. Rao. He will also travel to Varanasi and Calcutta, where he will visit Mother Theresa's mission. On February 11 Havel will visit Thailand at the invitation of the king of Thailand, Phumiphon Adunyadet. Besides meeting the king, Havel will meet Thai Premier Chuan Likphai and Chairman of Parliament Marut Benneg. This is Havel's second trip to Asia which he visited in April 1992 in his capacity as Czechoslovak president. He went then to Japan and South Korea and on his way back home he made a short stop-over in India. "One of the goals of my current visit to Asia is to emphasize the Czech Republic's membership in the United Nations Security Council and our share of responsibility for world developments ensuing from this membership. We also want to point out that also far distant countries are very important for the Czech Republic," Havel said before his departure.
