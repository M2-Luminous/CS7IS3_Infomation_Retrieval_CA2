FBIS4-37097 "drnes117_a_94002" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 ARAB AFRICA Algeria FIS Leader Claims Zeroual Broke Agreement FIS Leader Claims Zeroual Broke Agreement PM1606114094 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 15 Jun 94 p4h PM1606114094 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Report by Jamal Khashuqji: "Belhadj Attacks Zeroual and Accuses Him of `Falsifying and Distorting Facts'"] [Excerpts] London -- The Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] has distributed the text of a letter sent by Cheikh Ali Belhadj from his prison in Blida to President Liamine Zeroual accusing him of breaking an agreement and of "distortion of facts, falsification, and fabrication." He was replying to a statement made by Zeroual over two months ago charging that FIS did not honor its promise to stop the violence. [passage omitted] An informed Algerian source has told AL-HAYAH that the Algerian crisis "has reached a security and political climax," and that the number of people killed in the ranks of the Islamists and government forces "has reached 100 daily, and the poor channels of contact and dialogue which raised some hopes over the past six months have been closed." The same source spoke of a meeting held between a former Algerian official, Islamist leaderships interested in Algerian affairs, and the FIS leadership abroad. He said that the meeting concluded that "the invisible [Algerian] leadership which toppled President Bendjedid and revoked the elections won by the FIS is the very same leadership which brought Zeroual to power, and that the escalation of violence against FIS supporters is done with the knowledge of that leadership and in accordance with its plans." The Algerian official disclosed to the FIS leadership "details of armed groups manipulated by security organs headed by Major General Mohamed Lemari who is continuing his work despite the recent changes in the Algerian Army." The source downplayed the French role which he described as "existent but not serious. Algeria is not Gabon and many things take place without Paris' approval." He emphasized that the all-out confrontation, the large-scale security operations, the summary executions, and reprisals against families of the mujahidin "all take place in accordance with a decision by the real command within the Army." [passage omitted] Sources close to the FIS say that it is currently trying to unite its military ranks and intensify its political campaign. At the beginning of the current month it announced the formation of the Military Committee for the West [al-lajnah al-'askariyah lilgharb] and described that move as a "structuring of the FIS' military wing." This is the first time FIS has admitted the existence of its military wing. "It seems to be trying to block the way for the independent groups, especially the armed Islamic groups trying to inherit FIS' leading position in Algeria on the grounds that the FIS is a political party and has no military activity."
