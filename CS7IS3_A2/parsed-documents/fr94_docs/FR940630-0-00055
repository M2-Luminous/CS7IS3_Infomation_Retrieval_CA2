The Cleveland Charity Classic will have an estimated 20&hyph;30 offshore powerboats, racing in a closed course which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. This regulation is needed to provide for the safety of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during the event. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective at 11 a.m. (EDST) until 2 p.m. (EDST), July 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William A. Thibodeau, Marine Science Technician Second Class, U.S. Coast Guard, Aids to Navigation and Waterways Management Branch, Ninth Coast Guard District, 1240 East 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44199&hyph;2060, (216) 522&hyph;3990. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth Coast Guard District until May 19, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish a proposed rule in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are Scott J. Smith, Lieutenant Junior Grade, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Officer, Aids to Navigation & Waterways Management Branch and Karen E. Lloyd, Lieutenant, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Attorney, Ninth Coast Guard District Legal Office. Discussion of Regulations The Cleveland Charity Classic will be held on Cleveland Harbor on July 23, 1994. This event will have an estimated 20&hyph;30 offshore race boats, racing a closed course race on Lake Erie, Cleveland Harbor, which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. This regulation is necessary to ensure the protection of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during this event. The effect of this regulation will be to restrict general navigation on that portion of Lake Erie, Cleveland Harbor, in an area triangular in shape, from the Cleveland Waterworks Intake Crib Light (LLNR 4030), thence to the West Pier Light (LLNR 4185), thence to the Disposal Light B (LLNR 4045), back to the point of origin, for the safety of spectators and participants. Any vessel desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast Guard Station Cleveland Harbor, OH). This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165. Federalism Implications This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. Economic Assessment and Certification This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget Under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary. Collection of Information This regulation will impose no collection information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
