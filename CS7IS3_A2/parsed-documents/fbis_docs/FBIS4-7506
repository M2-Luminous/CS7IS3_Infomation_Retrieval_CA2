Ivo Komsic, president, and Luka Markesic, Petar (?Josolic), and Ivan Lovrenovic, all members of the Croatian National Council, today held a press conference at which they stated their position regarding the role of this body in implementing the provisions of the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia- Herzegovina adopted yesterday. Mladen Bosnjak has the details. [Begin recording] [Bosnjak] Ivo Komsic, president of the Croatian National Council, assessed the session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly -- which ended yesterday -- as being a historic turning point for many reasons, and not only for our state, but also for the Republic of Croatia. He assessed that the newly adopted Constitution was proof of Bosnia-Herzegovina's strength. The historic quality of the Constitution is evident in the fact that its contents evolved from the utmost suffering of our state and its citizens. Establishing the place and role of the Croatian National Council, Ivo Komsic said that the Congress of Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats had defined a project around which it was possible to achieve complete accord, and added: [Komsic] Now that we have a Constitution, it is the Croatian National Council's duty to invest all its strength and potential into implementing this Constitution, to do [words indistinct], and to fulfill its duty to the utmost, a duty for which this body was formed in the first place. We shall, of course, support this and do everything that will be required of us in the course of implementing this Constitution -- both in the political sense and on the ground, where very concrete tasks will have to carried out .... [Bosnjak] For Luka Markesic, Franciscan friar and believer, the most important thing now was to restore the love and the strength of spirit in the people, victims of war, so that they can in peace bear and overcome their hatred and thoughts of revenge. Petar (?Josolic) stressed that one of the roles of the Croatian National Council would be [words indistinct] when the Croats from Vares and the Muslims from Capljina return to their homes -- they and all the others. [passage omitted] [Bosnjak] After the introductory greetings -- of which you have heard the most significant details -- correspondents' asked two questions. Ivo Komsic answered both. First, about the candidates for the highest offices in the Federation. [Komsic] Between now and the next Assembly session, we shall be coordinating our positions regarding [changes thought] and we shall try to reach a consensus on this in the Croatian deputy caucus -- which is now being formed from the rest of the caucuses that are already in the parliament -- just as we reached a consensus in political negotiations regarding this project. [Bosnjak] The other question pertained to the Croatian National Council's position toward the possibility of a confederation of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Serbia, after the possible participation of the Bosnian Serbs in the Federation of Bosnia- Herzegovina. Ivan Lovrenovic stressed that there were no definite answers to this. Mr. Komsic stressed that the Croatian National Council cannot support the possibility of any kind of confederal arrangement between the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia. [Komsic] [Words indistinct] of confederal relations with Croatia, why then should we not have a confederal relationship with Serbia? The reason for not doing so is very simple; Serbia has carried out aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina with the help of the Serbian Democratic Party, which formed a para-state here. There can be no political or moral justification for such an act, and the world cannot support it. The aggressor must be punished in some way. [end recording]
