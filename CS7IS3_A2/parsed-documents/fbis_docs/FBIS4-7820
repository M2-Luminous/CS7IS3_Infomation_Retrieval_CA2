Abdic told the Yugoslav magazine SVET that he welcomed every step towards a lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that the Washington Moslem-Croat agreement was positive on condition it was not another Moslem-Croat coalition against the Serb people. He said the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina would not stop until all three warring sides -- Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- were brought to the negotiating table to reach an agreement on just and lasting peace. Abdic set out Izetbegovic was to blame for the two-year bloodshed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although the world had without any proof largely demonized the Serb people. Izetbegovic is not interested in peace and his fundamentalist policy is aimed solely at creating an Islamic state in the Balkans, Abdic set out and said his departure from the political stage would be a relief to everyone, most of all Moslems, said Abdic. Abdic stated that his policy was mainly aimed at achieving peace. He said that the APWB and the R.S., the state of Bosnian Serbs, had signed an agreement on the cessation of hostilities and establishing of cooperation in the fields of economy, culture and sport. The APWB had also signed an agreement on cooperation with the republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 on the ethnic and historical territories in the former Yugoslav republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslav federation. Abdic had also signed with the state of Bosnian Croats -- Herceg-Bosna, an agreement of the same content. According to the Moslem-controlled Sarajevo Radio, some 500 Moslems were killed and over 2,000 were wounded so far in the clashes between Izetbegovic's and Abdic's over the past six months. A moderate Moslem politician, Abdic, opposes the belligerent policy of fundamentalist Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic and has proclaimed the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (APWB) last September.
