The United States at first planned to have a discussion on a resolution which the ROK, Japan, and the United States had drafted at a session of the five permanent members early this week to pass it as soon as possible. However, the countries reportedly are having difficulties in reaching accord among themselves. As a result, it will take some time to present a draft resolution on sanctions against North Korea to the UN Security Council. The United States, which had been playing a leading role in passing a resolution, had a tripartite consultation with the ROK and Japan in Washington and New York and coordinated views among the five permanent members of the Security Council toward the end of last week. However, the United States seems to be embarrassed because it realized the difficulty in passing a resolution. In short, countries concerned do not positively support the United States' ideas on the timing and method of the sanctions. The attitudes of China and Russia may be understandable to the United States. However, Japan, a major country concerned, expressed the view that it cannot accept the United States' plan on sanctions. The two countries have reached agreement on sanctions in principle. However, they have significantly different views on details of the sanction plan, including how to impose sanctions. The consultation among the ROK, the United States, and Japan which took place in Washington on 3 and 4 June (Washington time) is the proof of the difficulties in passing a resolution. That day's meeting was intended to draft a resolution. They agreed on a general idea on sanctions for two days of separate and expanded meetings. However, they reportedly failed to reach agreement on what should be included in the sanctions. For example, no agreement was reached as to whether sanctions will be imposed immediately after a resolution is passed or whether a certain grace period will be given to North Korea to see North Korea's reaction to the sanctions. Still, the three countries appeared to have agreed that the effectuation of sanctions must not be delayed for very long. The problem was how to impose sanctions. Kim Sam-hun, the ROK nuclear ambassador, and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Gallucci reportedly had no different views. However, (Sunji Yanai), chief of a bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, expressed his opposition in many respects. Japan said that it "would cooperate on matters in which it can under the constitution." It also said that it is not necessary to hastily present a draft resolution. It is expected that the passage of a resolution will be delayed not only because it is difficult to draft a resolution, but because countries concerned still want to try to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. The United States and other Western countries want to leave the door open for North Korea's acceptance of special inspections of the two unreported facilities in Yongbyon, the final exit.
