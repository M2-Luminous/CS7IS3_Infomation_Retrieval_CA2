The resolution called on all countries concerned to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and to place their nuclear weapons under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. What makes this important step for consolidating world peace in this sensitive part of the world more significant is that the approval of Egypt's proposal to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons was coupled with another resolution, which Egypt voted for, on Israel's nuclear weapons. The resolution called directly on Israel to renounce the possession of nuclear weapons and join the nonproliferation treaty. Egypt's call, which was backed by the UN General Assembly, was not born accidentally or imposed by certain circumstances. It stemmed from the Egyptian leadership's firm belief that world peace is indivisible and that it is high time to end the state of armed struggle in the Middle East so that the people may give more attention to economic and social development to create a better tomorrow for future generations. [passage omitted] The UN General Assembly's resolution calling for freeing the Middle East of nuclear weapons is a practical way to help promote the ongoing peace efforts exerted by the international community. It will prevent those countries that possess nuclear weapons from threatening their neighbors and imposing their will on them. It will also prevent other countries from attempting to obtain these destructive weapons in a bid to ward off the nuclear threat against them. In addition, it will help put the brakes on all types of arms races by the region's countries and eliminate all potential hazards that may result from radiation in the densely populated Middle East region. More importantly, the resolution paves the way for the disputing parties to regain confidence in each other, which would ultimately help them meet half way to achieve a just peace that guarantees the legitimate rights of all the region's countries. Egypt's call to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons is a new addition to the extensive efforts that President Mubarak has been exerting for years to promote peace between the Arabs and Israel at the international level. At the same time, it affirms Egypt's deep belief in the strategy of peace as the only way for reaching an understanding among the region's countries and highlights the need for all countries in the region not to violate it, regardless of the excuses they use as a facade. Through the United Nations, Egypt has opened the door for all regional countries to prove their goodwill and seriousness in their quest for peace and to get rid of nuclear weapons. When will the regional countries that possess nuclear weapons respond to the world community's peaceful call?
