That emerged from calculations by the research department of the Kredietbank. In 1994 wages will increase in Belgium 0.6 percent quicker than in its five most important trading partners, expressed in a single currency. In 1995 there will be a slight improvement, according to the report. Toward the end of the month the CRB [Central Council for Industry] will again issue an opinion on how the competitiveness of Belgian companies is developing. The CRB will base itself on the figures of the OECD. The Kredietbank has already calculated the conclusions which the CRB will reach. From the calculations it appears that company competitiveness is further deteriorating in 1994, despite wage restraint and other measures in the Dehaene government's crisis plan. The explanation is simple: Belgium's trading partners are also making an effort to keep down wages. In addition, the Belgian franc -- after weakening in the fourth quarter of 1993 -- has once again increased in value. The result is that Belgium's competitive disadvantage in wage costs compared to its five major trading partners (Germany, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Italy) will increase in 1994 from 4.1 percent to 4.9 percent. Compared with Belgium's seven biggest trading partners (the five plus the United States and Japan). The competitive disadvantage will increase from 4.7 percent to 5.3 percent. Assuming that the franc's exchange rate remains stable in 1994 and 1995, then the competitive disadvantage should decline in 1995 to around the 1993 level. The end of the tunnel as regards the restoration of Belgium's competitive position was not yet in sight, the Kredietbank's research department concluded. However, it is possible that the CRB figures will differ from the Kredietbank's. The discussion between trade unions and employers within the CRB concerns the very question of the impact of the crisis plan on wage developments in Belgium.
