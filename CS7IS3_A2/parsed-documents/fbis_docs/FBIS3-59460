When it is taken into account that the new Serbian state in Bosnia has its own government news agency, and government radio and television as well, all the necessary conditions have been met for the optimum functioning of a legal and political community, which, to be frank, also has a very strong army and police in addition to the institutions mentioned already. The news media, above all television and radio, impart particular importance and features to everything that has been said so far about the attributes of RS statehood, which were brought about under the difficult reality of war, which has persisted for nearly two years now. In singling out radio and television, we did not mean to underestimate the importance and role of the many publications operating on the territory of the RS, but only to recall the special place they have in informing the Serbian people. Recently, for instance, media interest in the RS has been centered not only on the events of the war, but also on the political activity of certain political parties, above all the Serbian Democratic Party [SDS]. However, the political activity of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], the Socialist Party of the RS, and other parties, and indeed even certain associations and political organizations not organized as parties, is just as important. After all, the very fact that during the birth and evolution of the new Serbian state a multiparty system has grown up out of the social and political stratification of the Serbian people, which is an essential condition of parliamentary democracy, places a special imprint on the upcoming democratic and multiparty elections in the RS, which will be held when all the necessary conditions are brought about. It should be emphasized that even the present Assembly of the RS is a multiparty body, although the SDS has a sizable majority. The thaw in the activity of the political parties registered in the RS has not been given proper weight or treatment in the media, especially television. There is no doubt that this can be seen when various news releases and reports are issued for the public and are addressed to the Serbian people and thereby also to the membership of the parties addressing them through the media. The most recent example is the news item recently broadcast from the television studio in Pale on the Second Newscast concerning the news conference held by the Serbian Radical Party in Banja Luka. The only message to the public from the leadership of the Serbian Radicals of the RS reported from that news conference in that news item was that the instruments of the law-governed state are being applied more effectively on the territory of the RS, and that is all! Can it be that nothing more was said at that news conference of the SRS of the RS about anything else happening in the RS? Did that party's leadership really summon a sizable number of journalists just for one sentence?! Nor are we inclined to believe that the leadership of any party which intends to participate seriously in the proceedings of the parliament of a state, and that would thereby also apply to the leadership of the SRS of the RS, would dare to send to the public by fax or other means of communication just one sentence about its discussion with the newsmen. The costs of such a project (!) would be much greater than the political effect they might achieve by their presentation to the members of the media. This is not an isolated case. A similar fate has befallen news releases and reports issued from news conferences of other political parties, except for the Serbian Democratic Party, whose record so far on behalf of the RS has not been challenged by anyone. But the way in which news releases of other political parties are issued through the government news media, especially RS Television, which beyond all doubt is the one most watched and and the most influential, is not fair and should be changed immediately. After all, a piece of news, however important and subtly written, cannot have great value if its broadcast time on television is reduced to a mere 20 seconds or so! The media neglect of the political activity of certain political parties in the RS, whether the blockade by the leading news media is deliberate or inadvertent, constitutes a negative political legacy which thousands of Serbs belonging to various political parties will be looking at in the upcoming election campaigns in the RS. After all, the upcoming multiparty elections in the Serbian republic Krajina and then in Serbia as well, will have a strong political impact on overall political events in the Srpska republic. And if there should be a political solution for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina in the near future, one that is acceptable to all three nationalities involved in the conflict, the scheduling of the first multiparty and democratic elections in the RS will not be so far off.
