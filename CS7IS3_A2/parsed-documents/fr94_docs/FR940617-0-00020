FR940617-0-00020 FR940617-0-00004 This rule reflects the committees' and the Department's appraisal of the need to revise the pack requirements for California nectarines and peaches in volume-filled containers, as specified. The Department's determination is that this rule will have a beneficial impact on producers, handlers, and consumers of California nectarines and peaches. This rule revises pack requirements for fresh California nectarines and peaches in volume-filled containers, enabling handlers to pack such fruit consistent with desirable packing practices, and is needed to help the California nectarine and peach industries maintain the quality of fruit shipped to the fresh market. This rule is designed to establish and maintain orderly marketing conditions for these fruits in the interest of producers, handlers, and consumers. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matters presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees, and other information, it is found that the rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) Shipment of the 1994 season crop of fresh California nectarines and peaches is currently underway; (2) this rule relaxes pack requirements for both nectarines and peaches; (3) California nectarine and peach handlers are aware of these revised pack requirements recommended by the committees at public meetings, and they will need no additional time to comply with such requirements; and (4) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any written comments received will be considered prior to any finalization of this interim final rule.
