It has now been given the name of Eurofighter and still has problems flying. Is this project, which involves enormous sums, too big for the industry? [Piller] Let us talk about the name. The name Fighter-90 developed -- similar to the term "great bugging campaign" -- as a result of public discussion. Eurofighter is not the final name either. One should always give things a name that describes the contents properly. What is important is that it is a European air defense aircraft. [Schmalz] But the air defense aircraft is not yet able to fly. Is the project too complicated? [Piller] It is complicated because it is one of the most extraordinary high-technology projects in Europe. However, it is certainly not too big a challenge for the European aviation industry in the technological sense. Quite the contrary. With projects like the Tornado and the Airbus, the Europeans have proven that they are capable of top achievements. The Tornado is the best fighter aircraft of its kind, and the Airbus family belongs to the technical vanguard in the civilian aviation industry. Yet the difficult political process of arriving at a decision did not promote the project. You can imagine how difficult it is to tell a crew of thousands of technicians and engineers alternately to stop and to continue their work. Moreover, there was the crash of the Gripen interceptors... [Schmalz] ...a Swedish prototype. [Piller] ...which requires great care. We must not forget that aircraft of this kind are aerodynamically unstable. Only a highly complicated control mechanism keeps them in the air. The software is of decisive significance here because we do not want to take any risks. Also, there is no hurry because, if the European combat plane is to be bought by the Bundeswehr in the year 2002 or even 2003, it will still be early enough if the maiden flight takes place some time this year. [Schmalz] The problem regarding software seems to be that numerous countries and an even larger number of firms are involved in the development. [Piller] I am not sure whether this is the reason for the delay. Cooperation is difficult because it took such a long time for the four responsible countries to agree on the tasks that the aircraft has to fulfill. The borders in Europe were also a problem. Goods are involved here that fall under the war weapons control law. I have repeatedly been informed about delays that were linked with the German foreign trade law -- if components had to be transported to other European countries, for example, that had to be integrated into a subsystem. In fact, we always claim that we no longer want any borders, but we Germans are doing a great deal in this sphere to maintain the borders and to prevent European harmonization regulations. [Schmalz] When will the first European fighter fly? [Piller] We are confident that the first prototype built by us in Manching will make its first flight late in the spring. [Schmalz] The industry is being accused of juggling with the prices. Might this still lead to a failure of the fighter plane? [Piller] I do not think so because, on the basis of the offer submitted by the industry, the prices mentioned at the time are being adjusted according to a certain procedure. This is one aspect. On the other hand, however, one must bear in mind that a development project extending over several years is involved here upon whose completion a decision will be made as to whether it will be purchased or not. This is an unusual case. Moreover, the responsible officials have not made any final statements as to what the aircraft should look like and, above all, how many units are to be produced. [Schmalz] Will the aircraft be produced on a large-scale basis? [Piller] I proceed from this premise because I still believe in a certain rationality among politicians. If politicians think rationally, they must be aware that national defense and fulfilling the duties within the alliance are not possible without national armed forces. As the example of Yugoslavia has shown, these duties cannot be fulfilled without a functioning air defense. [Schmalz] Is the awareness of the need for defense decreasing? [Piller] Yes, indeed. Yet the pendulum has starting swinging in the other direction again. Shortly after reunification and the collapse of the Soviet Union, 85 percent of the Germans were convinced that eternal peace would break out. However, a glance at the newspapers shows that we are confronted with a larger number of conflicts that also affect Europe today than at any time in the past. [Schmalz] A man like Zhirinovskiy might also open people's eyes... [Piller] As a citizen of this country, I hope that we will realize our interests, opportunities, and dangers without such phenomena. However, the awareness that vigilance and readiness for defense continue to be necessary is certainly being promoted by people like Mr. Zhirinovskiy. [Schmalz] Your employer is the German Aerospace Company, which offers a considerable range of military products. How do you feel about the term "weapons concern"? [Piller] I have two different feelings. First, the precondition for your question does not exist because the share of defense technology in the German Aerospace has dropped to 27 percent. Second, I believe that stability and peace must be paid for and defended if need be. To ensure that, products are required that must be developed and produced. In Germany, the term weapons industry belongs to the arsenal of rhetorical and semantic warfare. It certainly has a negative connotation in our country. However, I would like to use it in a positive way and claim: Possessing weapons means having the required instruments for all vicissitudes of life. In the private sphere, this is a matter of course for us. We take out insurances for household equipment and against fires and old age insurances, and we attach utmost significance to a good education for our children. Should all this be wrong in the public sector? [Schmalz] A controversy erupted at the international aviation and aerospace exhibition in Berlin two years ago over a wooden model of the Fighter-90. This year the German Aerospace does not participate in the exhibition. Is there a link? [Piller] The decision was exclusively made on economic grounds. The management believed that the costs for the participation were too high in view of the closure of works and the reduction of jobs. [Schmalz] The threat was heard in German aerospace circles that production might be transferred abroad. Has Germany become too expensive for you? [Piller] There can be no talk of a threat because we are confronted with natural economic laws that cannot be avoided. If we close plants and reduce jobs, this means that we are adapting our structures to competition and the economic development in the world. [Schmalz] If the economy should recover, industrial jobs that have been eliminated under great difficulties will certainly not be restored easily. [Piller] You are right. We are slowly starting to realize that numerous legal stipulations, collective agreement provisions, and other regulations have become unintended barriers that have a negative impact on the economy. Jobs that have been abolished under difficult conditions and high costs will in all likelihood not be recreated in Germany. The wage cost factor is only one aspect. The ossification of old structures and the difficulty to change and adapt them are an equally strong factor. [Schmalz] You just mentioned the war weapons control law. Do you consider it to be part of the ossified structures? [Piller] The German position on the export of military equipment and goods that can be used for civilian and military purposes is increasingly turning out to be the big obstacle to European integration. In fact, we like to stress day in, day out, and particularly in Sunday speeches the need of integration. Yet the unilateral German measures are a barrier. The aviation and aerospace industry suffer particularly. Contrary to the tank and shipbuilding industries and the production of ammunition, up to 80 percent of our projects are carried out on the basis of international cooperation. If we want to survive, we will have to prove our ability to cooperate. However, this means that our partners must be able to rely on our deliveries. Experience has shown that particularly the French and the British no longer want to depend on internal German developments. European cooperation is increasingly taking place without the German industry. We know that the British and the French are already developing technologies for the successor generation of the Tornado and the European air defense aircraft. Initial talks have already taken place without the Germans because we are no longer considered reliable partners. If we stick to our position, there will no longer be a German defense industry over the medium term. And there will certainly no longer be a military aviation and aerospace industry, because an industry that is not able to cooperate will cease to exist in this area. [Schmalz] You are cooperating intensively with the French on the helicopter project Eurocopter. There is considerable ill feeling over our "dual use" regulations. [Piller] The helicopter is a classical "dual use" example. Like numerous other products, a civilian helicopter can also be used for military purposes. There will never be a satisfactory solution to this problem. Yet we should stop convincing Europe that we have the only right standards and yardsticks. Europe is not willing to follow the German model. [Schmalz] You sound as though you were announcing the death of the German high technology industry. [Piller] In any event, the situation is very serious. However, I am confident that the awareness of these dramatic developments is also growing in Bonn and, above all, in the Foreign Ministry. [Schmalz] Thus, you are still hoping? [Piller] My hope is based on some signs that can only be discerned with a very sensitive instruments. [Schmalz] Have you discussed this topic with the candidate for chancellor of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]? [Piller] I had the opportunity of holding a longer conversation with him. I have the impression that the awareness of this problems is also increasing in the SPD on a broad basis. [Schmalz] Both the United States and France are proud of their successes in the aviation and aerospace industry. In Germany, one has the feeling that the strategic significance of this industry is not being recognized. [Piller] Unfortunately, your description of the situation is not wrong. Yet we are convinced that the aviation and aerospace industry belongs to the great technological potentials of the future. In the United States, in Japan, but also in China and other Southeast Asian countries, and naturally in France and Great Britain, it is being recognized as an integrating part of the economy for structural, technological, and political reasons. In Germany, this awareness does not exist, but we are all making efforts to promote it. [Schmalz] Who is "all"? The teachers, for example? [Piller] This is an important point: I believe that we must also set new priorities in the sphere of education. Natural science and technical training are not accorded the required significance. In Japan, the share of engineers and natural scientists among younger people is three times as high as in Germany. This has an impact on the acceptance of technology. [Schmalz] Is that a hidden call for political leadership? [Piller] I have a very old fashioned concept of political leadership which was shaped when I was still cooperating closely with Franz Josef Strauss. For me, political leadership is convincing people of what is necessary. This requires the courage to tell people that we need an economic basis for a national weapons industry, and that we urgently need the technological potentials of the aviation and aerospace industry. [Schmalz] If a teacher called you, asking you for advice on how he can convince his students, what would you tell him? [Piller] I would advise him to take his students on a mental journey and to ask them to imagine a world without aviation and aerospace industry. It is the driving technological force of the national economy in the industrialized countries and an indispensable precondition for ensuring our living standard in the future, because this is only possible with the help of the most advanced technology of the aviation and aerospace industry. In a science fiction film oriented on the past, one would have to do without the usual weather chart, and the live transmission of a tennis match from Flushing Meadow would be impossible. Without satellite communication, without the mobility ensured by airplanes, and without the exploration of space, our lives would be completely different. I am firmly convinced that we only discovered the vulnerability of the earth's atmosphere after we started moving outside our planet. The mental trip would also make the students realize that the world would be different politically and economically. The GDP would only be 50 percent of the current volume, and starvation, oppression, and dictatorship would stand at twice the current extent. For me, it is no historic coincidence that the Soviet Union and many other dictatorships collapsed at a time when it became possible to spread information on freedom and justice across borders with the help of telecommunications. [Schmalz] Let us return from the mental journey to the tough reality. The conflict over subsidies between the European and the North American aviation industries was not resolved in the GATT round. Will a hot trade war break our in the air? [Piller] I hope not. Yet the following must be clear: The GATT negotiations represent a defeat for the European aviation industry because distortions of competition that threaten the existence of European aviation and which favor U.S. air carriers have been adopted. The United States is no longer interested in serious negotiations because it achieved its goal without talks -- the abolition of direct European subsidies. The United States will continue or even increase its extensive indirect subsidies for the civilian aviation industry, which currently amount to $2.7 billion annually, because these subsidies -- and particularly the military subsidies -- are not covered by the existing GATT disciplines. In view of the U.S. interests, it is imperative to create a suitable set of promotion instruments within a German or European framework. The simplest solution would be for the United States to stop subsidizing the research and technology projects of their industry with enormous sums. [Schmalz] The Europeans are also supporting the Airbus with sizable sums. [Piller] Historically, the direct promotion system has developed in Europe as a result of the numerous national states. This means that in Europe the development and production of large civilian aircraft is primarily being promoted through repayable loans and state-covered credits. In the United States, the indirect promotion of research and technology has developed. Billions of dollars are being provided by the defense budget for new technologies, engines, new wings, and experimental aircraft every year. The results are placed at the disposal of the industry. [Schmalz] What sums are involved? [Piller] This is difficult to say because there are also a great number of black boxes in the United States involving presumably between $2-3 billion -- projects that are subject to utmost secrecy. We estimate the annual subsidies for our competitors Boeing and McDonnel Douglas at $1 billion. This is a massive distortion of competition that cannot be justified in a private economy. [Schmalz] What is the solution? [Piller] The European Union should either persuade the Americans to stop this promotion, or the European Union should ensure that the Europeans receive the same subsidies. [Schmalz] Boeing now wants to develop a super jumbo together with the German Aerospace Company. Have the Americans chosen a junior partner whom they would like to swallow? [Piller] No, certainly not. This is not correct. The fact that Boeing talks with the Europeans at all shows that we are growing up and that we are being taken seriously as partners. The project itself -- an aircraft with up to 800 seats -- requires enormous investments which neither the United States nor the Europeans would be able to provide on their own. Only a trans- Atlantic cooperation can handle the comprehensive technological problems and the financial risks. [Schmalz] The fact that the United States has chosen the German aviation industry as a partner shows that it is not completely at the end... [Piller] No, but it is necessary to point out the distortions of competition stipulated in the GATT agreement in favor of the U.S. aviation industry and to remind the authorities time and again that the political framework conditions of the German aviation and aerospace industry have to be improved if it is to remain efficient.
