The Chinese have presented to Korea a proposal on joint manufacture of 25 auto parts including fuel systems, bearings and ABS (Anti-lock Brake System) and they are currently discussing the matter, the sources said. Liu Keming, vice president of the China National Automobile Import and Export Corp., will visit Seoul around June and decide on whether to approve Korean car imports after touring automaking and car parts manufacturing sites here. A KAMA official, who recently attended the working-level meeting of the Korea-China Automobile Industry Association conference held annually in rotation, said Liu would be bringing a blueprint on how many cars China intends to import. He said it was "a matter of time" before Korean cars make inroads into China as the latter is coming around to the idea, predicting July or August after Liu returns from his tour and winds up the necessary procedures. Beijing lifted its ban on car imports to some extent last year by formally allowing in 16,000 American autos and unofficially approving 8,200 Korean cars made by Daewoo Motor Co. The automobile industry associations of the two countries agreed to hold the first joint conference in Beijing or Changchun from Sept. 12-16 during the last working-level meeting April 13-16. China is expected to spell out its policy on Korean motor vehicle imports, including ways to promote investment in the completed car and auto parts industry and cooperation in parts at the joint conference.
