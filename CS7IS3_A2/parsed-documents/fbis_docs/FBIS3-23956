Approaches to the extension of mortgage credits on the real estate market are being developed and standard credit products convenient for consumers are being created. Sergey Ivanovich Potapov, member of the Council of Russia's Association of Mortgage Banks, president of the Yunifyucher Firm, told our correspondent about the state of the mentioned problem and ways of solving it. Talking about what is missing for the formation of a civilized real estate market in Russia, I want to dwell on the basic factors. First, the absence of a comprehensive mortgage law. Second, the absence of realistically operating mortgage mechanisms. Third, the absence of a unified computer service of registration of real estate facilities and deals with them. Fourth, the tax policy of the state does not fully take into account the justification for preferential terms for the subjects of the real estate market. Fifth, the training of new people working in this sphere has only begun. Sixth, the formation of a positive image. The extension of mortgage credits is one of the elements necessary for the creation of market relations; of course, not only in the housing sphere. However, mortgage in its present sense does not yet exist in Russia. Today we have a very distinctive "mortgage," all the problems of which are caused by the crisis state of the economy and by the lack of a comprehensive legislative base, without which it is impossible to fully actuate the classic mechanism of extension of mortgage credits. At the present stage, subjects of the real estate market--mortgage banks, insurance companies, available housing, independent appraisers, and real estate firms--cannot manage without state assistance. It is not a matter of monetary subsidies, which can only spur on inflationary processes. We expect the most rapid coordination of the "rules of the game" on the real estate market from the state. At the same time, the Association of Mortgage Banks established in August of last year is the leading active lobbyist in the good sense of this word, which promotes the fermentation of the process of adoption of a comprehensive mortgage law. This law must take into account without fail the mortgage of housing, of nonresidential premises, of land, and so forth. It must expand the field of activity not only for banks, but also for the system of real estate appraisal and mortgage insurance, as well as for investment-construction companies. In our country there is tremendous interest in mortgages. The number of mortgage banks is growing and their affiliates are being opened in Russian cities. According to the evaluations of our firm's experts, the extension of mortgage credits in Russia should attract no less than 50 percent of all the financiers. However, a great deal will have to be done to reach these goals. In the real estate community there are two points of view of the formation of the legislative base in Russia--evolutionary and revolutionary. The advocates of the first assume that in a short time it is impossible to do with real estate legislation what in economically developed countries was perfected for centuries. Advocates of more radical views have a no less weighty argument: If we are unable to establish normal mutual relations on the real estate market, of course, taking the experience of other countries into consideration, we will definitely destroy the country's economy. I think that this year is decisive and it will take place against the background of the integration of real estate and financial markets. In this connection the problem of an efficient utilization of real estate by its owners is of no small importance. Tens of thousands of real estate facilities throughout the country have already been privatized. Most of them, just as they did not see builders last year, so, very possibly, will not see them in the very near future. At the same time, the cost of leasing premises is rising steadily, which is due to the shortage of real estate equipped in accordance with elementary norms. Only economic levers, which bring about an efficient use of property, can change this situation. A property tax at the rate of 1 percent of the value of realistically appraised real estate is the simplest. The introduction of such a basic rate is next year's task. Without this the process of formation of the real estate market cannot be accelerated. It must be stated that the body of directors of industrial enterprises, who are forced to attract credit resources and to interact with credit extending banks, are interested in the appraisal of a realistic property value. At the same time, insurance savings of enterprises will make up 5 to 8 percent. With regard to construction organizations the problem of searching for finances in order to retain their house building collectives worries them more than making profits. For example, they are very interested in shareholding in housing construction and seek opportunities to attract the population's funds. Most builders believe that for the time being matters pertaining to the extension of mortgage credits, basically, are theoretical. In their opinion, there are very few real plans and practical achievements here. For the most part Russian mortgage banks work with juridical persons. Some of them also tried to work with natural persons. However, they incurred neither substantial losses nor obtained profit and, therefore, abandoned such an activity. It must be admitted that, of course, mortgage banks managed to achieve something, but this represented only a small part of their potentials. I repeat: There is a need for a firm comprehensive legislative mortgage base, which unequivocally interprets the mortgage of land, of housing, and of nonresidential structures. What positive sprouts are there? First of all, mortgage banks actively seek their market and conduct negotiations with investors and large organizations, which are ready to subsidize borrowers interested in mortgage credits. For example, Moscow's municipal council is ready to cooperate with some banks, which made a good showing, such as the Joint-Stock Mortgage Bank and the Standartbank. A draft decree of the municipal council on the development of the extension of mortgage credits in Moscow has been prepared and in accordance with it mortgage banks will be creditors for citizens on waiting lists for free municipal housing in local bodies of power. The municipal council intends to subsidize such credits through the commercial sale of municipal housing. Various big organizations can also play the same role as the municipal council. After all, all large monopolist enterprises build housing for their workers with their own funds. They are forced to do this and incur big expenses on the construction and operation of buildings. Therefore, they are interested in mortgage credit subsidy. This would enable them to relieve themselves of this problem and to transfer housing to the ownership of their workers. In order to ensure current expenditures, the bank must act as an ordinary commercial bank--to issue commercial credits and to actively operate on the interbank market. Banks began to establish subsidiary firms for operations on the real estate market and to ask well-known firms for assistance in the appraisal of residential and nonresidential premises and their sale if credits are not returned. For example, our firm has drafted a package of mutual contractual relations among the bank, the client, and the real estate firm concerning the appraisal and sale of an apartment not bought out by the client. What should be done in order to attain progress in mortgage development in Russia? Naturally, with the large number of credit products and their modifications it is difficult to get oriented in them. Therefore, if the opportunity of getting mortgage credits is now granted to our population, it will be sufficient to make do with only a small number of versions of credit products. This is convenient both for the bank and for the investor. It is simpler to buy up mortgages. If every mortgage is individual, it will not be possible to sell it wholesale on the secondary market. Let us turn to the concept of a "securities market." In what cases does it develop? When such a concept as the grade of a security appears. Owing to it, stocks and bonds find extensive application--they are the same, standard. When the moment comes that the market accepts only a small number of credit products, it will become very convenient for banks to operate. The issue of mortgage credits by banks both to citizens and to juridical persons should become constant practice in bank operation. At first these will be credits within the framework of specific programs, where there are already investors and organizations ready to subsidize these credits. Such examples already exist. The Standartbank, which has begun such operations with the Kama Motor Vehicle Plant, can be mentioned. Several thousands of long-term credits have been issued at a low interest. This is a large-scale plan, according to which the issue of about 10,000 credits until 1995-1996 is anticipated. A great deal will depend on investors, that is, on the resources that they are prepared to invest in mortgages. Bank plans also include the extension of credits to private individuals. All over the world it is believed that for banks these are the least risky operations owing to the small sums. In the 19th century it was precisely the private issue of large credits into the same hands that was the cause of the collapse of the first commercial banks in Russia. As a rule, large amounts of credits are not issued to natural persons. However, the risk of nonreturn also exists. In order to reduce it, very serious prerequisites are needed. I will try to note the main ones: 1. The availability of reliable data on the borrower's income, which is necessary for an evaluation of his solvency. An efficient operation of the tax service is required for this. 2. The establishment of a bank of data on borrowers' credit histories at the level of cities and regions. If a person has a bad credit dossier, no bank will grant him credit. 3. Insurance companies must provide another type of service--insurance of the return of mortgage credits. 4. Firms insuring the purity of the title of ownership, which does not yet exist in our country, are needed. It is very important to have reliable information on the value of real estate. Our firm--Yunifyucher--plans to computerize this kind of information all over Russia. We are mainly interested in the value of enterprises, office premises, and municipal housing so that our clients--banks and other financial institutions--may be able to use these data. Negotiations are now being conducted with several American firms, which have computer real estate bases both in the United States and all over the world. At our clients' requests we hope to receive information through the real estate telecommunication system operated by us. There should be a surplus of information on the real estate market. True, everything depends on the condition of the real estate and where it is located. There are unfinished projects, with which nothing can be done--they are ruins. There are projects not meeting international standards, in which technical backwardness is inherent even at the planning stage. Foreign investors more often prefer to dismantle abandoned projects and to build in their places first-class hotels, profitable houses, and supermarkets. Unfinished projects must be sold at cut-rate prices, but economic sanctions must be established for those who simply stake out a claim in expectation of better times. Russia has lost too much, transferring money to foundation pits so that they may disfigure its appearance for a long time. There should be only economic levers here. But the scope for activity is wide. Firms working with real estate do not hamper each other. Specialization has already appeared: some are reconstructing private houses, some lease out housing, and some sell cottages with land plots. I will touch upon the characteristics of the Yunifyucher Firm, which I head. Its name reflects the idea of combining people's efforts for the creation of a worthy future. Our philosophy is based on the fact that we are surrounded not by competitors in the form of real estate firms, but by colleagues, together with whom we are creating a civilized real estate market. We are trying to counterpose the systems approach, "turnkey" work, and a system of guarantees for the client to amateur brokers. About 970 firms connected with the buying and selling of dwellings advertise themselves in Moscow now. Things are going well for approximately 110 of them. Fifty such firms are former state structures established with large investments and, therefore, have strong starting positions. They had access to information and powerful connections, which at times plays a decisive role. However, private firms achieved everything by themselves, beginning from small things. For example, Yunifyucher had a charter fund of only 1,000 rubles. Like the legal association BAISO and the SAVVA Firm our firm has gained recognition only through its own efforts. In June 1993 we presented the first real estate telecommunication system. The development of a remote access system is being completed now. It will enable our subscribers, sitting in Vladivostok, Yekaterinburg, San Francisco, or a dacha near Moscow, to communicate with Yunifyucher by telephone, to access our central computer, and to make any request in an arbitrary form. For example, there is a need for a prestigious office in the center of Moscow with an area of 200 square meters or a separate building in the capital. At present we are ready to discuss with interested financial institutions and legal structures the question of the establishment of a joint-stock company, which will introduce the real estate telecommunication system into the Russian market. I will also touch upon the realtors' guild. It unites professionals and, therefore, the very participation in the guild gives a certain image to a firm and indirectly attracts clients to it. The guild raised the question of licensing real estate activity. When this is carried out, there will be fewer amateurs and simply incidental people in our business. In the United States there are brokers, who have received licenses and who are able to work on their own. The same can also be in our country. The fact that the guild gives information and methodological materials to its members is also important. It widely popularizes mortgage ideas, realizing what important place in its infrastructure is assigned to realtors. I think that it is important for people who make decisions to pursue their policy in the real estate sphere through serious firms. After all, the wider the contact with professionals, the bigger the guarantees that policy in the real estate sphere will bring success in the realization of the housing program, development of cities, and an efficient utilization of our country's land.
