The heads of the two states -- Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze -- are now having tete-a-tete talks. Members of the two official delegations are meeting at the same time behind closed doors in order to make the negotiations more comprehensive and constructive. ITAR-TASS has learned that bilateral, primarily economic relations between the two countries are now being discussed by First Vice-Chairman of the Russian council of Ministers Oleg Soskovets and Chairman of the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers Otar Patsatsia. Political aspects of inter-state cooperation are being discussed by Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Aleksandr Chikvaydze. Taking part in the talks from the Georgian side is Chairman of the Provisional Committee for the Emergency Situation in the Republic Jaba Ioseliani and Head of the Human Rights and Inter-Ethnic Relations Committee Aleksandr Kavsadze. Judging by the participants of this part of the negotiations, they are dealing not only with Russo-Georgian relations as a whole, but also with some aspects of the Abkhazian and South Ossetian problems, as well as with the rights of non-indigenous nationalities, particularly the Russian-speaking population. Heads of the defence establishments of the two countries are discussing a package of draft documents on cooperation in the military sphere. Future military-political cooperation between Russia and Georgia depends on the stabilisation of the socio-political situation in the republic. This was stated by Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev on the eve of President Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. In his opinion, this also depends on the settlement of problems linked with the political statuses of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as on Georgia's readiness to act in keeping with the Collective Security Treaty. Then the talks were continued on a broader scale with the participation of the official delegations of the two countries. A package of bilateral Russo-Georgian documents are expected to be signed after them. The most important document, of course, is the Treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighbourly Relations, and Cooperation. ITAR-TASS has learned from circles close to the Georgian delegation that the republic's leadership believes that "the signing of this treaty will restore the disrupted ancient ties, will add new substance to bilateral relations, fully meeting the interests of the two nations". A joint press conference will be held by President Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze after the signing ceremony. President Yeltsin will meet Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia Iliya II in the second half of the day. Then the Russian president and Eduard Shevardnadze will meet Georgian intellectuals. An official dinner will be given in honour of the Russian president in the evening of the same day on behalf of head of the Georgian state Eduard Shevardnadze. President Yeltsin will return to Moscow late on Thursday evening.
