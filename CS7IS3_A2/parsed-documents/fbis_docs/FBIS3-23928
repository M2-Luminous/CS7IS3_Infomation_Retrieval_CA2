Joint Venture Has Begun Operations"] [Text] Negotiations were completed yesterday between top officials of the Experimental Design Bureau Imeni A.S. Yakovleva AO [joint-stock company] and representatives of the South Korean corporation Hyundai. At the negotiations, which for the first time were being conducted within the framework of the Hyundai-Yak Aerospace Company Ltd. SP [joint venture], a deal was made to sell to the Korean side three Yak-112 aircraft. For all practical purposes this deal became the beginning of operations of the first joint venture in Russia between a Russian aviation design bureau and a foreign partner. The Hyundai-Yak Aerospace Company Ltd. was created at the end of last year (KOMMERSANT reported on the progress of negotiations in its issue dated 24 November 1993). Hyundai owns 51 percent of the SP stock; however, most seats on the board of directors belong to the Russian side. In the implementation of joint projects, Yakovlev Design Bureau gains access to Hyundai technologies and finances. The South Korean corporation Hyundai (gross sales in 1993--$56 billion), which has representations in more than 160 countries, will make its distribution and service network available to the SP. After Hyundai specialists complete work on interior finishing of aircraft cabins using automotive industry technologies, the South Korean side will begin marketing Yakovlev products in the West. The four-seat Yak-112 aircraft, produced in passenger, training, medical, and multipurpose versions, and also equipped with float chassis, completely meets international standards of fitness to fly. In addition, a decision was made that Hyundai-Yak Aerospace Company Ltd. will in the near future introduce in the Asia-Pacific market two new aircraft developed by Yakovlev Bureau--a two-seat sports Yak-54 and a six-seat Yak-58. The aircraft are equipped with Western-made engines, which reduces their operational costs and makes them more attractive to potential foreign buyers. The SP intends to expand its sphere of activities, not limiting itself to bilateral cooperation. According to Aleksandr Dondukov, chairman of the board of Experimental Design Bureau Imeni A.S. Yakovleva AO, there are very good prospects in cooperation between Hyundai-Yak Aerospace Company Ltd. and the Italian company Aermacchi in the area of so-called dual-use technology, which may be used for both military and civilian purposes. The Yak-130 training jet aircraft was selected as the basis for joint work with Aermacchi. A rather important factor is that this aircraft does not fall under the program of reductions of conventional arms in Europe and therefore has quite good market prospects. KOMMERSANT experts note that Russian aviation technology's entry into the world market through the "Asian door" at this point probably represents the most realistic solution. Currently Russian military aviation design bureaus either do not plan at all or are at the stage of only considering the possibility of setting up an SP. Somewhat of an exception is the cooperation between the MiG Design Bureau and the French aviation engine builder SNESMA regarding equipping MiG-AT training aircraft with the Larzac power system. However, the partners have not yet considered setting up an SP.
