The announcement of this resignation, which observers say is a surprise, was made by Interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya during a news conference held to mainly brief the press on the presidential investiture expected to take place before 12 July -- date on which interim period expires -- in conformity with the Constitution. Mr. Sendegaya is the deputy of Kayanza Province -- located in northern Burundi -- which recently was the scene of armed clashes that left dozens of civilians dead. He is also the author of the cassette: "Inciting Ethnic Hatred," according to the terms of a suit filed in court by Mr. Charles Mukasi, chairman of the former sole party, the Unity and National Progress Party [Uprona], which is now the parliamentary opposition. This unprecedented gesture in Burundian political practices will bring back into parliament the 16 Uprona deputies who had been boycotting the Assembly's sessions to protest the statements made by Christian Sendegeya on his tape, according to observers. The Uprona representatives had said they would return to parliament on condition that Sendegeya withdraws his statements. The National Assembly comprises 81 members, 65 of whom are members of the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU). It is expected to appoint by consensus a head of state -- following discussions between the opposition and the ruling power -- to replace President Cyprien Ntaryamira who was killed on 6 April in a plane crash in Kigali. Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana was also killed in that plane crash. Mr Ntaryamira's predecessor, Melchior Ndadaye, first democratically elected Burundian president, was killed on 21 October 1993 in an unsuccessful military coup attempt.
