Chapter 35, requires Federal agencies to minimize burden and costs associated with information collection. The Director of OMB promulgated regulations to implement the provisions of PRA '80 at 5 CFR Part 1320. The OMB regulations include a requirement that Federal agencies obtain OMB approval of collection of information requirements that are contained in any regulations published by the agencies in the Federal Register . After approval of the requirement by OMB, Federal agencies are further required to publish the control number assigned by OMB as part of the agency's regulations text. To comply with the OMB requirement and as a means of notifying the public that HCFA's information collection requirements have been approved, we have established a general regulation under 42 CFR 400.310 to display the valid OMB control numbers and the applicable regulation sections. We routinely update our regulation to add the most recent assignment of OMB control numbers or to delete entries that are no longer in effect. II. Provisions of the Rule Our display of valid OMB numbers was last updated on December 2, 1992 (57 FR 56997). We are revising our table at ยง400.310 to add the following approved sections. 42 CFR Sections 405.512. 417.436. 424.3, 424.32, and 424.34.
