Public representatives from the frontier town of Pechory handed over to him an address in which they expressed an alarm in connection with Estonia's territorial claims on this ancient Russian locality and called the leadership to strengthen and improve conditions on the border. Andrey Kozyrev called the territorial claims of Tallinn unfounded and stressed that Estonia, just as Russia, were recognized within the existing borders. Moscow, the foreign minister noted, is in the know about these problems and is closely watching them. It is necessary to strengthen the border, but at the same time there is no need to make it "impenetrable." Here, on the spot, Andrey Kozyrev said, an optimal regime should be determined and a formula found which will suit both sides. The problems of the strengthening of the border and the troops withdrawal are exclusively issues of bilateral relations, but we are interested that these problems are known and understood by our neighbors in the region, the Russian foreign minister pointed out. At the same time, Andrey Kozyrev noted, there are also problems of the rights of the Russian speaking population in Estonia. These issues are not exclusively the subject of the Russo-Estonian dispute. After all, there is international law and all-European norms which must be observed. We are raising this issue very insistently, the Russian foreign minister emphasised.
