Among the options under active consideration is a package comprising an additional squadron of the Russian Mig-29, a unirole air superiority fighter, along with up to three more squadrons of the French Mirage-2000 multi-role aircraft. The IAF [Indian Air Force] presently has two and three squadrons each of the Mirage-2000 and Mig-29 aircrafts. However, a proposal to induct an additional squadron each of the Mirage-2000 and Mig-29, submitted during the tenure of the former chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal N.C. Suri, has been hanging fire for almost two years now on account of indecision and the prevailing resource crunch. Other options projected by the IAF include induction of a second multi-role fighter variant in addition to the Mirage-2000 and even examining the Russian offer to jointly produce the long range Su-27 interceptors, which have already been acquired by China. Looking beyond the figure of 38 F-16s that the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) is set to acquire, the IAF requirement projections are catering for the total 71 more such aircraft that Pakistan is seeking to obtain from the United States. Taking into account the 37 F-16s already in the PAF's inventory, the IAF is drawing up long-term plans to counter the final figure of 108 F-16s or six squadrons worth of this nuclear weapon delivery capable aircraft that the PAF hopes to have before the end of this century. In principle, the IAF is of the opinion that the multi-role nuclear weapon delivery capable F-16 has to be met with a multi-role aircraft. While the IAF is interested in the more advanced `M' version of the Mig-29 (India presently only has the Mig-29B version), this aircraft type alone will not be the answer to the F-16 since the Mig-29 is essentially a unirole interceptor. Similarly, defence experts point out that a unirole deep penetration strike aircraft would again not be viable since a strike mission would require a package of air defence aircraft for protection against enemy interception. This would involve many more aircraft per mission not to mention cost of fuel and the time involved. A multi-role aircraft could switch roles from strike to air defence and vice versa. Till now the two PAF F-16 squadrons comprising 37 aircraft were matched by IAF's two Mirage-2000 squadrons comprising 45 aircraft (including reserve). Besides, the two present PAF F-16 squadrons were more likely to be involved in air defence roles owing to fewer numbers of this aircraft type available to them and the fact that Pakistan lacking in geographical depth needed superior aircrafts to protect high value targets such as its all important nuclear programme facility at Kakuta, Karachi port, Sargodha and Chaklala air bases, etc. But with a total six squadrons of F-16s, defence experts point out that the balance would be substantially tilted in the PAF's favour providing it with a phenomenal long arm and rendering vulnerable many key locations of strategic importance located deep inside Indian territory. These include Bombay High, the vast industrial complex stretching from Ahmedabad to Bombay, the HAL and IAF Mig-27 and Mig-23 assembly and overhauling facilities at Ozhar not to mention New Delhi, the Mathura refinery, etc. Significantly, whlie all variants of three F-16s are capable of delivering nuclear weapons, the IAF has no such aircraft which includes the Mirage-2000H that it has. The numerical strength that the IAF enjoys vis-a-vis the PAF holds no value owing to two main reasons. Firstly, the IAF has to cater to its vast borders on both the western and eastern fronts, and secondly, owing to the old vintage of IAF's aircraft. While the bulk of the PAF fighter fleet is of medium to state-of-the-art technology, the bulk of IAF's fleet ranges from medium to low technology. In fact a new area of concern is the nine odd squadrons of the Type 77 and Type 96 variants of the Mig-21 that the IAF will be phasing out by the end of this century. In any case these aircraft have already outlives their life and cannot be put to frontline use. From where will the IAF find a replacement? One possibility is buying up the Mig-29 assembly line which was offered to India in the 1980s. Another option is to accept the Russian offer to jointly produce the Su-27. But whatever be the final outcome, it is evident that IAF's answer to the PAF's F-16s will rest on the sole consideration of resources available to buy matching aircraft. A Mig-29 will not be less than Rs 50 crores [rupees] a piece while a single Mirage-2000 will not cost less than Rs 80 crores. An expensive proposition no doubt, but prosperity has always hinged on security.
