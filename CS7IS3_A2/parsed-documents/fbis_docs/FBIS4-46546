Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Main Directorate for Indoctrination Work Chief Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar made the opening remarks at the meeting; he stated in particular that "the problem of military discipline and law and order in the ranks has always attracted the attention of theoreticians and practitioners, thanks to which a definite increase can be observed every year in knowledge and experience in the study of this social aspect of the vital activity of the Army. Notwithstanding this, the state of military discipline has grown significantly worse, and there exists a steady trend toward growth in such types of offenses as evasion of military service, the theft of state property and official abuses. The number of instances of suicides remains very high in the Army. Life forces us to address this problem again and again, and to make an attempt to find and realize new reserves to improve organizational and indoctrination work. "The practical-science conference was devoted to all of these issues as well. The task is to study deeply the problems of law and order and military discipline, which are becoming more and more widespread, by moving beyond the traditional framework and encompassing not only purely statistical data, but the host of preconditions that give rise to them." He gave the floor to Minister of Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy for the report, "The Moral-Psychological State of the Personnel of the Armed Forces and the Activity of the Bodies of Military Administration to Strengthen Military Discipline and Law and Order in the Ranks." (The report is being published in somewhat abridged form.) Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Main Directorate for Indoctrination Work Chief Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar spoke following the report of Minister of Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy. He devoted his presentation to a topical theme for the vital activity of the troops: "The Practice of the Utilization of Scientific Approaches in the Activity of Bodies for Indoctrination and Socio-Psychological Work Directed at Indoctrination and Raising the Level of Discipline of the Personnel." As Minister of Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy indicated in his closing words, a serious and productive exchange of opinions took place during the practical-science conference with regard to strengthening military discipline in the Armed Forces. The conference demonstrated that the level of serious scientific study of problem issues in the vital activity of the Armed Forces and their well-founded analysis has been reached. The participants in the conference were able to formulate, in clear-cut and scientifically substantiated fashion, new and progressive approaches to solving the problem of strengthening military discipline. The practical-science conference provided a profound analysis of the state of discipline in the ranks, and projected the principal directions of organizational and indoctrination work of the bodies of military administration. The report by Minister of Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy and the speeches of Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Main Directorate for Indoctrination Work Chief Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Kobzar, Deputy Minister of Defense for Rear Services--Chief of Rear Services for the Armed Forces of Ukraine Colonel-General Hryhoriy Mikhaylichenko, Deputy Minister of Defense for Weaponry--Chief of Weaponry of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Colonel-General Ivan Oliynyk, Ministry of Defense Main Directorate for Cadres Lieutenant-General Hryhoriy Dyachuk, Main Organizational-Mobilization Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Chief Major-General Valeriy Venher and other participants in the conference made it possible to draw the fundamental conclusion that the level of military discipline is defined to a considerable extent by the moral-psychological state of the personnel, which reflects the needs of the servicemen at a certain moment in time, their interests, social points of reference and psycho-physiological state, which determines the readiness of people to engage in various types of military activity and fulfill the requirements of standards and ethics. The leadership of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the participants in the practical-science conference feel that the following are essential in order to invigorate the work pertaining to the establishment of law and order and strong military discipline: 1. To designate the work pertaining to strengthening law and order and discipline as one of the priority areas of activity of military cadres at all levels of military supervision. The work system of military cadres with regard to the maintenance of strict law and order and conscious discipline in the ranks should encompass the principal areas of this activity, ascertain and substantiate indicators of the effectiveness of the measures that are being carried out, and create organizational-social and psychological-pedagogical conditions for the formation of a level of discipline among the personnel. 2. The organizational work of commanders, staffs and bodies for indoctrination work should be concentrated on eliminating the causes that worsen the moral-psychological state of the personnel and, as a consequence, cause violations of the norms of regulations for service activity. 3. The indoctrination work of commanders and senior officers of all levels should promote the formation and development of such individual qualities as discipline among servicemen. The underpinnings for that should be the pedagogization of all spheres of military activity and individual indoctrination work, which should be of a preventive nature. 4. The efforts of military scholars and social-sciences scholars, in collaboration with scientists at prominent scientific institutions of Ukraine, should promote the formation and incarnation within the Armed Forces of the ideology of the Ukrainian state--an ideology of public patriotism with the person and his life, rights and freedoms at its center. 5. The efforts of bodies of military administration should be directed toward the achievement of a solid interconnection between Ukrainian society and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, through active collaboration and interaction with all of the public organizations of Ukraine to the benefit of state interests. 6. The bodies for indoctrination work, together with commanders, must focus their efforts on the formation of positive military traditions and rituals within the military collectives. The development of a system of measures with regard to moral incentives to stimulate the service activity of servicemen of various categories would be expedient. 7. Commanders and superior officers at all levels, together with the cadre bodies of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, must uphold the principle of social justice during the naming of servicemen to official positions. It is important to be guided therein by professional competence, high moral qualities and experience in the service of military cadres, with the broadest possible enlistment in this work of the officers' assemblies and their conduct with a regard for public opinion. 8. Military scholars must launch the profound development of a program with regard to the study, analysis and strengthening of the moral-psychological state of the troops. 9. The Main Directorate for Indoctrination Work must invigorate the activity of its sociological structures for the purpose of obtaining objective and prompt information on the moral-psychological state of the personnel in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It would be expedient to be guided, during the evaluation of the state of military discipline in subordinate troops, by criteria that are clearly formulated by the corresponding guiding documents. The leaders of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the participants in the practical-science conference expressed the hope that the generals and officers of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine will be actively involved in the work to establish strong law and order and conscious military discipline in the ranks, and will display creativity, exactingness and discipline therein.
