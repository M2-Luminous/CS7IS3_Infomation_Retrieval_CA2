The latest attempt to regulate the relations of Russian departments associated with property abroad was undertaken when what is most valuable for Russia in Germany--the legacy of the Western Group of Troops--is already being turned over to German authorities; moreover, free of charge. There is nothing new in the text of the decree. Its central point is this: Decisions on the sale, assignment as security, placement in authorized capital, or removal of Russian property in the FRG are made by the Government of Russia on the representation of the State Committee for Management of State Property, and in no other way. The former Union property in Germany will be transferred yet again to the management of Russia's State Committee for Management of State Property, although Ukraine continues to demand a foreign share that is due it. While the Ukrainian reasoning may not be clear, the fact that the decree does not mention the Western Group of Troops requires comment. There is a presidential edict--"On Procedure for Selling Military Property Being Released" of 30 November 1992--according to which military property is sold by the Ministry of Defense, while the functions of control are reserved for the State Committee for Management of State Property. On the other hand, on 16 December 1992, Boris Yeltsin and FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared jointly that real estate of the Western Group of Troops will be transferred to the German authorities without compensation. Thus, the train has already left (it is worth mentioning that the not unknown Dmitriy Yakubovskiy in his time valued Union military property in Germany at the lower level of DM12 billion.) What does the civilian Russian property held in abeyance in Germany represent? The "apparatus of representatives" of the State Committee for Management of State Property in Germany, the weak descendant of the State Economic Mission in Germany under the president of the USSR, is seeking an answer to this question. The genealogical tree of the "apparatus of representatives" is branching out, reflecting the abrupt changes regarding military property, and has naturally taken on a political coloration. Some answers have been found. A typical example--the former House of Soviet Science and Culture has been transferred by presidential edict to the Federal Information Center. As is known, on 6 May 1992, Mikhail Poltoranin tried on behalf of the Russian Government to transfer the building free of charge to a German company with limited responsibility; however, the transaction was declared invalid. As a result, the State Committee for Management of State Property will have to bear responsibility for the possible commercialization of Russian real estate that remains in Germany.
