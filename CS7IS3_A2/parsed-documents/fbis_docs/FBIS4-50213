At the closing session, Li Guixian stressed: Civil affairs work is an important aspect in government work, having a direct bearing on social stability and on economic and social development, closely linked with the immediate interests of the broad masses of people, and having the strong characteristics of social endeavor and mass participation. He said: Always listening to the voices of the masses, caring for the immediate interests of the masses, and safeguarding and guaranteeing the basic living rights and interests of the masses of people, constitutes the fundamental purpose of our party and the government. Successfully carrying out civil affairs work is precisely the specific manifestation of this purpose and of the superiority of the socialist system. Li Guixian held that for now and for some time to come, the priority in civil affairs work is to do a good job in social security work and building grass-roots organizations. He said: The social security system is an important support project of the socialist market economic structure, having a bearing on whether the reform of the economic structure can be smoothly carried out or not. All localities should pay great attention to it and realistically do their work well. The grass-roots political power and the grass-roots self-government organizations of the masses constitute the foundation of all fields of work. The civil affairs departments in all localities should actively coordinate with relevant departments to reshuffle and build the grass-roots organizations. Li Guixian also called on the civil affairs departments in all localities to do a good job in administrative zoning, social management, marriage and funeral management, as well as the work of taking in the people or sending them back to their original places.
