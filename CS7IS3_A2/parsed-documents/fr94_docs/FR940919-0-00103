FR940919-0-00103 FR940919-0-00016 b. Mixed Radioactive Soil EPA derived data on the quantities of DOE mixed radioactive soils using MWIR data. Table 5 lists the quantities of each category of mixed radioactive soil that is expected to be generated annually, as well as the amount currently in storage. The quantity of hazardous soil in storage, or projected to be generated annually, is very small. This can be attributed to the fact that the MWIR Data Base generally does not include DOE environmental restoration wastes. When these wastes are generated they will increase the quantity of newly identified mixed wastes, particularly soil, that require treatment. Although these wastes are not included in the Final MWIR Data Base, the IMWIR estimates that DOE will generate a total of approximately 600,000 m 3 of mixed environmental restoration wastes over the period from 1993 to 1997. Some of these wastes will likely be newly identified organic TC mixed wastes.

Mixed Radioactive Debris EPA derived data on quantities of DOE mixed radioactive debris using MWIR data. Table 6 lists the quantities of each category of mixed radioactive debris that is expected to be generated annually, as well as the quantity currently in storage.
