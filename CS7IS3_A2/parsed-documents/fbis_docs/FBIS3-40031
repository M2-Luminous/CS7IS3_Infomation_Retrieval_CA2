[Bertinotti] The idea is to produce an ordinary property tax in such a way that all income is taxed, with an exemption threshold excluding the first 150 or 200 million lire [L] of treasury bills and the primary residence. [Panara] But do you realize that, in launching this idea in the middle of an election campaign in which taxation is the major issue, you are stirring up a hornets' nest? [Bertinotti] I do not understand the reason for the controversy. This proposal has been part of the traditional position of the Left since the sixties, and has become relevant nowadays given the heavy tax burden on workers. Their earnings represent more or less half of all earnings while they pay three quarters of all personal income tax. It is as if the tax authorities were playing Robin Hood in reverse, taking from the poor to give to the rich, and we want to bring all this back into balance. [Panara] You know that treasury bills can be taxed in three ways: through a fixed withholding on the income, as is done today; by including the income in the tax return and subjecting it to progressive taxation; or through a property tax. Why have you gone for a property tax? [Bertinotti] My intention was not to offer a technical solution to the problem. We are very open to any further detailed suggestions. What I am attempting do is to highlight the disparities between the tax treatment of incomes. Obviously a property tax requires that the bills be registered, but it does not seem to me improper for the state to ask about property held by taxpayers. [Bertinotti ends] Bertinotti is calm, as if unaware that he has rocked a weighty container, unexpectedly rocking the progressive ship and without warning the rest of the crew. [Panara] But why, if your intention is to tax financial income, did you not talk about financial income, but about treasury bills, the sacred word? [Bertinotti] Because one has to move gradually, and since we have to begin with something, we decided to begin with the most important thing. [Panara] It seems to me difficult to do these things in stages. If one begins by taxing treasury bills, the first and inevitable consequence is that everyone will sell their treasury bills and buy something else. The result is a useless and very dangerous earthquake. [Bertinotti] What we want to do is to rebalance the tax burden by including all income, and not just treasury bills. We mentioned treasury bills in order to kindle reflection on the problem. [Panara] But the Renewal is part of an alignment. Why did you go it alone? [Bertinotti] We are not making an exclusive out of this proposal, we are seeking solely to push the progressive alignment to analyze this proposal, nothing more. [Panara] But to propose a new tax just when the right is building up consensus on a tax reduction. [Bertinotti] We are proposing a different balancing of the tax burden; we say that our position exemplifies a line which is different from that of the Right. We say: "Pay less, but pay on all income." [Panara] It seems that while your allies are working to conquer the center, you are doing everything possible to throw them off balance. [Bertinotti] It seems to me that the alignment is working in particular to lose the social sector of the left, whose votes and enthusiasm it needs to reconquer and without which this battle cannot be won. And it is precisely this rush to the center, this alignment which is opening up to the moderates. The Right, what is it, basically, but an alignment which is tending to become a mass reactionary phenomenon based on fear and uncertainty? [Panara] And then? [Bertinotti] And then we have to reassure the Fiat workers, who are afraid. [Panara] By saying that the agreement which has just been reached should not be signed? [Bertinotti] Yes, I believe that if, in factory-level consultations, the agreement were to be rejected, this would be a positive thing, because workers could move ahead in two areas. The first is to change Fiat's attitude, which from the outset has been: Industrial policy decision are mine but the social consequences are for the state. The second is to avoid the social "shock absorbers" having the effect of eliminating any possibility of intervention by workers in the restructuring process. With this agreement the shock absorbers have been applied in such a way as to divide workers into a number of sections unable to communicate between themselves. This is an agreement concluded within the culture of the eighties, whereas the situation demands inventiveness, novelty. [Bertinotti ends] Bertinotti reflects for a moment: "This does not seem to me such an extremist line of argument." [Panara] But tell me one thing. Do you really think that this system of fighting separately in order to achieve a unified victory can work? [Bertinotti] We need to learn to reconcile dissent and unity. We have a common basis and then everyone advances his proposals. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] has presented its program, which does not please a lot of people, there are candidates for whom perhaps one does not vote gladly, there are different ideas on certain points, but the elements of unity are there and it is these which remain. For the rest we will see what consensus we manage to build. [Panara] In a Turin constituency where the Renewal is strong, Gino Giugni, the minister who put together the Fiat agreement which you do not like, is standing. Will you vote for him? [Bertinotti] It is here that Republican discipline comes into play; just as we do not silence dissent, in the same way this dissent does not eliminate the reasons for a united battle against the right. I will vote for Giugni, certainly I will vote for him.
