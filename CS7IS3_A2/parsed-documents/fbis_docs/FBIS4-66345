Chan, sales director of Motorola's North Asia Paging Products Group. There is plenty of room for expansion in China. This is because there are 400 million city dwellers in the country but only 10 million pagers. In developed countries, on the other hand, 12 out of 100 people have pagers. In 1992, Motorola invested more than $100 million into its manufacturing base in Tianjin City, North China. And so far, the plant has churned out more than 1 million beepers priced at 1000 yuan ($115) each. ``There are about 3 million Motorola pagers in use in China at present, if imports from Singapore are included,'' Chan said. Singapore is the leading manufacturing base of Motorola in the Asia-Pacific region, providing nearly all the pagers which display information with Chinese characters. But towards the end of the year the Tianjin base will also start producing pagers with Chinese characters, said Chan. He did not say how many such pagers will be produced per year in the future. Motorola's biggest potential rivals in China include Japan's NEC and some Chinese manufacturers from Guangdong Province in the South. The American company has captured a third of the Chinese pager market. And the multinational firm has also cornered more than half of the global market which requires 15 million beepers a year. ``Motorola's top three markets are the U.S., Japan and China, and we are anticipating a bigger local production in China,'' said Chan. Motorola staged a sales promotion campaign in Beijing recently, selling more than 23,000 pagers. Statistics show that the number of China's pagers increased by 152 percent in 1993 over the previous year. And the country's telecommunications market has grown rapidly, said Liu Cai, head of the policy department of the Ministry of Posts & Telecommunications. But he admitted that telephone systems, particularly mobile [phones] and beepers, are still in their infancy in China. By the year 2000, China will have more than 5 million mobile phones, he said. And the number of pagers is expected to boom during the same period. Pagers will become one of the most sought-after consumer goods in the 1990s, an official said.
