FBIS4-12011 "drnes065_g_94001" FBIS-NES-94-065 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 Sudan Government Order Closes AL-SUDANI AL-DUWAILI Government Order Closes AL-SUDANI AL-DUWAILI EA0404200594 Omdurman Republic of Sudan Radio Network in Arabic 0315 GMT 4 Apr 94 EA0404200594 Omdurman Republic of Sudan Radio Network Arabic BFN [Statement issued by the Presidency of the Republic; date not given] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Brother citizens, the National Salvation Revolution was begun in the defense of this homeland, which had been overwhelmed by the dangers of fragmentation and infighting. National unity was threatened and the economy was in a state of collapse and stagnation. Corruption and nepotism were rampant because of the weakness of the rulers and the absence of a true course and higher ideals. Further fuel was added to the fire by party differences and improper press practices linked to private benefits and foreign interests. The principles of the National Salvation Revolution were opposed to all that. It replaced division with unity. Defense and the struggle for the sake of God and the homeland replaced caution and surrender to enemies. It raised aloft the ideals of purity and impartiality over and above corruption. It raised aloft the banner of the brilliant Islamic law in place of a confused and baffled course. It worked to establish a new society guided by clear ideals linked to heaven. The revolution established institutions for popular and political work and embarked on policies for reforming the economy, the education sector and society. The ship sailed on, guided by God, confident of victory despite storms, challenges, and trials. When the revolution provided opportunities for consultation and advice, it issued regulations, but some people, whose minds were narrowed against the revolution and who hated it, thought that their opportunity had come to achieve their dreams and the dreams of those who supported them, to drag the country back to the hated and painful past. Among these was the newspaper AL-SUDANI AL-DUWALI, which gathered a clique blinded by the brilliance of money which was generously given to them, and by the fear of the foreigner whom they thought was God disposing of the universe. They were also friendly to the alliances and the ghosts of the past, which feed on illusions and live on mirages. The paper permits its pens to harm the noblest causes of the homeland in the struggle and defense of its creed and unity. It raises doubts about the purpose and the struggle of the Armed Forces and the popular defense forces. It calls for the separation and negligence of the unity of the country, for which many martyrs have fallen and colored with their pure blood. The martyrs march forward, liberating every inch of the country until they attain victory -- and they will attain it, God willing. These journalists have worked to fragment national unity by raising doubts about the option of the people and the revolution, about the political system and the popular and constitutional bodies. They have called for a return to parties, sectarianism, and tribal conflict. They have waged a psychological war against the Armed Forces and the other regular forces, falsely accusing some of them on having committed excesses and oppression, and denigrating the strength of others in so far as the protection of the citizens and their property were concerned. They resorted to magnifying simple incidents with the intention of influencing the security of citizens and the homeland. They then raised the charge of corruption and spread rumors, without providing any evidence or proof, in spite of the call made by the minister of justice, the attorney general, stressing the revolution's readiness and its firm commitment to establish the truth and to punish anyone whose criminality was proved. They intended by these acts to harm the revolution and its noblest intentions, namely righteousness and impartiality. Finally they crowned all this with a premeditated design to kill respect for the revolution and its symbols. They became arrogant without any justification, committed excesses without any proof, and made allegations without any evidence. Brothers, the revolution has promised God, then its people, to go to the end of the road to achieve clear victory and God's favor. It has proffered martyrs as evidence of its sincerity and a sign of devotion, and will not retreat or withdraw. God willing out of fear, nor will it bow before anyone other than God. [sentence as heard] An order has been issued in accordance with emergency rules to close this newspaper. The organs concerned will call to account all those who have exceeded the bounds and overstepped the limits. Those who have done wrong shall know the end they will meet. God is great, glory to Islam, God is great, victory to Sudan.
