For the first time the party will put up candiates for the local and landtag elections in Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and Rhineland-Palatinate, DSU Federal Chairman Robert Rink said at the DSU Federal Congress in Leipzig on Saturday [19 March]. He once again defended the expansion of his party to the old laender, which was decided last year. As a result, the then sister party Christian Social Union stopped its support, but now the DSU can work independently, stressed Rink.
