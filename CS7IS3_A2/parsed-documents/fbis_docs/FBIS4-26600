"This is because Hong Kong's administrative work has to rely on its civil servants. "The smooth transfer of power and stable transition as well as its special administrative region's management after 1997 will also rely on them," said Qian at a meeting with a delegation from the Association of the Former Senior Civil Servants of Hong Kong, led by former Secretary for Land and Works Chan Nai-keong. Qian said that both Sino-British Joint Statement and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region make clear stipulations on the continuous employment of civil servants. The aim is to maintain the civil servants' stabilization, he added. Qian described the delegation's visit to Beijing as of great significance, adding: "We support you to set up the association of the former senior civil servants of Hong Kong." Qian said after Hong Kong's return to the motherland, civil servants will serve the government of its special administrative region and the Hong Kong residents as well. This is in conformity with loving the motherland and loving Hong Kong, he said. Qian expressed the hope that the Hong Kong civil servants will do their best to be responsible in their work and serve the Hong Kong residents well in the remaining years of the transitional period. He stressed that Hong Kong is a center of finance, economy and information and also an economic city, so administrative management plays a leading role and its high efficiency should be ensured. Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, took part in the meeting.
