In an interview with INTERFAX Satarov accused Communist leader Gennadiy Ziuganov of failing to voice his objections to the agreement at the April 22 meeting between Boris Yeltsin and the leaders of the parliamentary factions. Ziuganov rejected the agreement at a party conference last Saturday. Satarov said that at the April 22 meeting Ziuganov came out with a number of constructive suggestions which were taken into consideration by the authors of the agreement. Later Ziuganov said that the agreement aimed to perpetuate the negative tendencies which led to the destabilization of society and Russian state structures. Satarov saw his statement as a clear-cut attempt to call white - black. In Satarov's view, the agreement aimed to promote social accord and civic stability. And, he said, the document was phrased by a working group which brought together representatives of all parliamentary factions, including the Communists and Agrarians, meaning, according to Satarov, that their criticism of the agreement backfires on themselves. Satarov failed to understand what Ziuganov meant by calling for sweeping changes in the social and economic policies and describing the civic accord agreement an ultimatum to the opposition. What Ziuganov said was something on the order of an ultimatum rather than a call for accord, Satarov said. Satarov was confident that in spite of the negative moves by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the YaBloko grouping and some other organizations, the country's leading social and political forces would voice approval of the agreement on April 28.
