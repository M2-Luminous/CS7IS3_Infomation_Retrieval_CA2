He declared about this at the press conference held on Friday evening in Moscow. As he said, subventions to territories "represent the greatest problem today." He also pointed out that due to privatization which is being implemented in a wrong way, currently "many important enterprises have appeared without a real owner." "A working staff cannot be an owner," emphasized Soskovets and said that respect towards working staffs should be demonstrated in timely issuance of wages and several other measures but not in the transfer of enterprises to them. Soskovets laid great hope for the second stage of the privatization which, as he said, "will help to remove many problems" by means of organizing large investment funds for industry. Soskovets mentioned defense, state borders guarding, and security of domestic producer as the major functions to be preserved by the state. "This security is an extremely important measure which has been unjustly forgotten," said he.
