It is proposed that two main issues will be at the center of the session's attention: how to resolve problems of international security, and how to treat the request from a number of Central and East European states for admission to membership of the North Atlantic Alliance. It will essentially be discussing the future of this alliance in the modern world. On the eve of the NATO summit it seems expedient to examine the question of Russia's relationship with NATO. But before trying to find the answer to it, I believe that we should consider the following: A truly paradoxical situation has taken shape. Practically everyone in the West believes that the North Atlantic Alliance was the undoubted winner of the Cold War. At the same time this alliance has probably never before been faced with such acute and intractable problems. It is even said that NATO is experiencing a kind of crisis. The bloc's critical state is all the more surprising because it followed directly on the outburst of euphoria which in the West accompanied the fall of the Berlin Wall, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and the breakup of the Soviet Union. At the London meeting in the summer of 1990 the state and government leaders of the alliance countries welcomed the changes in Europe enthusiastically and even called them historic. Then suddenly a crisis. What is going on here? The point is that NATO in the form in which it was created in the late forties is practically played out. The "threat from the East" has disappeared. The enemy has disappeared. Yet that is precisely what the bloc organizers needed not only to implement the policy of "containing and rolling back" communism but, above all, to consolidate the leading role of the United States in the postwar world. For long years the bloc's chief function was to be the instrument of Washington's policy and to involve other Western countries in it. There is more. Having rid itself of real or imaginary fears of a "massive attack from the east," NATO has found itself facing new and this time very real dangers. These are the unstable situation in Russia (let us recall the pained reaction of some people in the West to the results of the parliamentary elections in our country) and also in other states which have emerged on the territory of the former USSR, the possibility of the uncontrolled spread of weapons of mass destruction, and, finally, the interethnic and ethnic conflicts on the periphery of the bloc, which are escalating into fierce armed clashes, as has already happened in Yugoslavia, Moldova, and the Caucasus. How is NATO to react to all these dangers, and what can it and must it do under these conditions? The top-level NATO meeting is to indicate an answer to this question. All this also directly concerns Russia, Particularly as the question of expanding the NATO framework by admitting a number of East European countries to this organization's ranks is arising very acutely. Every state's sovereign right to choose the forms and means of ensuring its security which best suit it has to be respected. But NATO's leading circles know of Moscow's negative attitude to the prospect of the alliance's accelerated expansion. This might not resolve existing problems but create new ones. For example, it might undermine the established legal treaty system on our continent -- above all, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Instead of strengthening trust and stability, new seeds of mistrust would thereby be sown -- which would undoubtedly lead to the destabilization of the whole situation. The expansion of NATO's zone of responsibility will directly affect Russia's interests for geopolitical, military, and also internal political reasons. As a result of the alliance's expansion the bloc's military grouping -- the largest in the world -- will reach lines close to Russian borders. This will require a fundamental reappraisal of all our defensive concepts, a reshaping of the armed forces, a revision of the operational apportionment of theaters of military operations, the deployment of additional infrastructure, the relocation of large military contingents, and changes in operational plans and the nature of combat training. It is also easy to imagine that both the leadership and the public of Russia would perceive the widening of the circle of NATO members as an attempt to isolate us and to create a "cordon sanitaire" on our western borders. It would not be out of place to remark that this could promote the emergence of xenophobia in our society and strengthen the influence of right-wing radical nationalist parties and organizations. This, however, is the opinion not only of Russians. It was no coincidence that the influential German newspaper DIE WELT wrote recently that a desire to recreate the Iron Curtain to cut themselves off from an unstable neighbor -- Russia -- lies behind all the attempts to expand NATO to the east. Leading NATO circles also understand the delicacy of this situation. To all appearances they are in no hurry to admit new members, despite insistent requests from Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the Baltic states, and a number of other East European countries. The U.S. President has advanced as an alternative an idea which has been named "partnership for peace." I believe that Russia could support this idea insofar as it takes into account the security interests of all states without exception. Of course, this partnership should be geared to forming unified security standards throughout the Euro-Atlantic area. The priority development of a political dialogue, constant consultations, the attainment of concerted positions, and, in the long term, coordinated actions constitute genuine partnership. At their sessions in early December the NATO countries' foreign and defense ministers confirmed their support for the "partnership for peace" plan advanced by Washington. Nevertheless, the essence of this plan and the ways of implementing it are still insufficiently clear. Obviously, these questions will be the object of close examination at the upcoming NATO Council session, and we would very much like its participants to take the Russian viewpoint on this problem into consideration. Of course, what will be decided in Brussels will also be discussed at the meeting of the Russian and U.S. presidents to be held in the next few days. All this certainly does not mean that an insurmountable gulf lies between Russia and NATO. This was shown by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's recent meeting with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner. It was pointed out there, in particular, that an objective assessment of Russia's role in ensuring international security and stability requires its relations with the North Atlantic Alliance to outstrip the relations between the latter and the Central and East European countries in terms of pace, volume, and richness. It is notable that we can already see compatibility in terms of a number of basic aims in the military-political concepts of Russia and the NATO countries. This is being promoted both by the deideologization of international relations and by the coincidence of the sides' views on the main problems of ensuring security. Both sides give priority in this sphere to political methods. The use of military force is regarded as an exceptional measure, permissible only in the interests of self-defense and also in peacemaking operations. Both the "new NATO strategic concept" adopted in 1991 and the recently approved "Main Provisions of the Russian Federation's Military Doctrine" contain exceptionally important points: No state or coalition is regarded as an enemy by either the North Atlantic Alliance or Russia. Both documents recognize that the limitation and reduction of arms accord with the national interests of all states and help strengthen universal security. It is possible to say that this opens up a real opportunity to eliminate the residual elements of military confrontation in Europe. Unfortunately, such elements do still exist. Whereas Russia is carrying out a thorough reform of its Armed Forces, having already significantly reduced their strength and intending to continue moving in this direction, the NATO countries' military activity is still being reduced only slowly. It was pointed out at a recent session of the bloc's Military Planning Committee that the strength of the member countries' armed forces has been reduced by just 15 percent over the past few years, while military spending still amounts to 3.2 percent of GNP. And this in the absence of a real enemy! But the following question arises: If NATO's expansion appears inexpedient -- let us put it that way -- from Russia's viewpoint today and if everything is not yet clear with the "partnership for peace" plan, is there any way out of the situation which is taking shape? Obviously there is, and maybe not just one. It is possible, for example, to point to the further enhancement of the role and significance of the activity of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC]. It already unites 38 states -- both NATO and former Warsaw Pact members, including, of course, the Russian Federation. Russia actively participates in NACC sessions at the foreign minister level, and its representatives from the Defense Ministry participate in the work of various commissions, seminars, and courses within the framework of this organization. This framework, however, is still quite limited. Obviously, the time is coming to expand it considerably. There is a real opportunity to turn the NACC into an organization for collective security in Europe. This would not mean lessening the role of the CSCE but, thanks to the fact that far fewer states participate in the work of the NACC than in the CSCE, it is easier to arrive at mutually acceptable decisions there and to make these decisions more effective and more consonant with urgent tasks and with the demands of the situation. It would not be out of place to remind you here that all the members of the NACC understand this. A recent NACC meeting adopted a statement which spoke of measures to further strengthen cooperation within the framework of this organization. It sets itself the task of continuing and activating consultations on political questions and questions connected with ensuring security, as well as developing cooperation on military questions. In particular, a new working plan for dialogue, partnership, and cooperation in 1994 was approved for this purpose. Why should emphasis be placed on organizations such as the NACC, let us say? Why cannot the functions of ensuring regional security be entrusted to NATO? Because the North Atlantic Alliance was created as a specific organization of leading Western countries under definite conditions and with quite definite aims. But the conditions have changed decisively. It seems beyond doubt that any attempts to transform NATO can change virtually nothing in its essence. The North Atlantic Alliance remains yesterday's organization. It is not its modernization that must be on the agenda, but the abandonment of bloc thinking in favor of an effective and efficient system of European and international security. It is evidently time to breathe vital force into the fertile idea of creating a security system "from Vancouver to Vladivostok" and to prepare and set in motion the appropriate mechanism. These are the views I would like to share on the eve of the NATO summit with regard to the serious problem of the relationship between Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance.
