Farmer say they are ready for a new confrontation with the authorities, two years after the government eradicated hashish and poppy fields in cooperation with Syrian intelligence services. "I'm afraid of God and no one else," said 65-year-old Zayd Sharif, banging his cane on the ground where hashish once grew freely and earned farmers and smugglers between 500 million dollars and one billion dollars per year. The season to grow hashish in eastern Lebanon begins at the end of March. Sharif and other farmers, according to experts, earned about 15 percent of hashish earnings, with the rest going to smugglers and merchants, but it was enough to secure what many people here call "a decent life." "Hashish meant I could build a stone house to replace my mud house. It helped me feed, clothe and educate my children," Sharif said. "If my son went hungry, I'd even kill my brother to feed him." Sharif said his family was now in need because the government reneged on promises to help find an alternative crop to hashish. Like other farmers Sharif never saved money from his hashish earnings for a rainy day. "I never thought that day would come," he said. A security official in the region said farmers had been warned time and again to avoid dealing with hashish. Violators -- farmers, merchants and smugglers -- can face up to seven years in jail. The authorities in 1992 launched a massive crackdown on widespread hashish and poppy growing in the al-Biqa' with the help of Syrian troops who have been deployed in Lebanon since 1976. Around 500 hectares (1,235 acres) of hashish were destroyed in 1992. The following year, some farmers took up arms to resist but the authorities burned 100 hectares (250 acres) of hashish. Bernard Frahi of the UN Drug Control Program (UNDCP) told a regional meeting in Damascus last month that the Syrian-backed campaign had been "successful in eradicating illegal crops" from the al-Biqa'. But the former director of the state-run Green Plan project, 'Abdallah Yazbik, dismissed this as wishful thinking. "They are fooling themselves unless they adopt a grass-roots plan to improve agriculture in the region, provide farmers with subsidies, financial and expert assistance and a means to sell their produce," Yazbik told AFP. On February 7, Lebanon signed a 4.2 million-dollar deal with the UNDCP and the UN Development Programme to help farmers grow alternative crops, sell their produce and improve irrigation in the Ba'labakk-al-Hirmil area of eastern al-Biqa'. Yazbik said the project had been on the back-burner since 1990. He linked its full implementation to peace in the Middle East. "It's a five-year plan. The first phase of it which was signed last month involves lending farmers money to get started on planting new crops," he said. "But how can you sell a 4.2 million dollar project to people who were earning between 500 and 600 million dollars annually from hashish? It's ludicrous," he said. Yazbik, farmers and experts agree that the authorities are not addressing the problem seriously and that the issue is not only hashish but the overall situation of agriculture in Lebanon. The al-Biqa', dubbed Lebanon's bread basket, has traditionally suffered from a lack of private and public investment, and because of the war the situation has deteriorated. 'Ali Ra'd, a veterinarian employed by the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development, called for a long-term project in which international organisations would work hand in hand with the farmers. "The frightening thing is that during a recent survey of the al-Biqa' an expert told us `there is no alternative to hashish,' and that's the truth unless we launch a long-term project to rehabilitate the entire sector. "We need to survey our animal wealth, establish studies to see what are the best cash crops for the area, improve irrigation but also build schools, roads, and clinics for the villages and set up cooperatives," he said.
