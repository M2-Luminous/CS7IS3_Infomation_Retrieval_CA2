The session on June 1, 1994, is scheduled to begin at 12 p.m. and end at 5 p.m. The sessions scheduled for June 2 and 3 are scheduled to begin at 8 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. The purpose of the meeting is to review research and development applications concerned with the measurement and evaluation of health care systems and with testing new methods of health care delivery and management. Applications are reviewed for scientific and technical merit and recommendations regarding their funding are prepared for the Associate Chief Medical Director for Research and Development. The meeting will be open to the public (to the seating capacity of the room) at the start of the June 1 session for approximately one hour to cover administrative matters and to discuss the general status of the program. The closed portion of the meeting involves discussion, examination, reference to, and oral review of staff and consultant critiques of research protocols, and similar documents. During this portion of the meeting, discussion and recommendations will deal with qualifications of personnel conducting the studies, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, as well as research information, the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of proposed agency action regarding such research projects. As provided by the subsection 10(d) of Public Law 92&hyph;463, as amended by Public Law 94&hyph;409, closing portions of these meetings is in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(6) and (9)(B). Due to the limited seating capacity of the room, those who plan to attend the open session should contact Mr. Bill, Judy, Review Program Manager (12B3), Health Services Research and Development Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, Washington, DC 20420 (phone: 202&hyph;523&hyph;7425) at least five days before the meeting.
