The Staff also imposed a Demand for Information upon Mr. Mowry. The hearing will involve IWI's appeal from these Staff rulings. This proceeding will be conducted under the Commission's Informal Hearing Procedures for Adjudications in Materials and Operator Licensing Proceedings, set forth in 10 CFR part 2, Subpart L. Further details appear in the November 15, 1994 Memorandum and Order referenced above. Documents relating to this proceeding are available for public inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L St. N.W., Washington, D.C.

In accordance with 10 CFR 2.1205(i)(4), any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding may within 30 days of publication of this Notice file a petition for leave to intervene. Such petition must identify (1) the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, (2) how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding, with particular reference to the factors set out in 10 CFR 2.1205(g) (and, in particular, whether the petitioner's specified areas of concern are germane to the subject matter of the proceeding), (3) the petitioner's area of concern about the licensing activity that is the subject matter of the proceeding, and (4) the circumstances establishing that the request is timely (in accord with the standard set forth in this Notice).
