DSP Chairman Ouchi Keigo said, "the cabinet should not be formed upon the initiative" of Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichiro Ichikawa, major strategists in the coalition. Ozawa is secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] led by Hata and Ichikawa is secretary general of Komeito, a Buddhist-backed party in the coalition. Ouchi said placing Hata as successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his intention to resign, will stem objection within the coalition as such a decision would be made upon Shinseito's leadership.
