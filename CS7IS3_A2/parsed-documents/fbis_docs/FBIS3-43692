Now we know the results. What I can say is that we must admit the failure of a certain policy that has been adopted in our countries for several months. We must also admit the failure of a certain cooperation policy. Our scope of choosing alternatives was very limited for several reasons. First, in monetary matters, we enjoy joint sovereignty with France which guarantees the convertibility of our currency. This sovereignty is also shared with other states. Second, we have currency problems because we have a currency that is common to 14 states. Third, each country is faced with economic situations in our own states and Mali is no different. We have made a lot of efforts and adopted many measures aimed at redressing the situation. But it is clear that we have inherited a really bad situation. You have noticed that for almost 15 years we have put in place an internal adjustment program. But this program has not enabled us to solve the main problems. It was suicidal to hold on to that with its concomitant problems of layoffs, unemployment, lack of competitiveness, and also the flight of capital and lack of investment in the country. There are therefore no prospects. In the face of all this, it became necessary to adopt such a [word indistinct] measure. Of course, that will not be without problems, we must admit. We must succeed in suppressing [word indistinct]. We must also succeed in cushioning, in solidarity, the social effects, especially on the most exposed classes in the society. But we think that it is possible for us to find the key to tomorrow if we manage the situation well by creating the conditions for greater competitiveness and a situation that favors investment. Ours is a country of farmers, herdsmen, and fishermen. Basically, it is a situation that can enable us to develop our national production. On the industrial level it is possible today to develop our national production. You know our difficulties regarding fraud and the closure of enterprises here and there. I think these are real assets for our country. I expect all the democrats to form the largest possible front -- above partisan quarrels -- in order to face the new situation. It is this patriotic front that can enable us to take up the current challenge. [Unidentified reporter] The devaluation has taken effect. It is a fact today. What can your government propose to Malians today in order to make the cup less bitter, especially for the civil servants? [Konare] I think for several weeks, the government has asked itself many questions. The government -- the prime minister and the ministers -- will soon brief the public and all our economic and social partners on the decisions that have been adopted. The decisions that will be adopted at the national level will also be thoroughly explained. These decisions will be aimed at creating the conditions and giving answers to the daily concerns of the people. They will also be aimed at creating more solidarity and better remuneration of labor in rigor and discipline. This will be indispensable for us. The decisions will also be aimed at creating the conditions for competitiveness for investments to be made and national production developed, as I have said. Without doubt, they will be aimed at -- and I think this is indispensable -- strengthening our ability to take care of ourselves, move toward more regional integration, and basically reinforce solidarity among Africans.
