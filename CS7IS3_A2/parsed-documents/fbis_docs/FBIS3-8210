General Rasim Delic said the Bosnian army had "no confidence" in the neutrality of Russian troops and did not want to see them deployed, even as observers, in line with a UN plan to reopen Tuzla airport. People were "irritated with things they (the Russians) have done. Some incidents could happen and it has to be avoided," Delic said. Twenty-five Russian experts arrived in Zagreb Friday en route for Tuzla, where they are to visit the airport in preparation for Russian deployment. In an interview with AFP, the commander of the Bosnian army said the besieged mainly Moslem population in Tuzla mistrusted the UN idea of deploying Russian troops there, viewing the Russians as allies of the Serbs. Delic said the airport at Tuzla was Bosnian property and that the Bosnian government should be able to decide who was based there. "We're not asking for some special troops but we don't want the Russians," Delic said, also rejecting the idea of Russian observers, if that were proposed instead of armed soldiers. The United Nations has said it will start using Tuzla airport this month to boost the humanitarian aid effort in central Bosnia. Serb forces besiege almost half a million people in Tuzla and have bombed the airport several times in recent weeks. The Russian experts are to visit the airport, which Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said Tuesday in Moscow they had agreed to reopen after almost two year's closure. Bosnian government officials have already protested the deployment of 400 Russian UN troops behind Serb lines in Sarajevo. Meanwhile ceasefires were holding broadly, UN officials said. But UN peacekeepers admitted problems pinpointing the origins of the sporadic shellfire that fell within the NATO-imposed exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital. Two mortars shells fell overnight Friday near the UN-controlled Sarajevo airport, without causing casualties, said UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Major Rob Annink. The incident was the latest breach of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's heavy weapons exclusion zone set up 20-kilometres (12-miles) around Sarajevo. UN Bosnian Commander General Sir Michael Rose on Friday repeated his urgent appeal for more UN troops to be sent to Bosnia to help enforce the ceasefires, warning continued ceasefire breaches threatened to topple the fragile peace process. The British general has called for at least 5,000 more troops to reinforce the 13,000 UNPROFOR soldiers already in Bosnia. Meanwhile, five 122-mm howitzers discovered inside the Sarajevo exclusion zone Thursday have been driven out by the Serbs, UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said, adding that a sixth was due to leave Saturday. The Serbs told UNPROFOR that they considered that the weapons, discovered at Cifluk, 19 kilometres from Sarajevo, were outside the exclusion zone. In central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina British and Canadian UN troops were due Saturday to deploy along the confrontation lines between government soldiers and Bosnian Croat forces. UNPROFOR planned to inspect 350 kilometres of front lines, mainly in the areas around Vitez, Mostar, Gorni Vakuf, Prozor, Konijc and Jablanica. The opening of six aid routes through the front lines were also to be negotiated. Under the terms of a Croat-Moslem ceasefire which came into force late last month, all HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and Bosnian army checkpoints are to be dismantled or placed under UN control.
