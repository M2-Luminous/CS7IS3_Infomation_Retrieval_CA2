In reply to a question as to what led Iran to decide to establish ties with South Africa, Mahdavi says: "It should noted that diplomatic ties have not been established with South Africa. After the elections in April 1994, when the deprived and suffering people of South Africa have attained their rights and taken over the management of the country, we will, God willing, establish diplomatic ties with South Africa. But what was recently approved in the country and brought to the attention of the people was the lifting of the restrictions we had on our economic ties with South Africa." Mahdavi then comments on the events leading to the forthcoming free elections and abrogation of apartheid in South Africa. On the reason for Iran's decision, he says: "What led us to decide to establish economic ties with South Africa was, first, the recent events in South Africa and, second, the direct request of the combative groups in South Africa, who wrote to us and asked us to lift the restrictions on trade with South Africa. However, we have deferred the establishment of diplomatic ties, which will be the main basis of relations between our country and South Africa, until after the elections, when every black person has attained his rights there." Asked about Western media propaganda about Iran's u-turn in its policy on Israel and South Africa, Mahdavi says: "They, themselves, know that they are not being truthful and that what they are saying is not correct. We have declared our stance on these two from the start. About South Africa, we said that when racism is abolished there and the oppressed and innocent people of South Africa take over power -- on the basis of one man one vote -- we would establish diplomatic and economic ties with that country. And we are moving in that direction now. However, our stance on the Zionist regime has been clear from the start. His holiness the imam said that the Zionist regime must be destroyed. Yes, when the Zionist regime is destroyed and the people of Palestine take over power, our relations with the people of Palestine -- which is now occupied, but will then be free -- will be established."
