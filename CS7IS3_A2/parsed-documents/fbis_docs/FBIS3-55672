In his speech, the president emphasized it was not what one would wish, but it was compelled by this moment in the internal and external political situation. In the words of Meri, an exceedingly unsuitable time has been chosen for the government reshuffle, because leading Estonian politicians should, at present, give the main attention to the NATO and the U.S.-Russia summit meetings, and not to the examination of, so to speak, one's own navel. The president regards the wish by the Isamaa [Fatherland faction] to stay in power at any cost as the cause of the situation that has arisen. The president expressed surprise that Laar himself did not resign, but began a government reshuffle. The resignation of Laar, in the opinion of Lennart Meri, is in the interests of Isamaa itself. The Isamaa crisis is a crisis for the prime minister. Meri appealed also for a decisive expansion of the government coalition. With that, the president has officially released Toomas Sildmae from the position as economy minister, and appointed Heiki Kranich and Toivo Jurgenson as finance and economy ministers respectively.
