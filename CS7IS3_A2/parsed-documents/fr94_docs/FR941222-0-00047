For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board is amending 12 CFR parts 208 and 225 as set forth below: PART 208_MEMBERSHIP OF STATE BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (REGULATION H) 1. The authority citation for part 208 continues to read as follows: Authority: 12 U.S.C. 36, 248(a), 248(c), 321&hyph;338, 371d, 461, 481&hyph;486, 601, 611, 1814, 1823(j), 1828(o), 1831o, 1831p&hyph;1, 3105, 3310, 3331&hyph;3351 and 3906&hyph;3909; 15 U.S.C. 78b, 78l(b), 78l(g), 78l(i), 78o&hyph;4(c) (5), 78q, 78q&hyph;l, and 78w; 31 U.S.C. 5318. 2. Appendix A to part 208 is amended by adding a new paragraph (iv) to the introductory text of Section II.B. to read as follows: Appendix A to Part 208_Capital Adequacy Guidelines for State Member Banks: Risk-Based Measure * * * * * II. *␣*␣* B. *␣*␣* (iv) Deferred tax assets_portions are deducted from the sum of core capital elements in accordance with section II.B.4. of this Appendix A. * * * * * 3. Appendix A to Part 208 is amended by: a. Revising footnote 19 in section II.B.3.; b. Removing footnote 20 from the end of section II.B.3.; and c. Adding section II.B.4. The additions and revisions read as follows: * * * * * II. *␣*␣* B. *␣*␣* 3. *␣*␣* 19 *␣*␣* 19 Deductions of holdings of capital securities also would not be made in the case of interstate ``stake out'' investments that comply with the Board's Policy Statement on Nonvoting Equity Investments, 12 CFR 225.143 (Federal Reserve Regulatory Service 4&hyph;172.1; 68 Federal Reserve Bulletin 413 (1982)). In addition, holdings of capital instruments issued by other banking organizations but taken in satisfaction of debts previously contracted would be exempt from any deduction from capital. The Board intends to monitor nonreciprocal holdings of other banking organizations' capital instruments and to provide information on such holdings to the Basle Supervisors' Committee as called for under the Basle capital framework. 4. Deferred tax assets. The amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, that may be included in, that is, not deducted from, a bank's capital may not exceed the lesser of: (i) the amount of these deferred tax assets that the bank is expected to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projections of future taxable income for that year, 20 or (ii) 10 percent of tier 1 capital. For purposes of calculating this limitation, Tier 1 capital is defined as the sum of core capital elements, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted). The amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and that do not exceed the amount which the bank could reasonably expect to have refunded by its parent (if applicable) generally are not limited. The reported amount of deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, in excess of these amounts is to be deducted from a bank's core capital elements in determining tier 1 capital. 20 Projected future taxable income should not include net operating loss carryforwards to be used during that year or the amount of existing temporary differences a bank expects to reverse within the year. Such projections should include the estimated effect of tax planning strategies that the organization expects to implement to realize net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards that would otherwise expire during the year. Institutions may use the future taxable income projections for their current fiscal year (adjusted for any significant changes that have occurred or are expected to occur) when applying the capital limit at an interim report date rather than preparing a new projection each quarter. To determine the limit, an institution should assume that all existing temporary differences fully reverse as of the report date. * * * * * 4.
