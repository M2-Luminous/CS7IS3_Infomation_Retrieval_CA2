FR941012-0-00002 FR941012-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ACE&hyph;07] Revision of Class E Airspace; Harper Municipal Airport, KS/ AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action modifies the Class E airspace at the Harper Municipal Airport, Harper, Kansas. Prior to the Airspace Reclassification, the Class E airspace for Harper, Kansas, was designed to exclude that airspace east of 98 degrees longitude. However, during Airspace Reclassification, the excluded area, including the Bob Park Airport (private), was inadvertently omitted. The intended effect of this action is to exclude the Class E airspace east of 98 degrees longitude above the Bob Park Airport (private) located northeast of Harper, Kansas. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., December 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kathy J. Randolph, Airspace Technician, System Management Branch, ACE&hyph;530c, Federal Aviation Administration, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; telephone number: (816) 426&hyph;3408. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On January 7, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class E airspace at the Harper Municipal Airport, Harper, Kansas (59 FR 4612). Prior to Airspace Reclassification, the Class E airspace area for Harper, Kansas excluded that airspace east of 98 degrees longitude. During Airspace Reclassification, this excluded area was inadvertently omitted. The NPRM proposed to exclude that airspace ``north of Hwy 160 and east of longitude 98 00 ’00 ’ ’ W. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. One commenter objected to the proposal because it did not exclude all the airspace east of 98 degrees longitude. The inclusion of the airspace ``north of Hwy 160 ’ ’ within the excluded area was in error. This amendment corrects that error in the NPRM by deleting the Class E airspace east of 98 degrees longitude, which was inadvertently omitted in the airspace reclassification. It has been determined this exclusion will not compromise safety to aircraft arriving or departing the Harper, Kansas, Municipal Airport. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) amends Class E airspace at Harper, Kansas, by excluding the Class E airspace east of 98 degrees longitude above the Bob Park airport (private) located northeast of Harper, Kansas. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034: February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
