Background EPA is charged with administration of section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346. Section 408 authorizes EPA to establish tolerance levels and exemptions from the requirements of a tolerance for residues of pesticide chemicals in or on raw agricultural commodities. Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 162.3(c), and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting and spreading agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement on inert ingredients published in the Federal Register of Arpil 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. Where it can be determined that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not need some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert ingredient. The Agency has evaluated data pertaining to all of the listed studies in developing this proposed rule. In those cases where the toxicity of an inert ingredient is such that exposure to the inert ingredient must be restricted to assure that the use of the inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation is not injurious to the public health, EPA will propose to establish a tolerance for residues of the inert ingredient on raw agricultural commodities. II. Provisions of Rule Zeneca Ag Products, 1800 Concord Pike, P.O. Box 751, Wilmington, DE 19897, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 6F3344 proposing to amend 40 CFR 180.1026 by establishing a regulation to permit residues of N,N-diallyl dichloroacetamide when used as an inert ingredient (safener) in formulations applied to corn fields before the corn plants emerge from the soil with a maximum use level of 1.0 pound of this safener per acre per year in or on corn, fodder at 0.05 ppm, corn, forage at 0.05 ppm and corn, grain at 0.05 ppm. EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62123), announcing receipt of this petition. No comments were received in response to the notice of filing. A safener is a herbicidal antidote that protects desirous crops while allowing the herbicide to act on the intended weed targets. This safener will be used with the active ingredient acetochlor. The data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have been evaluated. This inert ingredient is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerance is sought. The toxicological, ecological, and environmental fate data considered in support of the proposed tolerance include: 1. An acute rat oral toxicity study with an acute oral LD 50 of 2,055 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg). 2. An acute rabbit dermal toxicity study with an acute dermal LD 50 of > 5,000 mg/kg. 3. A rabbit eye irritation study in which N,N -diallyl dichloroacetamide is determined not to be an eye irritant. 4. An acute rat inhalation toxicity study with a 4-hour inhalation LC 50 of > 5.6 mg/L. 5. A rabbit primary dermal irritation study indicating that dichlormid is a mild dermal irritant. 6. A 90-day rat oral toxicity study with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 200 parts per million (ppm) or 10 mg/kg/day. 7. A 90-day dog oral toxicity study with a NOEL of 5 mg/kg/day or 200 ppm. 8. A rat developmental effects study with a NOEL for maternal toxicity of 40 mg/kg/day and developmental toxicity of 40 mg/kg/day. 9. A 14-week rat inhalation study with a NOEL of 2 mg/m 3 . 10. Mutagenicity studies including in vivo/in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes, Mammalian Cells in Culture Cytogenetic Assay in human lymphocytes, in vivo Micronucleus Assay in Mice, Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian plate incorporation (Ames) assay with and without metabolic activation were negative. 11. An acute mallard duck oral toxicity study with an LD 50 of > 5,620 mg/kg. 12. An acute bobwhite quail oral toxicity study with an LD 50 of 1,545 mg/kg. 13. A bobwhite quail dietary toxicity (LC 50 ) study with an LC 50 of > 5,200 ppm. 14. A 96-hour rainbow trout static acute toxicity study with an LC 50 of 103 mg/liter (L). 15. A 48-hour daphnia magna static toxicity study with an EC 50 of 161 mg/L. 16. Environmental fate studies including hydrolysis, photodegradation in water and on soil, aerobic soil metabolism, mobility (batch equilibrium) studies. A reference dose (RfD) has not been established for this chemical. However, a Provisional Acceptable Daily Intake (PADI) has been established at 0.005 mg/kg/day based on the 90-day dog oral toxicity study NOEL of 5 mg/kg/day. The theoretical worst-case maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from the proposed tolerance is estimated to be 0.000017 mg/kg/bwt (bodyweight)/day for the overall U.S. population, representing 0.3% of the PADI for dichlormid. The TMRC for the most highly exposed subgroup, non-nursing infants less than 1 year, is 0.000049 mg/kg/bwt/day, or approximately 1% of the PADI. This tolerance is being established as a time-limited tolerance because the Agency does not have data from two chronic feeding/oncogenicity studies which are part of the toxicology data typically required to be submitted in support of a tolerance request. These studies will be required to be submitted to the Agency by January 31, 1998. In addition, product chemistry data to fulfill Guidelines Nos. 61, 62, 63-2 through 63-6, 63-8, and 63-13 must be submitted within 6 months of the date of this notice. When the Agency receives these chronic feeding/oncogenicity studies it will reassess the tolerance. However, based upon the data considered in support of the tolerance and the low degree of dietary exposure, the Agency does not believe that this time-limited tolerance poses significant risks. The Agency believes that this use will not result in residues in processed food requiring additional food additive regulations because of the low residues in the raw agricultural commodities, the structural similarity to acetochlor, and the rapid metabolism of the safener in plants. However, the Agency is requiring that a processing study on the safener be submitted by March 31, 1996, to confirm that food additive regulations are not needed. This tolerance will expire December 31, 1998. Residues not in excess of these tolerances will not be considered actionable if a pesticide containing this inert ingredient is legally applied during the term of a conditional registration under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended and in accordance with the acceptable labeling under a conditional registration. This tolerance will be revoked if any data indicate such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. An analytical method for determination of the nature of the residue, gas-liquid chromatography using an electron-capture detector, has been reviewed by the Agency, and upon successful completion of an Agency method validation, will be made available in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II), for enforcement purposes. In the interim, the method will be available at the address given below.

Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1130A, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-5937. Based upon the above information considered by the Agency, the tolerance established by amending 40 CFR part 180 would protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
