Speaking at a regular news conference he said that the government will closely monitor the implementation of this year's economic policy and, depending on the situation, would decide whether or not to convene an extraordinary session. [passage omitted] Answering a question about the cease-fire in the former Bosnia- Herzegovina and the decision of the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress on the lifting of the embargo on arms imports for the Muslims, Kontic said that a short-term cease-fire, as well as the decision on lifting the embargo, are encouraging Muslims to persist in the war option. He added that some of President Clinton's statements that the arms embargo will not be lifted were encouraging. Asked about the army and police allegedly stepping up their activities in Raska, about which the Muslim National Council of Sandzak has informed foreign journalists, Kontic said that this was not true and that such claims are spread in order to exert pressure on Serbia, primarily from abroad. He added that he had given instructions for an investigation to be carried out. [passage omitted]
