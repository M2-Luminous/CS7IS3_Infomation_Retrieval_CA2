On 24 February, the CEA announced that the licensing agreement that was just signed will enable REOSC to use this "sol-gel" process to make scientific optical components and anti-reflection glass panes, especially to protect art works. The technique was developed at the Limeil-Valenton center in connection with research on military power lasers and is covered by several patents; it consists in depositing by capillarity high-performance thin films, a few microns thick. The "sol-gel" process uses submicron particles of oxides or fluorides in an alcohol- or water-based medium. After evaporation of the solvent, these particles form a brittle porous optical film, but one of the anti-reflection coatings, Flucosil, is a dense abrasion-resistant and water-repellent composite film. The process works at ordinary temperatures (around 120xC) and even at room temperature, so that it can be applied to mineral or plastic media. According to the CEA, it can also treat large areas at very competitive prices. A subsidiary of the French aircraft equipment manufacturer SFIM-Industries [Measuring Instruments Manufacturing Company], REOSC Optique is a world-renowned specialist of high-precision optics for satellites such as Spot. It is currently grinding the first eight-meter diameter mirror of the Very Large Telescope (VLT) that will be installed at the European Southern Observatory (ESO), on top of Cerro Paranal, in Chile.
