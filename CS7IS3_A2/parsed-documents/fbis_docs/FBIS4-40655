General Sagadat Nurmagambetov, the defense minister, and Economy Minister Mars Urkumbayev presented reports. An exchange of opinions was held, summed up by Nursultan Nazarbayev: We must precisely decide what an army needs -- how many men we need -- he said. We should urgently tackle all questions connected with equipping the Armed Forces, we should, to a maximum degree, reduce import of military products from outside, and to the best of our possibilities manufacture such products in Kazakhstan. The head of state set an objective--in one week's time--to set up a commission on the military industry. Its chairman will be directly responsible for the situation in this important sphere, which should provide reliable defense capability for our sovereign state.
