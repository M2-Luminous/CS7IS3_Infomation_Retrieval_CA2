The situation is such that our coast is undefended, and the absence of the F-16 in our space shows that we cannot defend our land and sea. Mr. Pressler declared Pakistan a hostile nation three years ago. Perhaps he does not know the difference between gunpowder and atomic bombs. The American policy shows that they want to make Pakistan a sacrificial lamb or goat and throw it in front of the bloodthirsty wolves. If we review relations between the United States and Pakistan, it is clear that the United States has not been faithful even to its good friends. There is an old adage used by the soldiers in the West: If you are faithful to your friend, then you are unfaithful to God. The Americans follow this adage perfectly. In the Gulf War, it started Operation Desert Storm to help its friends. It then demanded billions of dollars to meet its war expenses. First it emphasized the need for nuclear power in Pakistan, and when Pakistan reached its goal of producing nuclear power, it then began to make noise and asked it to stop. When India exploded a nuclear bomb in May 1974, it was commended, even though India had fought wars with both China and Pakistan. America is extremely powerful, but because of its biased nature, its foreign policy has been very ineffective. It is falling in the eyes of the free world. The United States had no desire for Pakistan to reduce its defense budget. The Americans praised their agents for this goal, and then had them raise the slogan that Pakistan must reduce its defense expenses. Why should we reduce defense expenses? No logical reason was given for this. Pakistan has had an open stand, that militarily weak Pakistan had always been a "delicious morsel" for India to devour. India had always suppressed the weak, be it in the Kashmir issue, Goa, Nepal, Bhutan, Hyderabad (Deccan), Junagarh, Manavdar, Mangrol, Naxalbari, the Nagas, Mizo tribals, or former East Pakistan. India always forced itself into any place where it saw weakness. The Americans always supported India in Asia and have ignored India's belligerence, war craze, and expansionist designs. The balance of military power is essential for a stable, peaceful environment, especially in Asian and African nations; however, the United States of America has also tried to establish India's supremacy in Asia. A good air, land, and sea army is important for any country. If Pakistan wants to strengthen and stabilize its defense forces, that is its natural and legal right. The United States, because of its erroneous policy, or to gain specific goals, wants to impose restrictions on its "weapons." If it does not change this attitude, there is the strong possibility that Pakistan will get its military needs from Western nations and China. The United States believes that Pakistan cannot function without its technology. The Americans are wrong. They are not fully aware of the skills of the Pakistani people. The question arises: Since the United States is a trading nation, is it backing away from its agreement in order to put pressure on Pakistan to close its nuclear plant? Can the nuclear plant be closed? The way the United States wants to disarm Pakistan in the name of peace in Asia is causing negative results. Just because of U.S. stubbornness, the whole nation agrees on the point that Pakistan should make a nuclear bomb, and should talk to other countries in order to meet its needs. The Americans should think about it all since they have themselves made thousands of nuclear bombs and stored them in safe places, they have spent billions of dollars and established two "secure places" underground, where nuclear radiation cannot reach. The Pakistani army is not a police force; it also has to protect and defend the nation. It also is endangered by India's expansionist designs. Of course, the armed forces keep the Pakistani government informed about its needs. The Pakistani army cannot expect internal and external pressures. The present Pakistani government, led by Madam Benazir Bhutto, who represents a strong and flawless political heritage, is expected to keep in mind the needs of military Pakistan. Madam Benazir Bhutto surely considers Pakistan more important than her own life, and she is aware of the needs of our armed forces. If the Americans do not review their attitude, they will soon lose their good friends. It is also possible that Benazir Bhutto will make changes in her new social contract and will order military training for all men and women under the age 45. Perhaps the Americans want a peaceful nation to become a belligerent one; however, the Pakistani people want to benefit from peaceful but modern technology. The United States should participate in the effort to make Pakistan a peaceful area, one that is strong in defense. Every U. S. president has said during the last half century that a strong, stable America is important for world peace. Will not a strong Pakistan assure peace in Asia?
