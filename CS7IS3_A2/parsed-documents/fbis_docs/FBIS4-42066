This line that has leaked from the Brussels Commission will be agreed upon at Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl's meeting with French President Francois Mitterrand on Monday [30 May]. In Friday's Bundestag session, Kohl announced that his government wants to use the [German EU] presidency starting on 1 July for making 1994 a year of success in European unification. Rudolf Scharping, Social Democratic Party of Germany chairman, accused Kohl of failures in his European policy. In their consultations in Alsace, Kohl and Mitterrand will set the course for the European Council meeting in Greece on 24 June. Greece has held the EU presidency since the beginning of this year. SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG has been informed that the chancellor and the president agree that Belgium's Prime Minister Dehaene will succeed Jacques Delors as Commission president. Meanwhile, 10 of the 12 EU governments are said to share this view. The other candidates for Commission president are Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and British Foreign Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan. The British candidate is not considered to stand much chance; the Dutch one might be slightly more successful. It has been said that the time has come to bring it home to Lubbers that he should "withdraw gracefully." Should Bonn and Paris succeed in making Belgium's Dehaene EU president, Belgium would support a German secretary general. State Secretary Trumpf would be available for that position. Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel have already agreed on this option. Trumpf, a longtime ambassador to the European Community, is a Social Democrat. [passage omitted]
