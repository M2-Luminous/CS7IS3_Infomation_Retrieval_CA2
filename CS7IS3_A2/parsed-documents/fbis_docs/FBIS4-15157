He confirmed the following: The elections took place in all 450 electoral districts. In the first round, 49 deputies were elected, of which 11 are engineers, 13 education system workers, three lawyers and economists. In terms of party membership, the break-down of deputies is as follows: 12 members of the Communist Party of Ukraine, four members of the Rukh, two from the Ukrainian Republican Party, Ukrainian Peasants' Party, and Socialist Party each, while other 24 were independent deputies. In the words of Ivan Yemets, most of the parties retain their positions in the second round of elections. In the first place, this applies to Communists, Socialists, and national democrats. Ivan Yemets expressed confidence that the "second round will give Ukraine a new legislature." Asked how many deputies are required to make the new Ukrainian parliament work, Ivan Yemets responded: The present legislation has some discrepancies regarding this question. This is why it will clear up later whether 226 or 301 deputies will be necessary." Speaking on the Crimean referendum, Ivan Yemets declared that the Central Electoral Commission had nothing to do with it. This is solely the business of the Crimean president. It was announced that most of the electoral commissions set the second-round election for 10 April. In this connection, Ivan Yemets called on the press representative to explain to the population the need to elect a new parliament. Rukh Garnered 12 Percent Of 49 deputies elected on 27 March, 11 represent the Rukh or were supported by it. They include the organization's activists Vyacheslav Chornovil, Les Tanyuk, Mykhaylo Kosiv, Yaroslav Kendzyor, Serhyy Holovatyy, Andryy Mostyskyy -- all were members of the previous Supreme Council. The Election Results Were Fabricated Levko Lukyanenko, honorary chairman of the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] and cochairman of the Democratic Bloc "Ukraine," noted: "The outcome of this election is not the result of the electorate's preferences, but the result of the struggle conducted by the party in power with democratic forces. We are dealing here not with the real popular choice, but the documentation of the actual balance of forces. The party in power used its structures and exerted an immense influence on the electorate, resorting to intimidation, forgery, and blatant violation of the electoral law. In many places, fearful of losing their jobs, people refused to be observers. The electorate is scared, in particular, the part that we counted on. The elections took place in an atmosphere of a flagrant violation of law and intimidation," Levko Lukyanenko emphasized. The cochairman of the Democratic Bloc "Ukraine" cited the following facts: In Lugansk Oblast, instead of distributing ballot papers, they made lists indicating who voted for whom. In Tarashchanskyy Electoral District, where the URP's candidate Petro Borsuk ran, a truck crashed into Borsuk's car in the evening of 27 March. After the truck's driver was hospitalized with a concussion, rumor spread that it was Borsuk himself who was in the hospital. Asked to comment on the defeat of the URP leader, Mykhaylo Horyn, in the election delivered by Stepan Khmara, Levko Lukyanenko noted that there are two reasons for this. First, some disservice was done by discontent with Horyn's brother, Mykola, who is head of the Lvov Oblast Council. Second, Stepan Khmara deliberately ran in the same district with Horyn to demonstrate his hostility to the URP, and used all of his eloquence to deceive uneducated social groups. "However, Mykhaylo Horyn," Levko Lukyanenko noted, "was not knocked off his feet. He still has his energy, and will continue to work for Ukraine." Negative Opinion Serhyy Holovatyy, the newly elected deputy and head of the Ukrainian Legal Foundation, spoke critically about the results of the first-round election to the Supreme Council. He stated that "presidential representatives, who have already inflicted heavy damages on Ukraine," will sneak through rural electoral districts. In his words, the Ukrainian people will feel the negative consequences of their choice for a long time to come. Communists' Performance [subhead] In the headquarters of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, we were told that their candidate, Oleksandr Bozhko, qualified for the second round in the Pecherskyy Constituency of Kiev City. However, the Socialists declined to say how many of their candidates made it to the second round of the election, asking us to wait until official announcement of the election In the headquarters of the Communist Party of Ukraine, we were told that the party's 173 candidates won in the first round in 22 Ukrainian oblasts, including Oleh Hrachov, Oleksandr Bondarchuk, and Volodymyr Martynyuk. Performance of the Greens The 31 members of the Green Party that were put forward by working teams, and not by the party, were not successful. In particular, the party's leader Vitalyy Kononov, an independent candidate at the Gagarin Electoral District, did not get to the second round of the elections. "New Ukraine" and Liberals] The Secretariat of the "New Ukraine" said that their two members, Volodymyr Hrynyov and Volodymyr Filenko, who ran from Kharkov, qualified for the second-round election. According to the party's Donetsk-based organization, four Liberal Party members, including its vice president Yuryy Baskakov, entered the second round. Mass Agitation in the Crimea The Crimean National Movement Organization [OKNR], the Crimean organization of the URP, the Ukrainian Civilian Congress of the Crimea, and the Committee "Crimea With Ukraine" made public a declaration emphasizing serious violations of law in the elections that have just taken place. The "statement by Yuryy Meshkov, the highest official in the Republic, made on the eve of the election" is called one of the grossest violations. The documents also points to the fact that according to preliminary findings, the poll did not result in an overwhelming approval -- it was ignored by the Crimean Tatars, a considerable part of Ukrainians, and representatives of other nationalities. "We are confident," the declaration's authors stated, "that the poll's results will be fabricated." In this connection, the OKNR and other Crimean pro-Ukrainian organizations announced their intention of coordinating their activities regarding the issues of "preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity." Leaders of the Ukrainian Civilian Congress, the Committee "Crimea With Ukraine", and the OKNR held a press conference, where Ihor Banakh, deputy chairman of the Committee "Crimea With Ukraine," discussed "numerous violations during the Crimean election." In his words, there were cases in which one individual could vote for several candidates. In one of the electoral districts of the Krasnoperekopsk District, the militia detained a group of people encouraging people to vote for the "Russia" Bloc. Members of electoral commissions removed posted information on pro-Ukrainian candidates. Ihor Banakh expressed his personal hope that official Kiev will pursue tougher policies with regard to manifestations of the Crimean separatism.
