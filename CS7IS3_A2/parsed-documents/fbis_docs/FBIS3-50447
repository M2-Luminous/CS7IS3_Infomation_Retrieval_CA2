The agreement includes cooperation in aerospace research, mutual technology transfer of military materiel, joint ventures in oil production and construction, and other transactions. Brazil and Russia signed a trade agreement on 3 December to increase their annual trade from $200 million to $2 billion over the next five years, military correspondent William Waack reported in the 4 December conservative daily O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO. During his official visit to Russia from 1 to 3 December, Brazilian Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Jose Eduardo de Andrade Vieira and Russian Foreign Economic Relations Minister Oleg Davydov discussed the possibilities of space research, transfer of supersonic airplane technology, and exports of Brazilian foodstuffs. Waack noted, however, that everything still hinges on an interbanking agreement that has not even been initiated. During his Moscow trip, Waack continued, Vieira also visited the Moscow Space Center and was again told by the Russians that they would like to use the Alcantara launch site in Maranhao State for the international Iridium project. Vieira spoke favorably of the project, which envisages placing roughly 60 communication satellites in orbit within the next two years, and said that he would present it to Brazilian President Franco. Moscow's independent, business-oriented KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 4 December, however, said that plans for Russian participation in the project were being developed "at Brazil's suggestion." The Moscow state-run news agency ITAR- TASS on 3 December also quoted Vieira as saying that he had met earlier in the day with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin to discuss Brazil's participation in the international Iridium space communications project involving the use of Russian Proton booster rockets. Brazil's O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 4 December cited diplomats familiar with this issue saying that "the main obstacle" to this project would soon be removed: The Brazilian government is now "willing" to join the Missile Technology Control Regime soon, accepting "an international code of conduct that does not allow the transfer of the technology for building and operating missiles to third parties." Arms and Aerospace KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 4 December noted that "Russia has long been mulling over plans for an outlet to the Latin American arms market. Brazil may become a good springboard for the products of the Russian aerospace complex. In Moscow, the Brazilian side once again expressed interest in joint development of inertial guidance systems for space-launch vehicles." O ESTADO of 4 December reported that the Monteiro Aranha Group has been negotiating for 18 months with the Russians to purchase defense materiel to assemble Russian MiG-29 supersonic fighters at the Brazilian Aeronautics Company (Embraer) facilities, as well as to buy ships and helicopters. The source quoted one of Vieira's advisers to the effect that the Monteiro Aranha Group "sought a fait accompli so the Armed Forces would have to approve these deals." Moscow's ITAR-TASS and official military newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, as well as various Brazilian dailies, speculated extensively during September on the ongoing negotiations between the two countries over possible swaps of Russian war materiel for Brazilian foodstuffs. Rio de Janeiro daily JORNAL DO BRASIL on 1 December, however, noted that Frederico Robalinho, trade policy secretary of the Brazilian Ministry of Industry and Commerce, has denied knowing anything about reported Brazilian government purchases of Russian arms. According to JORNAL, reports of possible exchanges of Russian arms for Brazilian food products began circulating in September when Brazilian Army Minister Zenildo Zoroastro de Lucena visited Russia. Robalinho, however, commented only that Brazil is interested in the purchase of helicopters such as the MI-26, spare parts and maintenance of military equipment, as well as a nonmilitary ship to replace the "Barao de Tefe" in the Antarctic. Robalinho, JORNAL added, described this negotiation as "historic" because Brazil and Russia are for the first time carrying out an accord that will develop all possible trade opportunities. In a related press report, the weekly Sao Paulo news magazine ISTOE reported on 24 November that the Brazilian Army will receive Russian surface-to-air missiles that will be distributed to various infantry headquarters. The delivery of the missiles, according to ISTOE, will begin early in 1994. In an earlier "exclusive" report (ISTOE, 18 November) regarding the negotiations between Brazil and Russia, Army Minister General Zoroastro lauded the "great efficiency of light arms, particularly grenade launchers, manufactured by the Russian defense industry. General Zoroastro also announced that talks between Brazil and Russia to designate a Brazilian Armed Forces attache to Moscow have been concluded; likewise, Russia would have an Army attache assigned to Brasilia. Background of the Accord On 18 November, leading Sao Paulo business daily GAZETA MERCANTIL provided considerable detail on the scope and background of the then upcoming Russia-Brazil trade accord. GAZETA commented that the governments of Brazil and Russia had concluded their largest ever economic agreement, the result of "authentic diplomatic engineering spanning five years of secret negotiations" and the "final intermediation, in the Brazilian private sector, by the two Rio entrepreneurial groups, Monteiro Aranha and its associate, ITS Participacoes." The accord provides for bilateral trade increasing to $5 billion in the next five years, with financing from the two governments. The annual volume of trade anticipated is almost six times greater than the $172 million projected for 1993, GAZETA added. During this period, GAZETA continued, Brazil is committing itself to purchasing various Russian arms and ammunition, rockets, large military helicopters for use in the Amazon Region, special fishing boats and icebreakers, hydraulic and thermal turbines and generators, petroleum and its by-products, gas, chemical-pharmaceutical products, fertilizers, nonferrous metals, primarily aluminum and its by-products, and Portland cement. Russia, in turn, will buy from Brazil the following: designs for hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants; agricultural equipment; beef and pork; soybeans and derivatives; sugar, cocoa, and coffee; textiles; and finished and semifinished shoes. Two lines of credit have been specially established in the "store account" system, GAZETA continued. In sales of raw materials and commodities" to Russia, the term of payment will be one year and at London Inter-Bank Overnight Rate (LIBOR) rates. In exports of equipment, machines, and manufactured products, the term will be five years, also at LIBOR rates. Banks and firms directly involved are Bank of Brazil, Sao Paulo State Bank, Monteiro Aranha, Andrade Gutierrez, Embraer, Brazilian Petroleum Corporation (Petrobras), Ceval, Vinicola Aurora, Tramontina, Iochpe-Maxion, Grendene, Portobello, Olvebra, Artex, and Neiva. KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 4 December said that lines of credit from the Russian side will probably be provided by Mosbiznesbank, Mezhkombank, Imperial Bank, and the Export-Import Bank. The accord also provides for the establishment of "joint ventures" including the following enterprises: * Andrade Gutierrez and Monteiro Aranha, in association with Agrarian Technologies of Russia, Neftkom, MID-Continent of the United States and John Brown of Great Britain, to design and build a refinery in Krasnodar; * Brazilian firms and Anglo Resources Ltd. in oil exploration in the Stavropol Basin; * Monteiro Aranha and Anglo Siberian Oil Ltd. in developing the design and construction of a refinery in Krasnoyarsk, as well as participating in the consortium to build a bridge over the Yenisey River in the same area. Providing an historical perspective to the agreement, GAZETA went on to say that from the diplomatic standpoint, this accord with Russia has a very special strategic dimension," particularly concerning cooperation in "sensitive" technologies that will be started with "very small-scale transactions." Such, it went on to say, is the case of the association of Embraer with the Russian aeronautical and space conglomerate, Aviaprom, together with Mashinoeksport, the sectoral foreign "trading" company. The two Russian firms presented a formal proposal to Embraer to form a multinational group, in which Argentine and South African state firms would participate to develop the CBA-123, a civilian aircraft that has been gradually developed by Embraer. Aviaprom and Mashinoeksport subsequently invited Embraer to examine their "Delfine" and "Be-30" models with Russian TVD-1500 and TVD-20 turbines of similar performance to the U.S. Garrett TRF351-20 that would be used in the CBA-123. The three firms then began the technical discussion involving the "plan, production, and sales" of a line of agricultural planes with two basic models having a capacity of up to 0.6 and 2.5 tons respectively. The technical discussions, GAZETA continued, were followed by a letter from Aviaprom President A. Gereshchenko to Embraer President Ozires Silva in October 1993 noting that "we have a good basis for cooperation." There followed a written invitation from Gereshchenko and Mashinoeksport Vice President I. Latin for Embraer to participate in "the creation and operation" of the Burlak aerospace complex. Both Gereshchenko and Latin had been in Brazil in February 1993 in a secret visit to the Alcantara launch site in Maranhao, GAZETA pointed out, and then noted that 10 weeks later, Embraer, Neiva, Aviaprom, and the Myaslshchev Design Bureau signed a protocol to launch communication satellites from Alcantara. There was, according to GAZETA, a parallel accord between the Monteiro Aranha group and Khrunichev Enterprise to use Russian rockets as launchers. The Monteiro Aranha group also signed an agreement with Rostvertol in Rostov to sell large Russian helicopters of the Mil line in Brazil. GAZETA further noted that in September 1993, Army Minister General Zoroastro headed a military delegation to Russia to study military equipment and missile technologies available to Brazil, and added that the Brazilian Government has been trying to attract partners to its space program by offering the use of the Alcantara site, where satellite launches cost an average 20 percent less than from any other launch site in the world. In addition to Russia, Brazil is engaged in negotiations with China, which Strategic Affairs Secretariat Minister-Chief Mario Cesar Flores has often called "the partner of the future," GAZETA concluded.
