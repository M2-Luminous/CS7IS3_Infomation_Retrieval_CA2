Khieu, who will be attending a round-table meeting on Cambodia in Pyongyang from May 27 to 30, will fly to Beijing on May 25 to attend a dinner hosted by Sihanouk, said a spokesman for the office, who added that Khieu had thanked Sihanouk for the invitation. Meanwhile, Sihanouk today urged the four participants in the round-table meeting in Pyongyang to agree upon an unconditional and immediate ceasefire and to pledge their commitment to unity. In a letter to the participants sent from his residence in Beijing, Sihanouk said that he is not trying to "impose a political solution to the bloody and tragic `problem' existing between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Democratic Kampuchea Party." "I would like to implore you to accept, while in short of a political solution, an unconditional, immediate, total and irreversible ceasefire across Cambodia," said Sihanouk. He suggested that the ceasefire be supervised by an inter-Cambodian commission of control, to be formed of a number of army officers from both sides of the conflict, and headed by two neutral generals representing Sihanouk himself -- General Oum Mannorine and General Buor Holl. He also called on the participants in the round-table meeting to sign a declaration pledging themselves to national unity, territorial integrity based on the 1963-69 border, and "our national ideals of peace, national unity and progress." "We will continue to do all we can to find a peaceful and political solution to the 'problem' which still divides the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Democratic Kampuchea Party," said Sihanouk. The four participants in the round table meeting will be Chea Sim, president of the Cambodian National Assembly, Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, the two co-prime ministers of the royal government, and Khieu Samphan, president of the Democratic Kampuchea Party, or the Khmer Rouge.
