On the opening day, the organization received some 1.25 million yuan in donations from local private firms. Yang Qingtian, head of the organization, said that this charity was sponsored by individuals and social groups who are keen to promote public welfare. He noted that they will collect funds through various channels, set up some service organizations and help those who live in poverty and helplessness. Xiao Zuofu, vice-governor of the province, said that charities are noble endeavours which mark the civilization of society, and the establishment of such an organization will undoubtedly promote the development of the social secrurity system. In China, almost all social welfare organizations have been sponsored by governments over the past decades.
