Mr Mandela said at Tuynhuys on Thursday that he was prepared to meet UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi, preferably in South Africa. Speaking after a meeting with United Nations Mediator Alioune Blondin Beye and representatives of the United States, Portuguese and Russian Governments, Mr Mandela said he would first contact Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and then Dr Savimbi. "I would be happy to invite Dr Savimbi and to sit down and have a discussion with him. I know Mr dos Santos' point of view, but I've never had the honour of meeting Dr Savimbi. I am prepared to see both parties in the near future," he said. Mr Beye said Mr Mandela had been asked to become involved as the leader of a nation that neighboured Angola and also had substantial assets there. He said South Africa had geographical, historical and political ties to Angola. Mr Mandela said South African companies had invested in oil and diamond mining in Angola, and an end to the civil war that has raged since 1975 would be a positive advantage to South Africa. Mr Beye said the UN's priority was not to bring about a direct meeting between Dr Savimbi and Mr dos Santos. It first wanted to contact Mr dos Santos and then to set up a meeting between Mr Mandela and Dr Savimbi.
