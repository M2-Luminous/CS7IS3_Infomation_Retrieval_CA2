In its content, it is an unprecedented legal act, according to which the overwhelming majority of ethnic Russians who reside permanently in that country are in fact deprived of a real possibility of obtaining Latvian citizenship. The law contains elements of discrimination on ethnic grounds and consolidates the principle of quotas for the naturalization of Latvia's permanent residents that, in general, is to start in 2000. Thus, on the threshold of the 21st century, a state that claims to be democratic and based of a rule of law, has made yet another step towards discrimination in law of hundreds of thousands of residents of the Latvian Republic and formation of a monoethnic state. Long before the citizenship law had been adopted, by depriving "non-indigenous" residents of citizenship, Latvia started purposeful discrimination against them in the political, social, economic and other spheres by adopting relevant laws and statutory instruments. These include the law on elections to central and local bodies of power, on civil service, on languages, on election campaigning and so on and amendments to the laws on entry and foreigners' stay or on the police. These have seriously worsened the situation of hundreds of thousands of permanent residents, the majority of whom are ethnic Russians, and have created a legal basis for introducing discriminaton on ethnic, language, religious, and other gounds in Latvia. Latvia has been persistently ignoring the real situation in the country, fundamental human rights documents, the views of international experts, and recommendations by the CSCE high commissioner for ethnic minorities, the Council of Europe, and the calls of some neighboring states concerning the rights of minorities. All this cannot be evaluated otherwise than an open challenge to democratic and humanistic traditions in today's Europe and world. In this situation the absence of an appropriate international reaction, let alone the acceptance of the country in the Council of Europe, would look as a sign of approval of the Latvian authorities' discriminatory policies and would be tantamount to the lowering of international and European standards in the sphere of human rights. For its part, in accordance with UNGA resolution no. 48/155 "The situation in the sphere of human rights in Latvia and Estonia" and in connection with the further deterioration of the situation in the sphere of human rights in the Latvian Republic, Russia will resolutely strive to ensure that Latvia complies with the international obligations it has taken upon itself. In developing relations with Latvia henceforth the Russian side will take account of the situation that is taking shape in that country following the adoption of the citizenship law."
