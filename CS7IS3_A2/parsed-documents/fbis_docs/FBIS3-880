As planned, they told Westerners about their impatience. Jean-Karim Fall reports: [Fall] After five hours, the participants adopted a final communique in which they said that, despite some tensions, inflationary pressure has been curbed thanks to the actions undertaken since the devaluation of the CFA franc. French sources report that the average inflation rate in the zone amounts to around 30 percent. Participants also expressed their concern over the debt stock and over the speed of payments of the promised assistance. This was one of the main concerns of the member countries of the zone. On this issue, the backers -- the IMF and the World Bank -- answered that they have never been so quick. However, French Minister of Cooperation Michel Roussin said: We will speed up procedures. He believes that it has been the first time in years that everyone has heeded the Africans' call. On the whole, the heads of government and of state in Ouagadougou expressed their concern over the social consequences of the devaluation of the CFA franc. The backers -- France, the IMF, and the World Bank -- tried to reassure them by repeating that all the promises made in Dakar will be kept.
