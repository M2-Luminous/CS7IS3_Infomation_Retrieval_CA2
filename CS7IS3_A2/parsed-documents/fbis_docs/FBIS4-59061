The Yemeni president briefed President Zayid on the latest Yemeni developments. Shaykh Zayid asked the Yemeni brothers to resolve their differences through reason, logic, and dialogue to serve Yemen and the Yemeni people. President Zayid expressed his deep concern over the continued fighting in Yemen and appealed to all sides to stop fighting immediately to end the bloodshed and take the course of dialogue and understanding in preparation for resuming good offices and mediations to resolve differences and place the interests of Yemen and its people above all other considerations. During the telephone conversation, the president said that he was confident that the Yemeni leaders and figures would be able to solve their differences and effect a brotherly reconciliation instead of shedding blood, killing, and wasting resources, something which saddens every Arab and Muslim. Yemen and its people are dear to us and we harbor great love for them. His highness said: We appeal to you to fear God in dealing with Yemen and its people and to resort to reason instead of arms. His highness warned against aggravating the fighting and the resulting inability to control the situation and held the Yemeni leaders responsible. He said: We must give advice and do whatever we can to steer Yemen away from this painful fate. His highness has been in constant contact with the leaders of fraternal Yemen for the past several days within his highness' endeavors to follow Yemeni developments.
