Near the plant he was met by a picket organized by the local independent trade union, whose participants demanded that the plant be able to work without interruption. As Interfax learned at the managing board of the plant, the Kirov plant has not been working full working weeks, and in some workshops there are cases of delayed payment of wages. At a meeting with plant officials Chernomyrdin promised to grant financial aid to the Kirov plant and supported plans of the directorate to launch production of modern equipment for gas-pumping stations on the basis of German technology, as well as equipment for gas and steam-turbine electric power stations. Chernomyrdin suggested that plant officials consider producing a new modern bus meeting Russian requirements in cooperation with the KAMAZ automobile maker. On Monday evening Chernomyrdin will return to Moscow.
