You should know that you are sons of Rwanda. The Republican Democratic Movement [MDR] cannot accept people using their grief as a pretext to kill indiscriminately and for this to be accepted by senior officers. We cannot just stand by and watch. The MDR and other parties that favor change in Rwanda cannot accept decisions made by those who had no power to do so within their parties. This is one of the reasons why the self-styled coalition government is unacceptable. The MDR does not accept the government of Jean Kambanda since it exists in violation of the country's constitution and other known agreements related to the formation of a government. [passage omitted] The MDR calls on the group of soldiers and their supporters who are [words indistinct] not to plunge the country into an abyss of endless misery. If these people aim to preserve their personal interests, they should know that this is no longer possible since the current times and the country cannot accept it. They should abandon the policies of (?selfishness) and adopt the policy of multipartyism, since it is the one accepted by the Arusha agreement.
