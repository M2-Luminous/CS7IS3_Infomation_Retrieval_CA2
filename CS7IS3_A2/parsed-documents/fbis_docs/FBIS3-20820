Instead, they offer to form a new coalition based on the "positive legacy of the Demos [Democratic Opposition of Slovenia]." The Presidency of the Social Democrats states in its message that the coalition should fight against "corruption, legal anarchy, political repression, and restoration of neocommunism." The People's Party says in its statement that Slovenia has arrived at a "decisive crossroads" at a time when it is still able to resist a "pernicious economic policy." The SLS will file criminal charges against Finance Minister M. Gaspari, Labor Minister Jozica Puhar, and Director of the Development Fund U. Korze. A real political scandal was caused yesterday by Janez Jansa's offer to all dissatisfied members of the Democratic Party, Eco-Greens, and Socialists who do not want to merge with the Liberal Democrats, to join his party. Presidents I. Bavcar, P. Tancig, and V. Zakelj denounced this sort of "recruitment" as an "intolerable attempt to interfere directly in the relations among the merging parties on the one hand and the internal relations of the parties on the other hand."
