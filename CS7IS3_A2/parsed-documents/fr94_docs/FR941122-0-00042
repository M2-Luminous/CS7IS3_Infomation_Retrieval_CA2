FR941122-0-00042 FR941122-0-00010 Commenters addressed only two of these changes. Under the proposal and the final revised rule, where a sulfur-free generator is designated outside a unit's dispatch system, the designated representative must submit, as part of the reduced utilization plan, the contractual agreements governing the ``acquisition'' of electricity by the unit's dispatch system from that generator. In addition, where a shift of generation from any designated sulfur-free generator (whether the generator is within or outside the dispatch system) is claimed, the designated representative must document that at least the amount claimed to have been shifted was actually ``acquired'' by the unit's dispatch system from the generator. The January 11, 1993 regulations referred to the contractual agreements governing and documentation concerning the ``purchase'', rather than the ``acquisition'', of electricity from sulfur-free generators. See 48 FR 3672 and 3682 (§§72.43(c)(4)(iv) and 72.91(a)(6) (1993)). Commenters supported this change adopted in the November 18, 1993 proposal. Some sulfur-free generators have multiple owners and may be owned in part by the unit's dispatch system. In such cases, the unit's dispatch system may not acquire electricity from the generator through a ``purchase'' but rather may acquire the electricity based on its ownership share. Further, it is important to ensure that multiple owners of sulfur-free generators claim only their respective shares of the sulfur-free generation. Consequently, the Agency is requiring documentation concerning the ``acquisition,'' which encompasses not only ``purchases'' (as under the January 11, 1993 rule) but also acquisitions based on ownership. Further, the requirement to document actual acquisition applies to all designated sulfur-free generators. One commenter stated that the documentation required, under the proposal, for acquisition of sulfur-free generation is more stringent than necessary. The commenter noted that, under the proposal, the designated representative must demonstrate that electricity was actually acquired from ``a particular sulfur-free generator.'' Comments of Oglethorpe Power Corporation at 7. Allegedly, it is ``extremely difficult to trace energy back'' to the sulfur-free generator. Id. The commenter further alleged that requiring that ``a unit power or similar power sale agreement'' govern the acquisition will result in ``significant regulatory or other approval delays.'' Id. at 6. The commenter suggested that, instead of these requirements, the Agency require that the designated representative of the Phase I unit simply obtain the consent of an owner of the sulfur-free generator to claim, for purposes of the reduced utilization plan, some or all of that owner's share of generation from the sulfur-free generator. In order to ensure that the designated representative does not make such claims without actually getting the consent of the generator-owner, the commenter urged that EPA require that a copy of any reduced utilization plan involving a sulfur-free generator be given to all owners of the generator and the designated representative of the Phase I unit certify to EPA that the necessary consent was obtained. Id. at 5.
