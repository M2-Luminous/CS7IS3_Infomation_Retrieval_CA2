It has observed from the Upper Huallaga that Shining Path (SL), far from being annihilated, is relocating to the provinces of Huanuco and Ucayali and to the Central Jungle. Since January, there have been several news reports of another relocation into the provinces of San Martin in the Mayo River Basin. Attacks on towns, executions of mayors and teachers, bloody ambushes, the shutdown of Huanuco university, and a great many disappearances tell us that the post-Shining Path era is a long way off there. Several small children are playing war at six in the evening on a street in now deserted Uchiza. Most want to be the "firma" (the cocaine mafia); others want to be "cumpas" (Shining Path) or "colochos" (Colombians). The littlest one complains that he does not want to be the "moroco" or army, but he has to if he wants to play. It seems that Abimael Guzman is playing a very weak hand in the Upper Huallaga and in the Department of Huanuco, but at the same time there are few signs that Shining Path is vanishing. At worst, a respite would diminish uncertainties. This would presumably be the last great Shining Path battlefront, where the ultimate outcome of this 14-year-old war would be played out. The regional committee in the Upper Huallaga was never just another committee. Its establishment was a victory for the so-called "black line," spearheaded by Osman Morote, that opposed Abimael Guzman. Guzman did not want SL to move into an area that he regarded as a "rotten territory" which could easily contaminate his cadres and would be taken over only after SL controlled much of the country. At the Central Committee plenum that debated the issue, Guzman reportedly said that "the Indians will never understand Gonzalo's thoughts." The internal opposition retorted that this is what the "five golden rules" were for and that the party should not throw away the opportunities offered by the jungle. This is why its existence was always a challenge to "Chairman Gonzalo's" authority and one of the reasons, aside from the historical ones, why it did not become the Main Regional Committee. The valley had its advantages. It was the area with the fastest growth, the territory in which SL conducted its principal experiments. The first "armed work stoppages" were decreed there, later to be conducted nationwide. The forms of organization for the "liberated zones" spread throughout its vast expanses between 1987 and 1990. SL did not even dream of trying these forms, which were developed according to theory and corrected in practice (such as the town delegates and the open grassroots committees), in Lima and other cities. It was General Arciniega who altered the course of the war in the Huallaga Valley. He radically changed the strategy followed until then, which regarded SL, drug traffickers, and the peasants who grew coca leaves as a single military target, and he vied with SL for peasant grassroots support; he stopped cracking down on coca growing and tried to restore the people's trust in the military through assistance efforts. These were not the only changes. When Arciniega assumed command of the Huallaga Front in 1989 after SL's bloody takeover of Uchiza, he shifted the center of operations from the north (Tarapoto, Juanjui, and the Mayo River) to the south, to the provinces of Mariscal Caceres (San Martin) and Leoncio Prado (Huanuco) in the Upper Huallaga. His successors, Generals Chacon, Brito, and Hanke, moved the hub of operations back to its former location and made the crackdown on the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] a priority. The upshot was a stronger SL that expanded into the province of Padre Abad (Ucayali), which borders the Huallaga. In 1993, when it was certain that the MRTA had been broken up, the Huallaga Front moved its center of operations southward for the second time, whereupon it became obvious that SL was feeling the blows and starting to withdraw in several directions. Its first move was towards the interior. Resigned to the fact that the blows to its "territorial networks" would be crushing, SL chose to shift its "mobile networks," that is, the units of the People's Guerrilla Army (EGP), into the jungle. The other two moves have not represented much of an exodus, being more a combination of withdrawal and deployment. On the one hand, it has moved into the other provinces in the Department of Huanuco and, from there, via corridors, to La Libertad and Ancash; on the other, it has moved into the central jungle through Puerto Inca, Puerto Bermudez, and Codo del Pozuzo. There were several reasons for this initial movement. First, the coca market crash has made the civilian population and the growers less dependent on SL. The chain reaction from this crisis pushed many of the social and economic players who had previously sought SL's help out of the area and left it with a smaller civilian population to vie for. Local observers note that paradoxically it would seem to be coca, rather than the army, that is getting the best of Shining Path. The countryside is becoming depopulated through emigration. Most of the families that were lured by the coca boom to the valley from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin, and Ucayali in the 1970's and 1980's are going home. Second, the aforementioned southward shift of the center of military operations is putting pressure on SL and forcing it to relocate further away from towns. Third, the Armed Forces are following a somewhat different strategy vis-a-vis the civilian population: less of a presence in cities and medium-sized towns (Tingo Maria, Aucayacu, Tocache, and Uchiza) and a stronger role in rural areas and smaller towns, including civic action programs. The role that the patrols played in defeating SL in the central highlands is not the same as in the Upper Huallaga. They are not very widespread there, and the army is having serious trouble organizing them. In the central highlands the patrols were formed using the structure of the peasant communities, which had to defend territory, internal democracy, and crops, among other things. There are very few communities in the Huallaga, but another factor is even more significant: migration has made the area cosmopolitan, and owing to this development, combined with the weak sense of order and democracy and the coca market crash, the locals are uninterested in defending what they really do not possess or have ceased to possess. Yankee Go Home The old red graffiti can still be seen along the road from Tingo Maria to Tocache. They are from 1989-90: "Long live the MLM," "Yankee Go Home," "Long Live Chairman Gonzalo," "Finish Off the Great Leap With a Gold Seal." None refers to "defending the life of Chairman Gonzalo" or some other current issue. Shining Path is not writing graffiti anymore today, nor is it operating checkpoints along roads, nor does it control the small, remote coca-growing towns. Its favorite tactics are ambushes, executions, and a few raids into small towns. During the first 10 months of 1993 its ambushes alone took the lives of 24 army personnel. It would be a mistake to conclude that SL does not retain some of its military reserves. The "main force," which the army itself estimated at 3,000 men, plus the "local forces" and the "base forces," totaled more than 6,000 men in 1989. Estimates are that these forces have declined by 80 percent over the last two years as a result of arrests, battles, desertions, and surrenders of reformed SL members. This means that SL would currently be able to mobilize 1,200 men, still a potent force. Huanuco: Leave or Die There are no graffiti, either new or old, in Huanuco, except for a few at the university. The SL's do not seem to do that kind of thing there. But a great many people have been killed. Four university professors, two students, and the woman president of the mothers clubs have been slain in less than one year. A student and a leader of the SUTEP [Trade Union of Education Workers] were severely wounded. SL does allow itself certain luxuries there, such as its ambush of a patrol car in the downtown section of the city last September. Since the SL regional committee in the Upper Huallaga decided in early 1992 to no longer consider Huanuco a transit point and temporary haven, the search for new "support bases" in the once placid city has turned violent. Gonzalo's "red line" was in the majority until September of last year; its goal was to clear out the political scene until only it and the State remained as adversaries. This faction was presumably responsible for the attacks of recent years and executed about one well-known public figure a month. The capture of an SL commando group in the city of Huanuco last August was reportedly a severe blow to the Gonzalo faction, leaving it in the minority. The other faction seeks to focus on government representatives. Its main goal is to pursue the tactics of the war of national liberation, which characterizes the faction of Osman Morote or the "former opposition" in the area. Hermilio Valdizan University is reportedly the center of SL activity. Its objective seems to be to recruit and train cadres, using the university as a springboard for subsequent development in the slums. Whoever opposes this approach has two options: leave or die. Ten professors have left in response to threats, among them the former president of the region, Andres Avelino Caceres, and the dean of the Department of Administrative Sciences, Julio Tarazona Padilla, as well as the former president of the teachers union, Ruben Sachun, and the former president of the Women's Network, Denessy Palacios, among others. Recent raids into the towns of Tantamayo and Monzon in September suggest that SL has again occupied the northern corridor of the Huanuco highlands, which it used from 1983 to 1988, its years of expansion. Supporting this deduction is the fact that the column which attacked Monzon (40 to 50 men in poor shape, with neither food nor clothing, with few supplies, many of them suffering from leishmaniasis) is the same one that raided Tantamayo. This corridor extends into the Department of Ancash and presumably enables SL to help out its organizations in Huaraz and northern Peru, to remove its wounded, and to obtain supplies. In addition, it is probably using the corridor that runs from Uchiza through Tayobamba and Huacrachuco to La Libertad. Ayacucho, Again and Again Manuel Milla Pinzas, a former dean of the Bar Association and university professor, was killed by an SL commando group at the gate to the university campus at five in the afternoon last 4 October. One hundred meters away is the Cayhuayna police checkpoint, where there were more than 20 agents and one van. The commando group fled on foot towards Paucarbamba and vanished from sight 10 minutes later. Rosa del Aguila, the president of the Federation of Mothers Clubs, was slain two months before near Calicanto Bridge. She called for help and fought with her assailants, who left on foot, watched by two policemen standing guard at the gate to the headquarters of the Technical Police...less than 100 meters from the scene of the crime. Ayacucho 1980? Lima 1992? No. Huanuco in recent months. Several mistakes in the strategy to combat subversion could have negative repercussions in the short term. In fact, they already have. Residents of the city are obviously jumpy, and the exodus of people could be followed by a withdrawal of the investments that have been trickling in for the past two years. The military commands have allowed SL to start retreating into the provinces in the Huanuco highlands and into the city itself and to use the Huamalies and Huacrachuco corridors without much difficulty. The Achilles' heel of the battle against subversion is the civilian population. In light of the difficulties it has had in organizing the patrols, the military command is resorting to territorial control, assistance, then neglect, and so on. But it does not stop at exclusion; it also cracks down. It would seem that beyond the sweeps, the mass control of the disadvantaged population, and whatever arrests it may make, the army has little to fall back on. Over the past two years Huanuco has been the department with the most arrests and missing persons. The Human Rights Commission of the Constitutional Congress reported recently that in 1992 there were 144 disappearances, 132 of which are blamed on the army. In 1993 there were 89 complaints filed, 32 in relation to army actions. From January to August of last year alone, the Ombudsman's Unit of the Attorney General's Office documented 38 missing person reports, most of them implicating troops from "Los Laureles" barracks in Tingo Maria. The problems are mounting because neither Tingo Maria nor Huanuco has a human rights commission. Other key words for the Upper Huallaga and Huanuco that neither the government nor the military seem to understand are "development" and "social support." In a region in which the State has been clueless for the past 15 years and in which the absence of democracy is as obvious as the lack of jobs, markets, investment, education, and health care, the mildest antigovernment rhetoric will clearly work. The strategy to combat subversion should take into account that the clearer the decline in the SL threat becomes, the more the State will again be the main target of discontent. A long list of problems persists in the Huanuco jungle and highlands: towns without electric power, communities in which 80 percent of the children suffer from leishmaniasis, villages without schools, harvests that cannot be taken to market because there are no roads, crops attacked by pests and blights, producers who cannot get loans, growers who want aid to replace their coca crops, people without jobs, displaced persons without homes, work, or hope. The National Compensation and Social Development Fund is not enough. What is needed is public and private investment, credit, an expansion of the agricultural frontier, and the promotion of output and jobs. Expanded assistance is oh so far away from the Huallaga and Huanuco! [Box, p 41] The Guerrillas Wear Blue Jeans The members of Shining Path in the Upper Huallaga are more cosmopolitan and frivolous and less ideological. Unlike the militant Maoists from Ayacucho, the SL people in the Huallaga have little political and ideological motivation. We should bear in mind that the area does not have a tradition of political confrontation (which Ayacucho does), nor is there a deeply rooted political culture, nor are there elites or parties that are even halfway organized. So, during SL's peak years you could see militiamen and activists wearing blue jeans, Hush Puppies shoes, and University of Oklahoma sweatshirts, something that would have been unlikely in other areas, even the hot ones. SL has gained little from its 10 years in the valley. Unlike in the highlands and the Andes, it built its relations with the people in the Huallaga Valley on the defense of coca growing, not on the assertion of any ideology. This link is becoming weaker and weaker, because there are fewer coca crops and less drug trafficking, which will likely wind up being insignificant. The reason for its success will eventually turn out to be the reason for its failure. In the long run, the coca growers and gangland kingpins will wind up using Gonzalo's men. Perhaps this is why Abimael Guzman, who is not much of a populist, opposed the opening of this front, inasmuch as a future alliance with Huallaga society did not depend on his forces. But what is easily conquered is easily lost as well. None of the mass organization arrangements that SL developed is working today: neither the grassroots committees nor the militias nor the groups they created. In a place where it was very easy to move from being a small-time trafficker to a militiaman or from being a coca grower (or else a producer of cocaine paste) to a delegate, it is also very simple to return to one's former activity, or to emigrate. These factors are also affecting SL. Most of its members no longer want to be involved in the war. They are fleeing, preferring not to become reformed terrorists. Some come to Lima, others to Pucallpa and from there to Brazil, to Manaus or Cruzeiro, where SL's, MRTA members, grassroots leaders, and peasants accused of terrorism have gathered to live. The more than 100 members who turned themselves in in January were probably not commanders or activists; they were likely residents of the former support bases, militiamen, or collaborators with the organizations they created. SL is presumably trying to follow the coca route or move alongside it. This is the reason for the attack on the Ashaninkas, which was probably an attempt to clean out the area. Everyone knows that coca is moving east and south, from Puerto Inca to the central jungle. The Codo del Pozuzo, which was once a ranching paradise, is part of the new scene of the coca-SL-war symbiosis. In the jungle SL is fated to wander around after the coca growers and drug traffickers from valley to valley, no longer as a political and military force that aspires to take over the country but as part of an apparatus that protects the former from the State. [Box, p 32] The Long Tocache March Driven by the need for territorial domination, Shining Path structured the life of the drug traffickers and each of their "firms." It did so as only it knows how. One fine day it issued a decree, the most noteworthy points in which were: a. Cocaine is for overseas consumption, and domestic use is punished. The watchword was: "The spider does not consume its own poison." b. Defend the right to plant coca shrubs and to work and prevent the eradication projects from destroying the crops. The watchword: "Yankee Go Home." c. The "firms" could not have more than four foreigners. The purpose of this was to stem the invasion of Colombians and stave off their violent activities. They stated that Colombian men married to Peruvian women would be given preference in remaining here. d. The "traqueteros" (the people who drove through towns and along roads on motorcycles buying the packages of cocaine paste) had to be Peruvian. e. All sales and "flights" (shipments of cocaine paste to Colombia) had to be carried out in the presence of the SL delegate. The slogan: "The Party has a thousand eyes and a thousand ears." Many people's disbelief was dispelled when, two weeks after SL issued its "edict," it dragged four Colombians out of the "Porkis" discotheque in Uchiza and slit their throats. SL's first advance guards arrived in the valley seeking jobs as coca harvesting laborers, the lowest rung on the coca ladder. During the first stage, from 1983 to late 1984, Shining Path focused on emphasizing its message to the people (the tactic of developing bases). In July 1984 an emergency was declared in the zone, and the military crackdown forced SL to retreat. The military campaign, which did not distinguish between targets, helped to bolster its ties with the civilian population. SL did not waste the opportunity and took charge of administering justice and daily life in the mid-sized towns that were flourishing because of coca and coca-dollars. It dealt with marital conflicts and land disputes and enforced penalties for minor offenses. Theirs was not a public takeover but rather a surreptitious presence in civil society, a silent alliance in which at that time SL was the major beneficiary. The second stage, from 1987 to 1991, was marked by SL's intensive and extensive deployment. During it SL scored its biggest successes. It dealt head-on blows to the State and easily took over towns, causing the police to flee from many spots, never to return; it set up checkpoints on roads and charged tolls to enter certain towns. SL was able to move in rapidly because its advance guards were not the first to shatter law and order in the Upper Huallaga. When they arrived, people in the Peruvian jungle did not ask who was armed but instead who was not. The local "mafias" had been armed since the mid-1970's, first to defend themselves against gangs of assailants and later to enforce the law of silence by assassinating mayors, governors, and newsmen. When Gonzalo's hosts arrived, many of the towns scattered about the valley had no authorities, and the locals lived in fear of abuses by the "mafias." The jungle needed its own brand of law and order, and SL was the right policeman for the job. "Coca" and "cocaine," not "eradication," enjoyed the broadest consensus in the zone. In keeping with the classic literary theme, SL sold its soul (ideology) for life (territory). The key word in this alliance was not "socialism," "equality," or "revolution," but rather "protection." It was the only SL front in which ideology did not come first and foremost. SL gained nothing other than the physical territory that it controlled and the social oversight that it exercised. It could never command the economy, and the only time that it tried to, in 1988 when it decreed a strike in Uchiza and outlawed the coca harvest and the sale of cocaine paste, it met with defeat when the coca market shifted to the Lower Huallaga and the peasants rioted.
