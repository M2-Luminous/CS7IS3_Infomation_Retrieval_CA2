FR941006-1-00062 FR941006-1-00013 The FHWA now has new, significant data, which had also not been considered by the Court in reaching its decision, to support its present determination. The vision waiver study has now been in effect since July 1992, and has collected driver safety and performance data periodically for approximately two years. Individuals driving pursuant to waivers are required to submit reports of vehicle miles travelled monthly. They are also required to report any citation for a moving violation involving a CMV and the judicial or administrative disposition of such charge, and, within 15 days of occurrence, any accident involvement whatsoever while operating a CMV. All accident information is verified periodically through each driver's State motor vehicle record (MVR) by the FHWA's contractor, Conwal, Inc. of Falls Church, Virginia. Participants in the waiver program also submitted, prior to their acceptance, detailed information of their individual vital statistics, employment history, current status of driving privilege as recorded on the licensing State's MVR and the license status for the past three years, and expert medical opinion by an ophthalmologist or optometrist as to current visual acuity and its effect on his or her ability to perform the driving task safely. Participating drivers are required to submit annual reports from an ophthalmologist or optometrist attesting to the present condition of their vision. Any loss of vision bringing them below the waiver standard of 20/40 in the better eye results in immediate discharge from the program. Drivers participating in the program are subject to revocation of their waiver for failure to meet certain reporting requirements or if the vision in their better eye falls below the required standard. The agency strictly holds waived drivers to these requirements and standards. As of September 30, 1994, a total of 201 drivers have had their waivers revoked. Of that number, 21 drivers were revoked for failing to submit an annual medical exam. The remaining 180 drivers were revoked for failing to submit monthly driving reports on time. No drivers have had their waivers revoked for decreasing visual acuity; however, two drivers have voluntarily withdrawn from the program on this basis. Based upon statistical analysis of this information conducted by the contractor, the agency can conclude that the driving performance of individuals participating in the vision waiver program is better than the driving performance of all CMV drivers collectively, based on data obtained from the General Estimates Service (GES). The GES is a national survey conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and was selected for use as the best measure of the prevailing national norm relative to large truck accidents. The Third Interim Monitoring Report, prepared by the contractor responsible for FHWA's vision waiver program, dated June 27, 1994, reported on the cumulative driving performance of those individuals participating in the waiver group between July 1992 and February 1994. During that period, a total of 211 accidents were reported and a total of 136.4 million VMT had been recorded. The number of accidents in this period divided by the VMT give an accident rate of 1.547 accidents per million VMT. The national accident rate for large truck accidents, as reported by the GES for the year 1992, is 2.531 accidents per million VMT. A copy of this report is contained in the docket. The reports submitted by the drivers are independently verified through periodic records checks with State MVDs. While drivers in the study are required to report all accident involvement, the State MVDs only record accidents warranting reports under existing State requirements. Similarly, the GES data only contain accidents recorded by State MVDs. Therefore, the drivers in the waiver study are held accountable for more accidents than those included in GES statistics. The FHWA's contractor, which is performing the data collection, the statistical analysis and preparation of the interim reports, was subjected to a peer review of its procedures and methodology, a summary of which is included in the docket. A Fourth Interim Report is in preparation at this time, and covers cumulative activities and mileage through June 30, 1994. A review of the data indicates that the performance of the study group remains relatively unchanged, as the accident rate is only slightly higher than previously reported, i.e. 1.636 accidents per one million VMT. The completed report will be placed in the docket along with all preceding Interim Reports.
