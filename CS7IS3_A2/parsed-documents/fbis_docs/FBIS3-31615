The Russian foreign minister will be visiting Krakow, where he will meet Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. The talks between the two ministers will be dominated by political issues. The Polish side expects Kozyrev to present a new concept of relations between Russia and the states of east-central Europe. Moreover, the ministers will exchange views on the subject of European security and present their positions on cooperation with NATO, including "Partnership for Peace." Bilateral economic contacts will also be discussed. According to officials of the Polish MSZ [Foreign Ministry], regarding bilateral issues the two sides are likely to seek forms of political and economic cooperation in spite of the existing differences on individual issues. One of the problems in Polish-Russian relations is an impasse in talks on settling the status of the Vistula Lagoon. Russia regards the lagoon as part of its internal waters, whereas Poland is demanding that it be designated as open sea, which would make shipping easier and facilitate the development of the town of Frombork as a sea harbor. An important unresolved issue is also the continued fishing of pollock in the Sea of Okhotsk. Some Russian deputies, as well as ministers, are demanding that fishing ships flying foreign flags be withdrawn from the so-called open area of the Sea of Okhotsk, that is, from international waters. Among other things they are demanding is that the 1987 fishing agreement with Poland be broken off. During Kozyrev's visit a Polish-Russian agreement will be signed on graves and sites of remembrance. Under the agreement, each sides will, among other things, finance the protection in their own country of sites commemorating deaths of the other country's citizens. On 23 February the foreign ministers will take part along with politicians and academics in the opening of a three-day Polish-Russian conference entitled "Toward a New Partnership."
