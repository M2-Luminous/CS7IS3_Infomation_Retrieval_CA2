Suggestions of that sort are exactly what the leaders of the movement are looking for; they put the movement into the headlines on the front pages of the newspapers, and at the top of the daily news bulletins and roundups. The Kach movement, now as always, has a developed sense of publicity. Even in cases where Kach and its offshoots have had no tie to an attack against Arabs or a pogrom against their property--Kach spokesmen have hurried to take responsibility for the incident, or at least to announce it in the papers. An outstanding example of this happened after Rabbi Avraham Toledano--a former leader of Kach--was arrested at Ben Gurion airport a few weeks ago, thanks to the alertness of an airport customs officer. Kach hurried to spread the news among the reporters that settlers from the extreme right were stockpiling weapons and explosives, partly smuggled from Russia and Czechoslovakia, and partly stolen from IDF [Israel Defense Forces] camps. "We are not doing it," the Kach members hastened to say, "but we know about cases of weapons hoarding, about smuggling in dismantled Kalashnikov rifles, about explosives in suitcases, and information pamphlets on how to prepare bombs--things from Red Army surplus." Kach's knack for public relations is proven daily, both through the exploits, real or imaginary, of the "Committee for Safety on the Roads," considered the "military arm" of the Kach movement. Every time an attack against the Arabs is reported, the newspapers receive a notice over the beeper from an unknown person who calls himself "Ronen" and takes responsibility for the action in the name of the Committee for Safety on the Roads. Up until last Friday, his announcements always arrived after the attack on the Arabs had already been reported over the media. Thus, for instance, the committee claimed responsibility for the murder of the Arab in Thurmosaiah near Shiloh, last week. But, as everyone knows, the suspect the police arrested in that attack was a young man from Shilo who is not known at all as a Kach activist or a member of the committee. We should say, though, that Ronen's announcements usually are--reliable. Investigation shows that the announcements he has turned in have usually had a basis in fact. So it was, too, with the murder of the three Arabs last Friday. Except that this time, Ronen's announcement to the newspapers arrived over the beepers even before the murder was reported over the radio. This would seem in itself to prove that this time Ronen did not hitch a ride on the actions of others, and that the anonymous announcer knew about the murder from sources of his own. These things, at any rate, should certainly start the security officers investigating the case thinking. Is Kach really as dangerous is it seems? Are its activists stockpiling illegal weapons, in addition to the legal weapons they have in their hands? Did members of the Committee for Safety on the Roads really carry out the murder of the three Arab workers in Tarkomiah? The police and General Security Service expend great energy following the trail of the activists of Kach and its offshoots. Kach leaders and activists are constantly brought in for questioning, under suspicion of various things. But it usually turns out that the security forces and the law cannot find the proof they need to get them convicted of anything more substantial crimes than disturbing the peace, rioting, or aggressive behavior. The movement's members and leaders are almost always freed on bail the same day. Sometimes they have to spend a few days in jail--and then are freed in court. Only very occasionally are members of Kach found guilty of crimes that require them to be locked up for periods of a few months or more. Members of Kach customarily explain this phenomenon as "political persecution" and as "the Bolshevik methods" of the government and its representatives--which are always blocked in the courtroom. But the real explanation apparently lies in the fact that the leaders of Kach are much more sophisticated about treading right on the edge of legality than they seem. It is very hard to catch one of them "in the act" committing a crime. Thus it also was when members of the "Committee for Safety on the Roads" put on their "nightly show" before a TV team a few months ago in the alleys of Hebron. Except for the game of "Hasamba" which is not illegal, the only crime photographed was breaking a street light.... So far, for example, nobody has been arrested in the case where a number of hand grenades were found in the courtyard of a Kach branch several weeks ago. Nor was anyone arrested for murder, or for inciting others to murder, because even in what they say to the press, the movement's spokesmen are always careful to emphasize that although they "understand" the phenomenon of murder of Arabs--they are not doing it. Since Rabbi Meir Kahane was murdered in November 1990, Kach has been led by a triangle of leaders. That triangle already served as the operative arm of the movement when Rabbi Kahane still served as spiritual and ideological leader of the movement. At the top of this trio stands Baruch Marzel (34), chosen to be the leader of Kach after a short period of several months when Rabbi Avraham Toledano took Rabbi Meir Kahane's place. When Rabbi Kahane was still alive, Marzel served as secretary of the Kach faction in the Knesset, as spokesman for the movement, and as the Rabbi's right-hand man. Marzel, who lives with his large family in a caravan at Tel Romeida in Hebron, is an artist at media and public relations. He knows all the "shticks" and "tricks"--and at the same time is careful of what he says and does. So far, he has proved that he knows exactly how to get his messages across without falling into legal traps. Still, he has been convicted for violence, rioting, and disturbing the peace, and sentenced a number of times to spend several months in jail. Another quality that helped him to be chosen to head the pyramid was his organizational ability. Thus, for example, Barukh Marzel was one of the main organizers of the mass funeral of Mordehai and Shalom Lapid, which began at Yeshivat Ponevitch in Bnai Barak and finished in Hebron. Marzel is very accepted in "Gush Emunim" circles, and takes part in councils of the joint leadership of the right. The two other points in the trio are Noam Federman, the movement's spokesman; and Tiran Pollak, chairman of the Committee for Safety on the Roads, and Kach candidate for the Jerusalem city council. Federman joined Kach when he was just 14. Since then, he has managed to chalk up a long list of criminal arrests and convictions for rioting, damaging property, and acts of aggression. Thus, for example, he was found guilty several years ago of setting fire to the church of St. Paul and of damaging the property of Arabs and leftists--among them former Shalom Ahshav spokesman Amiram Goldbloom--and also sentenced to 20 months imprisonment. Tiran Pollack also has a very long criminal record of similar offenses, but has spent less time than the others have in jail. Among other things, he has been under suspicion at various times of spraying Arab vineyards outside Hilhul with poison, setting the door of Jerusalem leftist activist Reuven Kaminer's house on fire, and organizing the big revenge crusades in Jerusalem after the murder of Yeshiva student Eliyahu 'Amadi in 1986. He joined Kach for tragic reasons, after losing his two sisters, Nurit and Esther, when Bus No. 18 was blown up on Herzl Boulevard in Jerusalem on 6 December 1983. The High Court of Justice ruled in 1988 to outlaw Kach as a racist movement, and forbade it to participate in elections. Now, Knesset members are demanding that its members be banned from the territories of Judaea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip. There are about 200 active members in the movement today, and it is very possible that in many of them will find themselves facing a wave of administrative arrests and forcible removals in the near future.
