FR941216-1-00005 FR941216-1-00002 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;191&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 Series Airplanes Equipped With SOGERMA-SOCEA Pilot, Co-Pilot, and Third Occupant Seats AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. This proposal would require repetitive inspections to detect distortion and/or cracks on the attachment brackets of the backrest recline control locks of certain seats. This proposal would also require replacement of cracked or distorted brackets and their associated attachment fittings with new parts, which would terminate the repetitive inspection requirements. This proposal is prompted by a report of failure of the bracket of the backrest recline control lock on a seat due to fatigue-related cracking. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent such fatigue-related cracking and/or distortion, which could result in failure of the seat backrest attach fittings, which may lead to the uncommanded 50 â—‹ angle recline of the pilot or co-pilot seat, and, subsequently, the temporary inability of the pilots to control the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received by January 27, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;191&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
