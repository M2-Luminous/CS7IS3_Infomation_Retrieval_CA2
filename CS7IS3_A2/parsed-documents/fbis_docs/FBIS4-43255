The "great old men," the forefathers capable of spreading a safety net under the free-falling party: [former Chamber of Deputies speaker] Giorgio Napolitano and [outgoing Italian General Confederation of Labor Secretary General] Bruno Trentin. The young mayors, ready to stand in for any of the main actors who may suffer an accident: Antonio Bassolino (Naples), and Walter Vitali (Bologna). The competent and telegenic "outsiders" who are natural candidates for the anti-Berlusconi hero's role: [Venice Mayor] Massimo Cacciari and [Rome Mayor] Francesco Rutelli, neither of whom is a PDS member but who, as it is commonly said, belong to the "same area." They are all under 50, apart from the sages who are about 70. In many cases, their relations are difficult, except for the "old men," who keep quiet. One of these men will be the PDS's next secretary. The selection process had been going on for some time now, but, officially, the campaigning starts today. For a single (and, moreover, uncomfortable) post, this may seem a long list, but after all, there are only six candidates plus two alternates, and the real match is only between two of them. Indeed, Botteghe Oscure's [PDS headquarters] spin doctors are saying: "There is no confrontation, there will be no confrontation." The PDS has never witnessed an open tug of war between two candidates, the party follows a "tradition" of full consensus, of unanimous agreement on a single name. If there is a struggle, it takes place before, behind the scenes. Officially, there will be no war: Everybody will want D'Alema or everybody will want Veltroni. However, since 39-year old Walter Veltroni, L'UNITA's chief editor, is telling anyone who wants to listen that he is happy with his paper, which is so successful, that he has no wish to become PDS secretary, and that, in any case, he is not prepared to run as a candidate for one side (in this case, Occhetto's side), it is difficult to see where the problem or the uncertainty really lie. It would seem that only Alema, 45, is actually in the contest. D'Alema has a majority in the party and among the regional secretaries. If a ballot were held now -- they assured us at Botteghe Oscure's press office -- he would most certainly become the PDS's next leader. Cacciari Is Not a Member Where, then, does the problem lie? In the fact that Occhetto did not leave peacefully and resignedly on the eve of the congress, handing over power to his official successor, as D'Alema -- on the evening of the European elections -- had suggested he should do. Occhetto left in a huff and at once, cursing his enemies, first and foremost his internal enemies, particularly Cacciari and D'Alema. "`I am leaving, but you will also have to leave,' is written in that letter," said one of Occhetto's "colonels" who was among the first to leave Botteghe Oscure yesterday afternoon. [passage omitted] An Invention by the Papers What if Cacciari were indeed the name that the PDS is looking for? "Look, Cacciari is an invention by the papers, he is completely extraneous to the party, and is altogether unpopular. He is not even a member, he has no chance at all," one of the leaders closest to Occhetto says sharply. Achille [Occhetto] hates him, since he was the man who first posed the problem of succession. However, whether Occhetto likes it or not, Cacciari has all the requisites which by now the PDS acknowledges in a potential anti-Berlusconi leader: He is telegenic and cultured, he is fascinating, witty, fairly young, and women like him. In addition, he is a philosopher, not just some sort of bureaucrat. "Let us keep things separate. One thing is the leader of the progressives, and another the PDS' secretary," Umberto Ranieri suggests. Two different things: a secretary, who must be found immediately, and a leader for the coalition, who can wait until later. Given the abovementioned requisites, apart from Cacciari himself, Francesco Rutelli would also make a good progressive leader. The same applies to Veltroni, assuming that an agreement is reached along the lines suggested by some: D'Alema would immediately become the secretary, whereas Veltroni -- who is Kennedyesque, charismatic, and appeals to young people -- would become the Left's leader shortly afterwards. Late in the day, the corridors were buzzing with this question: If the Left and the PDS choose the same man, who will have the courage to tell Veltroni?
