A Political Commentary"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Official Kiev's optimism manifested itself in yet another aspect. In the leading circles of the Ukrainian Supreme Council a RESPUBLIKA correspondent was informed that the question of Ukraine's becoming a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (DNYaZ) would not be taken up by the Ukrainian parliament in the immediate future. Consideration of this question has to be postponed until such time as Ukraine is accorded specific security guarantees. Would this take place any more rapidly than the dismantling of our technically obsolete missiles? The president of Ukraine has also said already that this question will not be brought up for consideration by the present parliament. He did not, however, indicate the reasons why this was being postponed. Could it be that the United States, changing its attitude toward Ukraine, has come to understand that the retention of nuclear warheads and the ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty constitutes a logical and political absurdity? However, there is little hope of such a change in attitude. During the telephone conversation which took place between the presidents of Ukraine and the United States on 18 February Clinton again insisted upon Ukraine's becoming a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. But what then about the promises of security guarantees? Is anybody in a hurry to accord them to Ukraine? All the more so when it would involve making uniquivocal moves in international policy? It was important for Ukraine to be made a part of the program entitled "Partnership for Peace": this was a display of trust in Ukraine on the part of the NATO members. As a member of this partnership, Ukraine adopted the Russian viewpoint with regard to the Serbian problem. Nowadays, after the withdrawal of Serbian troops from the frontline, it is still too early to assess the correctness or incorrectness of the Ukrainian stance on this matter. The Russian peace initiatives and actions in Abkhazia ended with the drama of the Georgian state. Ukrainian politicians are seeking answers to the question of what lies behind the fact that the Serbs believed only the Russians. All the more so in that Russia's presidential adviser--on the occasion of the new situation in the Balkans--made the following statement: "We need to be able to persuade people and know how to take advantage of the opportune moment." In this situation Western commentators traditionally consider the Russians' diplomatic mission as a triumph, while expressing great surprise at the stance taken by Ukraine. The latter's democratic politicians have emphatically proclaimed that in foreign policy we must uneqivocally pose the matter as follows: "Either national interests or old-time sentiments!" This matter has gained new urgency since the reasons for the "Russian diplomatic triumph" have been figured out. Situations sometimes occur whereby military people reveal that which the diplomats have striven so zealously and long to conceal. On 19 February a certain Russian general in an interview for the Ostankino Televison Company said the following straight out: "If NATO intervenes in a sphere of influence which is not theirs, unforeseen consequences could result." He thereby emphatically asserted for the umpteenth time that the world is divided into zones of influence. And so it turns out that the prolonged war in the Balkans is a consequence of the above-mentioned division. If decisiveness and determination had been shown, this military conflagration on the territory of the former Yugoslavia could have been extinguished long ago. When matters started to turn threatening for certain NATO members (Greece and Turkey), this organization showed firmness. Tens of thousands of victime did not constitute a sufficient argument to intervene in someone else's zone. All this sheds new light on the question of according security guarantees to Ukraine. At one of his November 1993 press conferences former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma said that Ukraine belongs to the Russian zone. Therefore, the doubts of certain Western journalists regarding the genuineness of the security guarantees intended for Ukraine are not groundless or unjustified.
