In Lunda Norte, South African mercenaries have met the appropriate response to their adventure of 16 March 1994 when they carried out an attack in the area between Lufige and Luxa Rivers, resulting in the death of 12 white South African mercenaries. They were led by Lieutenant (Stein Marais) and Noncommissioned Officer (Bronoz). Captured documents revealed that additional groups are being deployed in the region. 2. The Russian aircraft impounded in Rundu, Namibia, are owned by the Futungo [Angolan Government] and have nothing to do with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. The pilots are Angolan and Portuguese nationals. The Namibian Government is hereby challenged to take the crew to one of its tribunals so that the world may know the truth. 3. Until a general and verifiable cease-fire is declared, the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] will seize no more UNITA-occupied positions without receiving the appropriate response. Military adventures must come to an end. [Dated] Huambo, 21 March 1994 [Signed] Army General Arlindo Chenda Isaac Pena Ben-Ben, chief of the General Staff
