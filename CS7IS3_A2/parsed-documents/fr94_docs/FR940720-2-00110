Attorney for licensee: Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts, and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037. NRC Project Director: John N. Hannon. Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;266 and 50&hyph;301, Point Beach Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Town of Two Creeks, Manitowoc County, Wisconsin Date of amendment request: May 26, 1994. Description of amendment request: Point Beach Nuclear Plant is installing two additional emergency diesel generators and reconfigure portions of the 4160 Volt emergency electrical power system. The proposed amendment would revise the Point Beach Nuclear Plant Technical Specifications (TS) to establish the requirements for the electrical systems at Point Beach such that the TS will provide the appropriate guidance for all interim configurations and the final configuration. The majority of changes are incorporated in TS Section 15.3.7, ``Auxiliary Electrical Systems.'' Other Sections modified are 15.3.0, ``General Considerations,'' 15.3.14, ``Fire Protection System,'' and 15.4.6, ``Emergency Power System Periodic Tests.'' Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: (1) Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications will not create a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Point Beach Nuclear Plant Final Safety Analysis Report (PBNP FSAR) shows that the original emergency diesel generators and the associated support systems and connections do not cause or affect the probability of any accident evaluated in the PBNP FSAR. The additional emergency diesel generators, the associated support systems and connections, and reconfiguration of the emergency AC power system will not change this. The emergency AC power system does not initiate any accident previously evaluated in the PBNP FSAR. The limiting conditions for operation and allowable outage times proposed in this license amendment request are consistent with the current requirements in the PBNP Technical Specifications. The proposed change in the required emergency diesel generator (EDG) inspection interval, from annually to the time as recommended by the EDG manufacturer, will continue to maintain the operability and reliability of the EDGs. Therefore, the probability of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated in the FSAR is not increased by the proposed Technical Specifications. The consequences of the accidents previously evaluated in the PBNP FSAR are determined by the results of analyses that are based on initial conditions of the plant, the type of accident, transient response of the plant, and the operation and failure of equipment and systems. The new emergency diesel generator installation will meet the requirements for emergency power sources for PBNP. General Design Criterion (GDC) 39 as described in the PBNP FSAR, states, ``An emergency power source shall be provided and designed with adequate independency, redundancy, capacity, and testability to permit the functioning of the engineered safety features and protection systems required to avoid undue risk to the health and safety of the public. This power source shall provide this capacity assuming a failure of a single component.'' The limiting conditions for operation and allowable outage times proposed in this license amendment request are consistent with the requirements in GDC&hyph;39 and the current Technical Specifications for PBNP. Therefore, this proposed license amendment does not affect the consequences of any accident previously evaluated in the PBNP FSAR, because the factors that are used to determine the consequences of accidents are not being changed. (2) Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The PBNP FSAR shows that the original emergency diesel generators and the associated support systems and connections do not cause any accident evaluated in the PBNP FSAR. The additional emergency diesel generators, the associated support systems and connections, and reconfiguration of the emergency AC power system will not change this, because the new emergency diesel generators will meet the requirements for emergency power sources for PBNP. Additionally, these changes do not introduce any type of system or component malfunction that would create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The limiting conditions for operation and allowable outage times proposed in this license amendment request are consistent with the requirements in GDC&hyph;39 and the current Technical Specifications for PBNP. The proposed change in the required EDG inspection interval, from annually to the time as recommended by the EDG manufacturer, will continue to maintain the operability and reliability of the EDGs. Therefore, the proposed Technical Specification changes for the addition of two diesel generators and changing the required EDG inspection interval do not create the possibility of an accident of a different type than any previously evaluated in the FSAR. (3) Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The new diesel generator and emergency AC power system reconfiguration design and installation are being and have been performed to meet or exceed the original system design requirements. The emergency diesel generators provide power to the safety equipment that operates to maintain the margins of safety. The new diesel generators and emergency AC power configuration will continue to satisfy this requirement. The limiting conditions for operation and allowable outage times proposed in this license amendment request are consistent with the requirements in GDC&hyph;39 and the current Technical Specifications for PBNP. The proposed change in the required EDG inspection interval, from annually to the time as recommended by the EDG manufacturer, will continue to maintain the operability and reliability of the EDGs. Therefore, the proposed Technical Specification changes for the addition of two diesel generators and changing the required EDG inspection interval do not reduce the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Joseph P. Mann Library, 1516 Sixteenth Street, Two Rivers, Wisconsin 54241. Attorney for licensee: Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts, and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037. NRC Project Director: John N. Hannon. Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;266 and 50&hyph;301, Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Town of Two Creeks, Manitowoc County, Wisconsin Date of amendment request: May 26, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the Point Beach Nuclear Plant Technical Specifications (TSs) by extending the operation of both units with the current heatup and cooldown limit curves to 23.6 effective full power years (EFPY). The proposal also would revise the bases for TS Section 15.3.1.B, ``Pressure/Temperature Limits,'' to reflect the methodology for the curve compilation. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: We have evaluated these proposed amendments in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.91(a), against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92, and have determined that these modifications will not result in a significant hazards consideration. A proposed amendment will not involve a significant hazards consideration if it does not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed heatup and cooldown curves are identical to the current heatup and cooldown curves except for their projected expiration. The curves were calculated using the most limiting weld and fluence information from either unit as input to the acceptable methodology of Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2. The consequences or probability of a previously evaluated accident will, therefore, not significantly be increased or a margin of safety reduced. The underlying purpose of these curves is to define an acceptable operating range of pressures and temperatures to protect the reactor vessels against non-ductile failure. Since this purpose remains unchanged, a new or different kind of accident cannot be created.
