"We firmly believe that people need to follow our course toward an economic union within the CIS framework, a single ruble zone with Russia, and coordinated customs space as an opportunity and necessity to live and work in a civilized way," he said today at a reception for diplomats accredited in Minsk. The premier said: The basis of our foreign policy is giving up force and a threat of force and giving up nuclear weapons. "We were the first among the former USSR republics and among the world's states in general, who, without putting forward any preliminary conditions to the world community, began nuclear disarmament. By doing this, we laid our own little brick in the common foundation for European and international security. At the same time, we are not expecting any gratitude from the world community. The main thing for us is trust, mutual understanding, and an opportunity for full-blooded international cooperation," he said.
