It is not hard to guess that the purpose of his meetings and talks with the leaders of the region's states is to explain and publicize as much as possible the new NATO initiative. Therefore to some extent Clinton may be regarded as the major lobbyist for the idea of East-West partnership. The meetings that the U.S. President has already held on 11 and 12 January with the leaders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary -- the countries of the so-called Visegrad group -- confirm that idea. During the talks with Czech President Vaclav Havel, Clinton stated that although the program of partnership does not guarantee the new allies complete protection from external aggression it does nevertheless offer the possibility even before the end of this year of joining in the process of common combat training with the NATO armies and of participating in joint exercises. According to information from sources close to the U.S. President, the aim of Clinton's meetings with Polish President Lech Walesa, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, and Slovak President Michal Kovac is to hold similar talks. The first impromptu action has occurred during Clinton's European tour. I am talking about the U.S. President's unscheduled brief stopover in Kiev and the talks with Leonid Kravchuk. In Kiev, according to White House press service spokesmen, the sides are to discuss questions connected with the Ukrainian President's final resolve to renounce the strategic nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian territory and agree to their dismantling and shipment to Russia. The U.S. side is ready to grant $175 million from the Nunn-Lugar fund to finance this action. Ukraine is also being promised its share of the $1 billion which it is thought will accrue from the sale of weapons-grade uranium to the West. Although it is believed in the United States that Ukraine is simply obliged to do this -- in order to fulfill its own commitments under international treaties -- Washington is ready in principle to offer Kiev a number of additional inducements. Specifically, there is mention of a figure of around $1.8 billion to develop (or more accurately to maintain the viability of) Ukraine's power industry and achieve at least a minimum stabilization of its national currency. For the time being, however, all these are just suggestions.
