Tsokhatzopoulos Loses Vote Writing in the 19 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI, Stavros Liyeros discussed one of the main arguments that arose during the congress: the refusal of congress participants to approve the double role of Akis Tsokhatzopoulos as both party secretary general and minister of interior. Liyeros recalled the 1990 congress, at which PASOK leader Andreas Papandreou threatened to dissolve the party if Tsokhatzopoulos were not appointed secretary general. While party regulations forbid the secretary to occupy a ministerial post, Papandreou nevertheless appointed Tsokhatzopoulos as minister of interior last October, remanding a solution of the dilemma to the 1994 congress. As the date of the congress approached, Liyeros continued, Tsokhatzopoulos attempted to reinforce his position in the party as Papandreou's "natural heir." To avoid a conflict the position of minister of state was offered Tsokhatzopoulos, who rejected it "out of hand." Tsokhatzopoulos believed the majority of congress participants would approve his dual position, since they had been elected "under his banner." Events proved him wrong, with two out of three participants voting against approval. Liyeros cited a PASOK official as saying that "we all wanted to send a message that we will not accept a second hegemony, especially a misprint of Andreas'." The party, Liyeros observed, has entered a "slippery course," because the "Tsokhatzopoulos group," which had extended its power in the central committee and the party apparatus, suffered a political defeat despite Papandreou's advice to his minister of interior to show "flexibility." Liyeros quoted a Papandreou aide as saying that "the prime minister had no reason to jeopardize his relations with PASOK and lose his role as almighty referee just to get Tsokhatzopoulos out of trouble." Other Congress Developments Beyond the Tsokhatzopoulos issue, Nikos Kiaos took a critical look at other congress developments in the 21 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA. -- Papandreou was only present for an hour, the time it took him to open the proceedings, close them, and cast his ballot. He was crowned party leader once again by means of general applause and slogans which "covered up" the strong objections and criticism of the leadership a number of participants launched. -- While the congress rejected open membership in party organizations, it approved without discussion the list of candidates for the central committee "imposed" by Papandreou and the party's executive bureau. -- The congress boasted about "party unity," but all its members were engaged in conflicts related to the list of candidates for the central committee. -- Papandreou repeatedly emphasized the "rebirth" of PASOK without specifying the means to achieve it. Such a "rebirth" was contradicted by the proceedings. -- While all the members of the executive bureau disagreed with Tsokhatzopoulos' dual position, supporters of officials such as Kostas Laliotis and Yerasimos Arsenis voted for it. -- Despite the fact that party groups and apparatuses were denounced, the central committee is dominated by the Tsokhatzopoulos, Simitis, and Arsenis groups. -- Although a congress is expected to generate discussion of "hot problems," foreign and domestic policy issues were barely mentioned and only self-satisfaction was expressed. -- Finally, no discussion of the past 2O years or criticism of erroneous policies occurred, Kiaos observed.
