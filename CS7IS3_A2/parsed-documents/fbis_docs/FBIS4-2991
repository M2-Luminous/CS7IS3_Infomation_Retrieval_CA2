Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan will hold bilateral tariff reduction negotiations under the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) with the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand beginning April 25, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) announced Thursday [14 April]. BOFT Deputy Director-General Lin Yi-fu will represent Taiwan at the talks, to take place in Manila, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok respectively. The Philippines has requested Taiwan to slash import duties on 61 items, while Thailand has asked for lower tariffs on 33 items, and Malaysia 24 items, Lin said. The tariff-cut requests focus on agricultural and fishery products, textiles, machinery equipment, and small cars, he added. The forthcoming tariff negotiations will be the first such talks between Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries. Taiwan has held similar talks with Australia, Chile, Hungary, New Zealand, South Africa, Turkey, and the United States. Meanwhile, similar talks between Taiwan and Japan will be held April 27-28 in Tokyo. BOFT Director-General Huang Yen-chao will lead the Taiwan delegation to the Tokyo talks. Bilateral tariff reduction talks with GATT contracting parties are expected to help ensure Taiwan's smooth accession to the Geneva-based world trade regulating body. Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.
