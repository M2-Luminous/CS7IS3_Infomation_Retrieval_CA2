This blade has successfully completed high-temperature rotation tests based on models of gas turbines used in 20,000 kW output electric power generation where the turbine inlet temperature reaches 1300째C. There are 300 kW class ceramic gas turbines for use in automobile engines, and 300 kW ceramic gas turbines have been developed for cogeneration systems, but this is the first 20,000 kW ceramic gas turbine blade for electric power generation that has ever been developed. The turbine blades have the role of converting the energy of the gas flow to rotational energy. This jointly developed turbine blade is made of silicon nitride to withstand high temperatures, and it was designed with increased anti-stress properties to counteract the stress generated by centrifugal force. Performance was confirmed in rotation tests at a Hitachi plant. Tests were conducted at a rated rotation of 11,214 rpm in air (air temperature approx. 200째C) using kerosene as fuel. Researchers measured both the rotor shaft vibration and ceramic blade vibration, and found no problems. High-temperature combustion tests were also conducted. Researchers found no abnormalities whatsoever when they inspected the ceramic blades after a 2-hour test at 1,200째C at the rated rpm, a 4-hour normal operation test at 1,300째C, a normal shutdown test, and a fuel cutoff/emergency shutdown test. Tokyo Electric Power is working to increase its thermal efficiency more than 50% via combined cycle power generation that uses both gas and steam turbines. Since 1984 TEPCO has proceeded with development of a gas turbine for power generation made of ceramic material, which can withstand high temperatures. As part of this program in January 1990 TEPCO developed a ceramic gas turbine combustor jointly with Toshiba, and in November of the same year developed a ceramic stator blade for expanding gas and converting pressure energy to dynamic energy jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. This ceramic blade is a continuation of that program, and its development confirms that less cooling air will be needed than with the current metal blades, and that researchers can now aim for greater combustion efficiency.
