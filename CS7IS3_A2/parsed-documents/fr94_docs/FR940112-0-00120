FR940112-0-00120 FR940112-0-00024 Four comments raised the issue of letter and print size requirements when the metric symbols, especially the ``mL'' symbol, are used. 38 The comments express concern that the requirement for lower case type for metric symbols may increase the height requirements for net content declarations in instances where other provisions in §500.21 impose minimum type sizes on lower case letters. 39 As a result, the commenters believe that the size of the area taken up by the net contents declaration would increase. To alleviate this result, the commenters propose amendments to §500.21. 38 Bord, 9, 3; Frst, 15, 1; NCWM, 19, 3; and Stem, 13, 6. 39 Section 500.21 imposes various requirements regarding type size in relation to the area of the principal display panel. First Brands Corporation suggests that ``*␣*␣* the minimum height requirement for the `m' in the abbreviation `mL' for milliliter be no less than one-half of the minimum height standards prescribed in *␣*␣*'' other parts of §500.21. 40 40 Firs, 15, 2. The NCWM offers the following proposal for consideration: Add a new paragraph to §500.21_(h) When upper and lower case, or all lowercase letters are used in SI (metric) symbols, it is the uppercase ``L,'' lowercase ``d,'' or their equivalent in the print or type used that shall meet the minimum height requirement. Other letters and exponents must be presented in the same type style and in proportion to the type size used. However, no letter shall be less than 1.6mm (1/16 inch) in height. 41 41 NCWM, 19, 3. Mr. Stempnik suggests that the following sentence be added: The height of the SI declaration shall be equal or greater than the inch pound declaration height. 42 42 Stem, 13, 6. Borden suggests that ``when upper and lower case letters are used, it is the upper case letter `o' or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum height standards.'' 43 43 Bord, 9, 3. Based upon the comments, the Commission believes that it is necessary to address the issue of type size changes resulting from the metric amendments to the FPLA. The Commission adopts the proposal made by the National Conference on Weights and Measures because it presents a standard which is precise, yet not complex or burdensome for industry to follow. Establishing minimum height and size requirements for type and print of letters should assure adequate disclosure to consumers without burdening industry by necessitating an increase in the minimum height for the content declaration. Therefore, the Commission amends section 500.21 by adding a subpart (h) setting out these requirements. R. Section 500.22␣Abbreviations Formerly §500.19, the Commission renumbers this section. S. Section 500.23␣Expression of Net Quantity of Contents in SI Metric Units This is a new section. Subsection (a) sets out the ``rule of 1000'' which states that, with exceptions, metric disclosure should be in units ranging in value from 1 to 1000. Thus, the declaration would be ``750 mL'' rather than ``0.75L.'' The ``rule of 1000'' has been used by industry and FTC staff since 1984 and has the effect of simplifying and unifying label disclosure. Subsection (b) sets out the symbols to be used for SI metric units. These symbols are consistent with those preferred for government usage. 44 44 ``Guide for the Use of the International System of Units,'' NIST Special Publication 811, U.S. Department of Commerce, September, 1991; and ``Preferrred Metric Units for General Use by the Federal Government,'' Federal Standards 376B (Preprint Copy), General Services Administration, January 27, 1993.
