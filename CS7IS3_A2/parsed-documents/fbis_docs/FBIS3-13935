TISHRIN adds: The questions insistently posed by observers is: Has Israel learned any lessons from the terrible Hebron massacre? Has Israel actually abandoned the policy of trickery and procrastination, which it has pursued since the Madrid conference, in order to join serious negotiations in search of a lasting and firm peace? TISHRIN continues: So far, there has been nothing tangible to suggest a real change in the Israeli position on the peace process with Syria and other Arab parties. Israeli officials were content to give hints, which are shrouded in ambiguity and obscurity, at a time when Syria is talking clearly about full peace. The paper stresses that full [Israeli] withdrawal is a basic condition for promoting the peace process and achieving a substantive breakthrough. The whole world knows that Syria cannot sell out a single inch of the Golan and that full Israeli withdrawal from these Syrian territories cannot be bargained over. TISHRIN cautions that further Israeli trickery at the Washington talks will only waste both time and a rare opportunity to achieve a just, comprehensive, and firm peace in the region. The paper emphasizes that when Syria talks about the Golan it looks forward to achieving full Israeli withdrawal from all occupied territories. The paper urges the international community to assume its responsibility, confront Israel's aggressive character, and champion the international principles and charters. Concluding, TISHRIN says: It is deeds, and not words, that count. Statements by Israeli officials are not significant unless they are translated to realities on the ground; that is, full Israeli withdrawal, recognition of Arab rights, compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions, and commitment to the principle of returning the territories.
