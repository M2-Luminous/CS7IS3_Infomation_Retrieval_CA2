I Am Finding Difficulty in Compelling Tribes To Stop Fighting"] [Excerpts] London -- Shabwah Governor Ahmad Farid al-Suraymah has said: "I am complying with the cease-fire and Security Council Resolution 924 in my capacity as governor and military governor of Shabwah Governorate. However, I am finding difficulty in controlling the Shabwah tribes and compelling them to comply with this resolution since they have begun to pursue the northerners." He said this over the telephone from his command post in 'Armah (one of the directorates in Shabwah Governorate). The governor promised to exert his efforts to achieve discipline among the tribes. But he said: "It is a difficult task. It is a popular resistance, and I advise Brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to withdraw the remnants of his forces from Shabwah, otherwise I will not be responsible." The Shabwah governor stressed that he is now at the approaches of 'Ataq, capital of the governorate. And that the distance between him and it does not exceed 20 km. He added that his forces have recaptured most of the governorate's territory, except some five square km in the city of 'Ataq itself. And that he has achieved total control for the southern authorities over the cities of Nisab, al-Musayni'ah, and 'Armah. [passage omitted] The Shabwah governor said that he had invited Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, to visit the governorate "in order to ascertain that we are in control of more than 90 percent of its territory. We are awaiting him." He added that this "refutes (President) 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's allegation that Shabwah is under his control." [passage omitted]
