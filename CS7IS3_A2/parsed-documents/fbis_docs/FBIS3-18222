We are going over direct to our reporter at the negotiations headquarters in Brussels. [Reporter] Well, here in what is called the Charlemagne building at the EU headquarters in Brussels, confirmation has come from several EU countries that Sweden has reached an agreement with the EU in the membership negotiations. There has been no confirmation from the Swedish side. We have not seen any Swedes since these reports came out about 15-20 minutes ago. After a near collapse of the negotiations this morning, Sweden has returned to the talks and solved the last issues concerning farming and the budget. So far there are a few details, very few, and they are that, as far as the milk quotas -- which have been a big issue -- are concerned, where Sweden has demanded that it be allowed to continue to produce 3.1 million tonnes and the EU has said that you are only allowed to produce 3.5 million tonnes [figures as heard], the nice compromise of 3.3 million tonnes has been reached. As regards the budget solution, that is, how much money Sweden is to be refunded in other forms so that the budget costs for Sweden are not so tough in the first few years, it appears to be roughly of the size spoken of a few days ago, perhaps up to 4 billion [currency not specified], (?something like that), but it is fairly uncertain so far. The confirmation comes from the EU side -- Sweden has accepted an agreement. Norway has in practice gone home and will hold negotiations on Monday next week, and on Tuesday the ministers will return (?in order to) solve the Norwegian problems. As for Finland and Austria, there may still be confirmation because Austria is with the Council of Ministers right now and Finland will be soon. What appeared to be a total collapse or at least a long break in the negotiations for the four countries this morning is on its way to being solved. It has been solved in such a way that first Sweden accepted and has an agreement and it seems very likely that at least one of the other countries, probably Finland, will say yes. There are not many details, but Sweden has an agreement.
