Rybkin emphasized in Bonn today that the industrial-cultural exchanges are to be stepped up. The Russian parliamentary president, who had also met Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker, reviewed his talks positively. He emphasized: "We Russians and Germans cannot live without one another." Kohl paid tribute to Rybkin's conciliatory role in Russian politics. At the same time, the chancellor underlined Germany's "vital interest" in the continuation of the democratic and economic reform process in Russia on the basis of stable framework conditions, government spokesman Dieter Vogel said. He also said that the politicians agreed "that bilateral relations are free of fundamental and insoluble problems." In the interest of the two countries and of the whole of Europe this positive starting position should be put to use and developed further.
