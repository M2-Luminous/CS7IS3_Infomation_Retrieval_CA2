Moscow believes that such attacks lead to further escalation of conflicts and that they are especially dangerous prior to the forthcoming ministerial conference in Geneva. The chief diplomats of the United States, Russia and the European Union and officials of the United Nations will meet in Geneva on Friday to try to definitively determine the framework for a political settlement of the crisis in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The situation around the Serb town of Brcko in the north of Bosnia is currently at the focus of attention of political organs and the media in Moscow. Radio and television stations broadcast the news that the U.N. Security Council had condemned the Muslim attack on Brcko in which four civilians were killed and 13 wounded. It is believed here that the current situation in Bosnia, especially around Brcko, does not inspire a great deal of hope for an early settlement of the conflict. Official sources here say that on both sides -- Serb and Muslim -- there are forces inclined to military confrontation who believe that a political settlement is impossible. Moscow has announced that its position in Geneva will be `very resolute' but it is not clear whether it will make any new proposals. Russia insists on an agreement that the warring sides resume talks as soon as possible. If this is not achieved, the war could continue indefinitely and the consequences could be disastrous, official sources in Moscow maintain.
