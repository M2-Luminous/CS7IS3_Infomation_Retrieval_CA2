According to the mayor, economic operations in the city had been on the whole good in the first four months of this year with its industrial output value increased by 35.4 percent over the same period of last year, fixed assets investment by 89 percent and export value by 20 percent. For various reasons, the special economic zone had suffered a decline in the introduction of foreign capital in the first four months with only 163 contracts on the use of foreign funds being signed in this period, a drop of 15.5 percent over the same period last year and a total of foreign investment of U.S.$415 million, down by 29.4 percent, but its actual utilization of foreign capital increased by 7.2 percent, reflecting that most of the indicators for the introduction of foreign capital in the city were lower than those in other special economic zones in the country. Mr. Hong attributed the decline in the introduction of foreign capital in the city to the unstable environment for investment there besides objective factors including a large-scale decline of investment in the real estate industry, the shifting of foreign investment from coastal areas to inland areas in the country and various limits imposed by the Taiwan authorities on its investment in the mainland. The mayor called for a solution to problems in the environment for investment through means of reform in order to curb the declining trend in foreign capital introduction in the city. He also said that the city must make itself trusted by foreign businessmen and all contracts, once signed, must be implemented even if in the circumstances there was a loss for the Chinese side.
