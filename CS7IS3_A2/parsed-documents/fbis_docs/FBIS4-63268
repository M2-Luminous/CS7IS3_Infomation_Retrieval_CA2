He said that Ukraine might sell air to air missiles, radars, guidance and automatic fire control systems and armored equipment. Gnatenko also said that six months ago, the Ukrainian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations established an agency (Ukroboronservis) dealing with the arms issues. It has established contacts with a similar agency in Russia (Rosvooruzheniye) and is currently coordinating prices on military equipment manufactured in both countries. To quote Gnatenko, there is a state arms development program to last until the year 2010 providing for the creation of a network of research centers. He said that whereas the former Soviet Union had about 40 research institutes working on arms projects, Russia has 37 now and Ukraine none, although research centers are attached to many of the former defense enterprises. He told journalists that in 1995-96, Ukraine would put on orbit a satellite of its own. Speaking about arms production Gnatenko said that Ukraine has built or nearly built 10 warships. He also announced that a program was being developed for the production of firearms at five Ukrainian factories, including the Kiev Machine-Building Plant and the Dnepropetrovsk Yuzhnyy Machine- Building Plant, the latter will manufacture firearms on the basis of the Kalashnikov sub-machine-gun and the former firearms of its own design. He complained that the budget spending on armaments and components was insufficient. In 1994, only 8 percent of the required money was allocated for this purpose. He said in this connection that Ukraine had had talks with Russia on selling about 40 strategic bombers in exchange for space parts for individual types of armaments and maintenance services.
