Judging from press reports it was indeed a grand affair. Up above, World War II aircraft, including the legendary Spitfire, gave way to modern fighters; while demonstration airborne assaults gave way to amphibious landings. Fifteen warships took part in the naval review, including the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier George Washington. Amphibious vehicles put ashore bearing the colors of the units which took part in the landing. There were also grateful speeches addressed to the veterans by leaders of the states whose soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy, along with parades and wreath-laying ceremonies. Yet for all the solemnity of the celebrations and the genuine enthusiasm of their participants, what took place prompts the feeling that something extremely important was left unsaid and undone. The country -- Russia -- without which neither the Normandy landing nor victory would have been possible took no part in the celebrations. Unfortunately, the Cold War has also cast its shadow over our common victory (let us recall that it was then that the actual "united nations" concept appeared). For many years our former allies, who had become our enemies, kept silent about the other side's role in crushing fascism. Now that confrontation has become a thing of the past, a chance has appeared to break the habit of dividing the great victory into "ours" and "not ours." So far this chance has not been taken. What a great pity. After all, what is the point of organizing such celebrations? Above all, of course, it is to pay due respect to those who achieved this feat. But something else is important: Such celebrations are necessary to remind us of the unity of mankind in opposing the forces of evil. And today are not fascism, aggressive nationalism, and dictatorships of various types and sorts not throwing down a challenge to freedom? Today is there no need to oppose these challenges with combined efforts? Nowadays, when East and West -- with considerable difficulties -- are trying to create a new European and global security architecture by overcoming their own prejudices and fighting other people's, many people are seeking a historical linchpin for new cooperation. The brotherhood-in-arms of World War II could be such a linchpin. The chance to demonstrate this was missed in Normandy. The 50th anniversary of victory presents another chance to show that the division of the world has been done away with. Let us hope that the politicians are perspicacious enough not to miss that one as well.
