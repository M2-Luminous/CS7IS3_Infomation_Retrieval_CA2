He made these remarks during his May 23-25 inspection of Shanghai, following his tour of neighboring Jiangsu Province. He noted that it was a most important decision of Deng Xiaoping's to develop the Pudong Area and to open it to the outside world. Li, who has gone to Shanghai each year since the central government's decision to develop and open the Pudong New Area in 1990, was pleased to see the great achievement that the new area made in the past few years. By the end of last year, there were some 3,100 separate domestic investments and some 1,600 overseas investments, attracting a combined overseas investment of 3.27 billion U.S. dollars in contractual volume. Shanghai is where the Chang Jiang River flows into the sea. The city has a vast hinterland which is quite advanced industrially, and in commerce and transport. A large number of highly skilled and talented people have also gathered there, Li Peng noted. The central government will continue to give its policy backing to the Pudong New Area since it is still under construction and needs a continuous policy on development and opening to the outside world, he said. He said Shanghai should be built into one of the world top economic, financial and trade centers. To achieve that target, he said, Shanghai should make concentrated efforts to make use of the favorable conditions that Shanghai enjoys. Shanghai should develop international shipping and establish an advanced network of domestic and international transportation, he said. He pointed out that the clearance of the Chang Jiang River course will make it possible for Shanghai to become a world shipping center. More domestic and foreign trade channels should be opened and specialists on international trade be trained so that the city can become an international trade center, he said. The service industries, especially finance, trade and shipping, should be developed as a key sector, he stressed. As for the secondary industry, he added that a group of large new and high-tech and export-oriented projects should also be constructed as a new pillar industry for the city. On agriculture, the premier said that vegetable planting should be stressed and stable farming production centers should take shape in the rural areas administered by Shanghai. The premier inspected the Pudong New Area and the famous Yangpu Bridge that links the city proper to the new development zone. Wu Bangguo, secretary of Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, as well as officials from the State Council accompanied him during the tour.
