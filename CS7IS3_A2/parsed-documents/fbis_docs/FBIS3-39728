[Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli said nothing. Nothing to journalists, nothing to his aides, and nothing even to those working with him to draw up lists of candidates. It must have been difficult not to comment even to his closest associates on the bomb dropped by De Mita in the very heart of what used to be the DC [Christian Democratic Party] left. To ignore the announcement that, amid so many problems, the "great outcast" is planning to wage war, within a PPI that he can see sliding to the right, into the arms of [Northern League leader] Bossi and [Forza Italian leader] Berlusconi. But in the evening Martinazzoli's rage exploded: "Let him by all means occupy an opposition stance within the party; that is his right. But," Martinazzoli said, "I consider some of his remarks entirely unjust. They are insults, rather than arguments. And I greatly regret the fact." The secretary was furious, hurt, and worried. This is because he is fully aware that De Mita is not alone in thinking those things, as he witnesses the disappearance or the collapse, one by one, of the candidates, representing all groups, of the old left -- De Mita, Bodrato, Tina Anselmi, Granelli, Mancino, and Mattarella. Moreover, in the shadow of the axis with Segni, there is again a growing fear that the "ideologue," Rocco Buttiglione, could realize the dream of a DC "controlled by Communion and Liberation." In fact the PPI [Italian Popular Party] leadership realized at once that the secretary had read De Mita's interview carefully. They inferred it from Martinazzoli's response to the reckless person who asked him to reveal his plans for the coming days: "But we do not even know what the world will be like next week." The questions subsided, but his silence was not enough to quell his anger. And when he drove off from his home at 1600 Martinazzoli looked extremely grim. This, even though he was on his way to meet not with "the Irpinia progressive ethnic group" (as PPI leaders call De Mita's supporters) but with the officials of CIDA, the Business Managers' Federation. He arrived dressed in blue, on edge, smoking a cigarette, with a look that said: "Don't come near me or I'll kill you." But television Channel 1 journalist Mimmo Sacco -- who has devoured several DC secretaries -- was brave enough to approach him. He knew exactly where he was driving, but he took an oblique approach, asking whether there are still any "problems" with Segni. His prudence did not spare him an attack: "You must stop it. It is you who have fabricated these ruptures and disputes. I have had enough of it." Sacco did not give up, and craftily talked about Occhetto, about strong men, even succeeding in making the secretary smile. He took advantage of this to ask his key question: What about De Mita? This time Martinazzoli did not even answer: He rolled his eyes, shook his head, spluttered, "What, again?" and made off, turning his back on Sacco. At 1900 he returned to PPI headquarters. Rosy Bindi had just left. It is well known that she does not like the right. So, did she like what De Mita had to say? "His interview confirms that he has tremendous political acumen," she replied with conviction. So is he correct? Are the PPI's lists really in danger of providing a stepping stone to a life to the right of Segni? "We are indeed working to ensure that this does not happen." That is not exactly the official line. This, though Martinazzoli did make hints at his meeting with CIDA officials: He stepped up his attack on a Right that he swore he did not want to ally with, a right that "if it continues this way threatens to be victorious," a Right that "is anything but what the country needs, and that will lead Italy back to the years of autarchy" -- a Right that has "a real leader who is neither [Northern League leader] Bossi nor [Italian Social Movement] leader Fini" and within which the League "no longer represents a break but has become an amalgamating force." This is consistent, according to his associates; "it is what he has always thought; he does not need to reply to De Mita." They too are angry with De Mita who is "obsessed with being at the center of the world"; "who is now attacking CAF [Craxi, Andreotti, Forlani], though in 1989 he curbed Martinazzoli, arguing the `realism' of the agreement with Forlani"; who "would be right if it were true--which it is not--that he was left off the electoral list without anyone having asked him to make such a generous gesture..." Silvia Costa also defended the secretary: "What? If we have always claimed that parliamentary representation is a service, why should someone get angry over their seat? De Mita is wrong: Unfortunately, it was the way in which he was asked not to run that turned his personal candidacy into a political one." But these remarks came from the first floor, contrasting with the sepulchral silence that reigned on the second floor -- in the inner sanctum, until Maria Eletta Martini emerged. So what about De Mita? she did not reply, drew a sigh, and shrugged. Are you turning to the right? She was about to shrug again, then stopped herself and blurted: "Ciriaco is expressing well-founded anxieties, with which I fully agree. But I interpret them as anxieties, whereas he talks about them as faits accomplis. In fact, after all, the elections have not yet taken place. As you know, we are in a difficult situation. We have loyally supported what was certainly not a progressive government and have had to form handicapped alliances." And were they fair with De Mita over his candidacy? This time the old De Mita supporter became heated: "On this point De Mita is entirely in the right. We treated him like dirt, like some kid who should stand aside. I have said so, too." A few feet away, Martinazzoli's press officer blanched. But by this point she was unstoppable. And when someone asked her whether she trusts Segni she looked at him as though he were crazy: "No, for goodness' sake." These are difficult times for Martinazzoli.
