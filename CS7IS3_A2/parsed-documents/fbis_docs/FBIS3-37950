A statement made by the Georgian delegation at the talks says in particular: Georgia is in a worse situation at the start of the third round of talks on the large-scale settlement of the Abkhazian conflict than it was during the second. Thousands of civilians in Gali Rayon have been driven out of the region. Hundreds of houses have been burned down. Hundreds of people have been killed, frozen, or injured. Representatives of the Gudauta regime made absurd statements at the Moscow talks of experts on Abkhazia's political statute within Georgia, thus making ineffective all efforts made by the group of experts to accomplish their task constructively. Having seen that Russian-Georgian relations are turning to a new stage and that this will result in the stabilization of the situation in the whole Caucasian region, Gudauta separatists did everything they could to prevent the signing of the treaty on friendship, good-neighborliness, and cooperation between Russia and Georgia. The moment the treaty was signed and was welcomed by the whole world, Abkhaz armed gangs, together with mercenaries, launched a large-scale operation on driving the remaining Georgian families out of Gali Rayon. On the very day -- on 3 February 1994 when the Russian-Georgian treaty was signed -- Abkhaz forces armed with heavy equipment burned down a number of villages in Gali Rayon. It should be emphasized that the Gudauta authorities did not allow representatives of the UN mission in Sukhumi to enter the area of punitive operations. This convinces us that realizing that the state of affairs is driving toward the unconditional elimination of the regime and that they will not be able to prove the logical concept of the separatist and fascist regime they had established against the territorial integrity of Georgia, the Gudauta authorities are using the policy of a completed fact. Will this challenge to, not only Georgia but also the whole world community continue? How many resolutions should be taken by the UN Security Council to convince the Gudauta separatists to rethink themselves. We highly appreciate efforts taken by Edouard Brunner, the UN secretary general's personal envoy. It was due to his efforts that a certain success was reached at the talks. A constructive policy by the Russian delegation was also positive during the drafting of important documents. But the time has come for more vigorous activity. We appeal to the United Nations Organization to seek effective means to end the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people. The Gali events convinced us that all negotiations are only used as screens by the Gudauta regime. We cannot participate in this sort of development. This would encourage Abkhaz separatism. Every negotiation should be based on trust, but this very trust and hope of the Abkhazian side's goodwill has been eliminated. The development of events demonstrates that Abkhaz separatists respect and recognize only the language of force.
