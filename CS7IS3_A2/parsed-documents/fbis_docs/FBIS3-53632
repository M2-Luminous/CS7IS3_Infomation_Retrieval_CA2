Various arms producers, through their representatives in Pakistan, are trying to influence public opinion in a bid to thwart the negotiations for the purchase of the Mirage-2000 from France and SU-27 and MiG-29 planes from Russia. Important institutions in Pakistan have received reports of mysterious activities by representatives of arms companies from various countries of the world. Instructed by company offices in New Delhi, the representatives are carrying out a propaganda campaign in a bid to scuttle the 1989 agreement with the United States for the purchase of 60 F-16 planes and to thwart the negotiations for the purchase of Mirage-2000 planes from France, and SU-27 and MiG-29 aircraft from Russia. Important sources in Rawalpindi said that political-level talks with France for the purchase of Mirage-2000 planes have ended. Experts of the Pakistan Air Force have approved Mirage-2000 planes as technically suitable for induction into the Pakistani Air Force. Financial details, however, are yet to be worked out and the Government of France and the concerned company have been given a financial package proposal. The sources said that no political-level talks have been held yet with Russia on the purchase of SU-27 and MiG-29 planes. A Russian delegation will visit Pakistan soon during which Pakistani officials will hold talks on the purchase of these planes as well as other matters. The sources said that the test and trial stage for the SU-27 and MiG-29 planes have not yet begun. It will be after the political-level talks between Pakistan and Russia. Therefore, it is premature to say anything about the suitability of the SU-27 and Mig-29 planes for Pakistan before their test and trial. A senior officer in Rawalpindi expressed the hope that the people responsible for mobilizing public opinion either for or against any issue will act with a greater sense of responsibility when dealing with defense-related matters and will not turn themselves into the tools of elements attempting to exploit the situation after the suspension of the U.S. aid.
