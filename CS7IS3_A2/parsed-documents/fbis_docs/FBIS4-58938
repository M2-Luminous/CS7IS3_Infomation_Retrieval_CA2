A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry today said Egypt's decision to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa conforms to Egypt's position, which supported all stages of the democratic movement and the annihilation of apartheid in South Africa. These movements began in 1989 and culminated with the democratic nonracial elections in April 1994. In the election, every citizen was able to exercise his right to chose his representative within the context of freedom, equality, and justice, thus ending the system of apartheid.
