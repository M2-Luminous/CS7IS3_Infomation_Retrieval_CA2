FR941012-1-00016 FR941012-1-00004 C. Calculation of Obligations EPA currently allows financial tests as mechanisms to demonstrate financial assurance for environmental obligations under several programs. These include hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities under 40 CFR parts 264 and 265, petroleum underground storage tanks under 40 CFR part 280, UIC facilities under 40 CFR part 144, and PCB commercial storage facilities under 40 CFR part 761. Under each of these programs, the Agency requires that the owner or operator include all of the costs it is assuring through a financial test when it calculates its obligations. This policy prevents an owner or operator from using the same assets to assure different obligations under different programs. The Agency believes this is vital to assure the effectiveness of the financial test and assure that assets are available to assure all of the environmental obligations covered by the test. Thus, consistent with Agency policy, today's proposal requires a firm using a financial test for its subtitle D obligations also to include those costs covered under other Agency programs when it calculates assured costs. V. Domestic Asset Requirement for the Subtitle C Corporate Financial Test The Agency is proposing to modify the domestic asset requirement of the current subtitle C financial test. The current regulations at §§264.143(f)(1)(i)(D) and (ii)(D); 265.143(e)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 264.145(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 265.145(e)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 264.147(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); and 265.147(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D) require that corporations using the financial test have assets located in the U.S. amounting to at least 90% of total assets or at least six times the sum of costs assured through the financial test. The purpose of this requirement is to assure access to funds in the event of bankruptcy. The Agency is concerned that without a domestic asset requirement, it could experience difficulty in accessing funds of bankrupt firms whose assets are located outside of the United States. When the Agency proposed revisions to the subtitle C corporate financial test in the July 1, 1991, notice, at 56 FR 30201, the Agency did not propose revisions to the domestic asset requirement portion of that financial test. However, commenters on that proposal argued that the domestic asset requirement should be revised, as it unnecessarily limits the use of the test. In response to comment received on the July 1 notice, the Agency is proposing a revised domestic asset requirement for subtitle C. The Agency is proposing that corporations using the financial test be required to have assets in the U.S. at least equal to the sum of all environmental obligations assured by a financial test. This approach is consistent with the domestic asset requirement proposed in today's corporate financial test for subtitle D. The Agency solicits comment on its proposal to modify the subtitle C domestic asset requirement. VI. Analysis Supporting This Proposed Rule The discussion below describes the analysis conducted by the Agency to develop the ratio alternative, minimum net worth requirement, and domestic asset requirement of this proposed corporate financial test. These provisions, which are proposed in this notice for use under the subtitle D program, also were proposed by the Agency on July 1, 1991, for use under the subtitle C program (56 FR 30201). In conducting analysis to support today's proposal, the Agency relied in large part on analysis conducted in support of the July 1, 1991, subtitle C rulemaking. This section of the preamble discusses the subtitle C analysis, and additional analysis conducted to support development of this proposal. For a more detailed description of the subtitle C analysis, the reader can refer to the preamble of the July 1, 1991, proposal (56 FR 30201), and to the Background Document supporting the July 1 proposal, which can be found in the docket for that rulemaking (Docket No. F&hyph;91&hyph;RCFP&hyph;FFFFF). For a more detailed description of the analysis to support this subtitle D corporate financial test proposal, the reader can refer to the Background Document for today's rule, which can be found in the docket for this proposal. A. Development of the Subtitle C Corporate Financial Test As was discussed above, on July 1, 1991, the Agency proposed revisions to the subtitle C corporate financial test. At that time, the Agency conducted analysis using the following approach.
