[Petrov] This is our wish and we would like to think that it will be so. To judge from the hospitality that we were shown at NATO Headquarters, and if the Alliance really expands, we could be optimists and believe that in the near future Bulgaria will receive a vote of confidence and will be among the first new NATO members. [Andonova] Do you think that our state enjoys greater attention than the other Eastern European states? [Petrov] I cannot commit myself to assessments as to who is in first place in NATO's eyes. It is the politicians who must follow and assess this. From my position as an observer I think that confidence in Bulgaria is strengthening daily in NATO's higher structures. [Andonova] What do you think determines whether a state is admitted to NATO, the behavior of the candidates or international circumstances? [Petrov] The admission of any Eastern European state depends on NATO's leadership. According to the Washington Charter it alone can propose and invite new members. Naturally, the activity of the candidates in strengthening the structures of international security is of exceptional importance. I think that NATO will also have other criteria, but I do not want to dwell on them -- this is not within my scope of activity. The main thing now is to remove the barrier created by the Cold War between East and West. We must stop seeing each other as enemies. Mutual reproaches as to who was guilty are senseless and obsolete relics, which we must forget. [Andonova] Has the "old thinking" been overcome in the Army? [Petrov] We are doing everything possible to overcome the image of the enemy, especially in the Balkan peninsula, and I think that we have achieved a lot. However, all the state institutions must work in the same direction. The contours of the past have not been fully eliminated. [Andonova] Where do those contours still exist -- at the level of the higher leaderships or at the lower levels of the army's hierarchy? [Petrov] At all levels. [Andonova] Do you see common denominators in the military, regardless of what specific country is involved and of what specific organization it is a member? [Petrov] I fully agree that the military has similar criteria and assessments regarding security, and are equally concerned with the stability of regions that contain hotbeds of tension. [Andonova] Is NATO seriously concerned with the Yugoconflict? [Petrov] NATO is following with great concern the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and is determining its steps with exceptional caution. I can say that they are more concerned than the Balkan states. It may sound strange, but this is what I felt during my meetings in Brussels. [Andonova] Is this the reason for NATO's increased attention toward our country? [Petrov] Perhaps. They are interested in all the factors that could influence the conflict, and in the historical factors in the Balkans. They are carefully observing the behavior and position of every state in the region regarding the crisis. From this point of view we really are the object of increased attention. They assess our position very highly and do not hide this. I think that Bulgaria's principled position will have an important role in resolving the conflict. [Andonova] Why is NATO more concerned than us with the Yugocrisis? [Petrov] I have the feeling that people in our country think that foreign structures and factors will resolve the problem. The absence of an immediate threat prompts us to assume a calm posture, and this situation could play a bad joke on us at some given moment. [Andonova] Our integration in the international security structures could be a gradual process. Do you think that from this point of view the Partnership for Peace initiative has a serious role? [Petrov] The new partners must participate in the initiative in such a way that it could justify the very existence of the initiative. One cannot speak about integration through the initiative, but it will strengthen East-West confidence to a large degree. The Partnership for Peace has a certain aspect, which justifiably causes concern among our public and other countries that have signed the framework document. We all want guarantees of our security, but the Partnership for Peace initiative does not provide such guarantees. Both the framework document and the invitation to participate point out that no guarantees are assumed. They envisage political consultations under NATO leadership when security is threatened, but this is no guarantee. [Andonova] Our country must prepare a document on our participation in the initiative. Are you informed about the preparation of this document? [Petrov] A supradepartmental commission has been established. Representatives of the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Finance are on it. The General Staff also has a basic role in preparing the national program. We must prepare a realistic and feasible program, even though our financial means are very limited. As you know, all expenditure on joint enterprises must be financed by the partners. The framework document allows every state to determine alone the degree of its participation. The commission is working hard and in the near future it will propose a draft to be submitted to the Council of Ministers and then parliament. Only then could we talk about real participation. [Andonova] What does the draft contain more specifically ? [Petrov] Naturally, certain enterprises could be eliminated from and others included in the draft. It envisages the participation of our military representatives in NATO's Coordinating Center in Mons -- most probably three Bulgarian officers. We discussed this with the supreme commander of NATO Allied Forces, General Dowland [title as published]. They even expressed their considerations on the qualifications of our officers. We will also have representatives at NATO Headquarters -- probably politicians or representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense. On the basis of the national program our military and political representatives will make proposals and coordinate our participation in NATO. In addition to forums and consultations joint training is also envisaged. Since participation in such enterprises is rather expensive, at this stage we will restrict ourselves to minimal formations. We will begin at a lower level and gradually increase the scope of our participation. Actually, it is to early to reveal the entire draft program. [Andonova] Is there good coordination between the General Staff, the Defense Ministry, and the military office of the president in deciding on participation in joint initiatives? [Petrov] The Ministry of Defense has made a special decision to instruct the defense minister to coordinate this activity and propose a final draft. [Andonova] My next question is "personal": Are there serious differences among the leading figures regarding our behavior toward NATO? [Petrov] As far as a new element in our relations with NATO is involved -- the beginning of partnership -- it is normal to have differences regarding our participation in this initiative. One should not make any tragedy out of this. The moment the program is adopted it becomes a national program and thus obligatory for all the institutions involved. I cannot commit myself to assessing the various positions, but if everything is determined without comparing different positions we could not speak about democracy. [Andonova] Are we left with any choice after joining the international security system, for example, outside the Partnership for Peace initiative? [Petrov] So far we have achieved a lot on the bilateral foundation for strengthening confidence with NATO -- with all states, including European states outside NATO. The Partnership for Peace initiative allows for cooperation on multilateral foundation and expands the scope of activities without restricting bilateral contacts. [Andonova] With which NATO members will we have the most active contacts? [Petrov] We will continue to develop our relations with our neighbors Greece and Turkey very actively, and also with Belgium. It is with Belgium of all the other Western European states that we have the best mutual relations and close cooperation. Confidence between us is at the highest level. One of our officers worked for three months on the General Staff of the Belgian Army. We have become acquainted at very close range with their military structures and the organization of their work. We have much in common in anything related to the number of population and the size of the army. We also have similar problems in implementing the reform -- the Belgians are advancing toward a professional army. For the time being only the United States, the UK, and Luxembourg have such armies. All other countries only claim that they will advance toward this. Belgium is the first to make serious steps toward this and its experience will be very useful to us. [Andonova] You also were received by NATO's political leadership, visited SHAPE -- NATO's supreme headquarters in Europe -- and met with the chief of the Belgian General Staff. What were the most important elements of your visit? [Petrov] You see what the level of the meetings was -- there was not a single secondary or unimportant talk. At joint briefings at the headquarters and the Supreme Command we were briefed in detail about NATO's structure and tasks under the new international conditions, and on the envisaged cooperation with the new partners. We briefed them on the progress of the reform in the Bulgarian Army. Actually, they are well informed about our military doctrine. We were flattered by the exceptionally positive reaction of specialists of the highest rank regarding the context of our military doctrine and its European spirit. In SHAPE in Mons we discussed with General Dowland and top officers future cooperation in the military sphere and within the Partnership for Peace initiative. The supreme commander himself showed us the building in which our officers will work. The offices, halls, and so forth are ready. Generally, I saw real soldiers and real professionals at NATO Headquarters. My last meeting was with my Belgian colleague, General Charlier. We visited a mechanized brigade and were briefed on details related to its transition toward professionalism. We saw the training of pilots at air force bases. We also viewed the training of a "blue helmets" unit that will be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Andonova] Were you informed about NATO's intentions regarding Macedonia? [Petrov] We asked both at NATO's headquarters and in Mons what additional steps they envisage regarding former Yugoslavia. The answer was -- "what the politicians decide." As all military everywhere, they will carry out any orders that they receive. We are no different -- we too implement political decisions. In this respect I see absolutely no difference in our positions. [Andonova] Do Bulgarian politicians have a correct attitude toward you? [Petrov] I do not want to evaluate them. I have only one wish -- that they really are more precise in working out their decisions.
