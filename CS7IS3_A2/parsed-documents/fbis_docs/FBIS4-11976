The first of these deals with the Christian representation [in state institutions]. He stressed that there is such representation, as reflected in the presence of the Franjiyah, Mu'awwad, and Buwayz families. No one can dispute their patriotism and nationalism, he stressed. As for the Christian figures living abroad, Minister 'Ubayd said that Raymond Iddih himself chose to leave and so did General Michel 'Awn and former President al-Jumayyil. Gen. 'Awn can return at any time but must do so in accordance with the law, 'Ubayd added. Concerning the third issue, Minister 'Ubayd said: I am against a Muslim state or a Christian state.
