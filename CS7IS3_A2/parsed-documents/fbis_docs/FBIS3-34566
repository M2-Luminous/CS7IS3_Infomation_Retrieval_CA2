In giving Hizballah freedom of action in southern Lebanon, al-Asad wants to have a card to play in the negotiations. Lubrani said President al-Asad wants to make us pay to end this threat. Lubrani warned that Israel will continue to strike on all occasions and with all means against Hizballah and other terrorist organizations. He indicated that any suspension of the talks with Syria and Lebanon would ultimately serve Hizballah.
