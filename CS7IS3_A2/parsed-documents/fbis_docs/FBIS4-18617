In this connection it is often ignored that important steps have already been taken to improve Germany's financial situation toward the EC. Most recently, during the membership negotiations for Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, I advocated Germany's financial interests without endangering the fair balance with the would-be members. I expressly welcome the enlargement of the European Union [EU] by the four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states. These countries are an enrichment for the EC both in political and economic terms. The membership negotiations were successful for Germany also from the financial viewpoint: Three of the four would-be members are net payers of EC cash. With them we also gain important support for our efforts to implement the principles of thrift and strict budget discipline at the European level. Thus, already during the membership negotiations demands by other member states for internal EC compensation were successfully rejected. We have achieved an important success in the negotiations on the new decision about the EC's own resources, which are the financial basis of the EC. According to this decision, in the future the EU Commission will explain which resources go to which member states. This will clarify the distribution effect of the EC budget. This newly created clarity was an indispensable condition for my basic agreement to this decision. On the one hand, this creates absolute clarity about the use of the tax money that is available to the EC. On the other hand, it shows potential distortions in payments, demonstrating the need to implement corrections. At the negotiations about the EC's financial framework for 1993 to 1999 we considerably restricted the original ideas of the EC Commission and of other member states. The suggested expansion of the EC's financial resources was postponed by two years; only 35 percent of the demanded increase in the EC's financial resources were approved. On the basis of the final year of 1999, this means that about 15 billion German marks will be saved. As a result of the European Council meeting in Edinburgh in 1992, after long and difficult negotiations the Council of Ministers came to a decision on 21 March 1994, which establishes an upper limit for more than half of the EC budget expenditures -- expenditures for agriculture -- for the next few years. Strict budget discipline for the EC budget must be applied to all spheres of expenditures. During the second half of 1994, when Germany holds the presidency, I will continue to emphatically insist on strict thrift. To halt the flood of programs from Brussels, strict yardsticks of whether or not something can be rejected will be applied when new programs are presented or existing EC programs are to be continued. The Federal Government examines every proposal very thoroughly as to whether the EC should decide, implement, and finance certain measures at all from the viewpoint of subsidiarity. When the people in Germany are expected to accept some cuts because of the budget consolidation in the federal government, the laender, and the communities, achievements that one has grown fond of must also be examined at the EC level. There must not and will not be any taboos at the European level. Enforcing strict budget discipline in the circle of our EU partners will not be simple. However, there is no realistic alternative to that. Our efforts to improve Germany's financial situation toward the EC cannot be exhausted just by saving. It is necessary to try out all possibilities that can lastingly improve our position. In particular, we will implement our financial interest in increased returns in connection with formulating expenditures if they cannot be avoided at the EC level because of their contents and scope and with distributing the means. Thus, for instance, we will insist on considerable EC participation in the current negotiations about the financing of trans-European networks in Germany. The FRG will not call into question the EU decisions that were made, for instance, by the heads of state and government at the European Council meeting in Edinburgh in December 1992. We are and remain a politically credible, predictable, and reliable partner. Regardless of that, I will continue to work consistently toward achieving a gradual improvement of our financial situation in the EU in all fields of policy that are important for financing. The financial aspect is only a partial aspect of integration. To fully assess the matter one must take into consideration the political and economic advantages that all member states derive equally from their membership in the EU. I share the view that was expressed by the German Bundesbank in its monthly report of November 1993. The advantages of a large unified market have a positive effect on the prosperity of all those who participate in the EU market and form the basis for the competitiveness of European companies on the world market. European integration is the guarantor for peace in Europe and stability in the world. Unfortunately, in the Balkans one can still see every day how brittle peace is in view of crumbling structures and the resulting reemergence of nationalism.
