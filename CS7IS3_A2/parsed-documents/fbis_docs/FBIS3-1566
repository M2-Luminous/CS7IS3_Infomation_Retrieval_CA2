During the meeting, Li Peng solicited their views on how to improve the comprehensive management of public security and build an environment in which people can live and work in contentment -- issues that are to be discussed in the government work report (draft for soliciting comments) that he will soon present to the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress for deliberation. When the meeting began, Li Peng said: Public security is an issue of public concern. We all want a stable environment in which to work and live. While we have achieved certain successes in this regard, there are still areas with which people are not satisfied. I hope that you will say anything that you wanted to say with regard to improving the comprehensive management of public security and building a better democratic and legal system. Those attending the meeting actively presented their views and suggestions about the actual state of public security. [passage omitted] They said: The problems that affect the comprehensive management of public security today are theft, highway and train robberies, a lack of order in certain urban districts, and troubles caused by ruffians and other evil forces. This being the case, party and government departments' attention and support are essential for the better comprehensive management of public security, and they must take up the responsibility of ensuring local peace by following through on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic thought that firm efforts must be made to promote material construction and socialist ethics at the same time, by providing stronger leadership over the comprehensive management of public security, by firmly cracking down on crimes that jeopardize people's lives and property as well as the modernization drive, and by waging deep-going struggles against what is socially vile. Li Peng thanked them for their opinions, which were needed for the revision of the government work report. He also indicated that he would improve and replenish the report in accordance with their views and suggestions. Li Peng said: Improving the comprehensive management of public security and safeguarding public stability is an important task of the CPC and the government this year. Not only is this the demand of the people, but it is also a responsibility that party and government departments -- and especially political and legal affairs departments -- must not evade. Party and government departments must consider this task a routine assignment. He pointed out: The most essential requirement for accomplishing this assignment is to integrate the handling of special projects with the mass line. This is to say that we must fully arouse the initiatives of the masses, all social sectors, and relevant departments, and must broadly mobilize and organize the masses to take an active part in the comprehensive management of public security, giving full scope to the roles of all departments in maintaining social stability so that the problem can be solved with combined efforts. Comprehensive management cannot be effective unless the strength of all quarters has been rallied. Li Peng stressed: While managing public security comprehensively, we must pay special attention to properly handling all types of contradictions among the people during the new period. We must be good at mediating disputes, alleviating contradictions, dissolving negative factors, and nip in the bud all problems affecting public security. Meanwhile, people's governments must always keep in mind the need to serve the people wholeheartedly; give top priority to hearing the people's voices, showing concern for their interests, and solving their plight; and serve the people with more good and practical services so that there will be closer flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the government on the one hand and the people on the other, and so that our work can win the masses' support. Li Peng said: To do an even better job in carrying out the comprehensive management of public security, governments at all levels must improve their analysis of the state of public security, give priority to preventing and cracking down on special crimes at the same time, and deal with the root causes as well as the symptoms. [passage omitted] Among those present at the meeting were Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and chairman of the Central Committee for the Comprehensive Management of Public Security; and Luo Gan, State Councillor and vice chairman of the Central Committee for the Comprehensive Management of Public Security.
