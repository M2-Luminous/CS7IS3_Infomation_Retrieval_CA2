FBIS4-138 "drafr064_a_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Zaire Opposition Majority Endorses Constitutional Act Opposition Majority Endorses Constitutional Act AB0204174394 Paris AFP in French 0746 GMT 2 Apr 94 AB0204174394 Paris AFP French BFN [Text] Kinshasa, 2 Apr (AFP) -- The majority party in the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] on 1 April officially endorsed the new Transitional Constitutional Act, which was adopted on 30 March by the High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT]. The act is being contested by the USOR's hardliners. In a press communique, the Union for the Republic and Democracy [URD], which contains most of the USOR's major political parties, with the exception of Etienne Tshisekedi's party, said it has noted that "from a legal standpoint, both Article 76 and the Transitional Constitutional Act were correctly adopted by the HCR-PT plenary session, which wsa officially held in line with the normal procedure." The Article 76 being referred to here deals with the provisions for appointing a prime minister. It does not make any allusion or reference to former Premier Etienne Tshisekedi or to the Sovereign National Conference, which had appointed him to that post. The drafting of the article led to the departure of most of the USOR hardliners from the HCR-PT. The USOR hardliners maintain that Tshisekedi is Zaire's "legal prime minister." The URD communique was initialed by key figures from the main opposition parties, notably Gerard Kamanda of the Nationalist Common Front, Edouard Mambu of the Union of Independent Democrats, and Raphael Mwanba of the Social Christian Democratic Party, which, with the exclusion of Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress, form the backbone of the Sacred Union. It was also signed by Pierre Lumbi, a representative from the civil society (peasant solidarity) and foreign minister in Tshisekedi's government.
