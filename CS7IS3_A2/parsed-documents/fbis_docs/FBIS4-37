(Jerusalem AL-NAHAR 7 Mar 94) Real Estate Investments in Gaza on Hold Gazan real estate investors are reportedly refraining from undertaking projects in the Gaza Strip due to the climate of instability and uncertainty there. Usamah al-Khudayri, the head of Al-Khudayri Engineering and Contracting Company in Gaza, expressed his fears about investing in real estate construction in Gaza at this time, and said that he has decided to forego employing many workers at his company because he has had to stop some projects as a result of current conditions. Investor Mahmud Saf iyah backed out of a project to construct 20 housing units because Gazans declined to put deposits on the apartments, hoping for better prices and payment terms from the new Palestinian authority. In the recent past, the Israeli Government put up at least $100,000 in capital for each housing project that investors undertook in Gaza. A study prepared by Jamil Hararah, head of the Center for Investment in Gaza, concludes that future investment in Gaza should focus on industry, real estate, tourism, agriculture, and services.
