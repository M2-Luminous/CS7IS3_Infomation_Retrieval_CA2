The representatives of various minority groups in Turkey were the guests of a group of Belgian members of parliament of various political parties. Following strong condemnation from the Turkish Government and in addition to calls for support for the oppressed Kurds, satisfaction was expressed at the way in which the Belgian Government -- and especially Interior Minister Louis Tobback -- had reacted to the clashes between Kurds and Turks last weekend in Saint-Josse and Schaerbeek [Brussels]. A spokesman for the marchers called upon the European countries -- especially France and Germany -- to stop supplying Turkey with arms and to exert international diplomatic pressure for a truce between the Kurdish opposition and the Turkish Government so that a solution may be sought through political and democratic channels to the Kurds' right to self-determination. VU [People's Union] Senator Nelly Maes said that, according to confidential information that she obtained from Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia are the main customers for Belgian manufacturers of light weapons. Her colleague, Willy Kuijpers, asked for the withdrawal of the 42 licenses granted by various countries to Turkish arms manufacturers and which make it -- after American Lockheed -- the world's largest arms producer. Deputy Hugo Van Dienderen of AGALEV [Flemish ecologists] would like to know which countries have been supplied with the weapons produced by Belgium to the value of 5 billion Belgian francs. Agitator Kuijpers called upon the Turkish Embassy in Belgium to remove from the streets the man codenamed "Osman," a member of the secret service whom he openly charged with being one of the agitators involved in the New Year clashes in Saint-Josse. Senator Sleeckx of the SP [Flemish Socialist Party] even repeated charges of human rights violations observed during last year's visit by a parliamentary delegation to southeastern Turkey. He expressed his full support for minister Tobback and his interpretation of Saturday's events. Senator Hugo Van Rompaey of the CVP [Christian People's Party] was of the same opinion and also hinted that former Turkish President Turgut Ozal may not have met with a natural death due to having showed signs of readiness to grant the Kurds a place to live of their own. He also stated that he, too, would resort to arms if his people were treated as the Kurds are treated. "The PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] people are guerrillas not terrorists," he stated, while not advocating violence. He stressed the need for a solution to the Kurdish problem through dialogue. Dr. Ismet, a lawyer and former senior lecturer at the Sorbonne, who has supported the cause of the Kurds for the last 25 years, pleaded for the Kurds' right to self-determination, even within the existing Turkish state system. He wondered whether the federal states in the five countries where Kurds now live could not achieve cross-border cooperation and referred to Europe where the borders between countries are now disappearing and to the federal structure of Belgium and Switzerland. He urged those present "not to fall into the trap of Turkish propaganda" and said that the PKK members were not terrorists but "a well-organized resistance," who were themselves calling for an arms truce.
