The entire Cambodian nation and people, including the people in Phnom Penh and in rural areas and abroad, are very tired of the longer than two-decade war. The Cambodian nation and people do not want war. They yearn for peace and want all Cambodian parties to reconcile, in genuine national unity and peace so that every Cambodian has a chance to live normally. His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk thought about the roundtable meeting and the meeting of the roundtable commission to reconcile the nation and for peace. This represents his lofty desire to see all sides hold successive meetings, and to show increased mutual understanding until full national reconciliation and national concord are achieved. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] as a nationalist force has fought with the entire Cambodian nation and people for the survival of the Cambodian nation, people, and race for over 15 years. It does not want to seek or seize power and is not greedy. As the victim, the PDK, like the Cambodian nation and people, want to quickly end the war and reconcile the nation. It wants to rally all national forces so that the Cambodian motherland has peace and national union again with independence and territorial integrity. II. Now, in the past and future, the PDK has been happy to have a cease-fire. The PDK does not want war and fighting. We only want the war to end quickly and to achieve national reconciliation and peace quickly. The PDK holds that the cease-fire should be within the framework of a solution to achieve genuine national reconciliation and peace. Therefore, it is necessary to have a permanent cease-fire that is effective nationwide, with proper and adequate control by a commission or technical group to be set up to deal with this issue. We believe it is imperative to avoid using the cease-fire as a trick to cheat one another and the local and foreign public in order to continue fighting. In this case, it would not be a genuine cease-fire and fighting would continue. This would be against the will and aspiration of our nation and people who want to restore genuine national reconciliation and peace. The Cambodian situation is very complex with the issues of war and national and social problems. Problems related to the war in Cambodia for over two decades have not been created by Cambodians and are not problems among Cambodians. These problems have been created by direct foreign interference and aggression. Fueling the war does not respond to the interest of the Cambodian nation and people. People are aware of the great suffering and destruction of the country during the over 20-year-long war. Continuing the war only serves the interest of foreigners whose aim and strategy are to annex Cambodia and place it in their orbit. This is particularly true for the communist Vietnamese who want the war in Cambodia to continue. They have pushed Cambodians into fighting and killing nationalist Cambodians so that communist Vietnam has a chance to bring in Vietnamese nationals to annex Cambodia. With this aim and strategy in mind, foreigners do not want national reconciliation, national union, and peace in Cambodia. They only want to fuel the war so that they have a pretext and a chance to interfere in Cambodia in every way. Therefore, the cease-fire is not in the hands of Cambodians. The fact is that the cease-fire is an old issue the communist Vietnamese had raised a long time ago. It is one of three conditions raised by the communist Vietnamese to eliminate the PDK and the Cambodian people's resistance forces. People are aware of this. It should be recalled that the three conditions were: 1. Getting Democratic Kampuchea to implement a cease-fire; 2. Getting Democratic Kampuchea to hand over all its zones to the former State of Cambodia of the communist Vietnamese, and now to the two-headed government; and 3. Getting Democratic Kampuchea to demobilize all its troops. III. Despite all this, the PDK holds that as long as Cambodians strive to meet, talk, compromise, and make mutual concessions, we will eventually and gradually solve all these problems and move toward national reconciliation. Talking about the cease-fire and national reconciliation without concrete evidence is like the present situation following the election of UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]. People are aware of how bitter this has been. This is the issue we have to discuss, now and in the future, until full national reconciliation and peace are achieved. The entire Cambodian nation and people are waiting to see a genuine cease-fire that is vital to them. [Dated] 15 June 1994
