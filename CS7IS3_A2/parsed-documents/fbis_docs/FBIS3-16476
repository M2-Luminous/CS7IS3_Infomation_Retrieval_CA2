The official report about the meeting says the two exchanged views on the talks process, Russia's initiatives, and the conditions for achieving a political settlement in the former Yugoslavia. It was stressed that one of the main conditions is that equal account be taken of the national and state interests of the sides drawn into the conflict and that mediation by international representatives be impartial. Churkin also met Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. The sides described the meeting as "a continuation of working contacts with a high level of mutual understanding." Karadzic expressed his satisfaction with the fact that when the issue of a Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia was being discussed, the Russian side had made it quite clear that the Bosnian Serbs have the same sovereign rights as the Muslims and Croats. For the Bosnian Serbs, close relations with Yugoslavia are crucial, so we have to look for a way towards a settlement that takes account of this interest, Karadzic said. Churkin left Belgrade today. He said he was going to Washington to hold consultations about the Yugoslav problem with the U.S. President's special representative Charles Redman.
