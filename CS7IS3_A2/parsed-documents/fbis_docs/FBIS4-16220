The press were informed that yesterday consultations were held behind closed doors between Admiral Feliks Gromov and Russian Special Envoy Yuriy Dubinin on the one hand and Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk on the other. Judging from the fact that those involved in the consultations did not wish to see the press any nearer than a bullet shot away, no particular progress was achieved. In an exclusive interview for the Today program, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Anatoliy Zlenko, added that: [Begin Zlenko recording] Everything that is going on around the Black Sea Fleet is not controlled -- we have just been convinced of this on the basis of the event that took place in Odessa. I think that if we are able to find a solution to the Black Sea Fleet problem in the near future, we need to find a solution for the Black Sea Fleet on the basis of mutual interests and not approach a solution in a unilateral manner.
