The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) must check all chemicals exiting or entering the country, a switch from the old system that only required inspection from the Customs General Administration. NEPA, along with Customs and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) issued the regulations yesterday. It takes effect on May 1. The regulations were drafted in response to a UN call to stamp out unauthorized transfers of toxic chemicals worldwide. And they are also aimed at protecting the national environment and the people's health, said Li Hengyuan, deputy division chief in charge of solid wastes and chemicals in NEPA. Li said that chemicals play a key role in economic development and improving people's living standards, but some cause pollution and major health problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that about 60 to 90 percent of the known cancer cases are caused by chemicals. Li said China has experienced rapid development in chemical production over the past few years which are widely applied in many fields. Add to this a large number of pesticides imported for agricultural production. Customs in Shanghai and Guangzhou alone saw imports of 6 billion yuan (about $700 million) in chemicals in 1993. Nepa has received numerous reports of chemical accidents in recent years, Li said.
