Now if something were to happen, the combined megatonnage of the two superpowers would merely slaughter fish and, perhaps, a couple of unfortunate fishermen. This, of course, is a large step forward compared to Cold War times when, at the beginning of the eighties, on both sides of the ocean fingers were literally quivering over the launch buttons. The re-aiming of the strategic missiles was possibly the last in a long list of peaceful initiatives of Gorbachev, Reagan, and Bush, which made the beginning of the nineties quite different from the beginning of the eighties. In this case, the initiative came from the American military. The Pentagon was concerned about reductions of staff and combat readiness in the Russian Army, about which there were many reports last year, and also the general crisis in our country, as a result of which, as they think there, there was a greater probability of unsanctioned or accidental launching of missiles. The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs was happy to support the new peace initiative, and the Ministry of Defense and General Staff had no objections. The agreement was signed, but neither in the United States nor in Russia was there any possibility of monitoring compliance. All questions of controlling strategic nuclear forces (SYaS) are a carefully kept state secret. Nothing is known specifically--all one can do is guess. But one can assume with a certain amount of confidence that the Russian (Soviet) missiles were not aimed anywhere in particular anyway. There are various possible versions of their application and, correspondingly, a set of flight assignments. The order to launch and, correspondingly, the number of the flight assignment come from Moscow at the same time, and the team on duty in the underground command point in a standard situation does not participate in the launch at all. It merely echoes the commands from Moscow in the event of a possible failure of the electronic system, but itself can launch nothing without an order from Moscow granting permission. When a year and a half ago President Yeltsin spoke about the fact that our missiles were not aimed at the cities of England and the United States, he undoubtedly spoke the truth, although in the West they did not really understand this ("Where are they aimed, then?!") Probably for the Americans aiming the missiles in a different direction really could serve as an additional safeguard against an accidental nuclear war. But since the majority of Americans, particularly the military--patriots of their homeland--are firmly convinced that the American way of solving any problem is the best, they are thus convinced that our equal triad of strategic nuclear forces is more or less a copy of their triad. Which in reality is far from the case. Frequently, fundamentally different technical and military-political solutions were used in the Soviet Union. The most reliable thing would probably be for our presidents to simply take and exchange nuclear buttons, and thus put an end to the threat of nuclear war once and for all. Incidentally, the already mentioned differences in the organization of strategic nuclear forces could make sure that this exchange would not be altogether equivalent, either. It has long been known that what is good for the Russian is good for the German (or, say, the American).... Or, as Sir Kipling wrote: "East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet."
