This action has resulted in the crippling of operations at the light and power company. The workers are asking for an 80-percent salary increase in the first year, and 85 percent in the second. However, management says it can only offer 40 percent in year one and 25 percent in year two. Janice Budd says as a result of this strike action, more than 40 percent of the country is without electricity and managers are manning operations. [Begin recording] [Budd] The JPSCO workers gave the minister of public utilities one last chance to respond to their demands, but when he finally did, the workers were not happy. They stuck to their promise and walked off the job. At the Hunt's Bay plant, the center of the JPS cooperation, more than 150 workers picketed the gate. They say they supply approximately half the island's power supply and management cannot keep the plant going indefinitely. Workers at all the other JPSCO offices were in solidarity with their colleagues at Hunt's Bay. They closed their office doors and took to the streets with their placards. The workers have several grouses. They want the establishment of overtime allowances, a pilot daycare facility, transportation home in emergency situations, among other things. [Unidentified striking employee] [passage indistinct] Who they care about? [Words indistinct] Consumer? More than they care about the employee. [passage indistinct] The consumer product [words indistinct]. They do not think about that. [Budd] They say the minister's claim that the company cannot offer more money is a lie. They say no company that says it has $900 million in the bank can claim inability to pay, especially if it has a monopoly on the commodity. [Unidentified employee] We believe that there are ways open to the company to pay this amount. There are a number of ways. We believe that if the company and their principals, the government, considered the situation seriously enough, there is a possibility that an improved offer could be made. [passage indistinct] [Budd] The workers say they will continue their strike until the company's management accept their [word indistinct]. Management is running the B-6 and GT-10 units at Hunts Bay and keeping emergency units going island-wide until the whole issue is resolved, whenever that may be. Until then, the island will no doubt feel the effects of their actions. [end recording] Meanwhile, workers at the Trinidad and Tobago Electric Company sat and looked at the customers what come in for service yesterday morning. By yesterday afternoon, the commission was warning that workers who refused to perform could be shocked into action. The commission was, however, not prepared to say precisely the type of shock action it is likely to administer. Yesterday's protest is part of a campaign to persuade the government against privatization of the utility. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] [Word indistinct] customers found themselves caught in the middle of rapidly growing objecton to privatization of the commission on the part of workers. While [word indistinct] workers sat at their desks as usual, they reportedly did little else, refusing to attend to customers who eventually trickled out of the Customer Service Department, frustrated. Reports are that action taken by the workers forced the closure of the South office. Officals of the [word indistinct] branch of the OWTU [expansion unknown] denied reports that workers forced customers out of the building. [Unidentified OWTU spokesman] [passage indistinct] Okay? We will take care of ourselves to [words indistinct] because the people upstairs have a pension, too. [Reporter] Workers are continuing protests against privatization which they say will deprive them of their pensions. They estimate the pension figure to be $540 million. They have [words indistinct] far more sinister implicatons of the move toward privatization. [OWTU spokesman] [passage indistinct] The minute they stop the pension, it means they stop the permanency, too. Up to now, we do not know what is going on with the pension which everybody is relying on. [Words indistinct] something like 90 percent of the workers depend on that. We have people out there with bills to pay and this is what they depend on when they reach the age of 60; they are able to relax themself and get something and help their children or whatever. [Reporter] The workers see this as the return of the white devil of colonial days returning labor to slavery. The scene today was characterized by empty offices and tight security. Service vehicles remained on the compound and the workers wore red, carrying red flags, and milling about at the front of the building. [Word indistinct] officials have confirmed this morning's incident adding that hundred of persons were affected by action taken by workers. They add that they have communicated to workers that their actions are illegal and that the commission will penalize workers if it is not halted by Thursday. [Word indistinct] officials say they have assured employees that the pensions will not be affected, but that they are dissatisfied with the assurance. Workers in Port-of-Spain say they intend to march at headquarters tomorrow. [end recording] In related news, Barbados' largest public sector union, the National Union of Public Workers [NUPW], says it has been experiencing problems and more problems in recent times. Andrew Lowe takes a look at some of these problems. [Begin recording] [Lowe] The Achilles' heel of the NUPW seems to be its inability to raise a quorum at important meetings. Just two Saturdays ago, the union called its annual general meeting which failed to come off because of that "q" word. This appears to be a major problem for the union for some time now. Commenting on the situation, President Morris said that even pressure issues did not seem to attract a crowd. [Morris] I think it is generally speaking, in my view, two reasons: one has to do with a general malaise by individuals about the running of the organizations where they leave the decisions to the leadership. Secondly, from where I sit, I believe that our organization needs to move to a delegates' conference. [Lowe] Speaking of the time of the failed [word indistinct], Mr. Morris said that a new system should be put in place to prevent the problem. He said a system in which different workers' groups are represented by one or two delegates is a system being considered. [Morris] In my view, those people who they be selected by their departments -- and this is where the delegate system comes in -- where they will be seeking to have elections in the various departments for delegates on a proportional basis to be sent to represent the interests, and therefore, what can happen is conceivably the union can have 500 or 600 delegates and a quorum of those will be some amount, but I believe that that will ensure a lot more. [Lowe] But finding a quorum is not the only [word indistinct] situation the union has been faced with recently. Try electing a new executive for good measure. The union tried that last Wednesday. The result? Chaos. Election officials discovered ballot tampering with a number of votes for the presidency. The election was eventually declared null and void following a heated meeting Saturday. The war of words spilled over from the meeting. [end recording]
