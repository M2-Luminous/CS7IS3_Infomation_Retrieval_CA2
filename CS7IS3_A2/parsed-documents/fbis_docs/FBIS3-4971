This news conference is scheduled to last for approximately 20 minutes. Mr. Prime Minister, you have decided to put off a reshuffle of your cabinet. Mr. Prime Minister, I would ask you why you have decided to put off a reshuffle of your cabinet. Mr. Prime Minister, you have stated that your government will shift from a government for political reform to a government for economic reform and that you will work with this shift in mind. Mr. Prime Minister, you have had difficulty handling the issue of replacing the chief cabinet secretary. How are you going to deal with these issues? [Hosokawa] I have caused the people great worries. Yesterday and today, I met with leaders of the ruling coalition parties to ask them about their respective intraparty situation and their views on the cabinet reshuffle. As you just said, I have worked on political reform as a major item on my domestic policy agenda for the past seven months since my government was inaugurated last August. During that period, I have worked to deal with the Uruguay Round and with a package of economic stimulus measures and with the Japanese-U.S. framework talks. I think that all of these have been major policy tasks for me. Although the legislation for political reform has yet to be completed, I think that in general, my government has completed its first phase. From this point forward, my government will enter its second phase. I think that during the first phase, my government pushed for political reform. In the second phase, my government will deal with Japanese-U.S. economic frictions and will work on deregulation, which I believe is related to Japanese-U.S. relations. Because of different tasks, the nature of the government needs to be changed. In this context, I think now is the time for a cabinet reshuffle. I officially mentioned the issue of reshuffling my cabinet yesterday for the first time. The issue of reshuffling my cabinet has been reported. I yesterday met with leaders of the ruling coalition parties to ask their views on a cabinet reshuffle for the first time. I met with them yesterday and today to ask their views. I have realized through a series of meetings with the leaders of the ruling coalition parties that I should not do what might cause a rift within the coalition government. Other leaders of the ruling coalition parties said that it is not good to give the impression that I am trying to oust a specific cabinet member. In short, many leaders of the ruling coalition parties expressed their opinion that the most important thing is to hold the coalition government together. I and many leaders of the ruling coalition parties have considered the need to make the prime minister's official residence function smoothly. As for the issue of replacing the chief cabinet secretary, who plays the key role in the prime minister's official residence, I have been concerned that the ruling coalition parties have reacted against the chief cabinet secretary's behavior. The chief cabinet secretary has worked hard to support me. There is the opinion that although Mr. Takemura is the head of Sakigake [Harbinger], he should concentrate on his duties as chief cabinet secretary. I said this straightforwardly to Mr. Takemura today and asked him to take this into account. I asked him to concentrate on his duties as chief cabinet secretary. Needless to say, the duties of the chief cabinet secretary are to coordinate views among the ruling coalition parties as well as the opposition parties. I asked Mr. Takemura to concentrate his efforts on coordinating views within the ruling coalition parties on economic issues including Japanese-U.S. economic frictions, which are emerging as a major item on the agenda of my government. In response, Mr. Takemura told me that he fully understood what I asked of him and that he will carry out his duties keeping in mind what I have asked of him. As I said just a while ago, in giving importance to the unity of the ruling parties, I have decided to postpone a cabinet reshuffle. [Reporter] You just said that you have postponed carrying out a cabinet reshuffle at this point, but did you discuss with the leaders of the coalition parties the possibility of reshuffling the cabinet in the future, for example, after the Diet passes the budget bill? [Hosokawa] No, I did not. [Reporter] You mentioned the treatment of the chief cabinet secretary. Does your decision to postpone a cabinet reshuffle mean that you will not remove Mr. Takemura from his post? [Hosokawa] That is correct. [Reporter] It may not be an appropriate expression, but from what you have said, I understand that Mr. Takemura will not resign voluntarily. Is my understanding correct? [Hosokawa] I believe that he will not resign voluntarily. [Reporter] You have planned to establish a new ministerial post in charge of deregulation and to carry out a reorganization of the cabinet to transform it into an economic reform government. Thus, are you considering reshuffling the cabinet around May? [Hosokawa] I am not thinking about doing that so far. However, because, as I said earlier, the government has to deal with issues with a particular emphasis on economic problems, I would like to tackle those issues by taking the initiative. [Reporter] You mentioned that your relations with Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura are not smooth. He is not attending this news conference. Do you think that you will be able to improve relations concerning the operations of the cabinet over the next several months? [Hosokawa] He was originally scheduled to attend this news conference, but I told him that it was better for him not to attend because he was the person to be discussed. I would not mind his attending, but because I thought that he would feel uneasy, I recommended to him that he not attend. He has been supporting me completely, and I have discussed things straightforwardly with him. Because he told me that he would, I believe that Mr. Takemura will continue to support me. [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you said just a while ago that yesterday was when you first made an official proposal concerning a cabinet reshuffle, but half a month ago you did not deny a possible cabinet reshuffle in response to reporters' questions. As a matter of fact, I think that your intention to carry out a cabinet reshuffle invited a political vacuum for more than half a month. The media has reported such a political vacuum, and it can be said that the prime minister's office has not been functioning. What do you think of this? [Hosokawa] What I said a half month ago means that the first task of the political reform-oriented government has been carried out and that the situation now permits me a free hand. I do not think that the prime minister's office has not been functioning. Because the cabinet is composed of the coalition partners, which are precariously balanced, I think it is inevitable that I will undergo a twist-and-turns process in making decisions on political issues -- such as the welfare tax issue. [Reporter] We have heard that Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ozawa has persistently called for Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura to be replaced. Did he consent to your decision when you met with him today, and what did you discuss with him? [Hosokawa] I think that Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa -- I want to refrain from mentioning specific parties -- must have thought that, like the opinions mentioned earlier, it is time for a cabinet reshuffle because one goal called political reform has been achieved, and that it is necessary to consider the fact that relations between the chief cabinet secretary, who is a key person in the cabinet, and the ruling parties are rocky. [Reporter] In view of a series of confusing incidents such as the welfare tax issue and the cabinet reshuffle, there is the opinion that it is impossible for the coalition to run the government, even though the government -- which originally set political reform as its major goal -- plans to shift its emphasis to economic matters following the attainment of political reform. What is your opinion? [Hosokawa] I know that there are various opinions. At the meeting of top leaders of the ruling parties held just a while ago, we confirmed the intention to maintain the unity of the coalition government. [Reporter] What is the reason for maintaining the unity? [Hosokawa] The reason is that it is impossible to carry out the reforms proposed by the government unless the unity of the ruling parties is secured. We all keep this in mind -- although there sometimes is an unpleasant atmosphere within the ruling partners, and things can be awkward in running the government -- and we reconfirmed this at the meeting. [Reporter] In addition to the fate of the chief cabinet secretary, the focus of attention has been on whether Political Reform Minister Yamahana will be appointed a minister plenipotentiary. Are you thinking of giving him a new special post? [Hosokawa] At present, I am not planning to do so, but that may be possible. I would like to study this later. [Reporter] I believe that you planned a cabinet reshuffle to deal with many issues. It is possible that because you abandoned the plan for a reshuffle, your leadership will greatly weaken. As a result, the government may lose its centripetal force, and this would have negative effects on the Hosokawa government, which has to tackle many problems. What do you think about this? [Hosokawa] As you know, it is the prime minister's arbitrary right to reshuffle a cabinet. It is wrong to say that I failed to carry out the plan. Because I think that the unity of the ruling coalition is important, I have decided to postpone a reshuffle. Some may not agree with me, but I do not think I have failed. [Dean of the press corps] We are running out of time. We would like to conclude the news conference with one more question. Are you confident that you can continuously get along well with the chief cabinet secretary, who is opposed to your exercising your right? [Hosokawa] Even under former governments led by the Liberal Democratic Party, cabinet reorganizations were decided after hearing opinions from each faction, not to mention the fact that it is more difficult for the coalition government to carry out a cabinet reshuffle because it is composed of several parties. Although it is the prime minister's arbitrary right, I have to make a final decision on a cabinet reshuffle based on the opinions of each party and on the political situation. I think that this is the right way for the ruling coalition to do this. [Dean of the press corps] Thank you very much.
