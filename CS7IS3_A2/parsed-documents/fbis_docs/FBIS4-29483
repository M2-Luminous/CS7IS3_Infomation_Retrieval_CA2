Responding to reporter's queries, Prasong said Cambodia should continue its attempt to bring back to the community the Khmer Rouge, who refused to participate in 1993 UN-organized election. The Cambodian government has ordered the closure of the Khmer Rouge office in the capital, Phnom Penh, saying that it is uncertain of the guerrillas representative in the city. [sentence as published] "Phnom Penh's order regarding the Khmer Rouge office clearly showed the government's outrage at the Khmer Rouge refusal to cooperate with it. However such closure should not happen, as the two sides are in the process of negotiation," Prasong said. The office, which has only one staff, has seldom been in operation due to conflicts with the government. The government has not yet outlawed the guerrillas. A proposed bill to outlaw the group has been withdrawn temporarily pending the results of talks held last week in Phnom Penh. The talks failed to reach any agreement on a ceasefire, reportedly prompting the Cambodian government to order the closure of the office. "Hope to see immediate and lasting peace in Cambodia has been further diminished as the guerrillas will certainly be angry with the closure of its office," Prasong said.
