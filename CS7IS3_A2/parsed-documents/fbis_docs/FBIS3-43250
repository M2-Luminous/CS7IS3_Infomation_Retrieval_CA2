In a New Year's message received by a SAPA correspondent in Umtata, APLA commander Sabelo Phama said on Friday the bullet and the ballot were to be used effectively in 1994. Mr Phama said his organisation was concerned about decisions pertaining to security forces at the World Trade Centre. He said political power without military and economic power was empty and APLA should double its efforts both politically and on the military front. The statement made no mention of the attack on a Cape Town pub around midnight on Thursday which killed four people and injured others. A caller purporting to represent APLA claimed in a telephone conversation with SAPA his organisation, the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress, was responsible for the attack.
