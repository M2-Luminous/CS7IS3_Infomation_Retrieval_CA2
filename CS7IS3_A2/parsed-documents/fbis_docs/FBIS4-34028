[Begin recording] [Quintas] Firmly rooted in the glorious era of the vigorous rebellions of slaves, in the land soaked in Mambi and the rebel blood of the immortal army of Gomez and Maceo, Camilo and Che, in the 5 September streets quenched with heroism, in the mountains where we defeated the bandits, and in the glorious sands where imperialism sustained its first great defeat in Latin America, the fighting people of the Central Army work together with you to guarantee, at any cost, the sacred defense of the fatherland. [end recording] This tour through the Central Army was reassuring to those accompanying the FAR minister since it was evident that the Armed Forces is headed in the right direction, and is increasing its ties with the people.
