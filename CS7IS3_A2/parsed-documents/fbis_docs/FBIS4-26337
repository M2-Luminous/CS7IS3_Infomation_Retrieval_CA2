Addressing the closing session of a symposium on the strategy for the development of the provinces and cities in central China, Chen pointed out that the five provinces in central China, namely Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Henan, occupy a decisive position in the country's national economic development. He said that the area produces 27.2 percent of the country's grain, 46 percent of the country's cotton and 35 percent of the country's oil-bearing crops. It is also the country's important base of power and raw materials. The area is a hub of communications in the country and is inhabited by one fourth of the country's population. In 1992, Chen stressed, the area's gross product accounted for merely 18.4 percent of the gross national product, and its foreign trade volume and overseas funds used were all less than five percent of the national total. Therefore, he said, it is urgent to speed up the development of the area. He disclosed that the central government had started to draw up a program on the economic development in the five provinces so as to accelerate the economic development of the whole central and western parts of the country.
