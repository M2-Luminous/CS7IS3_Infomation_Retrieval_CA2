His Recruitment and Long-Time Work May Undoubtedly Be Recognized as Domestic Intelligence Service's Success"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The press bureau of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] would not give official comments on the arrest of Aldrich Hazen Ames. A "no-comment" response in such cases means an indirect recognition of an uncovered agent's cooperation with one secret service or another. An informed intelligence expert, who asked not to be identified, answering your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent's question whether this incident is the FIS' worst setback recently, said: "I would look at the incident from a different side and I would say as follows: The fact that our intelligence service has had such an agent for such a long time is undoubtedly a great success. Undoubtedly, he was worth the great amount of money that was paid to him. The situation should not be dramatized and the scandals should not be blown out of proportion. No one has yet canceled intelligence activity after all. Our agents do in the United States just what theirs do here, nothing more. As a matter of fact, when we catch their spies we do not demand that their diplomats be expelled. It would be most unwelcome if this episode causes tension in Russian-American relations. The United States needs us just as we need them."
