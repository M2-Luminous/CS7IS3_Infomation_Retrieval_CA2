Figueroa B.] [Text] Carlos Felipe Escobar, chairman of the Legislative Assembly Drug Control and Eradication Committee, believes the United States is also responsible for the existing drug problems in Panama, because the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) was approved two years ago, but the U.S. Senate still has not ratified it. Three days ago, Robert Gelbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said Panama has become a "very important" center for the laundering of narcodollars. This prompted the Panamanian Government to prepare a protest note which will be delivered this week to the authorities of President Clinton's administration. "MLAT is shelved, because there are senators who have been unwilling to approve the treaty, which would permit both countries (Panama and the United States) to conduct operations to counter the drug problem," the president of the assembly's drug committee said. For his part, Rodrigo Arosemena, former customs director, has said the Panamanian authorities have countered drug trafficking but if the U.S. authorities do not want to accept this fact, they should offer proof indicating otherwise.
