"This year the production of offshore and inland fish-farming has for the first time outstripped marine-fishery output," said Zhuo Youzhan, Director-General of the Ministry's Department of Fishery. Aquatic output from fresh water and offshore fish-farms has grown steadily over the past decade, Zhuo added, and this year will account for some 52 percent total fishery production. Offshore fish-farm output increased 350,000 tons, a 24.6 percent jump, while freshwater farm output grew 690,000 tons, up 15.7 percent through November. Total aquatic production is expected to reach 17 million tons. Nonetheless, the decline of marine resources hampered further increase in overseas fishing output, with this year's catch expected to total 530,000 tons, up only 9 percent from last year, Zhuo said. He attributed the steady growth of aquatic production to the expansion of fish farms, the improved breeding of fries and fingerlings and the introduction of advanced skills and technologies in the fishery sector. Fresh water fish-farm acreage benefiting from exploitation of low-lying and waterlogged lands has reached 4.2 million hectares in 1993, about 140,000 more than last year. Thanks to an increased demand for more sophisticated species in light of raised living standards, Zhuo predicted that total aquatic production would top 18 million tons in 1994--the target set for 2000. He warned, however, that a chain reaction caused by the skyrocketing price of diesel oil has seriously hindered the development of the seawater catching industry. Many high-power ships have had to stop fishing prompting increasing use of small low-power ships and aggravating the overkill of already dwindling resources in shallower waters. Insuffcient management of frie [as published] and fingerling importation, aquicultural water administration and monitoring of environmental conditions have spread some fish-depleting diseases this year Zhuo said.
