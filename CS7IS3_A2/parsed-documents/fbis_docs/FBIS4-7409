Pak seemed to be attaching a condition to the offer but his remark attracted attention since permitting further checks of its nuclear facilities would be considered a breakthrough in the lengthy impasse related to the North Korean nuclear issue. South Korea recently withdrew the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys as a condition for a third round of high-level U.S.- North Korea talks. North Korea previously maintained that any further inspections should be discussed at a third round of high-level talks with the United States. Pak reiterated Pyongyang's position that the 1953 Armistice Agreement should be replaced by a peace accord between North Korea and the United States.
