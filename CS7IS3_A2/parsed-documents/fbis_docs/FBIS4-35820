[Al-Franji] Good morning. [Buss] Mr. Al-Franji, yesterday, REUTERS ran the following statement, and I quote: Israel has called on PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to tackle effectively the problems of the self-administrated areas Gaza Strip and Jericho. Regarding 'Arafat's complaints about international financial aid, which was promised but has not been provided yet, a spokesman for the Israeli Government reacted with criticism and said that 'Arafat had acted like a beggar instead of taking action. Government spokesman Drori said that it was time for 'Arafat to stop behaving like a beggar and stop whining, and that he should tackle the problems there effectively. End quote. Mr. Al-Franji, apart from the polemical rhetoric, the Israelis seem to be worried. [Al-Franji] I would say that this is not the right way for Israel to deal with 'Arafat. 'Arafat is a partner in the peace process in the region, and 'Arafat has actually done a lot to advance the peace process to the current stage. Of course, the problems left by Israel after 27 years of occupation are enormous. One cannot solve these problems overnight. We have financial problems. The countries that promised to support the Palestinian people insist on certain conditions that cannot be fulfilled so easily. The Israelis, who took a lot of money off the Palestinians in those years, and who committed themselves to pay parts of this money to the Palestinians and to 'Arafat, have not done so. This is why 'Arafat cannot overcome the problems alone. And it is understandable that 'Arafat cannot and will not cope with the problems alone. [Buss] Is there a practical reason for 'Arafat and the PLO leadership not to have moved yet to the now autonomous Palestinian areas? [Al-Franji] One reason is that 'Arafat has been ill for a week. Actually, it is the second time he has been ill. This is the only reason that our move has been delayed. Nevertheless, we have sent some people there, and we have taken over responsibility in the Gaza Strip, and things are working, working not too badly. One has hardly heard of people being injured or killed in this region since we took over. I hope that 'Arafat gets better soon and that he will soon be able to assume his duties. [Buss] Is there anything at all that the PLO leadership might be able to administer or solve better from Tunis than from a base in the autonomous regions? [Al-Franji] Certainly not. Any Palestinians bearing responsibility within the PLO would like to go there right away. However, there are many conditions that are making this difficult. And these conditions are one part of the agreement between us and the Israelis. If I were to react today to the declaration of the Israeli or the Israeli Government Spokesman Drori, then we would thwart this peace process [dann werden wir diesen Prozess des Friedens platzen lassen], which is why we have to deal with one another with patience, with a sense of responsibility, and with understanding. This is what I cannot see on the part of some Israelis. There are other Israelis who, of course, do not talk like that official Israeli spokesman or say such things as he just has. [Buss] Could you elaborate on that? What exactly is it that could thwart the process? [Al-Franji] I do not want to talk about the failure of this process. All I would like to say is that we are now bearing responsibility together, and that we must help one another. It is very difficult. It is not so simple that one could say: Well, the PLO must now rapidly get all the problems under control left by the Israelis after 27 years of occupation. We cannot do that. We must get help from the Israelis and from the Arab world, and help from Europe and the United States. I cannot imagine that the United States, which promised a lot and bears great responsibility for this process, that it will remain so passive toward us. One must not really do that. Peace in this region is not just a matter for the Palestinians and Israelis alone, it is a matter for the international community. And I hope that the other parties will now assume their share in responsibility so that the PLO will be able to get the problems in the occupied territories under control. [Buss] As far as the Israeli heritage, the legacy in Palestine is concerned, people in Israel hold a different view. It has been said, for example, that one even considerably extended the infrastructure in the formerly occupied territories. [Al-Franji] Well, I do not want to discuss what the Israelis did and what they did not do. It was an ugly time, during which we could not see the Israelis as a -- let us say -- liberator, or a helper. We did not act any differently from other peoples that were occupied, for example. We are glad about it. Of course, the transition is very difficult and complicated. The problem is not that the Palestinians and the PLO are unqualified, but simply that we lack the funds. For many years we spent money on the occupied territories, and we -- and not the Israelis -- continued to build up many things during the era of occupation. We built the universities there, we established the committees, the organizations, the trade unions, everything, while the Israelis had laws that prevented us from operating these institutions in the appropriate way. [Buss] Mr. Al-Franji, let us briefly talk about the financial aid. It has been said that you were promised $2.4 billion in aid, money that is badly needed. Who promised how much, and who is now unwilling to pay? [Al-Franji] The United States has promised a lot -- $500 million. The European Community promised $600 million, the World Bank, and many other institutions also promised money. The way in which the donor countries or the countries that wanted to provide the money are dealing with one another is not smooth enough so that one party would say: we now give the Palestinians so much money for the next two or three months or the coming six months to make sure they can work. They also have difficulties and are facing complications, and one can say that there is not a single organization that would be responsible for all the donors that have so far provided money or intend to do so. On the part of the Palestinians, we have not yet nominated all members of the government that is to assume responsibility. However, we hope that we can do that within a week, and we are also hoping that the World Bank will not continue to place its conditions so firmly and difficult on the head of the Palestinians [passage as heard] so that we will be able to take the necessary steps to overcome this difficult situation.
