After many centuries of spiritual political and historical proximity, these relations have revived with the breath of fresh air." This had been stated by RF Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before he started talks with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias here today. The head of the Russian foreign policy department said that he attached great importance to the current meeting, considering the big role Greece is playing in the Balkans and nowadays in Europe as head of the European Union. The talks are centred on the issues concerning bilateral relations and preparations for the visit to Russia of the Greek prime-minister Andreas Papandreou at the end of the year. Regarding foreign policy, the sides intend to discuss the situation in the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans as a whole, as well as the Cypriot and the Near East problems.
