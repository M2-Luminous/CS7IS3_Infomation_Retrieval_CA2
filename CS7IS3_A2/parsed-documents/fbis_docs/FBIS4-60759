"There exists only one state in Yemen, the republic of Yemen (which merged north and south in 1990) and nobody has the right to interfere in its internal affairs," parliament's foreign affairs secretary, Sa'd Mujbir, told AFP. "Libya supports Yemen's unity and is opposed to any secession," he said. Southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid proclaimed an independent state with Aden as its capital on May 21, two weeks after civil war broke out. His northern rival, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, has vowed to crush the "rebellion." Libyan officials had earlier stopped short of denouncing the secession, issuing statements of support for Yemen's unity. Mujbir also warned against any "plan to send troops" from the United Nations to keep the warring sides apart, adding that will "repeat the catastrophes which took place in ex-Yugoslavia and Somalia." The Security Council is due to debate the Yemeni conflict on Tuesday.
