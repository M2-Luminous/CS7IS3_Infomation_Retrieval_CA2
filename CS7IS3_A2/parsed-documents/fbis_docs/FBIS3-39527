Felipe Gonzalez said that Spain will support the process of Hungary's integration into the European Union once the corresponding period of adaptation has passed. Asked about a possible withdrawal of the Spanish blue helmets deployed in the former Yugoslavia if the conflict worsens, Felipe Gonzalez said the Spanish Government will not make a unilateral decision on this, but rather in the context of the commitment agreed with its partners in the European Union. He said, however, that security measures are envisaged and expressed his hope that the situation will improve. [passage omitted] At the news conference on the occasion of the Hungarian president's visit, Prime Minister Gonzalez said he is against sending more reinforcements of blue helmets to the city of Sarajevo, as requested by General Rose. However, he is not opposed to a change of position by the Spanish blue helmets. Here is what he said: [Begin Gonzalez recording] In Bosnia I have to say that the effort for us is at the limit of our possibilities from the human point of view -- you know this well. I have said as much on a number of other occasions. A change in our deployment in the territory can always be studied, if it were useful, but for the time being that is not a question which has been raised. We occupy a place in the territory of great importance from all points of view, but, naturally, we are open to cooperating with the other UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces in whatever is necessary.
