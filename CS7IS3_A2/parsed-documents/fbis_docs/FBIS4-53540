The farmers there who had assiduously made farming preparations from early spring are transplanting rice seedlings on 500 to 600 hectares of fields a day by raising the operation rate of farm machines including tractors, rice-transplanting machines and rice seedling-plucking machines and scrupulously organizing work when the season of rice-transplanting came. The Yomju plain is one of the nation's major paddy rice producers. Agricultural production in the plain called Pura plain before the liberation of the country was insignificant under the Japanese imperialists' colonial predatory policy. After the liberation it has turned into a fertile land reaping bumper crops thanks to the correct agricultural policy of the DPRK Government. The state has invested huge funds to increase agricultural production on the plain. It has built the Kuam, Sorim, Yonggok and Kwangbong reservoirs, more than 200 pumping stations, waterways extending several hundred kilometres and many irrigation setups. The establishment of the Amnok River irrigation system with the Lake Manpung as the main source helped solve completely the water problem on the plain where a proper farming had been impossible for want of water, although it had a fertile arable land. As a result of the completion of irrigation, not a small area of fields and tidal flats have been reclaimed and, now, the area under paddy rice is six times as large as that at the end of 1944, the year before the liberation of the country. In the 1980s, more than 8,800 hectares of tideland have been reclaimed. There are over 20 cooperative farms on the plain. Each cooperative farm has scores of tractors and trucks, various trailing farm machines, rice-transplanting machines, rice seedling-plucking machines and other farm machines and means of transport. Their level of the application of chemicals is high. The amount of application of chemical fertilizers per hectare was more than two tons on the plain last year. Food grain production has annually increased. A gain of more than 12,000 tons was registered last year above the previous year. In the same period, the income share of each farmer increased 12 percent in grain and 28 percent in cash. The production of meat, eggs, fruits and vegetables also has increased markedly. The rural villages, with cosy modern dwelling houses, schools, hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens and welfare and service facilities well arranged against the background of orchards, resemble a fairyland.
