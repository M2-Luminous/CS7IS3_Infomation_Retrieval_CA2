It is not at all going too far to call her a living Bethune because she vividly embodies Norman Bethune's spirit; neither is it going too far to call her a banner in medical circles because what the motherland demands and what the people look forward to are precisely good doctors like her. As a communist party member, she has turned the lofty ideals she is pursuing and the aim of wholehearted service to the people into practical actions of giving quality service to patients. The relationship between a communist party member and the masses should be as completely harmonious as that between her and her patients. As a doctor, she regards the work of healing the wounded and rescuing the dying as her duty. She constantly improves her skills; has an unremitting sense of responsibility in her work; treats her patients enthusiastically, patiently, and cordially; looks at all their angles; takes care of their every need; and tries by every possible means to relieve them of their pain. For this reason, she is highly trusted, loved, and held in high esteem by vast numbers of patients. As a "daughter of the Taihang Shan," she never forgets the people's upbringing and kindness. She never forgets the difficulties caused by the shortage of doctors and medicines in the mountain areas and takes advantage of every opportunity to examine and treat the diseases of the women of the mountain areas. She has devoted her love to the masses of the people. As a section head and secretary of the party branch in a hospital, she takes the lead in setting an example and leads her colleagues in working conscientiously and sternly resisting the corrosion of such unhealthy practices as money worship and egoism in medical circles. She has maintained the pure image of a people's doctor. As a patient who suffers from two types of cancer, she thinks first of patients who suffer from lingering diseases and then of herself. Before undergoing an operation, she made only one request to the party organization: she should be allowed to first perform gynecological and obstetrics operations on patients who had been admitted to the hospital. After undergoing two operations, she tenaciously threw herself into her work again. What she thought about was how to make better use of her limited time to preserve the lives and health of more patients rather than how to preserve her own life. In her medical practice of the past three decades and more, Zhao Xuefang's motto is to devote all her love to the people and not create a fuss. Day after day she works for ordinary peasant sisters without taking remuneration into consideration. Her spirit of absolute selflessness can be rated as a paragon for contemporary medical workers. We should take good care of good comrades like Zhao Xuefang who are respected by colleagues and held in high esteem by patients. This is the wish of the masses as well as the duty of leaders. It should be admitted that, in the current process of replacing the old medical structure with the new, power and benefits have been readjusted and some people have lost their sense of righteousness at the sight of benefits and have sought private interest through medical practice. There are some in the medical ranks who are not concerned about the weal and woe of patients, are irresponsible, and give poor service. They have damaged the image of medical workers in the public's minds. This is a conspicuous issue that should be conscientiously tackled in medical and public health reform. Holding the banner of Zhao Xuefang and learning from the Zhao Xuefang spirit is not only of practical significance to medical circle, but is also needed in the present era of reform. It is hoped that, like Zhao Xuefang, our medical workers will turn their true love for the public into the inflexible pursuit of undertakings, working industriously and wholeheartedly, offering quality services, and making positive contributions to promote the building of two civilizations on the public health front.
