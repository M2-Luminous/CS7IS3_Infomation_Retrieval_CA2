FBIS4-1482 "drafr083_cs94006" FBIS-AFR-94-083-S Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Appeals for Patience Appeals for Patience MB2904140894 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1157 GMT 29 Apr 94 MB2904140894 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg April 29 SAPA -- The counting procedure of votes cast in South Africa's first all inclusive elecion will be time consuming because it needs to be done carefully, Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said on Friday [29 April]. He appealed to the public to be patient as counting would be done meticulously. This time-consuming process, which was also affected by the breakdown of election administration in some areas, would obviously affect the next two phases of the election procedure. "This means, in a nutshell, that you (voters) must be patient," he said. The next two phases are vote counting and announcing the election results, Mr Justice Kriegler said. IEC international Commissioner Brian Gould explained the counting procedure in more detail. Ballot boxes from about 9,000 voting stations will be sent to approximately 700 counting stations. Counting would not start until voting taking place on Friday in six areas was completed. Mr Gould said the second phase of the election process would be the reconciliation of ballots in which counting officers open ballot boxes to balance the number of votes in the box from particular voting stations with the number issued at those stations. "We expect that in some cases the numbers will not balance... we are not running a fast food operation here," he said, adding some problems could not be anticipated. Mr Gould said reconciliation could "be bogged down" and take a day or more if there were many disputed ballots or other problems. After reconciliation, the ballot boxes would be resealed until the actual counting started. Mr Gould added some reconciliation may take place on Friday. During the counting, votes would be placed in piles according to the political party voted for. A separate pile would be made for disputed votes. Counting officials in conjunction with political parties would decide on whether a ballot was disputed. Mr Gould said four counting procedures would take place at the same time. Two for provincial ballots and two for national ones. Counting results would be relayed by fax to the IEC's operations room in central Johanesburg. From there the provisional tallies would be made available to the media at the IEC's nerve centre at Gallagher Estate, Midrand, he said. Mr gould said the first provisional results could be expected around noon on Saturday. He did not want to commit himself to an earlier time as there might be unexpected problems. He said unexperienced staff would count the ballots and might need time to familiarise themselves with the procedure. "We have no idea whatsoever how this will flow," Mr Gould added. Iec International Commissioner Jurgen Elkit said the provisional results would be followed by the "final results phase". At this stage all disputes needed to be resolved. Seat allocation, the last and fastest phase of the election procedure, would allocate seats in the national assembly and the various provincial legislatures. Seat allocation would not be influenced by the number of voters, even if more voters than the IEC expected expected cast their ballot. Respsoneing to a question, J Elkit said he did ot want to compare South African and European elections. "This election is the first democratic election in a huge country". Europe had gradually, over centuries developed "almost perfect" election systems. It would be grossly unfair to make comparisons. Mr Justice Kriegler commented on the elections, saying: "overall an outstanding success; not so much because of IEC administration." He paid tribute to the patient voters who stood in long queues to cast their ballot on Tuesday and Wednesday.
