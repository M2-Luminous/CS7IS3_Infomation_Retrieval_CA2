The Finance Ministry and the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry are at odds over how to set interest rates on the Posts Ministry's ordinary postal savings, scheduled to be liberalized in line with those on rival ordinary savings. The Posts Ministry wants the savings' rates to be linked with market rates, such as certificate of deposit (CD) rates. The Finance Ministry opposes the idea, however, and has demanded that ordinary savings rates move in tandem with those on ordinary deposits, to be set freely by banks from June. The Finance Ministry has proposed that the postal savings bear interest rates somewhat higher than the average interest rates on ordinary deposits after deregulations come into force. The Posts Ministry criticized the Finance Ministry for acting only for banks and ignoring the interests of consumers. Market-linked rates are expected to be relatively higher than bank-set rates. "The Finance Ministry speaks on behalf of banks, which want to keep ordinary deposit rates as low as possible," a Posts Ministry official said. "The Finance Ministry should advise banks to be less egoistic." The sources said the deadlock in the negotiations makes it look uncertain that a law revision required for the deregulation can be submitted to the Diet within April, the deadline for the change to be implemented in June as originally planned.
