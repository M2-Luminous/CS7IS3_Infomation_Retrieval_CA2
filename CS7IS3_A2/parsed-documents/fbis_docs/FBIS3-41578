But the water first had to be treated to kill the bacteria and improve the quality of the water as usual. Also, the water could be used for piscicultural activities and for water sports. But water samples taken during the period 1991-1993 have shown that the quality of the water in the Tapi River has declined to dangerous levels. Today, the river is suitable for communications only. In some sections, officials found heavy metals such as lead and chromium. For example, at the Tha Thong dock, the lead level was 0.16 milligrams per liter, and the chromium level was 0.34 milligrams per liter. At the municipal dock, the lead level was 0.06 milligrams per liter, and the chromium level was 0.14 milligrams per liter. Even though these metals were not found everywhere along the river and even though the amounts found were small, this could pose a danger. If more and more such metals are released into the river, the river will become polluted, and this will destroy the ecological system. Mr. Sombat said that the reason why the Tapi River is becoming more and more polluted is that the people who live along the banks of the river throw their garbage into the river, farmers are using pesticides, and some industrial factories are secretly releasing untreated waste water into the river. Besides this, waste materials from auto repair shops and from battery plants also drain into the river. Another reason is that there has been a lack of urban planning concerning treating waste water before it is released. [passage omitted]
