The campaign, named Action Japan, will focus on trade with Japan in nine specific industrial areas, Warren told a press conference at the embassy. The areas are auto parts, electronic devices, construction, health care, fashion, textiles, food, environmental and marine equipment and projects in third world countries, Warren said. Warren said British exporters should increase their efforts to successfully enter Japanese markets, which he termed "strategically the most important" for British firms operating in Asia. He said he does not observe "significantly big institutional problems" in Japan that may hamper the smooth entry of British firms. The campaign will replace the Priority Japan Program that began in 1991 and will expire in March this year, which called for raising annual British exports to Japan to 5 billion pounds (7.58 billion dollars). Such exports totaled about 2.5 billion pounds in 1993, Warren said, noting more efforts are necessary both in governmental and private-sector levels.
