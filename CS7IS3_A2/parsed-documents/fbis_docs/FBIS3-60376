It shall be established in Denmark in the Copenhagen area. The [European] Council regulation (Footnote 1) (Council regulation 90/1210/EEC of 7 May 1990 on the establishment of the European Environment Agency and the European Environment Information and Observation Network. OJ No L 120, 11.5.1990, p. 1.) is now in force which means that steps can be taken to ensure the EEA is up and running in the shortest time possible. Immediate Steps Being Taken To Establish the EEA To make the EEA operational it is first necessary to convene the management board. This will consist of one representative of each member state, two representatives of the Commission (Footnote 2) (Laurens-Jan Brinkhorst (director-general DG [Directorate General] XI) and Jean-Pierre Contzen (director-general JRC [Joint Research Center]), and respectively, as alternatives, Thomas Garvey (deputy director-general DG XI) and Yves Franchet (director-general Eurostat).) and two designated by the European Parliament. The first meeting of the board will take place on Friday 17 December 1993. The meeting will tackle the immediate business needed to bring about a speedy start to the EEA's work, including: the procedure and schedule for appointing the executive director; interim arrangements to start the EEA's operation; provisional budget matters; and, appointment of the nine member scientific committee. The preparations made towards a draft work programme will also be tabled at the meeting, together with a report on the activities of the EEA task force between 1990 and 1993. The appointment of the executive director by the management board is of prime importance. The Council regulation requires the Commission to submit a proposal of candidature to the management board which will be done in consultation with them. Pending the entry into service of the first executive director, it is vital that the scientific and technical aspects of the work be actively pursued. Interim arrangements will therefore be adopted at the first management board meeting to ensure the smooth transfer of knowledge and expertise and the continuity of ongoing projects. These arrangements will include, in particular: the appointment of a 'mandataire' to act as executive officer until the executive director begins work; the steps to be taken to prepare the multiannual work programme; and, appropriate measures concerning an interim team and its tasks for the transition period. The Commission will provide the necessary assistance for financial and administrative matters (in particular, preparation of staff recruitment, staff status and budget). Background and Mandate The creation of the EEA should be seen against the background of the aims of environmental protection laid down in the Treaty of Rome as amended by the Single European Act, by successive Community action programmes on the environment, and now by the Maastricht Treaty. UNCED [UN Conference on Environment and Development], and in particular Agenda 21, now provide the international framework for fostering cooperation on the environment. The EEA, and the `European Environment Information and Observation Network', which it will coordinate, are intended to provide the Community and the member states with objective, reliable and comparable information at the European level to enable them to take the measures necessary to protect the environment, as well as to be able to assess the results of these measures. Equally important is the aim to ensure that the public is properly informed about the state of the environment. For all these purposes the EEA will also provide the necessary scientific and technical support. The management board will decide how the EEA is to be organised. However, it is clear from the Council regulation that the EEA will be the hub of a decentralised, distributed, network making the maximum use of resources already existing in member states. Building Blocks A number of major building blocks are required to enable the tasks of the EEA to be carried out: Information and Observation Network The European Environment Information and Observation Network will consist of: - component parts of the existing national information networks; - a national focal point nominated by each member state; - institutions contracted by the EEA to work on specific subjects of particular interest, often referred to as `topic centres' or `thematic centres.' Within 6 months of the entry into force of the Council regulation, member states have to inform the EEA of the main components of their national networks, including, if desired, national focal points, as well as candidates for topic centres. Multiannual Work Programme Within 9 months of the Council regulation coming into force the first multiannual work programme must be adopted by the management board. Topic Centres In approving the multiannual work programme the management board will have to decide specific tasks of topic centres. The Council regulation does not explicitly specify a deadline for the actual designation of the topic centres nor their thematic or geographic orientations. Work Areas The principal activities will cover all those areas of work necessary to enable the EEA to describe the present and foreseeable state of the environment from the point of view of: - the quality of the environment; - the pressures on the environment; - the sensitivity of the environment. Priorities in supplying environmental information which may be used directly in the implementation of Community environment policy, the EEA in its first years will give priority to the following areas: - air quality and atmospheric emissions; - water quality, pollutants and water resources; - the state of the soil, of the fauna and flora, and of biotopes; - land use and natural resources; - waste management; - noise emissions; - chemical substances which are hazardous for the environment; - coastal protection. Special consideration will be given to transfrontier, plurinational and global phenomena, and the socioeconomic dimension shall also be taken into account. Possible future tasks within two years of the EEA coming into operation, the Council shall decide on further tasks for the EEA, in particular, in the following areas: - Associating in the monitoring of the implementation of Community environmental legislation; - Preparing environmental labels and criteria for their award to environmentally friendly products, technologies and services etc; - Promoting environmentally friendly technologies and processes; and, - Establishing criteria for assessing the impact on the environment. Cooperation With Other Bodies Community bodies the EEA shall actively seek the cooperation of other Community bodies and programmes, and notably the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the statistical office (Eurostat) and the Community's environmental research and development programmes. The JRC will have an essential role in research and such areas as: - harmonization of environmental measurement methods; - intercalibration of instruments; - standardization of data formats; - development of new environmental measurement methods and instruments; - other tasks as agreed between the executive director of the EEA and the director-general of the JRC. On request of the EEA, the JRC will be able to provide scientific support in specific fields of competence and technical support in areas such as informatics and networking. Coordination with Eurostat is expected to lead to the supply of data on human activities (necessary to assess pressures on the environment), on economy-environment relations, and on basic territorial characteristics (topography). Participation of Non-Community Countries and International Organisations In parallel with its cooperation with external bodies, participation of third countries in the work of the EEA is clearly important since environmental problems and challenges are not confined by national frontiers. This has been envisaged from the outset, and provisions for their involvement is covered in Article 19 of the Council regulation. Considerable interest has already been shown by EFTA (European Free Trade Association) member states, as well as by countries of Eastern and Central Europe. Participation of international organisations the EEA will also develop working relations with relevant international organisations, with bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Council of Europe and the European Space Agency, and those of the United Nations family, particularly the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World MeteorologicaL Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The participation of non-governmental organisations is equally important. The Inheritance The EEA is the logical successor, in particular, of the Corine programme. Corine was an experimental project (1985-1990) to determine the need and practice for collecting, coordinating and ensuring the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resources within the Community. Its pilot projects concentrated on land cover, biotopes, and emissions to the atmosphere (see below). The Corine programme led to three types of complementary results: (i) relevant data bases for several priority environmental concerns; (ii) methods and nomenclatures adopted at Community level and internationally; and, (iii) networks of experts from all member states used to pooling their knowledge for environmental objectives. The techniques, data bases and networks established under the Corine programme will provide a significant contribution to the work of the EEA. The conclusions of the Dublin, Dobris and Luzern Ministerial Conferences, (June 1990, June 1991 and April 1993 respectively) emphasised the importance of integrating environmental information systems throughout Europe. Many non-EC countries have already expressed a keen interest to take part fully in the EEA's programme and to integrate into the network. In particular, the EFTA countries have stressed the importance of the role of the EEA as an instrument of cooperation on a European scale. Since that time, many non-EC countries have undertaken work in this respect. Beginning in January 1990, the EEA task force has worked to maintain and utilise the data and expertise built-up during the Corine programme, and to handle the many and diverse initiatives arising out of the decision to establish the EEA. In order to limit the damage caused by the absence of a decision on the seat of the EEA, this has increasingly meant becoming involved in new activities on behalf of the EEA, without compromising future decisions of the management board. The main areas of the task force's activities, in the period 1990 to 1993, are outlined below. Preparatory Activities for the EEA Work programme - in the light of many discussions between the Commission and a high-level group of member state national experts, the EEA task force has prepared a first draft multi-annual work programme. A systematic analysis of the data needed to implement the programme has been started, based in the first place on the objectives of the 5th Community Action Programme on the environment, 'towards sustainability'. The information needed to support the reporting requirements established in the UNCED Agenda 21 have also to be considered. Network Work is underway to develop a network architecture for the EEA to ensure inter-operability of the various elements of the 'European Environment Information and Observation Network'. This is taking into account issues of security, secrecy and legality, in line with common rules developed through the DG III programme, IDA (Interchange of Data between Administrations), whose aim is to encourage and stimulate such data exchange. The approach focusses on the requirements for communication and the exchange and access to data and information systems. Data Bases A `data-model' is being prepared to serve the needs of current and expected future data holdings, including, in particular, those arising out of European environmental legislation. Development of a strategy for coding data, and standards needed to improve and facilitate data exchange, are included. Catalogue of Data Sources A report has been completed on the needs and possible solutions for a 'meta-database' for the EEA. This is a system that records details of data holdings, data sources, institutions, activities and other environmental related information needed for the EEA's work. The main characteristics of the system have now been defined and a standard 'data-model' is being developed. Plans are also being laid for the preparation of a multi-lingual thesaurus of environmental terms to use in connection with the catalogue. Updating and Completing Corine Data Bases Land cover - the cartography of land cover on the scale of 1:100 000 has been completed for almost half of the territory of the European Community. This is continuing with the support of Community regional policy, with a view to completion of the inventory in 1994- 95. In addition, the application of Community methodology has begun in the PHARE (Footnote 3) (countries of Central and Eastern Europe in receipt of EC economic aid according to the terms of Council regulation 89/3906/EEC) countries, as well as in several EFTA member states and in countries in the southern part of the Mediterranean basin with LIFE (Footnote 10) (Council regulation 92/1973/EEC of 21 May 1992 establishing a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE). OJ No L 206, 22.7.92, p. 1.)/MEDSPA (Footnote 11) (Council regulation 91/563/EEC of 4 March 1991 on action by the Community for the protection of the environment in the mediterranean region (MEDSPA). OJ No L 63, 9.3.1991. p. 1.) support. Biotopes The data base has been updated and supplemented to serve the needs of Community nature conservation policy, and in particular the application of the `habitats' directive. The PHARE countries and certain EFTA member states are carrying out the inventory according to the Community methodology. Work continues in collaboration with the Council of Europe and the principal international nature conservancy organisations. Corinair 1990 An inventory of pollutant emissions is being carried out for 1990 as an update of the 1985 inventory. The work is being performed in cooperation with the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), all of whose European member states currently apply the Community methodology `Corinair.' The inventory includes greenhouse gases, and the results will provide the European contribution to the OECD-IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) programme in this field. The inventory also meets the needs for the supply of data connected with the Council directive on large combustion plants. A feasibility study has been completed which confirms that the Corinair methodology should be extendible to other environmental media to build an integrated multi-media inventory of emissions. Preparation of the Report Europe's Environment Conference At the European Environment Ministers' Conference at Dobris Castle in the former Czechoslovakia (21-23 June 1991), the Commission received a mandate to prepare the first report on the state of the environment for the whole of Europe (including EC, EFTA and Central and Eastern European countries). The report will facilitate the development of an 'environmental programme for Europe' in the lead-up to the next Ministerial Conference to be held in Sofia in 1995. It will be equally useful as a tool to inform the public and raise awareness about environmental problems. The report is being prepared by the EEA task force in collaboration with the UNECE and other international bodies (Council of Europe, IUCN, OECD, UNEP, WHO). The report is an assessment of the state of the whole European environment and of the pressures caused by human activities, and provides an analysis of prominent environmental problems of concern for Europe. Publication is scheduled for early 1994. The report will be accompanied by a joint data compendium, being prepared with Eurostat, OECD, UNECE and WHO. Other products are also envisaged including, for example, an environmental atlas and a popular version. The preparation of the report has proved a unique opportunity to explore the possibilities for cooperation with non-EC countries and other bodies--international organisations and non-governmental organisations. The work has contributed to building a framework for environmental monitoring and assessment at a pan-European scale. Lessons learnt during the course of this project will be useful for preparing the tasks of the EEA. Particularly valuable has been the experience of collecting, processing and interpreting data under conditions where much relevant data is missing and with problems of accessibility and comparability for the data which does exist. The constitution and use of expert networks has been especially important for helping to resolve these problems. Furthermore, the exercise has contributed to bringing together the statistical activities of Eurostat, OECD, UNECE and WHO. The need for regular reporting on the environment at the pan-European level is confirmed by the results of this work.
