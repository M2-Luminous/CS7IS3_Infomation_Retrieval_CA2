Yeltsin: A View From His Inner Circle."] [Text] Before New Year's there appeared in the NEW YORK TIMES an article by William Safire written as if it were by Boris Yeltsin. The situation that had developed before and after the elections on the Russian political scene was represented as the result of Yeltsin's clever moves, everything having gone precisely as planned: I had to show the democratic reformers how much they depended on me, and to do this I introduced and ran Zhirinovskiy, and, moreover, he is a counterbalance to my "main problem"--Yavlinskiy, and so forth. The old faithful hard-working chance put me in touch with people from Boris Yeltsin's inner circle, which resulted in the recording I was permitted to make without naming names. It seemed interesting and necessary to give the Russian reader a different view of this president's inner world from the one conceived by the American. [Kuchkina] What do you think, was the very form in which the article was written ethical? To what extent does the mode of thinking ascribed to Yeltsin correspond to his real one? [Answer] Genres may vary. We have already read what was supposed to be a letter from B.N. in response to the letter to him from Vitaliy Tretyakov, and this is similar to a certain degree. There are no complaints against the genre. But the character, world view, internal content, and sequence of thoughts of the person represented are in no way accurate, they are altogether different. This is some kind of laboratory test model, and the author has no need to feel the national character. [Kuchkina] When you read articles like this, how do you feel about them, are you offended or insulted? [Answer] Yes. [Kuchkina] But you remain silent? [Answer] We are not being silent. We are drawing our own conclusions. We have emotions just like anyone else, but the main thing are the conclusions: This means that somewhere something was missed, was not explained. Because such conjectures begin when there is no information. [Kuchkina] At his last news conference the president announced that he wanted to expand the channels of independent information. What lies behind this? [Answer] The need to improve and increase the effectiveness of the work of structures of government and administration. For which it is necessary to arrange contacts with independent experts outside the Kremlin. Assessments inside the Kremlin may be subjectively slanted even in spite of a person's will. Independent experts frequently give unpleasant information. [Kuchkina] Does he read the newspapers? [Answer] Information from the newspapers comes to him directly. He has many newspapers and he reads them all himself. [Kuchkina] According to rumor he read something in NEZAVISIMAYA and threw it down saying: Get this paper out of my sight. [Answer] As I recall, something similar happened with PRAVDA. When the tone is insulting to him, when the words are insulting--that kind of reaction is possible. But the next day this newspaper still must be lying there on his desk. [Kuchkina] A sharp reaction--is that his human character or his obkom [oblast committee] character? [Answer] Human. He does not get angry, he does not get wrathful, this offends him, and he takes it hard. [Kuchkina] Is he given the mail that comes to him? [Answer] There is a department that reads letters, generalizes them, and submits summaries. The clearest and the most profound and serious are given to him. [Kuchkina] And abuse? [Answer] Sometimes he asks to see these himself. But if it is nothing but vulgarity and nothing else, then no. [Kuchkina] But does he know that there is mail like this? [Answer] In all of the summaries they write down in detail and with candor the subjects, the problems, and the attitudes. [Kuchkina] The outline of events for 3-4 October is largely known. I recall that one commentator said on the radio at that time: Thank you, Boris Nikolayevich, and now go--to a monastery, wherever you want, shovel away a little more dirt and then leave. [Answer] As for his feelings, these hours and days were probably the most difficult in his life. It was a tragedy. When he uttered this word in a speech on television it was his personal assessment. He felt sympathy both with the disturbances and with the victims. How did he cope with this--and he did cope with it--is very difficult to say. But regarding the monastery, regarding the sin--he felt that. And no matter what he did, even if he were to leave his post, he had the feeling that this load, this burden would be on him for the rest of his life. He wakes up in the middle of the night, that is, it is always with him now. Recently he uttered the sentence: I do not believe in God but perhaps I will believe. Mainly because he feels the burden of these victims. This is his cross to bear. He arrived at the decision to storm the White House after much torment and he made it with immense difficulty. He had to break something or twist something inside himself, and this same thing had to be done by his inner circle, the people in power, and Dmitriy Antonovich Volkogonov, who as a part of the operations group had to spend a long time persuading B.N. after the seizure of the mayor's office and the battles near Ostankino that it was necessary to break up this group, there was no other solution, otherwise everything would be in vain because, as we imagined, the very next morning if they were to remain there they would arrange all kinds of communications, a certain part of the army could be on their side, and then a real civil war would break out. Possibly B.N. would not have resorted to the edict of 21 September if he had known what would happen on 4 October. Not even on the 3d, but the 4th. We are not yet familiar with all the documents, but that autumn opponents of the reforms, conventionally speaking, declared a season of battle, everywhere there was information about growing tension, about a whole series of actions scheduled apparently for 7 November--the day when Soviet power was to have been restored. To a certain degree the edict was to forestall these events. And the entire power line was calculated so that there would be no bloody developments. He emphasized that repeatedly. There was a sense of what we cannot allow. What we could not allow. On the 3d, after the disturbances had already begun at the Crimean Bridge, he understood that it could not be avoided. Incidentally, while aggravating the situation, Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and Baburin, apparently, were not counting on such harsh measures in response from the president because they knew him. And knowing him, they thought that he would appeal to the people, the components of the Federation, the international community, and perhaps he would defend the Kremlin and that would be all.... [Kuchkina] As a good person he considers the development of events on one plane, but events proceed on another. Perhaps here it is not enough to be a good person; it is necessary to be a good analyst, or a good analyst must be nearby so that it will be possible to follow thinking different from his own. [Answer] Yeltsin himself is a very complicated person. He is so big that it will take more time to get to know him. Even we who have been working with him for many years are always discovering something about him. So far we have been speaking about his human qualities. But there is also Yeltsin the politician who has a cold intellect and deep and far-sighted understanding. And all the events after 21 September and after 3 October were calculated with a cold intellect. He prepared the edict himself. And how events would develop if he made a mistake. He is aware every moment that he is the president of an immense country and bears responsibility for this country, he feels this responsibility with his bones, with his mind, with every cell. But politics is not chess, and reality can always bring surprises. [Kuchkina] That is, all the mythology that he merely signs things and that all of his inner circle plays the role of king, and the king may go to Zavidovo and sit there, as Zhirinovskiy says, does not square with reality? [Answer] This, incidentally, is another conscious means of evoking additional negative emotions. It is clear that it is impossible to do without analysts, without aides, and without an inner circle because the volume of work performed by the president is gigantic. But the president and his inner circle must not exchange places. There can be certain edicts that are signed in error, but he has the ability to recognize his own mistakes. Gorbachev would not admit his mistakes for anything. He would find some way to wriggle out of them and not admit his mistakes. B.N. has learned to admit things. But it is not even that: He is also able to correct his mistakes. He has a clear mind and a phenomenal memory. He takes a text and reads it down the middle while managing to cover everything on the left and right. He will say, I have already read it. Some people will answer him: That cannot be. He will recite the text of the document by heart. He selects people he trusts for their abilities and their orderliness in work and preparing documents. As long as the person does not make a mistake. Then he starts to watch them more closely. There are many problems, and there are also problems that are new to him or that have been underestimated so far. But the many problems on the fundamental or strategic plane he knows in detail. Before becoming the chairman of the government he worked with the economy on the scale of the oblast. Market reform on a practical plane was something new for him. When Gaydar began his work we went to all the sessions of the government. We saw that he began to speak with them as equals fairly quickly. Of course, Gaydar knows more, and of course, he speaks in the language of economic categories as a scholar who has gone into this in depth. But even after a month and a half they recognized B.N. as the informal leader of the government and began to work as a unified team. Or here is an example from international practice. The main topic of one of his conversations with Major was nuclear disarmament. At first they spoke on one level, discussing the political aspects of the problem, and B.N. went deeper and deeper, and reached a point where the other person simply threw up his hands. Major recognized him as a specialist with a thorough knowledge of his subject. This is a unique quality which remained with him from the previous system: He understands the significance of responsibility. [Kuchkina] Did he also sign the last edict on the KGB, to use the old name, himself? [Answer] The peculiarity of the last edict consists in that he understood the system with which he was dealing and that even if he had entrusted someone else to sign the edict, within a couple of hours or minutes this would become known. Therefore he prepared the edict himself. At the news conference he even called it not an edict but an operation which he conducted. [Kuchkina] Was the president not too late? Perhaps the historic moment had passed? Was it done on the wrong wave of expectations? [Answer] Perhaps on the propaganda plane he was too late. But the essence of the matter is that the KGB is not an organ you can joke around with. After all, the president had been hearing reproaches about this for a very long time. But if you have no forces and no capabilities and you offend it, this monster, it will tear down everything, destroy everything, and it will tear you down too in a couple of hours. One has the feeling that he was waiting for the proper moment and waited until it came. On the eve of the edict in the Ministry of Security some people were working for the president, some people were working for others, and some people were drinking. And the fact that B.N. selected the moment when nobody even said oh-oh.... [Kuchkina] Are you trying to say that he is able to choose the right moment? [Answer] Yes. He comes up with an idea and then carries it through. [Kuchkina] In your opinion, are there strategic tasks which the president has set for himself for the term of his presidency? [Answer] The main task is for Russia to be an economically strong power, and it can be this only through the assimilation of market management mechanisms. This means that it is necessary to conduct market reform. The communist Soviet system is completely obsolete and holds things back, it must be reworked, and this requires the Constitution. And so forth. As president it seems that he recognizes his role, which consists largely of raking up the dirt. But what can he do? He must rake it up so that he can lay a foundation for the future. Others will take the work up later. [Kuchkina] With this kind of portrait how do you feel, for example, about his last statement about Ukraine during his meeting with Gore to the effect that the Ukrainians are being deceptive and that it is difficult? [Answer] He is a human being and sometimes an idea which should be expressed more subtly is blurted out and draws more attention to itself than it should. This complicates matters. The idea is noticed and people begin to quote it right and left without paying any attention to the context. At the same time they complain that all the information is classified as it was before and his style is not candid, forgetting what happened yesterday. For instance whatever Brezhnev said off the cuff, not on paper, almost failed to become public. But now there is TV everywhere, there are reporters everywhere, and somebody is bound to hear you, if not a journalist then some random person, if not from one group then from the opposing one. [Kuchkina] What do you think, why do so many people hate him? From certain people he evokes a truly pathological feeling of hatred. Does anyone think about this here? [Answer] Yes, of course, this is analyzed. The president is not a person who is perceived in subtle tones. The hatred of his opponents contains a certain element of indirect recognition of his power. B.N. is straightforward and categorical in his communication. This has a strong negative effect on some people. Additionally, there are objective reasons why some people do not accept him. A period of severe breakup is linked to him. The people lost the Soviet Union. Those who are living and working with this breakdown, who have lost a sense of being a citizen of a great power, may blame him for this. When we flew with him to Almaty for the signing of the declaration of the Eleven and then returned we had tears in our eyes because we had all grown up in the Union, we understood it with our minds, but our hearts had not yet accepted this metamorphosis. [Kuchkina] And how did he himself experience this? [Answer] Also painfully. Very. [Kuchkina] But does he consider himself to blame? [Answer] This is an objective process which is beyond any human capabilities. The crisis of the system is objective. People who point the finger at B.N. are frequently playing tricks, and sometimes deliberately. A peculiarity of human perception is that we consider what we have to be the worst possible scenario for the development of events. Without taking into account what might have been and would have been much worse. [Kuchkina] Let us move on to the present situation. How does the president evaluate it? What, in his opinion, will happen in the near future? What do you think about this and what do you know? [Answer] The results on the Constitution are of primary importance for the president. For in essence this is the second referendum of the year. The political overload is absolutely terrible and it is surprising that people are still participating in political actions. That would not have happened anywhere else; in any other country, they would have simply said to hell with politics and voted with their legs. Well, about the elections--there was, of course, the element of surprise, linked mainly to Zhirinovskiy's success. [Kuchkina] How does the president feel about this? [Answer] He sees it as a serious new problem. He did not support any single bloc in the election campaign. That was illogical to the president. In terms of their programs the democrats are very similar; Shakhray's party is not very different from Yavlinskiy's. It would be wrong to participate in the deepening of a schism: to support some of them and push some of them away. To a certain degree there was an experiment going on in determining the real values, the real capabilities, and the independent rating of each democratic movement. And it was fairly unexpected that the rating would be low without the president. We had counted on more. Nonetheless the president is geared to work seriously with this parliament. But one of the problems that has always bothered him, along with the KGB, is the army: Why did some of them vote for Zhirinovskiy. B.N. understands that there are vulnerable national sensibilities here--everywhere we are being persecuted, made the fall guy, offended, insulted.... [Kuchkina] And does he understand that Rutskoy had already loosened this soil well? [Answer] Undoubtedly. And he is very concerned about how to change the situation there. Another problem that torments him is the course of the reforms. When he analyzed the materials from the election campaign and Zhirinovskiy's success he understood that we had voted not "for" anything but "against" the way the reforms were being conducted. Some people had won, some had suffered less, some more, but most people had lost. Things had become easier in the sense that it was possible to go and buy everything, but there was not enough money. One can sense that this bothers him greatly from the documents he requests, what he reads, and what he discusses with us. The reforms need a second wind, they need adjustments. [Kuchkina] If you will allow me, in this connection I would like to say something which, perhaps, you also know, but it is now important to place emphasis on it. In the first place, it is necessary to speak with the people, to defer to the people, joining forces, because when the people, the society, are the passive part of the reforms and not the active part, not the part doing the work, when they are not joined together with the government, then we have what we have. In the second place, America went everywhere in the automobile. What can we ride in, what are the most difficult and neglected things here? Housing and roads. We must begin to build housing and roads for everyone. These should be declared national programs. Perhaps the army could be brought in here. The people would pay for this. In the third place, when the people know or hear about out-and-out bribery, out-and-out corruption, this makes the situation much worse, nobody believes in anybody or anything, they do not want anything, so it is necessary in fact and not in words to get rid of corruption and corrupt people. Zhirinovskiy's party and to a certain degree his electorate include healthy young men from 20 to 40 whose arms and muscles are itching, and all the work threatens to go beyond the parliamentary framework. Is this a problem for the president? [Answer] If this party and this leader in any way overstep the bounds of the Constitution--nobody will try to persuade them to come back into bounds. This would present a danger to society and the president would be resolute. But the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon is one of the serious problems for him and for us. In the broad sense of the word. The phenomenon of ideology. He claims to respond to the moods of many, to respond to the needs of those who want to cling to what is simple and comprehensible, casting off the burden of self-determination and placing it on someone else's shoulders. If you want to fight--go ahead, we will let you fight. If you want to engage in business--engage in business. If you cannot do anything, we will feed you, give you gifts, and so forth. For people from the country and the city, for women and men, for old and young. All this taken together means a strong Russia with expanding boundaries. If it is cold in your home--you will have a warm sea. People in the east will expand to the west. People in the west will take Alaska along with the Kurils. For everyone. The phenomenon of this deceptive ideology is an indicator that state thinking and national self-awareness are in a crisis. Since back in 1990 the president has been making the assignment of gathering everything that could be given by the best minds regarding the general national idea, where we are going, not at the level of intuition but at the level of in-depth theoretical developments. For now, unfortunately, the progress is insignificant. The task has turned out to be difficult both for the institutions and for the individuals. [Kuchkina] There is no philosophy of a common cause. Well, who would be attracted by these definitions--bourgeois society, market society? Can a market really inspire you? It is much better to speak of a society of free initiative. It is necessary to keep in mind all the time that the artificial world in which we lived was or seemed harmonious to us. When you sit in your cell, everything you have is placed along the shelves, here is a little grain, there is a little vodka--everything, in general, is not so bad. But when instead of a cell you have the whole world, you do not know where to run or what to do. It turned out that we had lost our religious and spiritual orientation. It was impossible to turn over to Anpilov or Zhirinovskiy that which had always been valued in Russia: honesty and justice. And it seems to me that the president must make some kind of vivid gesture. Not vivid in form, but in essence. Not giving up his car or apartment--he is the president of Russia, he should not be living in some kind of shed made of boards, but he could declare and consistently adhere to a new policy: We will do this and that together with you. [Answer] There are things that are not clear, and once you clarify them, everything goes back into place. They talk about his moving into Gorbachev's dacha. He did not want to move there himself, but they told him: It has all the communications systems in place, if you move to a different place it will be necessary to reinstall all the communications, all these buttons, approaches, to provide for security--millions will be spent again. If we are to speak about the new politics, there is a sense of this turning point: Yeltsin as the implementer and defender of the market course is returning to the former Yeltsin but on a new basis. Yeltsin as the defender of the people. The defender of their daily life. The defender of their security. The defender of their incomes. In two years the people have become tired, society as a whole has become tired. We need new people and new ideas. [Kuchkina] But that also means that Zhirinovskiy objectively becomes stronger. Here he is: a new person with a new idea. And so far you have nothing to oppose him with. We have nothing. In addition to everything else, his roots lie not simply in the electorate but in the party of revanche. Having studied the mistakes of the State Committee for the State of Emergency and the "Octoberists," having studied the history and the coming to power of this one and that one, it is possible to turn in the direction of whomever he wants and whatever he wants. [Answer] We are well aware of this. And the president knows it. But we must not exaggerate the degree of danger. Society and the powers also have other deep and growing roots which will not give the revanche party enjoy revanche. Ultimately we are dealing with a president who not only experiences everything in his soul and is not only capable of adopting a decision, but who also has not exhausted himself as a politician. It is not without reason that we have spoken about this very complicated giant of a man, about his extraordinariness as a politician and a human being. The game is far from over. [Kuchkina] Does this mean that we will have one person again? [Answer] Everything in history is personified and it is foolish to forget this in favor of one to whom it is advantageous to brush any person aside.
