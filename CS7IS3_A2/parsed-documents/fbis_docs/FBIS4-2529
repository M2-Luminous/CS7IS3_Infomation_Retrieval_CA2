FBIS4-2529 "drchi070_n_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-070 Daily Report 24 Mar 1994 Economic & Agricultural State Council Circular on Price Inspection State Council Circular on Price Inspection OW1004221294 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 1209 GMT 24 Mar 94 OW1004221294 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service Chinese BFN [Unattributed report] [Text] Beijing, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- The State Council recently issued a circular on launching a nationwide general inspection of commodity prices to provincial and municipal people's governments, and to ministries, commissions, and organizations under the State Council. The circular said: At present, China enjoys a stable political environment and a prosperous economy. However, price hikes occur frequently. Price hikes and unauthorized fees have provoked a strong reaction from the masses. Some enterprises raised prices by taking advantage of the reforms in taxation, in the exchange rate, and of prices; some localities exceeded their authority, set prices for services, and wantonly collected fees for personal gain; and some shop owners, instead of marking prices clearly on their merchandise, demanded unreasonable prices, fixed prices, and cheated customers. Some of them even earned exorbitant profits from selling fake and shoddy products. These illegal operations have pushed up the general price level and have seriously harmed consumers' interests. To prevent illegal acts of raising prices, establish order with regard to market prices, restrain the general price level from an excessive increase, keep people's lives stable, maintain social stability, and create a favorable environment for the smooth implementation of various reforms, the State Council decided to continue the nationwide general inspection of commodity prices in 1994. The circular's demands: 1. The Scope, Focus, and Main Content of the Inspection All enterprises, individual industrialists and businessmen, and administration units authorized to collect fees will be included in the inspection. The inspection will focus on prices of daily necessities and fees for various services for citizens which are closely related to the people's lives. The main content of the inspection will focus on illegal acts of raising prices in the second half of 1993. These illegal acts include: 1) Raising prices without authorization by taking advantage of taxation reform and by widening the gaps between purchasing and selling prices and between wholesale and retail prices, and raising prices of products and services by adding additional value-added tax to original prices; 2) Exceeding the authority of price administration to raise prices and service charges that are supposed to be set by the state; wantonly raising and charging fees for railway, highway, and water transportation services; and forcing passengers to buy insurance while selling them tickets; 3) Violating state regulations on reporting the price adjustment plan, on controlling price differences, and on temporary price controls; and failing to mark prices on commodities; 4) Violating relevant state regulations and wantonly raising the prices of agricultural production means such as chemical fertilizers, agricultural films, pesticides, diesel fuel for agricultural use, and electricity in rural areas; 5) Charging fees outside of authority, adding categories of charges without authorization, and increasing fees indiscriminately. 2. The Time and Method of the Inspection The nationwide general inspection of commodity prices will begin in late March, and preliminary results must be scored by the end of June. Price departments at all levels will be in charge of the inspection. Working together with supervision, finance, taxation, auditing, industrial and commercial administration, and technology supervision departments, they will select cadres to form inspection teams to kick off the inspection. With the price inspection organizations serving as the mainstay, the nationwide general inspection of commodity prices will give full play to price supervision organizations in all fields. It will be conducted by simultaneously carrying out propaganda, handling problems, and correcting mistakes. In the course of the inspection, it is necessary to bring into full play the role of the mass media in exercising supervision, utilizing radio and television broadcasts, newspapers, and journals to build up momentum and create public support for the general price inspection and to publicize major and serious cases which have created bad influences. It is also necessary to encourage the masses to expose various instances of price violation. Measures for improving and perfecting price management should be worked out promptly to deal with problems uncovered during the inspection and to strengthen enterprises' capability for self-restraint. Local governments may invite people's congress deputies, members of political consultative conferences, and the democratic parties to take part in the price inspection, bringing into play their role in exercising supervision and offering guidance. 3. Organization and Leadership of the Inspection The nationwide general price inspection should be carried out and led directly by governments at various levels. Governments at all levels should attach great importance to, strengthen leadership over, and assign a leading comrade to take charge of the inspection, while leaving specific work to the commodity price departments. To ensure the smooth progress of the inspection, it is necessary to keep consistent commodity price departments and staff members, replenish essential inspection personnel, coordinate relations between various departments in good time, and effectively solve practical problems arising in the inspection. On the basis of investigations and study, governments at all levels should identify focal points, arrange them in the order of their priority, formulate plans, study policies, work out meticulous and well-conceived arrangements to ensure the concentration of resources to achieve breakthroughs in the focal points, and use the experience of selected units to promote work in the entire area, thereby making the inspection a great success. All departments should step up cooperation and coordination. The finance department should ensure outlays for investigating price violations uncovered in the inspection; banks should assist price inspection departments to collect, according to the regulations, fines and confiscations that units and individuals being penalized refuse to deliver to the state; the industry and commerce administrative departments should provide active cooperation in regard to price inspection departments' request for suspending a business's operations pending consolidation or revoking its business license; and the public security department should, in pursuance of the relevant laws and regulations, punish those who obstruct inspection personnel from executing their official duties. The State Council should instruct the State Planning Commission to work together with the supervision, finance, taxation, auditing, industry and commerce administration, and technical supervisory departments in organizing a number of work groups and should send them to provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to give inspection-related guidance; while local governments at various levels should also dispatch work groups to go down to lower levels to supervise the inspection. 4. Requirements of the Inspection Work 1) All inspection personnel should diligently study the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to fully recognize the inspection's great importance for stabilizing commodity prices, reassuring the public, and ensuring the smooth progress of reform programs. It is necessary to conduct training to enable inspection personnel to familiarize themselves with this year's reform programs as well as relevant professional knowledge, policies, and legislation. In the course of inspection, it is necessary to uphold principle, to observe discipline, to perform duties honestly, to strictly enforce the laws, and to handle price violation cases impartially without bending laws for the benefit of relatives or friends. 2) Price inspection offices should sternly handle uncovered cases of price violation in accordance with the "Regulations on Price Management in the PRC" and other relevant regulations. It is necessary to instruct units and individuals involved in price violation to refund their illegitimate incomes to buyers or consumers. Illegitimate incomes that cannot be refunded should be confiscated by price inspection offices, and those involved should be given a fine depending on the degree of gravity of each case. 3) All units and individuals being inspected should voluntarily accept inspection and provide accurate information; those who deliberately create difficulties and refuse to accept inspection will be given a heavy punishment. 4) It is necessary to protect inspection personnel who uphold principle as well as people who expose price violations; and retaliation against them should by no means be permitted. Those who shield and connive at acts of price violation should be affixed with responsibilities and duly punished. The State Planning Commission is responsible for the day-to-day work of the nationwide price inspection. Before 20 July, all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities should submit to the State Council special reports on progress in the inspection.
