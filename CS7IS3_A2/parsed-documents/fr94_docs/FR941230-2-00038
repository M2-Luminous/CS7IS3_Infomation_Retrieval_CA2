SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Pro-Children Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 6081&hyph;6084), hereafter referred to as ``the Act,'' was enacted on March 31, 1994, as sections 1041 through 1044 of Public Law 103&hyph;227, the ``Goals 2000: Educate America Act.'' The purpose of this Act is to protect children under the age of 18 from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke when receiving education, library, day care, health care, and early childhood development services in indoor facilities. The Act seeks to achieve this goal by requiring persons that provide children's services in indoor facilities to prohibit smoking in such facilities if they are regularly or routinely used for the delivery of those services. Similar prohibitions apply to federal agencies that provide those services to children. Section 1043(d) of the Act requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with other affected agencies, publish a Notice in the Federal Register incorporating the Act's prohibitions. Section 1043(d) further provides that the Act will become effective ninety days from the issuance of this notice or 270 days after enactment of the Act (March 31, 1994) whichever is earlier. The prohibitions that follow are being published in furtherance of these requirements. Prohibitions Contained in the Pro-Children Act of 1994 1. Persons That Provide Children's Services a.
