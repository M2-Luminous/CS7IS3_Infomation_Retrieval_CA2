F. Vasilevich, S. A. Yezhov; UDC 621.396.965] [Abstract]An optimum means is proposed to control how a search zone is scanned when detecting and tracking the trajectory of an individual target when a priori information on the type of target is available. The computations which were carried out showed that a 20-30% savings in search time is obtained as compared to sequential scanning for typical radar stations. This value grows proportionately to the number of cells in the search zone. 3 figures and 3 references.
