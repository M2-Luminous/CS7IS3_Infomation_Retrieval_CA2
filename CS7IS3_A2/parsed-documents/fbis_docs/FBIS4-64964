We are not accustomed to an ordinary Folketing election that has not been called because of an issue. The future of the welfare state is currently the key phrase for the campaign. Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has not yet called the Folketing election, of course, and the four government parties have not yet decided whether they will conduct a joint campaign and what the election platform will be if they do. But the ideological tone has been set. The prime minister and the government will use the possibility of a VKZ [Liberal/Conservative/Progress Party] majority as a bogeyman and have rejected the new Liberal and Conservative economic initiatives for the time being, noting that "the Liberals and Conservatives are setting the stage for heavy-handed treatment of the weakest groups in society." Naturally the two parties indignantly reject that interpretation. In any case it will be a long campaign. Prime Minister Rasmussen is still floating the idea that Tuesday, 6 September, would be a good election date. But in reality the date has not been determined. Government sources say the election will probably be held either in September or at the beginning of November. If it is held in September the four government parties will be bound together by the 1995 budget bill that will be presented before the end of August. Moreover, the newly elected Folketing could start work on 4 October when the Folketing session begins. If the election is held at the beginning of November, the four government parties will be bound together by both the budget bill and the prime minister's opening address, which can be used as a joint election platform. The election could then be called in connection with the opening of the Folketing. The risk of a long campaign is obvious. Of course the government will present some bills and proposals in the months ahead, but big reforms will be out of the question. That provides a possibility that minor political issues will be blown out of proportion and dominate the political picture. This kind of debate can be hard to control. For both the government parties and the opposition parties. Danish politicians are not used to long election periods where a Folketing election is not called until just before the end of the four-year term. Usually there are approximately two to two and a half years between elections, after which an election is called on the basis of a particular issue. On the rare occasions when the politicians go through three years of an election period they all have their eyes fixed on the coming election. That is also the case this time. The prime minister attacked the Liberal and Conservative proposals on Wednesday [23 March] after a two-day government meeting at the Toruplund conference center near Hundested. At the meeting the government agreed on a number of legislative initiatives that will be worked out in the months ahead. Government Proposal The government has presented an action plan, "Focusing on the Patient." According to the plan, illness prevention will be strengthened, waiting periods at hospitals will be reduced, and the quality of the health system will be improved. The plan will be discussed with the County Council Association and the government will not promise more money for the health area in advance. Education Minister Ole Vig Jensen will present another plan this spring. "Growth in the Universities" is the name of the plan, which is aimed at improving the quality of institutions of higher education over a 10-year period. Pension and Cost-of-Living Funds The four government parties have also finally agreed on a bill that will enable the wage-earner funds to increase their investments in the private business sector. The government will give the Labor Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP) and the Wage Earners' Cost-of-Living Fund (LD) an opportunity to invest 35 percent of their total capital in stocks compared with the current limit of 25 percent. At the same time the limit on how much of the capital can be invested in a single firm will be raised from 2 to 3 percent on condition that the listed company has net capital of over 250 million kroner. The government -- at the request of the Radicals in particular -- has decided to appoint a committee to investigate how to create more democracy in the pension and wage-earner funds and report back by the end of 1994. The question of the ATP's and LD's increased investment opportunities created political turbulence a few weeks ago when Conservative Party leader Hans Engell declared his willingness to engage in a debate on the funds. The government responded eagerly. But Engell is not satisfied with the government's proposal because it does not meet his demand for providing an opportunity to pay the LD money to wage earners earlier. Engell wants an age limit of 50 years for payment. Liberal political spokesman Anders Fogh Rasmussen also rejects the government's proposal because it does not support the Liberal demand that individual wage earners be given greater freedom to withdraw the money. Conservative Plan All in all the prospect of broad cooperation between the government and the opposition looks somewhat dim now that the ideological banner on the welfare state has been raised. The Liberal tax initiative has been shot full of holes by the government, led by Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft and Tax Minister Ole Stavad. On the other hand the finance minister was more conciliatory Monday when he commented on the Conservatives' economic proposal. But the prime minister's comments after the Toruplund meeting were considerably sharper. Apparently the idea of driving a government wedge between the Liberals and the Conservatives has been abandoned, now it is a question of issuing warnings about a VKZ majority. "The Danish Economy Toward the Year 2000 -- Growth and Prosperity" is the name of the Conservative plan. According to the plan, 160,000 new jobs can be created over the next five years, mainly in the private sector. In the labor market area it proposes limiting the unemployment compensation period to just four years. The level of unemployment benefits would be 80 percent for all four years, but the maximum benefit would be increased so that workers with higher incomes would have better coverage in the initial unemployment period. The maximum benefit would be 180,000 kroner in the first year of unemployment, 140,000 in the second, and 110,000 in the third and fourth years. It is precisely this proposal to pay higher unemployment benefits to workers who earned higher wages that has been sharply rejected by the government, which considers it an attack on the weak groups in society. In the longer term the Conservatives also want the unemployment benefits system privatized, making the labor market factions responsible for the system themselves. There would also be no barriers to setting up unemployment funds. The Conservative plan calls for abolishing the tax on gross income and replacing it with "earmarked insurance contributions" to finance unemployment insurance expenses. To create better conditions for private trade and industry the proposals include eliminating the tax on capital, dropping the CO[.sub]2[/] tax until European Union (EU) rules in this area are established, making entertainment expenses fully deductible, easing generational succession taxes, providing a 125-percent tax deduction for research and development costs, granting tax exemptions to newly established firms for the first three to five years, and eliminating the tax reform's increased taxes on stock and property profits and goodwill. Liberals' Tax Breaks The Liberal tax proposal, which is actually an attack on the welfare state, according to the government, operates with the possibility of lowering taxes by 5 billion kroner a year for 10 years, based on the assumption of zero growth in the public sector. Liberal tax spokesman Peter Brixtofte is the main person behind the tax initiative, which was presented by the Liberal Party as a debate proposal. The proposal lists 20 things that would improve the tax system, improvements that according to Brixtofte can be started as soon as the new government is formed. Brixtofte talks about the "new liberal government" in his proposal. In point of fact the Conservatives have not felt inspired to offer much comment on the tax proposal. Brixtofte, on the other hand, has called the Conservative economic proposal both "sensible and constructive," noting that it could be unified with the Liberal proposal and serve as part of the platform for the future coalition government.
