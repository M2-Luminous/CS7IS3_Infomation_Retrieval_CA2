Usmanov, head of Uzbekistan's Radio and Television Production Association; from the "Novosti" newscast] [Text] Ostankino TV's channel one and Russian TV were disconnected from 0900 this morning until this evening in Uzbekistan. The republican TV center did not receive these programs either. I remind you that transmission of Novosti programs has been partially disrupted here for almost a week. During the day viewers in the republic have only been able to see two editions of Novosti from Ostankino, at 1200 and 2100 local time. Other programs were screened without alteration, but clearly, the chronic problem of non-payment has finally caught up. We turned to the republic's communications ministry for an explanation: [Usmanov] The primary reason is that the Ostankino and Russian TV companies owe the Uzbek communications ministry about 1 billion rubles for 1993. Second, no contracts have yet been signed for 1994. We sent off telegrams asking these TV companies to dispatch representatives so that contracts for 1994 can be concluded. [Ganiyeva] Well, at the end of the day, a sovereign state is entitled to relay or not to relay programs from Russia, but what, in that case, can viewers do? They are starved of both bread and circuses.
