This item on the council's agenda has triggered rather keen debates. The council wanted the prime minister to personally deliver a report on the government's policy and to answer their questions. Speaker of the Council of the Federation Vladimir Shumeyko told the MPs that Premier Chernomyrdin was expected to chair a meeting of the government today and then fly to Minsk. This triggered a heated discussion and the speaker was asked to begin "immediate talks" with the head of the Russian Government. It was moved to delete the item from the agenda if the premier refused to deliver the report. The government was blamed of disrespect for the upper chamber of the parliament. Chairman of the Karelian Supreme Soviet Viktor Stepanov urged his colleagues "not to stir up passions around the government" and to hear the economics minister's information, as proposed by the government, and then, possessing concrete data, to hear a report by the prime minister himself. After several futile votes, the deputies decided by a roll-call vote to meet Chernomyrdin at any time suiting him today. The discussion was interrupted by the arrival of Shokhin, who took the floor and informed the deputies on the government's plans. He stressed that the main trend of the budget policy would be to toughen financial discipline. The high rates of inflation during the past month "is not a result of the government's January policy, but of earlier decisions, and also of the political situation in mid-January, provoked by growing inflation". The economics minister recalled that it was necessary to complete the privatisation process before July 1st, and to think over the next stage of privatisation, over the "effective use of joint-stock property". In the sphere of social policy, the government plans to check the dropping living standards and to stabilise them. It is necessary to render effective support to concrete sections of the population. Shokhin admitted that the scope of latent unemployment was sufficiently large, noting that it was impermissible to stop enterprises in several sectors of the economy. Touching on the problem of the rouble zone, the minister stressed that the merger of the currencies of cis countries should not be detrimental to Russia. He noted that firm negotiations were being conducted with Belarus, "marked by sufficiently comprehensive and tough quantitative demands". The upper chamber of the Russian parliament took note of the minister's information.
