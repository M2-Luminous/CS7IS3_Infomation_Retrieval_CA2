The area in which we are now was in Muslim hands yesterday. Today this is not the case. [Zlatan Mijo Jelic, commander of the HVO in Mostar] Yes, as of today, this part of the city is in HVO hands. Only 10 meters [m] away from us you can see a building held by the Muslim Army. It is only a question of time before the HVO will take this building too. The demarcation line between us is currently between five and 10m. The Muslim army tried to push the front line into our territory. Members of the HVO's First Storm Battalion initially repelled the Muslim Army attack and then launched a counterattack, shifting the front line around Santic Street [main front line in the city center is parallel with Santic Street] and capturing a significant Muslim stronghold in the [nearby] kindergarten and five to six other well-fortified buildings. We pushed the front line about 100m forward, toward the Neretva [river, Muslims control entire left bank and part of right bank] [passage omitted]
