The Statistics Bureau said the output of industrial firms hit 366.4 billion yuan ($42.6 billion) in December, up 29.8 percent from the same month in 1992. The increase was 6.2 percent higher than the average industrial output growth in 1993. Bureau economists said banks eased their controls on the money supply late last year, spurring industrial production at the end of the year. In December, banks lent 40.4 billion yuan ($4.7 billion) more than in the same month in 1992, they noted. Inspired by the relaxed financial situation, retail sales also jumped 35.3 percent over the same one-month period last year to reach 155 billion yuan ($18 billion). This was 5.6 percent higher than the year-on-year monthly growth rate in November 1993. The bureau said the rebound in production and sales was partly attributable to the government's new reform measures. In December, when the central government decided to reform its tax system and further deregulate prices, grain and household electrical appliances became hot sellers on the domestic market. The buying spree for agricultural products and high-value-added durables triggered a year-on-year consumer prices growth of 23.9 percent in the 35 largest cities, the bureau noted. The volume of grain sales increased by 1.41 million tons over December 1992. The counter-measures adopted by the government have, however, worked to stabilize the market prices of grain and cooking oil, while the State Council is taking steps to control the prices of other commodities bureau officials said. However, the taxes and profits generated by State firms listed in the government budget also doubled from December 1992 to the last month of 1993. State factories, which only experienced a 5.5 percent increase in output in November last year, had a year-on-year increase of 13.9 percent in output which totalled 174.9 billion yuan ($20.3 billion).
