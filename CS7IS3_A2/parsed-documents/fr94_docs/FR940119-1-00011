FR940119-1-00011 FR940119-1-00004 14 CFR Parts 21 and 23 [Docket No. 118CE, Notice No. 23&hyph;ACE&hyph;76] Special Conditions, Ballistic Recovery Systems, Modified for Small General Aviation Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed special conditions. SUMMARY: This notice proposes special conditions for the supplementary type certification of the Ballistic Recovery Systems, Inc., parachute recovery system installed in small general aviation airplanes. This system is referred to as the GARD. Modifications to airplanes using this system will incorporate novel or unusual design features associated with a parachute recovery system for which the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards. This notice contains the proposed safety standards that the administrator finds necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to the original certification basis for these airplanes DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comment on this proposal may be mailed in duplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Regional Counsel, ACE&hyph;7, Attention: Rules Docket Clerk, Docket No. 118CE, room No. 1558, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. All comments must be marked: Docket No. 118CE. Comments may be inspected in the Rules Docket weekdays, except Federal holidays, between 7:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: J. Lowell Foster, Aerospace Engineer, Standards Office (ACE&hyph;110), Small Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service; Central Region, Federal Aviation Administration, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, MO 64106; telephone (816) 426&hyph;5688. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of these special conditions by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the regulatory docket or notice number and be submitted in duplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments specified in this notice will be considered by the Administrator before taking action on these proposals. The proposals contained in this notice may change in light of the comments received. All comments submitted will be available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested parties both before and after the closing date for submission of comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket. Background On January 12, 1987, Ballistic Recovery Systems, Inc. (BRS), 9242 Hudson Boulevard, Lake Elmo, Minnesota 55042, filed an application for a supplemental type certificate (STC) to install the GARD&hyph;150 parachute recovery system on Cessna 150/A150 Series and 152/A152 Model Airplanes. Subsequently they received the STC under Special Condition 23&hyph;ACE&hyph;33, dated November 17, 1987. The parachute recovery system is intended to recover an airplane in emergency situations such as mid-air collision, loss of engine power, loss of airplane control, severe structural failure, pilot disorientation, or pilot incapacitation with a passenger on board. The GARD&hyph;150 system, which is only used as a last resort, is intended to prevent serious injuries to the airplane occupants by parachuting the airplane to the ground. BRS followed their STC on the Cessna 150/A150 and 152/A152 Series with a request for special conditions on a GARD system that would be applicable to most general aviation airplanes. The nature of the parachute recovery system applies to most general aviation airplanes instead of each airplane model needing separate special conditions. Parachute recovery systems typically consist of a parachute packed in a canister mounted on the airframe. A solid propellant rocket motor or compressed air may deploy the canopy and is usually located on the side of the canister. A door positioned above the canister seals the canister, parachute canopy, and rocket motor from the elements and provides free exit when the canopy is deployed. These systems are deployed by a mechanical pull handle mounted so that the pilot and passenger can reach it. At least two separate and independent actions are required to deploy the system.
