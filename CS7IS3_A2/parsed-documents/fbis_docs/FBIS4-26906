After hearing reports by the party school of the provincial party committee, Cheng Weigao stated his views about issues of how to strengthen the party school and solve the problems in cadres' education. He stressed that to develop the economy, emphasis should be placed on cadres; and that to improve cadres, emphasis should be placed on party schools. Cheng Weigao said that at present, attention should be paid to four aspects of party school work. First, we should conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the central instructions concerning the strengthening of the party school work and further clarify the nature, characteristics, obligations, reform direction, and objectives of the party school. Under the leadership of the party committee, party school is the school to educate and train the party's cadres according to the requirements of the socialist modernization, is an important front for training leading cadres at all levels, developing the theoretical backbone, and studying and doing research of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and is also the furnace for cadres to strengthen the tempering of the party spirit. Party schools at all levels should place their work emphasis on enhancing the quality of cadres, especially the quality of party and government leading cadres at all levels, and, through party school education, further turn party and government cadres, especially leading cadres, into ones who meet the needs in developing the socialist market economy and who have political integrity and ability, strong party spirit, and good work style. Party schools at all levels should conscientiously carry out the spirit of the "opinions of the CPC Central Committee on strengthening the party school work under the new situation" and successfully conduct party school reform closely, in line with the actual conditions of Hebei and guided by the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. This overall principle must be firmly adhered to. What kind of talented persons should party schools train, what are the problems of the persons to be trained, and what problems should we emphatically solve in developing these types of talented persons? If this question and the objective of training are not clarified, the reform of the teaching of party schools will not succeed. There are three main tasks for the party school of the provincial party committee: 1) To cultivate leading cadres, 2) to play a teacher-training role among party schools and train teachers for party schools at all levels, and 3) to conduct theoretical study. The first two points are the main focus. Reform is the way to successfully build the two civilizations in Hebei, and the crux is cadres. The party school assumes the main responsibility of enhancing the quality and the level of cadres. Second, in the reform of the education of the party school, we should emphasize mastery of one theory, learning of two knowledges, establishment of one concept, and initiation of one spirit. The one theory is the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. At present, many cadres in Hebei still have a long way to go to thoroughly understand and comprehensively master Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. For example, they often fail in handling the three cardinal issues on work practice. 1) They fail to uphold well the cardinal viewpoint that "development is the essential criterion." 2) They fail to uphold the criterion of "three advantages." When anything comes up, some cadres still contemplate first upon whether it belongs to socialism or capitalism and banish the "three advantages" from their minds. 3) They fail to successfully adhere to the policy of "attaching equal importance to two tasks and never wavering in either." One manifestation is "doing well in one task but not in the other;" and the other is that both tasks are not done well. Even persons in charge of the spiritual civilization do not do tasks well and lack boldness and assurance. Hence, party schools at all levels should regard the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the central substance of their teaching, adhere to arming leading cadres at all levels and the whole party with this theory without wavering, work with perseverance, and, by our effort, enable party and government leading cadres at all levels to have a comprehensive, in-depth, and correct understanding of the scientific system of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to firmly and consciously adhere to the party's basic line. Knowledge of the socialist market economy and knowledge of modern science and technology comprise the two knowledges. A large number of our comrades are influenced by the system of the planned economy and are accustomed to the old, stereotypical way of thinking and working. They apply lots of old thinking and very little new knowledge. For young cadres, the socialist market economy and modern scientific and technological knowledge are also a new field of knowledge. Therefore, unless the vast number of cadres across the province take the learning of the two knowledges as a priority, they cannot meet the requirements of reform, opening up, and the development of the socialist market economy. Party schools at all levels should make the "two knowledges" an essential element in teaching. One concept refers to the concept of the party spirit. Some of our leading cadres, with few years of party standing and little party nurturing, joined the party without any test or risk. Some cadres lack revolutionary steadfastness, and their party spirit and sense of the party are vague. They have not established a correct outlook on the world, life, and values, and they cannot adopt the correct attitude towards the relations between the individual and the organization and between the individual and the masses. Some cadres do not even know the party's elementary rules. Thus it can be seen that the political quality of the cadre contingent is in need of prompt improvement. As party schools are the schools of the party, they should stress the education on the party spirit and give priority to strengthening the cultivation and tempering of cadres with party spirit. One spirit is the spirit of arduous effort in pioneering a new cause. Some cadres are influenced by the ideas of money worship, pleasure-seeking, and extreme individualism. They seek fame and gain, covet comfort, and lack the spirit of sacrifice, solid work, arduous efforts, and pioneering of an undertaking. They lack arduous efforts in work, in thinking, and in style, their spirit in making painstaking and enterprising efforts is weak, and they have thrown away the fine traditions and work styles of the party. In view of the actual ideological level of cadres, party schools should intensify the education on arduous effort to call back the cadres' spirit of pioneering an undertaking through arduous effort so that their political quality can be improved significantly. Third, the crux of running party schools well is to pay attention to the teaching and research contingent. Party school teachers are the backbone force of party school education. All party school teachers, backbone force of teaching, and administrative leading cadres must possess higher political and vocational quality. Above all, they should be tempered well with party spirit to continuously upgrade their level of party spirit. Party schools should stick to the policy of integrating theory with practice in their teaching. Teaching from book to book and from theory to theory without knowing practice and the ideological trend of cadres, they cannot solve problems. The organization department and the propaganda department should often study party school work with the party school of the provincial party committee and provide it with the materials concerning the ideological and the working conditions of the cadre contingent. The organization department and the actual working department must give support and convenience for party school teachers to conduct social survey and investigation and study. Party school teachers may work in departments, bureaus, cities, counties, and enterprises. The party school of the provincial party committee may also organize and send groups to outside the border and outside the country to conduct observation activities or undergo training in order to widen their field of vision and constantly strengthen the ability of integrating theory with practice. Fourth, party committees at all levels must conscientiously attach importance to party school work and really solve the practical problems in the construction of party schools. The primary task of party committees at all levels is to pay attention to the building of the cadre contingent; and to improve the cadre contingent, party schools should be improved. To develop the economy, emphasis should be placed on cadres; and to improve cadres, emphasis should be placed on party schools. Two points should be focused in building the party school. 1) We should build a good contingent of the party school, stabilize it, and continuously improve its overall quality. We should make sure that this contingent is improving and be concerned about its work and life. 2) We should build the infrastructure of party schools well, improve the condition of running schools, and continuously enhance the ability of running schools. The construction of the party school is an important aspect of party building, and there should be no grudge in investing in this aspect and spending money on party building and the spiritual civilization. With regard to teaching, capital construction projects, the teachers and the students' work, and some specific problems in learning, Cheng Weigao along with the comrades of the departments directly under the province studied the opinions on ways to deal with them and resolved a batch of problems in need of urgent solutions. Li Zhanshu, standing committee member and secretary general of the provincial party committee, attended the on-the-spot handling of work.
