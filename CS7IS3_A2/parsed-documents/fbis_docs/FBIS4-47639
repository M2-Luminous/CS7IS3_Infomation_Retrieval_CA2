FBIS TRENDS-24MAY94-CROATIA Tudjman Renews Threat to Use Force Against RSK Tudjman Renews Threat to Use Force Against RSK Indicating his frustration at the lack of progress in implementing the March ceasefire plan and the postponement of talks with separatist Serbs on confidence building measures, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has issued an ultimatum demanding that control of the UN Protected Areas (UNPA's) be returned to the Croatian Government by September. In a 21 May speech, he pledged that the Croatian Government would "do its utmost" to regain control of Serb-held territory--the so-called Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK)--"in a peaceful way," declaring that this process must be completed "within the current mandate" of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) that expires on 30 September. If negotiations fail, he warned, Croatia "will use all means to which it is entitled as an internationally recognized and sovereign" state to establish legal control over "every inch of Croatian soil" once the current UNPROFOR mandate expires (Zagreb TV, 21 March). In recent weeks Tudjman and his government have expressed growing frustration with UNPROFOR's "inefficiency" in halting the "crimes" of the "Serb terrorists and occupiers" and complained about the lack of progress in holding the talks envisioned by the 30 March ceasefire agreement (Zagreb TV, 15 and 20 May). Tudjman's 21 May remarks mark a sharp break with the policy he had followed since November 1993 of avoiding threats to use force to reintegrate the UNPA's. At that time, Tudjman had announced a "peace initiative" on 2 November 1993 to seek a "political solution", after acknowledging that his government's policies had created an impression with "parts of the Serbian population" of Croatia that the conflict with the RSK would be resolved by "military means" and "ethnic cleansing" (Zagreb TV, 2 November). In the following months, he and other Croat leaders, while not giving an absolute guarantee that the Croatian government would eschew an eventual military solution, had carefully avoided threatening to use force against the Krajina Serbs (Trends, 15 December 1993, pages 47-51).
