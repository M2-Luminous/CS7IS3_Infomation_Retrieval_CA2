Kim Kil-song, 31 of Sinuiju, North Pyong-an Province, told a press conference that lately North Korean loggers are forced to earn rubles by doing household chores at Russian homes or manual work at Russian industries. ``These extra works are at the instructions of Kim Chong-il after logging failed to fetch money due to the lack of transportation means. But workers have been obliged to contribute up to 90 percent of the money they earn in extra work to North Korea,'' Kim said. The defector said he escaped Siberia after he learned his protest over the compulsory contribution was reported to security authorities. He said that after the escape he managed to reach Vladivostok where he could stealthly board a Pusan-bound Russian freighter with the help of a Korean-Chinese there. Kim said North Korea's head logging office is in Khabarovsk, which he said controls nine field logging yards in Siberia. Until 1975, prison inmates and those who had just served out their terms were shipped to Siberia, he said, adding that thereafter, however, ordinary people were recruited because prisoners were often involved in troubles. Kim said that during his military service in North Korea, he personally took part in digging a tunnel near Kaesong which he said was for use in holding nuclear. [sentence as received] ``I heard that they were mining uranium at an uranium mine near Pyongsan County, North Hwanghae Province,'' he said. The defector said that also during his active service, Army officers used to boast during lectures, ``the United States are afraid of us as we have nuclear arms. We even can reject nuclear inspections.''
