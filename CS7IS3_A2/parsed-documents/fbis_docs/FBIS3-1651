The Datong-Jungar railway and the Jining-Tongliao railway, which will soon be completed, are expected to bring common prosperity to the eastern and western parts of the autonomous region. In addition, ten leading highway projects are still under construction. Infrastructure facilities at the border posts like Erenhot and Manzhouli, bordering on Mongolia and Russia, were also improved last year. The energy industry in the autonomous region grew rapidly last year as generators with a capacity of 574,000 kilowatts were installed, pushing the total installed capacity to nearly 4.68 million kilowatts. Construction of a number of other national key projects, including several coal mines and copper mines, is also well on its way.
