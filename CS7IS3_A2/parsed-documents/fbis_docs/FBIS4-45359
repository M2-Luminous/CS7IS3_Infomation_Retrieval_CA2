He added that it is a priority to hold a high-level meeting to coordinate joint actions. [Begin recording] Mulino: If the U.S. Government confirms it, we will hold a meeting at the highest level in Panama during the first week of July. I will preside over this meeting, and it is to be attended by very important U.S. State and Justice Department, perhaps even U.S. Treasury, officials to discuss all the drug trafficking and money laundering problems. As you will recall, on 13 April I sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher telling him that, instead of talking and arguing whether we have cooperated or not, I invited him to a high-level meeting in Panama to discuss this topic. The invitation has been accepted and, hopefully, will be held during the first week of July. [end recording]
