In a statement for the "Signals of the Day" program on Polish Radio First Program, Minister Miller recalled that, in accordance with yesterday's decisions by the Trilateral Commission, the talks on 4 May will concern the wage control law, the implementation of the State Enterprise Pact, and changes in tax regulations. These problems, Leszek Miller pointed out, recur in the trade union demands. Minister Miller called yesterday's decision by the Solidarity's Protest Action Headquarters to hold strikes on 4, 5, and 6 May incomprehensible. He stressed that implementation of the trade union demands can only be achieved through negotiation. According to Miller, the possible Solidarity strikes announced for next week can only hamper the talks in the Trilateral Commission.
