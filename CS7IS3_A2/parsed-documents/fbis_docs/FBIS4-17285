The social policy gives priorities to the following: prevention of any lowering of the population's level of incomes, preserving of the balance between economic interests and material opportunities of three major population groups: hired workers, entrepreneurs, and disabled citizens. To this effect Chernomyrdin indicated that the tax reform to which he pays the greatest significance is to be the key element of the social policy.

The government's presidium returned for revision the draft of the federal program on assistance in the population's employment in 1994 prepared by the Federal Employment Service. As Chernomyrdin said, the document does not properly point out measures for helping in the employment of those who graduate from educational institutions, does not take into consideration investment programs the implementation of which the unemployed can be involved. A governmental commission headed by Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov has been formed to revise the federal program.
