Do you believe that more acts of reciprocal violence will adversely affect the peace process? [Rabin] I believe that the Israeli Government and its prime minister and the PLO and its chairman Yasir 'Arafat must pursue two parallel courses simultaneously. The first course is to focus on the negotiations to reach an agreement on the Gaza-Jericho First accord. This, in my opinion, is the best response to the enemies of peace from among the Israelis and Palestinians. The second course is that when a mistake is made either by the Israelis or the Palestinians, such as an act of violence or terrorism, especially if it is directed against innocent people, we must show [sentence incomplete]. For example, the Hebron massacre, which was committed by a mentally disturbed Israeli murderer, is as serious as the attack on the bus that was carrying innocent Israelis. Both the Palestinian and Israeli sides must show that we have reached a point in which we are trying to resolve the conflict by negotiations and not by violence and terrorism. I myself did not listen to the shouts of the demonstrators in Israeli towns after the brutal acts which Hamas and Islamic Jihad carried out in Afula and Hadera. I explained to the Israeli public that we will continue the negotiations without delay or postponement. The PLO suspended the talks with Israel for a month following the Hebron massacre. A number of Israelis asked me why they stopped the talks after the Hebron massacre and we did not halt them after the terrorist attacks against us. My answer was that I am doing what I believe to be correct. I explained this stand of mine in my telephone conversation with Chairman 'Arafat. I believe if we want to give a real response to the enemies of peace, we must show them that we can reach an agreement and implement it. Any terrorist activity and any act of violence against Israeli and Palestinian citizens aims at obstructing the attainment and implementation of an agreement. In the telephone conversation I explained to 'Arafat that we will continue the negotiations as scheduled on Sunday despite the terrorist acts. Our delegation will leave for Cairo to resume the talks on Monday. You might ask me why the talks were postponed from Sunday to Monday. My answer is that the postponement was in response to a request from the Palestinian side. [Al-Hinnawi] Will an agreement be signed in Cairo between the Palestinians and Israel before the end of April and during the upcoming tour of the U.S. Secretary of State to the region? [Rabin] In accordance to what was agreed upon in Cairo in December, we must take into consideration that if we do not prepare well for the upcoming meeting, it will mean failure. And failure means frustration and disappointment. Therefore, in the last meeting in Cairo we agreed on the following: 1. Whatever is agreed upon will be written down and initialed. 2. Matters on which no agreement is reached will be divided into two parts: A. Topics necessary for inclusion in the agreements that precede the implementation. B. Topics that we will continue to discuss but that are not in existing agreements; these are topics that will not prevent us from implementing the agreement. This is how we are working. I believe we have reached agreement on most solutions and basic points. Anything on which agreement is reached and which is signed must not be reopened for discussion. For example, the Declaration of Principles that we signed in Washington and the Cairo agreement and the maps appended to it will not be reopened for discussion. If we do this, we will be going around in a vicious circle. We have already wasted a lot of time discussing matters on which agreement had been reached in the previous two agreements. [Al-Hinnawi] Certain reports say that if no agreement is reached by the end of this month, you will implement what was actually agreed upon. [Rabin] We must sign an agreement that it is possible to implement. In other words, when we hold negotiations over peace with an Arab state, the agreement should be clear. Our negotiations must revolve around the meaning of peace, the issue of borders, the security arrangements, the stages of the implementation of the agreement, and whether the various stages will overlap in a way similar to what happened with Egypt. But what we are trying to do with the Palestinians is peaceful coexistence without division or clear lines, because there are no dividing lines. For example, as regards the route between Gaza and Jericho and which falls within Israel's borders, we must allow the Palestinians to use this route. We must, therefore, agree on the security arrangements concerning this point. This is more difficult than reaching a peace agreement with Jordan, Lebanon, or even Syria. The agreement with the Palestinians is a temporary one, for self-rule. We have approved many of the Palestinians' demands because we don't want to waste time in search of this or that change. [Al-Hinnawi] Did you start any unofficial secret talks with Syria as you did with the PLO far from the press and spotlights? [Rabin] As far as I recall, we tried to arrange a quiet meeting with the Syrians. But they refused. I believe that without a quiet and unannounced meeting, it would be difficult to reach an agreement. Recent history explains this. Since 1977, no agreement has been reached without holding unannounced preliminary contacts. Even President Anwar al-Sadat's visit to Jerusalem could not have been made had it not been for the unpublicized preliminary talks between al-Tuhami [an adviser to al-Sadat] and Moshe Dayan in Morocco during the summer of 1977. It was a long time before the majority of the Israeli cabinet members knew about these talks. The same thing happened with the other Arab countries. Let me say frankly, it would have been impossible to reach agreement with any Arab state and the PLO without the secret talks that preceded the publicized talks. [Al-Hinnawi] Does the long calm on the Syrian front mean that Syria is fully concerned with peace and that President al-Asad is fully prepared for peace? And do you believe that Syria could accept something less than Egypt accepted during the complete withdrawal from the Egyptian territory? And is it conceivable that a government led by you could refuse to sign an agreement with Syria similar to that signed between the Likud and Egypt? [Rabin] Let me tell you the real difference between the Egypt-Israel peace process and the situation between Syria and Israel. As regards Egypt, President al-Sadat took an extremely courageous step when he came to Israel. He managed to convince the Israeli people that there is an Egyptian leader who decided not to continue the war and confrontation and to get involved in the peace process and negotiations without this changing Egypt's view regarding the achievement of peace. President al-Sadat did 80 percent of what was expected from the Israeli Government and the prime minister of that time in order to convince the Israeli people to pay the price of peace. The Israeli people hold the same feelings toward President Mubarak, who has for 12 and half years of the 15-year old peace between Egypt and Israel been safeguarding and promoting the peace process. But President al-Asad has not done even one percent of what Egypt has done to establish peace. He did not even declare frankly his desire for peace. I agree with you that there are no acts of aggression on the Syrian-Israeli front. But had it not been for Syria's help, the 10 Palestinian rejectionist organizations led by Ahmad Jibril, Hawatimah, Habash, Abu-Musa, and others or even Hizballah would not be able to do what they are currently doing. Syria talks peace and at the same time allows these organizations to attack 'Arafat and the PLO because of their negotiations with Israel. Syria is not only hosting these organizations, but it also allows them to operate in Lebanon. Therefore, although Syria is not directly involved in acts of aggression against Israel, it has made it possible for them to act. These organizations would have never been able to act had it not been for Syria. [Al-Hinnawi] Very well, Mr. Rabin. You said that when President Anwar al-Sadat came to Israel he did 80 percent of the Israeli Government's work, because he persuaded the Israelis that he was serious about peace. What if another Arab leader, President Hafiz al-Asad for example, were to visit Israel? Perhaps you would later conclude that he failed to impress the Israeli public with his seriousness about peace? [Rabin] It is not necessary for al-Asad or anyone else to come to Israel. Let me tell you something. Why have I insisted that Palestinian-Israeli negotiations take place in Cairo and not Washington? To avoid publicity. Another thing. We believe that Egypt has done so much and we appreciate that. We appreciate what President Husni Mubarak and his government are doing to help the two sides, quietly and backstage. When Syria went to the Washington talks, the talks were conducted on a relatively small scale. However, every journalist expected a statement to come out of every meeting. This is not the best way to work things out. The talks should begin unofficially, quietly, and away from the media. I would not call for a meeting between me and President al-Asad tomorrow. Such a meeting would not be useful without quiet preparations. [Al-Hinnawi] Reports speak of rapprochement between Israel and a number of Arab countries. Can you clarify the picture for us a little? [Rabin] I believe that peace between Egypt and Israel is what broke the ice between Israel and Arab countries. Undeniably, Egypt is the largest and most important Arab country. In my modest opinion, Egypt has proved that peace can be achieved and maintained. Another thing. When I took over as prime minister, the Madrid Conference formula was already in place. We did nothing to change that formula, but sought to create another channel. We figured that the two keys to peace in the region are in the hands of the Palestinians and the Syrians. Jordan wants to be out in front [as published]. Lebanon does not want to do anything without Syria's approval. We studied the situation and reached the conclusion that it is better to begin with the Palestinians on the basis of two conditions; one is mutual recognition and the second is a statement of principles. We made a historic change in our policy toward the PLO. This change was based on the conditions we agreed upon and later the letters of mutual recognition appended to the Declaration of Principles. Once we moved toward implementing the Declaration of Principles, the ball started rolling. For example, the multilateral talks of the Water Committee will begin in Muscat, Oman, today. Early next month, the Arms Limitation Committee of the multilateral talks will meet in Qatar. This would have been unthinkable only a year and half ago. We have begun to see change and its continuation depends to a large extent on the Palestinians and the Syrians. As for Morocco, it has a large Jewish community. Actually, there is unofficial normalization between Morocco and Israel. Israeli citizens can go to Morocco to try and improve economic ties between the two countries. Israeli tourists are also allowed into Morocco. You must not forget that, in 1977, King Hassan helped organize a meeting between senior Egyptian and Israeli officials in Morocco, a meeting that helped set the peace process in motion. Although there are no diplomatic ties between Israel and Morocco, relations between us are good. Our relations with Tunisia may not be quite as good as those with Morocco. But the mere fact that the PLO leadership is located in Tunisia and that many Israelis, particularly journalists, go there is a measure of the level of relations between the two countries. [Al-Hinnawi] Do you believe that Russia still has a part to play in the peace process? [Rabin] Russia is one of the two countries sponsoring the peace talks. I will visit Moscow on 24 April to meet President Yeltsin. Chairman 'Arafat will also visit Russia to meet Yeltsin on 18 and 19 of this month. [Al-Hinnawi] Is there not a possibility of a meeting between you and 'Arafat in Moscow? [Rabin] I do not think so. [Al-Hinnawi] Is U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to the region at the end of this month linked to the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement? [Rabin] I do not think so. If we can reach an agreement during this time, it will be good. Christopher is coming to the region basically to give a boost to the multilateral talks. [Al-Hinnawi] I would like to convey to you a message from the people of Gaza. I was there last week and saw for myself the extent of the people's suffering as a result of sealing off the Gaza Strip. The people in Gaza say that the recent acts of terrorism did not come from Gaza. The Israeli Army and police are imposing a security cordon around the city. Supplies of medicines and oxygen necessary for surgery have stopped and students are not going to their colleges and workers are not going to work. Will this continue? [Rabin] This is untrue. I know nothing about the stoppage of medicine and oxygen supplies. I gave orders to supply the Gaza population with their needs. The territories were sealed only for those who come to work in Israel. [Al-Hinnawi] Soldiers order drivers of vehicles carrying oxygen and heading for the Gaza Strip to go back. [Rabin] There is absolutely no need for such measures. Even in Jerusalem we made special arrangements for doctors, nurses, and workers in Palestinian hospitals and Palestinians working for international organizations to go to work. All these workers obtained licenses enabling them to go to work. The same thing applies to Gaza. [Al-Hinnawi] The Palestinians in Gaza are wondering why the Israeli Government is taking these measures right before its withdrawal and before the Palestinian authority undertakes its mission. Are these the good-neighborly relations that Israel is talking about? Israel is giving the worst picture of the future neighborly relations it is seeking. [Rabin] Yes, but you must not forget that I do not know who will carry out the next terrorist operation. [Al-Hinnawi] But you, Mr. Prime Minister, are meting out collective punishment that is harming innocent people. [Rabin] I have no option but to continue sealing off the occupied areas in order to know what is going on and then to decide what I can do. [Al-Hinnawi] Despite the security cordon imposed on the Gaza Strip, numerous acts of violence occurred recently. The Palestinians in Gaza are wondering about the use of this security seal. [Rabin] You do not know the number of operations that have been foiled as a result of sealing off the territories. I told the Israelis that even after the territories were sealed off we could not completely prevent terrorist operations. In Jerusalem, for instance, the Palestinians used a vehicle with Israeli plates and were able to move in all parts of Israel. In certain areas the Israelis and Palestinians are only meters away from each other. There are no walls and we do not want walls. I would like to tell you as a fact that there are Israeli businessmen who have received Palestinian workers in the heart of Israel for months without obtaining a permit. We cannot search every house. In the two cases involving killing and violence, we found out that two Palestinians from Khan Yunus had been in Israel since December. The real problem is that the situation was so aggravated because of the Hebron massacre that certain members of terrorist organizations were aroused to the point that they decided in a moment of extreme anger to wield knives and hatchets to attack Israelis. Regrettably, no device has yet been invented to reveal man's inner intentions.
