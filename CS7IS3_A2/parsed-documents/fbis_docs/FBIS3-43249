The commander, who asked to be labelled by his combat name of "Sizwe", said small attacks had already been carried out in the province and that more would follow, urging people to leave "Occupied Azania." "In line with Apla's declaration that 1993 was the year of the great storm, Apla units in Natal will pounce on the enemy. The year will end with a thunder in Natal. This holiday will be a bloody one. All the tourists in occupied Azania must leave if they want to live." Sizwe also threatened that the ANC's [African National Congress] armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, MK], could soon become a target of Apla. "If MK joins the peacekeeping force, then they will become legitimate targets."
