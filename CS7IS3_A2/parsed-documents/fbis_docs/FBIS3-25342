According to a summary of the sub-council's deliberations presented to the Executive Council on Tuesday, the Executive Management Committee has mandated a sub-committee to examine the problem. The sub-council said the South African Defence Force had explained that without conscription there were no riflemen to draw upon and that new defence force recruits had not completed their training. The sub council said practical solutions had to be found to rectify the racial composition if the peacekeeping force was to play a positive role in ensuring peaceful transition. A joint Executive Council, defence force and defence sub council team is expected to finalise the peacekeeping force's budget by next week.
