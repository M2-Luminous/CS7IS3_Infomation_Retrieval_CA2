Speaking on Czech Radio, Klaus said that the world would smile at Baudys's initiative to solve the Bosnian conflict and doubt the very thing "which we are continuously trying to convey to the world -- that we are a normal country." Baudys acquainted journalists on Saturday with his proposal to end the Bosnian conflict, admitting that he had consulted neither the government nor parliament. Under the proposal, the conflict would be solved mainly by a good will committee, which would be entrusted by the UN. To supervise the situation. The committee would comprise several states connected by religion with the Bosnian warring parties, for instance, Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey, France, and Italy. Klaus said the sharp criticism of Baudys at Monday's session of the Executive Council of the Civic Democratic Party, of which Klaus is the Chairman, was not aimed at his immediate dismissal. But Baudys's move cannot be passed over in silence, Klaus pointed out.
