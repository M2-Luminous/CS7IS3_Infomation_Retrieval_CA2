Indications are that the Angolan foreign minister will present Luanda's latest national reconciliation proposals to Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola, confirmed today that the government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] will resume their peace talks in Lusaka tomorrow, after the festive season recess. The UN special representative announced this to the media shortly before leaving Luanda for quick visits to Gabon and Zaire. He will be briefing the heads of state of those two countries on the reality of the situation at the Angolan peace talks. It is also noteworthy that a team of U.S. senators is to arrive in Luanda today, after postponing their scheduled visit late last year. Gustavo Costa, our correspondent in Angola, provides some details concerning the national reconciliation counterproposal that Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura will be presenting to the UN secretary general today. [Begin Costa recording] According to a source close to the Angolan peace talks, the new national reconciliation counterproposal includes three ministerial portfolios for UNITA to be indicated by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, two to be suggested by Prime Minister Marcolino Moco, and at least three embassies to be led by UNITA, among other new developments. Angolan Foreign Affairs Minister Venancio de Moura is expected to deliver that proposal to UN Secretary General Butrus Burtrus-Ghali in New York today. Some observers feel that Venancio de Moura's call on the UN secretary general one day before the talks are due to resume in Lusaka shows that the Luanda government intends to use Butrus Butrus-Ghali's personal influence with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi so the latter will accept the government's counterproposal and will agree to the setting of a date to sign the cease-fire accord. Diplomatic sources say that Luanda's response suggests an attempt to meet UNITA's initial proposal halfway. It is already known, however, that UNITA will not be given some key ministries it has demanded. Luanda is reported to have shown inflexibility concerning the Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Interior Ministries, but it may be more open to UNITA holding ministerial portfolios linked to social and production sectors. Luanda is keeping open the possibility that UNITA will retain the Culture Ministry and it has replied that UNITA will only control three of the six embassies it has demanded. Meanwhile, moves linked to the Angolan peace process are not taking place in New York alone. In fact, the seriousness of this country's situation is such that a team of U.S. congressmen [as heard] has come to Luanda to assess on the ground the complexity of a problem whose solution seems increasingly linked to a higher U.S. profile in a bid to reduce mistrust between the government and UNITA. Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos received the U.S. team in Luanda this afternoon, but UNITA, through its Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel radio station, has already announced that it would like to see the team of U.S. congressmen in Huambo tomorrow to discuss troop demobilization and national reconstruction issues with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi. It appears, though, that such a visit is not on the agenda of the U.S. congressmen's stay in Angola. An official source has disclosed that, contrary to initial reports by sources in the Angolan Parliament, tomorrow the U.S. team will visit Malange rather than Bie [Cuito]. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, the (?key figure) in the negotiation process, is one person who does not appear to be satisfied with half measures. Today, he stopped over in Libreville, the Gabonese capital, and Gbadolite, in Zaire. Upon his return from Sao Tome and Principe yesterday, UN Special Representative Blondin Beye said that military issues will not be up for discussion again when peace talks resume in the Zambian capital tomorrow. Diplomatic sources say that such issues will only be the subject of adjustments when the government and UNITA military leaders meet in Sao Tome on 10 January to define practical measures conducive to the signing and effective implementation of the cease-fire accord.
