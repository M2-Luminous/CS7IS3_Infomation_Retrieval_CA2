Asked about the precise date when sanctions against the FRY will be lifted, Zhirinovskiy said that this will happen "the day after the results of the elections for new Russian president are revealed." He pointed out that he will speak at a rally in Belgrade's Republic Square to mark the 49th anniversary of the victory against German fascism and imperialism, regardless of the fact that the rally has been banned. According to Zhirinovskiy, the ban was not unexpected. He sees it as a "maneuver" because, as he pointed out, "somebody wants to be friends with both us and the NATO, but this is useless." As announced, the leader of the LDPR, who arrived at the invitation of the Serb National Renewal [SNO], is expected to meet representatives of the FRY and Serbian assemblies as well as representatives of the republic of Srpska and the republic of Serb Krajina [in Croatia]. According to Zhirinovskiy, he has arrived in Belgrade heading a "specific delegation" consisting of "representatives of legislative authorities and military experts." During his meeting with the press he reiterated his opposition to foreign involvement in the territory of former Yugoslavia and warned western states against testing the power of the Russian Army. According to him, there are two solutions to the crisis in the Balkans -- the first one is for the Balkan peoples to decide for themselves how they want to live, and the second one is to send 100,000 or 200,000 Russian soldiers, at the invitation of the Serbian side, "to bring order to the Balkans within a month." Zhirinovskiy noted that the LDPR will make efforts to have the Russian right of veto in the UN Security Council used to prevent implementation of any measures against the FRY. He accused NATO of refusing to listen to the "voice of common sense" from Moscow and of wanting to test the strength of Russia. "Our army showed what it could do 49 years ago. If they want to test its power again, they will be able to test it in their countries' capitals," Zhirinovskiy said. He stressed that another 22 June (the date when Nazi Germany attacked USSR in 1941) will not happen again, because "we will begin [our attacks] a few days before that." Stressing that the LDPR is on the Serb side, he warned: "We can drop ten times as many bombs on the towns from where the planes which bomb peaceful towns in Yugoslavia take off." State Duma Deputy President Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, who is a member of the delegation, called for a military and political alliance between the Balkans and Russia. He said that under the Balkans he also means the new states -- the republic of Srpska and the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK]. He said that the invitations extended to the presidents of the RS and RSK, Radovan Karadzic and Milan Martic, are signs of recognition of the new states. SNO president Mirko Jovic explained that the SNO invited Zhirinovskiy because "the LDPR is the only force in the world that can destroy the ghastly idea of the so-called unitary world state," and also because they want to give relevant information to the Russian delegation, which they will need in the discussion on the lifting of the sanctions in the Russian parliament.
