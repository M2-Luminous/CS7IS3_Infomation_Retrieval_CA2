As compared with last year, the number of those ill with syphilis increased ten-fold, and with gonorrhea, by twenty per cent. According to the data of the dermatovenerologic dispensary, the majority of the patients are nonworking individuals and students up to thirty years of age. With regard to the primary sources of infection, these were, in the opinion of physicians, emigrants from China and the Transcaucasian republics who enter Russia without the appropriate medical records. Director of the City Health Department, Margarita Khaltaeva, sees the legalization of prostitution, the opening up of anonymous treatment of venereal diseases, and the creation of a morals police as a possible avenue to the correction of the situation. She spoke at a meeting of the Minor Council of PeopleUs Deputies of Ulan Ude regarding the idea of opening a brothel in the capital of Buratiya.
