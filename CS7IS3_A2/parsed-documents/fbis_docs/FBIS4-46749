It was to these, in the main, that the material of journalists accredited to the visit were devoted. In actual fact, the range of issues was incomparably wider. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has already written about the jointly formulated approaches to Russia's membership of the Council of Europe and its affiliation to the Partnership for Peace, its participation in the political aspect of the Naples G-7 meeting, and the expansion of the number of permanent members of the UN Security Council. The range of problems lacking a tie-in with the present moment was not confined to these. The ceremonial act of 31 August in Berlin will definitely dot the "i" in the culminating stage of Russian-German relations. Will it be conclusive for the sphere of the Russian Federation's dealings with the rest of Europe and the world? Yeltsin believes that it could be dotted in December in Budapest at the meeting of heads of state and government of the participants in the CSCE. There, the president believes, it will be essential to harmonize the principles of the international arrangement on the basis of which we enter the 21st century. Simultaneously Yeltsin's approach will give a good boost to the more assertive activity of the CSCE, for which other abbreviations have more often been substituting in the international arena as of late. Next year the world will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, which also could be seen as the starting position for the building of the new world order. But there are certain apprehensions as to whether Russo-German relations might by this time have lost their present quality. The victory of the Social Democrats, who are currently in opposition, is expected at the November Bundestag elections. And much water will have flown in Russia also in this time. Optimists are rejecting the possibility of a cardinal change in the foreign policy course of both countries since they are in exceptional need of one another for a strengthening of their own authority in the world. Pessimists are certain of the appearance of a new balancing act. The position of Germany, following its release from the stigma of vanquished state, will, they calculate, become tougher and more demanding. In respect to Russia the arguments will amount to its increasingly distinct desire to demand respect for its geopolitical interests. There is no escaping differences under such conditions, it would seem. But the point is that this outline forgets the objective prerequisites of the joint actions of the Russian Federation and the FRG in the international arena. And no political forces can disregard them. Boris Yeltsin, incidentally, is, by all accounts, preparing for a change of guard in Bonn. The invitation to visit Moscow extended to a favorite in the struggle for the office of chancellor, Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and prime minister of the land of Rhineland-Pfalz, testifies to this. And this did not, it would seem, appear tactless in respect to Kohl but testified merely to Moscow's desire, given any political alignments, to preserve the "special" character of the relationship with Bonn, which will require serenity and farsightedness. Nor is there any desire for a loss of the latter on the Rhine, where a readiness to meet with Russian politicians of various stripes has been stated--who does not realize that the political era of Boris Yeltsin is not infinite? Thus a fitting continuation of what has been started may perfectly well be expected in the future also. A different situation could arise in international affairs. One example: The response to the announcement of Germany's decision to support Russia in its aspirations as regards the G-7 on the part, primarily, of the United States and Japan was guarded, to say the least. It softened a while later, it is true. But the possibilities of this discrepancy or the other arising in the future also cannot, it would seem, be ruled out. The vectors of temporary contradictions could take shape in other directions also. Removing the chance of their emergence if only in some is possible only by constant work on the future, into which Yeltsin and Kohl attempted at the time of the visit to peer.
