The NTV television company, which originated in the bosom of ITA Ostankino, began its permanent daily broadcasting on Channels 3 and 4 in 1993. Various things were said about the "youngster": that all the journalists who had transferred there had sold out lock, stock, and barrel to the financial group Most-Bank and that it is through their mouths that the high commercial financial circles of Russia broadcast from the screen. But discussions are discussions, and it is difficult to imagine a weekday evening without the information program "Segodnya" (anchors--Tatyana Mitkova and Mikhail Osokin) or the end of Sunday without "Itogi" (Yevgeniy Kiselev). Oleg Borisovich Dobrodeyev is a Muscovite, a specialist in modern and recent French history (MGU [Moscow State University] history faculty and graduate school), and an ace of domestic television. At one time he was the chief of all currently existing main information television services of Russia without exception. And he left it all: He was never satisfied by the concept of information broadcasting--neither on "Vesti" nor especially on ITA. Last year he finally got a chance to do things exactly as he thinks they should be done. We Are Dependent. But Only on Common Sense Independence is a fairly arbitrary thing, and those who say that TV can be completely independent today are being less than candid. Of course, we are independent of the power structures in selecting and preparing programs and we determine our own information priorities, but here we are guided by OUR OWN vision of what is happening. Watch, let us say, the news on BBC or ITN, their interpretation of the events in Southern Ireland, and you will immediately be able to see that not everything is so simple. Even the companies that frequently give only simplified outlines as information, and that is how CNN operates--an excellent service, which is remarkable in crisis situations--even they have their own particular predilections and unconditional priorities, their own sympathies and antipathies. Our company's main priorities are the same as those of other worldwide companies--NEWS. In the first place, we do not influence political events but simply register them. In the second place, we are not on the side of one or another political party or grouping and we try to give the information picture of the day in all its diversity. Information, in our view, implies a certain reasonable framework as well: We do not chase after sensational news, we try to give only verified information, we cannot allow ourselves to be too categorical in our assessments, and we do not allow those who speak on our programs to be too categorical either--whatever they may say, there is editorial control, and that is normal. Of course we do not give only pure news announcements but at the same time we have no shows with TV hosts. In the future we will try to get away from commentary. But the attitude of the host or journalist toward the event could be manifested also in the selection of information; nobody is insured against that--it is impossible to run everything through a computer so that it will have an ideal design in its final form. Nonetheless, the makeup of the program, its information portraits, each topic--these are never random on "Segodnya" or "Itogi," they do not appear in one place or another just because that is what somebody wants. And in this respect we depend only on common sense. There are socially significant events which undoubtedly influence the subsequent course of the political or economic process. Therefore, as a rule, the political news goes first, but it can also be something else that happened today but did not yesterday and will not tomorrow. For example, the loss of a person who was involved in many people's lives. For example, on the day of the death of Yevgeniy Leonov we decided to begin the program with this particular piece of news. We try to approach information from a position of universal value--human life. We always place the problems that are bothering our compatriots today in the first segment--and this is our fundamental position. Even if only to break down the stereotype of abstract state news: Here are state interests and here is the human being, who is very separate from them. The tradition of Ostankino news was precisely not to air anything that pertained concretely to a given person, whether it be Chernobyl or the tragedy in Baku. NTV Does Not Sing the Praises of Financiers I know many bankers, but this is in no way reflected in our work. People see us every day and we cannot allow ourselves such a luxury as to declare our predilections from the screen. Moreover this is unproductive: As soon as we join with one financial group or political party or another, regardless of whether they are our investors or not, our ratings will immediately start to fall. This is why we have no commercial pieces, as other leading information services now do, in which the anchor gives the lead in: "Today is the anniversary of such and such a commercial structure," and later in the middle of the information program, among other pieces, there appears a newsy but purely complimentary piece created in keeping with all the rules of commercial advertising and production. The commercial financial information is woven into the fabric of the program and it undermines confidence in everything else. Such pieces should be used only during advertising time. The problem of today's TV and of all journalism for that matter is that aesthetic boundaries are erased and ideas about what is permissible and what is not evaporate. And after the commercial financial information, which is shown daily (we are quite well aware of where and how it is placed), it is impossible to avoid the next stage, which we have encountered anyway, especially during the last election campaign. It is POLITICS FOR HIRE. NTV, incidentally, is the only company that has never given its air time to any political party for money. Naturally, they have asked us. But this was the fundamental position of both the leaders and all the workers. The strangest thing we have in journalism today is when representatives of one party or another come to an interview with an envelope in their hand. NTV's Prospects It will be simply reasonable, consisting of three components which are mainly interesting to the audience: information, entertainment, and sports. I would like for us to synthesize the BBC's balance, CNN's efficiency, and ABC's accounting for viewer interest. At the same time we understand quite well that we are living in Russia and working for a Russian audience, and we must make certain adjustments, taking into account the specific way in which we are viewed. One thing I can promise for sure--NTV will not do any political programs since they bring the lowest ratings and nobody needs them. "Itogi" is primarily analysis. And that is why those who receive it, those who do not receive it, and those who are indifferent to it are checking their political watches against it. The most difficult thing today is simply to register the event and give all existing viewpoints. Not to influence what is going on, not to have an impact on what the journalist encounters and, of course, not to harm it to any degree. Everything is filled with contradictions nowadays, and to represent it adequately to the audience without being on one side or the other is very difficult. But we think that there are some things that are inadmissible in journalism. We must not, for example, air an interview if it provokes a situation of conflict. Our Ratings Are Rising We especially order a determination of our ratings from sociological services. And so far we are satisfied--we have a fairly large number of viewers, the number is always with two figures, in the millions, naturally. Our audience is more knowledgeable than the audience of Ostankino's "Novosti" and "Vesti." We are watched by people who do not need a readymade assessment of events, who can put the facts together for themselves. Although, of course, we do not set a special goal of having news for the elite. Throughout the world companies invest colossal amounts of money in analysis of television audiences, since the rating means the value of advertising on which commercial TV exists. The value of each program is determined by its rating, which is typically determined the day after a program is aired. So far we do not intend to increase our broadcast time: We need to assimilate what we have now, which, in my view, is at fairly good times--1900 and 2200. The audience, as a rule, is not always the same and therefore no more than 20 percent of the newscast is repeated. Thus we end up with a very large amount of information broadcasting--a whole hour. Moreover, in a month or two our correspondent network will be in operation, and then it will be possible to speak further about the development of the NTV news service. For now we rely on help from stringers (nonstaff investigative reporters). The correspondent network will be fairly compact: two regional foreign correspondent bureaus--in the United States and Germany, and about 10-12 (in the first stage) in Russia and nearby foreign countries--in Vladivostok, Yekaterinburg, Rostov-on-Don, St. Petersburg, Syktyvkar, Saratov, Riga, and Tbilisi.
