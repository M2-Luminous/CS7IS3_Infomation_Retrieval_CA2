The Majles held a session yesterday and the deputies of Tuysarkan, Talesh, Eqlid, and Shadgan made speeches. Then the Majles went into session. The details of the discussion follow for the honorable readers. Seyyed Mohammad Naqbayi, Deputy From Tuysarkan Many of the Ratifications of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] Budget Have in All Practicality Faced Stagnation The first pre-agenda speaker was Naqbayi, from Tuysarkan, who offered his congratulations on the arrival of the month of Rajab and condolences on the occasion of the death of Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani and concerning the execution decree of the infidel Salman Rushdie said: This decree cannot be canceled and is a duty of any follower who takes steps to carry it out. Hence, I announce to [?Gerdip], the honorable member of the 90 Green Group of the German Parliament and all those who somehow request a reduction or cancelation of the decree, that religious decrees are irrevocable. He then said: President and Speaker of the Majles, by the approaching end of 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], it is worthy of note for us to know that many of the ratifications of the 1372 budget bill have in all practicality faced stagnation and have not been implemented. Among them is the payment of housing loans to educators and subsidies that were to be paid, failure to implement the ratification of the Majles concerning rural electricity outreach, failure to provide and implement banking loans in most ratified areas, failure to implement the laws to facilitate the construction of housing, failure to implement the law on natural gas outreach, etc., for which no justified and clear reason has been offered. He continued: I request of the honorable speaker of the Majles, as the head of the supervisory power, and the honorable president, as the head of the executive power, to pursue the matter and order the related officials to present the necessary explanations and response. The economic and foreign currency planning of the country and also the writing of the budget during the life of the Majles and prior to it indicate failure to conform words with deeds and the actions of the theoreticians, experts, and planners threaten the foundation of the economy and independence of the country. The deputy from Tuysarkan also pointed out: During this period, the vast country of the Islamic Republic of Iran has been a laboratory and the target of invasion by the planners. The masses of the deprived people and vulnerable and oppressed classes have been the tools of the implementation of experiments. The reverse is the result of the experiments of these theoreticians in small cities, oppressed regions, villages, agriculture, the rate of foreign currency, inflation, and again every day the instability of the actions of previous results and the cause of failure, dependence on the theories of Western countries, lack of intellectual independence, fear of precise implementation of economic issues and correct programs of the ideology of the Koran and Islam, and failure to understand the suffering and deprivation and taste the bitterness of hunger. Flying towards imagination without considering the existing conditions and lack of clear regulations and principles to achieve definite goals, which if continued, will ultimately confront us with the threat and many problems for the society and revolution. In another part of his speech, Naqbayi said: Concerning the roads of the city of Tuysarkan within the province and the internal roads, despite the emphasis of the president, the assembly of the deputies of the province, and the related officials, no steps have been taken to eliminate the problems. He mentioned the shortage of doctors, severance of the medicine ration of the only 24-hour pharmacy in the region by the province, and the stopping of the only national 95-bed hospital project among the problems, which since the time of the previous minister have not been eliminated, despite what was expected of Dr. Marandi. In conclusion, he asked related officials for the change of the labor and cooperative agencies to the related administrative offices, which were promised this year. Seyyed Mojtaba-'Erfani, Deputy From Talesh With All These Foreign Currency Problems, Still There Is No Agreement Between the Executive Managers and Monetary Policy Makers for the Appropriate Allocation of Our Limited Resources The second pre-agenda speaker of the Majles was Erfani, the deputy from Talesh, who offered his condolences on the death of the revered Shi'ite source of Emulation, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, and said: Our people, both old and young, proved that they love the family of the prophet, the infallible imams, and the rightful successors of the pure imams. The religious seminaries proved that they are still the banner carriers of struggle against the oppressors and the hope of the deprived and the oppressed in the world. He continued: We thank God that he has placed the describable love of the revered Shi'ite source of emulation and the religious jurist, Grand Ayatollah Khamene'i, in the hearts of the people and displayed the bravery, power, piety, and disregard of this great man for the oppressive power and his popularity. This the harbinger of the good news that, God willing, once again his honor will be the spiritual source of emulation. In continuation, he added: The sincere and revered presence of the people in the funeral procession of the revered source of emulation once again struck a hard blow to the mouth of the utterers of nonsense, who thought problems have separated people from religion and the revolution. These people, who deserve our service no matter how we serve them, tolerate all the problems but condemn making peace with a miserable America, whose poor president, in order to humiliate Muslims, lowered himself so much to meet with Salman Rushdie and is not disgraced. They also strongly hate the miserable terrorist-nurturing France, which by giving shelter to the hypocrites is trying to inflict blows on Islam and the revolution, and they must understand that we are after the implementation of religion and religious values and are not afraid of such actions at all, because today the Muslim nation has not only established an Islamic Republic regime but has also presented itself for the awakening of the Islamic world and return to lofty values. He continued: Today, the experts who believe in religion must use their minds and, by relying on God and not unfortunately under the influence of Westernized ideas, which have always caused misery and misfortune for the country, for the transition period, with appropriate reforms and in the context of the realities of the world today, design the model for the economic plan for the Five-Year Plan so that we can both take steps on the course of construction and economic blossoming and also establish divine spiritual values in the society. We must admit that accepting the dominant existing systems is never harmonious with our beliefs. The deputy from Talesh continued: What has been clarified in determining the policies governing the Second Plan by the grand leader of the government and the officials should be put on the agenda, because in the regime of the Islamic Republic, the religious guardian prepares the course for political, cultural, and economic changes through devising and approving general policies. In other words, he prepares the ground for the divine development of the regime. He added: In the face of events, incidents, and changes within the regime, we must have a change of leadership and initiative, and in the events we must not fade and wait for things to happen and then make decisions or in an isolationist, reactionary form engage in negative resistance. In planning, we must anticipate the events rather than look for a solution after an occurrence. We must engage in cultural planning and form the political and economic culture with the goals of the regime of independence. He also criticized some of the managers who are still thinking about luxury in their place of work and make improper expenditures and said: With all the foreign currency problems, still there is no understanding between the executive officials and the monetary policy makers for the appropriate allocation of our limited resources. Everyone is trying to implement the interests of his own section. Who must be accountable? For what reason have those who under the pretext of importing automobile industrial technology imported thousands of cars into the country and wasted the foreign currency of the country not been questioned. Why are these economic criminals not punished for their actions, and why have these middlemen of bankrupt foreign companies who before the interests of their country are trying to create multinational corporations done whatever they wish? The agreements in principle must also be investigated and the foreign currency given to them. Concluding, he thanked all the officials of his constituency who with solidarity have established the religious and brotherly spirit in the region and asked the government to expedite the issue of the free commercial port of Bandar Anzali. Ahmad Nikfar, Deputy From Eqlid Increased Economic Pressure Is by No Means in the Interest of Our Sacred Regime The third pre-agenda speaker of the Majles was Nikfar, from Eqlid, who offered his congratulations on the anniversary of the birthday of the fifth star of the heavens of the imamate and offering his condolences on the martyrdom of the 10th infallible imam and the death of the spiritual scholar, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, said: Global oppressors, one day by means of military invasion and another day cultural invasion and once with an economic embargo and disrupting the trade of our Islamic regime, try by creating and aggrandizing the problems to make life intolerable to our revolutionary people and by driving the people from the scene achieve their sinister goal. Considering the timely presence of our people in the unprecedented welcome of the visit of the grand leader to the province of Azerbaijan, which was comparable only to the welcoming ceremonies of the Imam of the Nation in 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979], and considering the several-million-large presence in the funeral procession of the spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, and the welcome by the Muslim people of the Central Asian and African countries of the honorable President, the Muslim people of Iran and the world have displayed their support for the Islamic regime and dear Islam. Hence, it is necessary for the Great Satan to learn a lesson not to play with the pure sentiments of and all that is sacred to the 1.5 billion Muslims in the world any longer by supporting the infidel Rushdie, the treacherous hypocrites, usurping Israel, and the bloodthirsty Serbs. It must know that behavior of this kind toward the Islamic Republic of Iran and other Islamic movements have, thank God, caused more unity of Muslims. He continued: Today, the time has come for all the high-ranking scholars of the Shi'ite school and the teachers of the seminaries to hold conferences to engage in discussions on the issue of guardianship and the successor to the Infallible Imam during the occultation in a more clear and definite manner and find a solution so that, God willing, Imam Khamene'i, who is among the most learned religious jurists, will favor us and take charge of all the affairs of Muslims. Who can doubt that if these dear ones are negligent, the creation of confusion and factionalism in the Islamic world will be certain. In continuation, addressing the Judicial Branch, he said: Unfortunately, the situation has reached a point that bloodthirsty khans, who in the past, fearing the consequences of the oppressive actions, crawled into their holes have even set traps for the faithful and dutiful judges and when they fail to make them greedy, threaten them. It has been heard that a khan, a leftover of the Qajar kings, has sent a faithful judge a message that he has the power to transfer him and find him a better position in Tehran. When he did not receive a positive response, he threatened the judge. This warning is sufficient that through a proper and intelligent reaction these new figures will be stopped from showing themselves once again, and the trust and judicial security of the committed and concerned judges will increase. The speaker continued: We are on the verge of writing and ratifying the Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget. It is necessary for the honorable Majles and the serving government, with more investigation, if the policy of economic modification is to continue, to make arrangements to help the oppressed classes and those deserving government aid, that is, the small businessmen, workers, employees, small farmers, and those under the coverage of emergency organizations, to benefit from the significant direct aid of the government in an assured and continual manner, because continuation of the existing situation, which caused more pressure on the above-mentioned classes, is by no means in the interest of our sacred regime. On the other hand, it is heard that the start of new projects in the 1373 budget and the Second Five-Year Plan has been prohibited. Yes, this is a proper action if fairness is observed in distributing the projects, especially large-scale investments. However, now that in many of the oppressed cities of the country there is no sign of large-scale investments, is it not clear and unjust discrimination to spend existing resources to complete ongoing projects, which are limited to some regions? Is deprivation eliminated from the oppressed regions merely by providing water, electricity, roads, and schools? Has the time not come for identifying and investing in the potential of the oppressed regions and the centers of economic, social, and cultural developments of those regions? He also expressed hope that in the Second Five-Year Plan a number of projects under study will be implemented to compensate for the witting and unwitting lack of attention in the past. In conclusion, he thanked the Central Office of Roads and Transport of Fars and the Construction Jihad of Eqlid and made reminders to the Cabinet concerning more attention to the agricultural sector. 'Isa Moqaddamizad, Deputy From Shadegan Ministers Must Do Their Best in Choosing Their Deputies and the General Managers 'Isa Moqaddamizad, as the last pre-agenda speaker, offered his condolences to all the people on the heartrending death of the revered Shi'ite source of emulation and, offering his congratulations on the birthday of Imam Mohammad Baqer, said: The resistant and noble people of Khuzestan in the past week hosted the old friend of the Imam and the eternal supporter of the grand leader of the revolution, Mr. Nateq-Nuri. On behalf of myself and all the deputies of this province, I thank him for all of his kindness. He thanked the people of the province of Khuzestan for their welcome to the speaker of the Majles and said: Since the Second Five-Year Plan of the government is going through its final stages, I find it necessary to remind the ministers of this point. You know that writing the above-mentioned plan took a great deal of the time of the ministers, experts, and executive officials. But more important than writing the plan is precision in its announcement and implementation. Hence, the ministers must do their best in choosing their deputies and general managers and choose individuals who at least have the following characteristics, in order for the efforts to reach fruition and the goals of the plan to be implemented. 1) Faith in the value of work, because interest in and love of work revive a sort of initiative and innovation in a human being and eliminate problems. 2) Trustworthiness and commitment; no group or guild can deny the value of purity of the self. Lofty spirit is a characteristic of men who have goals, who never sacrifice the goal for their personal inclinations. 3) Knowledge and capability. 4) Decisiveness and determination in decisions. Because of his position, a manager requires a strong will to be able to make decisive decisions after examining all sides of an issue. 5) Humility, modesty, and belonging to the people. 6) Good past history, which can encourage the officials who have chosen a manager without management [as published]. 7) Accepting criticism. The manager must see his problems in the mirror of other people's ideas and look fairly at the criticism of critics. [8)] And finally, the last characteristic of a manager is his perception. Moqaddamizad, continuing, referred to the problems of his constituency, mentioned the issue of the completion of water outreach to 88 villages of Shadegan, and said: The manager of the Water and Electricity Organization of Khuzestan, in regards to the second phase of the irrigation and drainage network of Shadegan last year, gave me false information and said that he had announced the funds for the above-mentioned phase to the Mahab-e Qods Company. But after the matter was pursued, the contrary was proved, whereas the timely implementation of this project can have a vital role for my constituency. Then, in connection with the completion of the construction operation of the educational affairs of Shadegan and payment of loans to people who reside in 80 villages, which fell victim to floods in the region, he asked the related officials for help and cooperation. Concluding, he thanked the officials of the Emergency Committee who were able to aid in the marriages of a number of brides and grooms on the birthday of her holiness Zahra. Ratification The first item on the agenda of the open session of the Majles yesterday was the report on the first round of discussions of the Islamic Guidance and Art Committee concerning the proposal to attach the National Library to the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance. Regarding the general points of the proposal, Morteza Nabavi said in support of this proposal: This library must be under the supervision of the Ministry of Guidance. In terms of comparison with other parts of the world, statistics show that in most countries, the National Library is under the supervision of the executive organization in charge of culture and information outreach issues. And if we do not want to make a comparison with other countries, in our own country, the president has a great deal to do. Since 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991], when this law was ratified, the president has had the opportunity to participate in one session and examine this matter. The deputy of the people of Tehran then rejected the reasoning of the opponents that this law has been ratified previously and it would not be proper for the Majles to change it and said: The charter of this library, which has been ratified by the Majles, is not supposed to change. Only the place of the library, which concerns the Ministry of Guidance, will be changed. He also added: Some of the opponents have stated that we shall have the problem of parallel organizations. Some of our colleagues have reached the conclusion that this law should be amended, like other laws, and put in place. This is very logical. This action will include the elimination of parallel organizations as the president at the present manages this task, and also it is the duty of the Ministry of Guidance. Dr. Sheybani said in opposition to the proposal: We have one library so large in the country, and that is the National Library, which must be operated under the supervision of the highest executive authority in the country, who should have an open hand and provide more resources. When this issue came up, I went to the president and said, Is there any reason why you cannot attend to this library? He said: "No, in fact, I can provide more resources." He then said: We should not do something to bring the National Library to the level of other libraries and then ultimately be unable to attend to it. This library is a national treasure, not to mention that its president is a person who was the minister of guidance once and previously engaged in vast propaganda in Europe in the Hamburg mosque. He is a person who is known to everyone. 'Ata'ollah Mohajerani, the parliamentary deputy of the president, then explained: Essentially, the strength and credibility of the Majles is in proportion to the strength and the credibility of the laws. If the laws of a country change, openly in the mind of the people the belief will exist that the law can be changed. Hence, we must act in a way that we only change the law when necessary, and do it tastefully. In the Third Majles, separating the National Library from the Ministry of Guidance and attaching it to the presidential institution was not a political idea but one of expertise. Certainly, the Fourth Majles also will look at the law from the perspective of expertise, and ultimately the government will implement the ratifications of the Majles. After the speech of the government representative, Zare'i-Qanavati, the spokesman of the Guidance Committee said: None of the deputies oppose the National Library, and all agree that the library must be expanded. He then said: To say that this proposal has not been made out of necessity is not correct. The reasons for the committee ratifying the proposal were expert arguments not issues of factional and personal taste. These issues, thank God, do not govern the committee. If the Administrative Committee has voted negatively regarding the above-mentioned proposal, it means that the committee has seen its organizational problems and given an opinion, whereas the expert Guidance Committee has seen the cultural coordination in the country and in all the sessions of the committee is concerned about the culture of the country. Hence, by attaching this library to the Ministry of Guidance, a great deal of coordination will be created in the culture of the country. After the explanations of the spokesman of the committee, the general points of the proposal were put to a vote and were not ratified. There were 86 supporting and 93 opposing votes. The second item on the agenda was the urgent proposal on the procedures for punishing individuals who engage in illegal audiovisual activities. The general points of the proposal were put to a vote and ratified. The details of the proposal will be discussed in the next session. Article 1 of the above-mentioned proposal, which had been proposed by the Judicial Committee, states: Any person who engages in any action regarding illegal audiovisual materials in place of legal materials or violates the rights of the owners of the work, including forgery of the official label of the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance on tapes or changing the tape or the content of the tape cassettes that have labels and the like, in addition to punishment for forgery and damages according to the case, if demanded, he shall be fined 2 million to 20 million rials. Note. During the phase of determining whether the action has taken place, the court may use the expert opinion of the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance as its standard. On the Margins of the Majles Bylaws Reminder of the Deputy of Lenjan In connection with the discussion concerning the attachment of the National Library to the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance not being a political but an expert decision, Mr. Kuhkan said in a bylaws reminder: We did not expect our dear brother, Mr. Mohajerani, to speak in this manner, that the Third Majles dealt with proposals and bills from an expert perspective and now it is done from a perspective of personal taste. Since we signed this proposal and spoke in support of it, I think his address includes me, as well, as one of the signatories and speakers, and I consider his statement an insult to the Majles in mentioning the opinion of the Fourth Majles in this case as having been based on personal taste rather than expert opinion. In this connection, Mr. Mohajerani in yesterday's issue of ETTELA'AT, in an article entitled "Criticism of the Situation," defended his speech in opposition to the proposal to attach the National Library to the Ministry of Guidance and said: "The problem is that sometimes an honorable deputy...regards his own preference or that of a few people as the opinion of the Majles." In continuation, he added: "Neither did I mean that the Fourth Majles acts inexpertly, as the evidence came like lightening and the proposal to attach the National Library was rejected, nor can the preference of a few deputies be regarded as that of the Majles. The Majles is not formed of a building, chairs, and discussions. The basic identity of the Majles is in its votes." In explaining the statements of Mr. Mohajerani, it can be said that the number of supporting and opposing notes shows that the person making the objection is right, because if "the basic identity of the Majles is in its votes," there are 86 supporting and 93 opposing votes. In other words, the votes of 86 persons cannot be regarded as merely the preference of a few people, because there is a difference of only seven votes. It seems that the accusation by Mr. Kuhkan has remained unanswered. Five Days With the War-Scarred People of Khuzestan Seyyed Amir Purfazeli, Dispatched Reporter. Part 2 On Sunday afternoon, 14/09/1372 [5 December 1993], Mr. Nateq-Nuri participated unexpectedly in the marriage ceremonies of 600 couples of the Imam Khomeyni Emergency Committee of the province of Khuzestan, which was truly very attractive and enjoyable. Their presence in this interesting and spiritually joyful gathering revived every one revived from the tiredness of the trip. I will never forget this memorable gathering. Truly we must say to the unknown members of the Emergency Committee who work sincerely: Well done. After these exciting ceremonies, Mr. Nateq-Nuri took part in a gathering of Ahvaz University people and responded to the questions of the officials with regard to political and cultural areas. This great gathering, in which a large number of students participated, was interesting. They welcomed the speaker of the Majles warmly. Of course, in this meeting, many questions were posed by the students, of which the speaker of the Majles responded to a few, due to the shortage of time. Among the questions posed to him was one concerning "Raja'i-Khorasani," which resulted in a heated discussion. He was asked, "Considering his letter, why was he not dismissed from the Majles?" Mr. Nateq-Nuri responded: "In the Majles, we do not have a law that if a deputy makes a speech, we can dismiss him as a deputy. I myself spoke in detail in connection with his letter on 13 Aban [4 November] and condemned this idea. I do not agree with him at all. The fact is that the newspapers are making an issue of Mr. Raja'i-Khorasani. On the one hand, if someone is arrested, they say there is no freedom of expression and democracy. But if a person writes a letter to the leader of the revolution and gives us a copy, does making a ruckus against him indicate democracy and freedom of expression? This action does not conform religiously and legally with democracy and freedom. Hence, I reject and condemn the opinion of Mr. Raja'i-Khorasani. "I announced earlier that the alley that ends in America is a dead-end alley." When the speaker of the Majles made this statement in a loud voice, the sound of "God is great" by the students shook the amphitheater of the university. Among the other questions by the students was the issue of national economy, to which Mr. Nateq-Nuri gave a strong and dignified answer. Also, among other questions was that of relations with South Africa, to which the speaker of the Majles responded: As long as the white racists are in charge, we will not have relations with them. At this moment, the minister of agriculture said: The blacks are supposed to come to power. And Mr. Nateq-Nuri immediately said: "If they come to power, we shall have no problems with them." Among the other questions by the students was a question concerning relations with Egypt. The speaker of the Majles said: "The grand leader of the revolution agreed to relations with Egypt at a certain level." After this meeting, Mr. Nateq-Nuri went to a gathering of the brave people of Ahvaz, a stronghold of combative forces, and spoke of their self-sacrifice and bravery and praised them. On Monday morning, 15/09/1372 [6 December 1993], the speaker of the Majles, in order to become familiar with the implementation of the Karun River dredging operation, visited the above-mentioned project. The project began four months ago to provide protection against seasonal flooding and to stabilize the Karun River banks, and it is anticipated that it will be completed in 32 months, if funds and heavy machinery are provided. Afterwards, Mr. Nateq-Nuri went to Susangerd to visit with the resistant people of that city. During the imposed war this city was occupied twice by the Ba'thists, but with the bravery and resistance of the Hezbollah forces, the Ba'thist mercenaries could not stay in that city for even one day. The same people, on seeing the speaker of the Majles, became joyful and welcomed him and his companions enthusiastically. During the moments that we spent in Susangerd, the signs of deprivation and damage from the war were evident. The implementation of the developmental projects will cause the city to thrive and repair the war damage. The first implementation of the project in the city was the natural gas outreach, water and sewage, and the establishment of Payam-e Nur University in Susangerd, all of which were visited by the speaker of the Majles, which will be encouraging to the war-stricken people of this city. When Mr. Nateq-Nuri went to the gathering of the resistant people of this city, the city stadium was filled with men and women. He said: "What we all wish is to sacrifice ourselves for you people. I believe that you have not received what you deserve. No matter how much work is done around the clock, it is still too little."
