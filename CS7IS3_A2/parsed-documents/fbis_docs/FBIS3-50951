What balance should be established between material and moral incentives? Does a material incentive inevitably create uncontrollable trends toward mercantilism and individualism? This may be the best possible moment to answer these key questions that we Cuban workers have asked ourselves repeatedly throughout our revolutionary history. Now is the best moment, and, as never before, it is essential to establish the greatest rational and realistic cooperation among the economy, politics, and ideology. This does not mean embracing a vulgar practice that rejects essential features of revolutionary humanism or leads us to confuse what is necessary with what is desirable. It is the best moment because the present situation strengthens our will to correct errors we had found earlier in the organization of labor and salaries and in our interpretation of the conditions influencing labor behavior. It seems that if one current economic issue needs special analysis because of its enormous, direct, and daily influence on the workers' standard of living and social education, it is the organization of labor and salaries. So it is not surprising that Cuban society is now focusing on this crucial issue. It is clearly a vital goal, and not just economic, but ideological as well, to develop formulas and practices seeking the best combination between material and moral incentives. The unions, representing the workers' vital interests, are absolutely committed to seeking and expanding formulas that by promoting the nation's economic reorganization, will safeguard the ideal of a collectivist and just society with solidarity. We support without reservation the view that a well-founded material incentive, which is actually a fair share for the performance of a social duty, is in fact a moral incentive of the greatest importance. The social evaluation shown by providing a material incentive to the individual corresponding to his contribution does not in any way create contradictions detrimental to the worker's morale, just as it cannot be alleged that an exclusively moral incentive can satisfy needs and aspirations of other sorts. There has always been talk of a combination of both types of incentives. Now is the time to interpret fully the meaning of the word "combination" that, in chemistry, for example, means an "intimate union of the molecules of two substances." Just as water is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, for us the motivation for labor indissolubly combines both material and moral factors. As we have already said, we Cuban workers must promote a process of revitalization of the role of salaries and other forms of material incentives so that we can differentiate to a greater degree the levels of individual consumption in relation to each person's contribution. It is important to understand the evolving, gradual, and very complex character of this process, so that we do not create false expectations or unjustified demands, and so this will not be identified with former experiments that were rightly criticized. The dynamics of this process will be shaped by the restoration of internal financial order and equilibrium and by the economic recovery steps that Cuba takes in its strategy of reentering the world economy. Moreover, the policy of renewed emphasis on material incentives would be inappropriate if it were initially extended without discrimination, with the same weight given both to productive sectors and to those that do not directly create material value. Among productive activities we need to distinguish those which are capable of definitely generating high foreign currency earnings, decreasing convertible currency costs, or which have a special significance in the current strategy of resistance and development. These activities, called multipliers because of their ability to help revitalize the economy in general, are the first to which the motivating force of greater material incentives should come, with the necessary criterion of maximum efficiency and stringent discipline. It is no waste of time to reiterate that the unions have the duty to demand that in any case, material incentives must also be contingent upon a substantial increase in labor productivity. All that is done to boost productivity and efficiency in these vanguard activities, along with steps for financial improvement, will have repercussions on the dissemination of these incentives toward more and more sectors of the economy and toward nonproductive services. What is done to revitalize the national economy will in one way or another reach the entire working population, starting by increasing the purchasing power of present salaries. It can be seen with enormous optimism that wherever the experiment of stimulating more vigorously effort and excellence in work has been tried, the immediate results have more than compensated the investment made. Still, increases in material incentives should not be conceived solely in terms of raising salaries and giving workers in these centers special access to the consumption of specific goods and services. This simplistic view would lead to failure. Wherever unquestionable economic gains promoted in large part by greater incentives exist, there are also present satisfaction in work well done, pride in doing one's duty, conscious acceptance of discipline that is desirable and appropriate for each member of the work unit, a precise definition of every person's objectives, functions, and tasks, understanding of the social usefulness of the work done, and the enjoyment of better environmental and working conditions. These experiences show that when the workers are fully and effectively motivated, it contributes to their ideological formation that, as we know, is expressed in the execution of their responsibilities, in their actions. Beyond words, the essential and most direct way for the worker to take part in the construction of socialist society is by doing his job. Everything done to promote the value of labor forms a part of the sacred struggle for human dignity. It may be worthwhile to say that, though we are speaking of the role of material incentives, we do not underestimate the importance of moral incentives. Doing that would once again polarize the focus on this issue, by denying that both form an inseparable whole. What we want to do is call attention to the necessary view that a material incentive linked organically to decisive political, ideological, and moral aspects, and associated more and more with collective effort, with the cooperation and socialization of labor, far from damaging revolutionary awareness, must and can help to strengthen it. This is the deeply held conviction of the Cuban union movement.
