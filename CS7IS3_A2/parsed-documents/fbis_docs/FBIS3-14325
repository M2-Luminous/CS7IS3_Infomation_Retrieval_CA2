[passage omitted] The liberation of our precious territories in the south and western al-Biqa' concerns us all. It is the responsibility of the state, which leads all its people, so that we can attain our objective together, with the minimum cost. National accord is the first step toward strengthening immunity in the face of dangers and the occupation. This occupation continued when the state was eclipsed. The state and its stability are a principal factor in retrieving our right. Any attempt to deal a blow to the state means collaboration with the enemy. Do whatever it takes to strengthen the state. One-upmanship is like retreat. Both work against the homeland and the duty of liberation. We are facing contemporary facts that should be well understood, acted upon, and dealt with wisely for the sake of the homeland's victory. This stage demands that reason prevail. Your homeland is rich with reason and qualifications. It is the age of the responsible decision. Know that we are now shaping our fate for years to come. O delegates, the homeland rises with action, not with emotions. Help to stop your enemy's objective of pushing us into the trap of emotional behavior. Stoking up crises does not alleviate the consequences. Solidarity in solving these crises strengthens the steadfastness. Our principles are constant: no giving up on the right to retrieve our occupied territories in the south and western al-Biqa' and no bargaining or appeasement over consolidating our national sovereignty up to the internationally recognized border. The way to do this is to implement the UN resolutions, primarily Resolution 425. Lebanon has committed itself to solidarity with the brothers, especially Syria. It has committed itself to seeking the just and comprehensive peace. We have declared that we seek the just and comprehensive peace. But Israel has not refrained from committing aggression against our people there daily. O delegates, you know that our domestic unity is the strongest shield, especially now when things are turbulent with change. We must all stand united to prove that Israel, by trying to split our ranks, cannot wrest that which it failed to wrest at the negotiating table. The state knows nothing of all this and has confirmed its ability to confront any treachery or aggression that attempts to undermine our internal stability. We have repeatedly announced that security is on a par with freedom and that national unity precedes politics and its games. [passage omitted] How can we remain silent over the humiliation inflicted on our sons detained in Israeli prisons or in al-Khiyam inside the Lebanese border? How can we accept the daily repressive practices against our kinsmen and their right to safety, dignity, and a prosperous life over their land and inside their homeland? [passage omitted]
