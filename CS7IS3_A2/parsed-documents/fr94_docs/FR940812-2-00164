FR940812-2-00164 FR940812-2-00058 Fish and Wildlife Service Notice of Availability of a Draft Recovery Plan for the Shenandoah Salamander for Review and Comment AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice of document availability. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability for public review of a draft Recovery Plan for the Shenandoah salamander ( Plethodon shenandoah ). The Shenandoah salamander is limited to mountain slopes within the boundaries of Shenandoah National Park in Page and Madison Counties, Virginia. It was listed as endangered in 1989 due to competition with the redbacked salamander ( Plethodon cinereus ) and eventual succession of the Shenandoah salamander's talus-slope habitat to conditions favoring the redbacked salamander. Human-related factors potentially affecting the Shenandoah salamander include potentially adverse physiological and/or reproductive effects associated with acid deposition, and defoliation of trees associated with non-native insect outbreaks. The primary recovery strategy for this species is to minimize any human-related impacts on the Shenandoah salamander while monitoring the effects of natural competition. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this draft Plan. DATES: Comments on the draft Recovery Plan must be received September 12, 1994 to receive consideration by the Service. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the draft Recovery Plan can obtain a copy from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region Five, 300 Westgate Center Drive, Hadlley, Massachusetts 01035&hyph;9589, telephone (413) 253&hyph;8628. Comments should be sent to this address, to the attention of Mary Parkin. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary J. Parkin (see Addresses ). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Restoring an endangered or threatened animal or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare Recovery Plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery Plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, established criteria for the recovery level for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ) requires the development of Recovery Plans for listed species unless such a Plan would not promote the conservation of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment be provided during Recovery Plan development. The Service will consider all information presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised Recovery Plan. The Service and other Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing Recovery Plans. The document submitted for review is the draft Shenandoah Salamander ( Plethodon shenandoah ) Recovery Plan. This small woodland salamander is known only from the northeast to northwest-facing talus slopes of three mountains_Hawksbill, The Pinnacles, and Stony Man_all within the boundaries of Shenandoah National Park in Page and Madison Counties, Virginia. The effects of fires, farming, and timbering operations prior to 1936 (when the Park was established) on the current limited distribution of the Shenandoah salamander are unknown. In its present environment, however, the primary threats to the salamander appear to be competition with the aggressive and successful red-backed salamander (which confines the Shenandoah salamander to a few relatively dry talus areas not occupied by the competitor), and eventual succession of these talus areas to moister habitat more suitable for the red-backed salamander. The red-backed salamander is widely distributed and completely surrounds each of the three isolates of the Shenandoah salamander. Against this backdrop of naturally occurring threats to the salamander's continued existence, two major, relatively recent anthropogenic factors appear to have the potential of further endangering this species as well as threatening other faunal and floral components of the ecosystem it inhabits. These include: (1) defoliation of trees within its habitat, associated with outbreaks of gypsy moths, hemlock woolly adelgids, or other introduced forest pest species; and (2) further debilitation of overstory vegetation, changes in soil chemistry, and direct impacts to the salamanders associated with acid deposition and other sources of air pollution. Because the Shenandoah salamander represents an unusual case in which natural factors play a major role in its present endangerment, the recovery objective is to stabilize this species. Recovery activities will focus on minimizing human impacts on the Shenandoah salamander and conducting long-term monitoring to detect any significant changes in size or demographic structure of Shenandoah salamander populations as well as any shifts in distribution between this species and the red-backed salamander. Studies to examine impacts of acid deposition, forest defoliators, and control agents will be conducted if it is determined that Shenandoah salamander habitat is susceptible to defoliation. All Park maintenance and management activities will be conducted in a way that is compatible with Shenandoah salamander populations. The draft Recovery Plan is being submitted for agency review. After consideration of comments received during the review period, the Plan will be submitted for final approval. Public Comments Solicited The Service solicits written comments on the Recovery Plan described. All comments received by the date specified above will be considered prior to approval of the Plan. Authority The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f). Dated: August 5, 1994. Ralph Pisapia, Acting for Regional Director.
