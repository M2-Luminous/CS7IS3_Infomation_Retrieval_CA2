The U.S. State Department expressed deep regret Tuesday over the latest arrest of Wei and said it had conveyed its concern to the authorities in Beijing. Reacting to the US statement, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said the 43-year-old pro-democracy activist had "violated regulations when he was on parole and deprived of his political rights." Describing the case as China's internal affair, the spokeswoman said it was "inappropriate for any foreign countries to make irresponsible remarks on this matter." "China's public security organ is interrogating (Wei) according to the law," she added. The Beijing Public Security Bureau announced Tuesday that Wei, who had been picked up by police last week, was being investigated for "suspected new criminal offences." The announcement carried the threat of criminal charges and a second jail term for Wei, who was only released on parole in September, six months short of a 15-year prison term for his "counterrevolutionary" role in the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement.
