Before leaving for Denmark, the Romanian foreign minister said his visit in the two northern countries was an "obligatory leg" in a process of opening the bilateral relations, considering also the fact that Denmark and Finland are both members of the European Union. The Romanian chief diplomat referred in his statement to Romania's interest in matters concerning agriculture, food industry, and environment protection, economic fields in which the two countries are very advanced. "It is a first good-will mission within an official visit aiming to review the things that we have accomplished together -- rather few so far -- especially in the economic field," said Minister Melescanu. The Romanian foreign minister is paying an official two-day visit in Denmark on June 14-15, at the invitation of his counterpart, Niels Helveg Petersen. On June 16-17, the Romanian chief diplomat will be visiting Finland at Mr. Heikki Haavisto's invitation. Minister Teodor Melescanu is scheduled also to attend the Crans Montana forum in Switzerland, on June 17-18.
