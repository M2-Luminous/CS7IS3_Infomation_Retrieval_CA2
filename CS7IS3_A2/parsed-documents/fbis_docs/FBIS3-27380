The meeting set forth that in 1994 the institutions of higher learning should emancipate the mind, firmly grasp favorable opportunities, accelerate the pace of reform, make positive development, and maintain stability. This year, the institutions of higher learning in the municipality should comprehensively carry out reform; make a breakthrough in cooperatively running schools, developing higher vocational and technical education, reforming the enrollment and employment systems, and socializing the reserve service work; and further strengthen and improve party building and the ideological and political work. Li Lanqing, vice premier of the State Council, was present at the meeting. He extended Spring Festival greetings to all teaching and administrative staff members of the institutions of higher learning in the municipality. He said: The Beijing Municipal party committee and government have paid high attention to the educational work and have also completed a lot of concrete deeds. I express my heartfelt thanks to them. In regard to the development of moral education, he said that we should strengthen the reform and improvement of the classes on Marxist theory and particularly study Comrade Mao Zedong's several philosophic works and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is necessary to strengthen education on patriotism, socialism, collectivism, modern history, and contemporary history. In the course of conducting education on the national situation, we should stress education on the current situation. It is necessary to conduct education on the traditional virtues of China, moral education, and education on the legal system. Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, stressed that the institutions of higher learning should strengthen party building and ideological and political work. He said: Institutions of higher learning should rely on the leadership of the party to achieve their work. Only when party building is strengthened will we be able to strengthen the work of teachers and students and to overcome the situation of firmly grasping one aspect while neglecting the other. Although the construction of spiritual civilization is strengthened, we have not done enough in this regard. It is dangerous if we do not continue to strengthen the construction of spiritual civilization. We should particularly strengthen the leadership of the party. Universities and colleges should strengthen the construction of the leading bodies at various levels and ideological and theoretical work. We will possibly come across many difficulties in the course of strengthening party building and ideological and political work. The municipal party committee and the municipal government will continue to award the institutions of higher learning advanced in party building and ideological and political work and continue to help institutions of higher learning eliminate difficulties. Chen Xitong also extend festive greetings to the teaching and administrative staff of the institutions of higher learning in the municipality.
