ACTION: Notice of availability of funds. SUMMARY: The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the availability of discretionary grant funds of approximately $12.5 million in fiscal year (FY) 1994 under section 330 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to establish new community health centers (CHCs) and new CHC service delivery sites for existing CHCs. For more than twenty-five years, the CHC program has been working toward ensuring the availability and accessibility of essential primary health services to those individuals who have the most limited access to services. The goal of the CHC New Start and Expansion strategy is to extend primary health services to populations currently without such services and to improve the health status of medically underserved individuals by supporting the development and maintenance of systems of care in areas where such systems are lacking or inadequate. The PHS is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity. The health center program directly addresses the Healthy People 2000 objectives by improving access to preventive and primary care services for underserved populations, especially minority and other disadvantaged populations. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00474&hyph;0) or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00473&hyph;01) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9325 (Telephone 202&hyph;783&hyph;3228). The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.
