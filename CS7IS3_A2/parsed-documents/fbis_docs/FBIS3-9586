Several thousand citizens of Bijelo Polje are attending the rally in the rain. Russia lost its historical allies under Gorbachev. We are therefore here to mend that, to tell you that we will never desert you and forget you, (Vengerovskiy) said. He further said that the Balkans is the Russian zone of interest and influence, and that no Turkish or NATO presence will be allowed here. He added: Your enemies are our enemies. No new world order will be established so long as it is aimed against the nation that is fighting for its freedom, as is the case with the Serbian people. Vengerovskiy further said: We are here to help you. We want to socialize and trade with you. Russia will again be the market for your products. Russia is today swamped with poor quality goods from Turkey and Syria, but we can remember with fondness your good quality clothes, shoes, and foodstuffs. To shouts from the audience of "Russia, Serbia!," Vengerovskiy said that the Mediterranean Sea is a Slav sea, and that Russian ships, not U.S. ones, would sail in it. Other members of the delegation of the Russian state Duma addressed the rally, as did the leaders of the Serbian National Renewal, who organized the visit by the Russian parliamentarians.
