FR940512-0-00012 FR940512-0-00005 For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. The provisions of this rule will not have a significant economic impact. The December 1993 interim rule that placed Portugal on the list of countries in which BSE exists had the effect of restricting the importation of some animal products and prohibiting the importation of others. Natural sausage casings were the only affected commodity that had been imported from Portugal in quantities sufficient to cause any economic impact. This rule will remove the prohibition on the importation of natural sausage casings of ruminant origin from Portugal. About 20 small U.S. entities had been importing natural sausage casings from Portugal prior to the December 1993 interim rule. None of the companies had been totally dependent on Portugal for sausage casings, as Portugal supplied only 2.5 percent of natural sausage casings imported into the United States. This rule will have a negligible economic impact on these small entities. Additionally, price and competition in the United States will not be affected. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ).
