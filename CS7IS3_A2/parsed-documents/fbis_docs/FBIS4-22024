On Thursday [14 April] during the trial at the Berlin Court concerning the attack [on the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin on 17 September 1992, which killed four Iranian opposition members] Joint Plaintiff Axel Jeschke quoted from an intelligence service document: "Several clues from a particularly reliable source lead one to conclude that the Mykonos attack was prepared in the Embassy under the code term Bozorg Alavi." Bernd Schmidbauer (Christian Democratic Union), coordinator for intelligence services in the chancellor's office, stated as a witness, when asked by Jeschke, that he could not recall such a paper. On the fringe of the trial, Jeschke told journalists that the court files are not complete. "Not all documents have been put on the table." In contrast, Schmidbauer insisted that, as far as he knows, all relevant papers and information provided by the intelligence services have been made available to the court. [passage omitted]
