This would help to protect the lives of threatened people more efficiently, Deputy Chairperson Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul told journalists in Bonn on Wednesday [30 March]. In addition, the Federal Government and the other governments of the European Union [EU] should increase pressure on the Turkish government. The association agreement between the EU and Turkey is a good means of doing this. The SPD politician emphasized that foreign policy must not be confined to "ingratiating oneself" with Turkey.
