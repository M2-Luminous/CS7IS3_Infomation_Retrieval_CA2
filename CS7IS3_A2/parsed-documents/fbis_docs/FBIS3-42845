The liberalization of social and political life in the republic and individual measures geared to a reform of the economy initiated movement toward a new condition of society based on a market economy and political pluralism. But the half-baked nature of the measures adopted by the legislature and the executive in recent years and the absence of a clear concept of stabilization of the situation in the economy and of arrival at a new quality of development led to the destruction of the previous economic, social, and political structures and to the underdevelopment of the new ones. As a result society has found itself in a dangerous situation fraught with permanent sociopolitical and economic crisis. The Liberal Convention of Moldova believes that there is no alternative to the further development of democracy, a radical reform of property relations, and the creation of a full-fledged and efficient economic system based on market mechanisms. There is no other way of extricating the country from the crisis and of the creation of favorable conditions for the formation of the state. The key question consists of the formulation of a clear and consistent concept of reforms based on the creative application of the principles of liberalism and in accordance with the particular features of the economy of Moldova, with the evolved mentality and traditions of the people. Without a vision by all citizens of Moldova of the conceptual trajectory of movement, without an understanding of long-range and immediate goals, and without specific programs of transformations at the macro- and microeconomic levels, renewal and a new quality of Moldova's socioeconomic development will not be achieved. In the absence of mature political parties and democratic traditions in Moldovan society, an effective instrument of the democratic reform of the country in the initial phase of the formation of the civil society are the state and its power structures. The Liberal Convention of Moldova regards power as a real opportunity for and the basic lever of implementation of comprehensive programs of transformations on the basis of liberal doctrine and with regard to the specifics and salient features of Moldova. These program principles, which have been made the basis of the activity of the Liberal Convention of Moldova and which contain the main directions of further liberal reforms in the political, economic, and social spheres, could contribute to a stabilization of the situation at the transitional stage and impart new impetus to the country's development on the path of democracy and progress. Freedom Under the Conditions of Order--Toward an Efficient Law-Based and Democratic Society In the political sphere the Liberal Convention considers a principal goal the strengthening of the statehood of the Republic of Moldova and the country's further development as an independent, sovereign, and democratic state. The Moldovan people's right to statehood is the right to the preservation of its distinctiveness and the creation of the necessary conditions for the more than 4.5 million citizens of different nationalities of the republic, who are capable only by joint efforts of extricating society from the crisis, stabilizing the situation, and creating living conditions for the present and future generations which are worthy of man at the end of the 20th century. It is important to adopt national features of Moldovan statehood, ensuring simultaneously the principle of equal opportunities for all citizens before the law, regardless of national affiliation. Setting the goal of the creation of a minimum, but strong and effective state, with regard to the residual influence of the authoritarian regime on people's frame of mind and the particular features of the mass consciousness at the stage transitional to a full-fledged and efficient democratic society, the formation of a strong presidential republic is justified and logical. The head of state, elected by the whole people, should have the opportunities for corrective influence on the branches of power for the purpose of assurance of the operation of the constitution and laws of the country and the rights and liberties of its citizens. An improvement of the institutions of the state presupposes primarily a delineation of the political and economic authorities, a decisive reduction in the role and influence of the state as a subject of economic relations via active privatization and the growth of nonstate property in the economy, the increased competence and responsibility of employees of the machinery of state, and effective control of the executive structures on the part of the organs of representative power. In the immediate future the state will retain the functions of regulation at the macroeconomic level, in the main, ensuring a reasonable proportion between the economic liberty of the members of society and directed influence in accordance with the economic and social programs of the governing majority. The principle of interethnic accord and the settlement of disagreements by the peaceful, democratic path should be a fundamental proposition of the state's domestic policy. This would permit the positive resolution of the problem of social stability and ensure a dynamic balance of the interests of the multinational population of the republic. On the other hand, consistent and decisive measures of the power structures in respect to the use of constitutional means to ensure the territorial integrity of Moldova and the unity and inviolability of its territory are essential. The resolution of the conflicts in the Dniester region and the south of Moldova based on the maximum consideration of current realities and strictly in accordance with the rules of international law, the principles of the European process, and UN decisions is a principal condition of the restoration of sovereignty throughout the territory of the republic and of peace and tranquillity in the republic. The decentralization of state power, the transfer of managerial functions to the local government authorities, their release from the tutelage of the "center," and the legislative enshrinement of these principles in the course of administrative-territorial reform would make it possible to organize the more precise interaction of the authorities in the center and locally on the basis of a delineation of authority and to enhance the efficiency of the power structures in the defense of social interests. A principal function of the state should be realization of the right of the citizen to be a proprietor, the optimum conditions for free competition, and the surmounting of monopoly trends. The continued democratization of society means first and foremost the creation and assurance of the normal activity of a civil society. The formation of a protected environment for the freedom of the individual and the subordination of political and state power to a community of free people via the consolidation of the institutions of the civil society--social and political organizations, societies, and citizens' associations, nonstate organizations and institutions, and so forth which aim at the support and protection of the autonomy, initiative, and responsibility of each individual and people's creative activity--could impart an irreversible nature to the progressive transformations. The gradual return of the functions usurped by the state to a self-governing civil society, the establishment of limited administration and the minimum state jurisdiction under the conditions of the existence of a clear-cut legislative base and assurance of the efficiency of the law-and-order authorities and the state authorities as a whole would make it possible to realize in practice the principle of freedom under the conditions of order. The creation and assurance of the efficient functioning of a multiparty system and subsequent elections to the country's parliament on a multiparty basis would make it possible to enhance the degree of responsibility of the power structures, and a real instrument of opposition to political voluntarism and totalitarian tendencies would arise. A parliamentary system and the mature, responsible approach of the political parties to support for the efficiency of its activity would afford an opportunity for the resolution of social contradictions in civilized fashion, in the interests of the majority, and with maximum consideration of the opinion of the minority. Thus real prerequisites for a qualitatively new level, social stability, and the consolidation of the multinational society would emerge. A constructive opposition to the authorities would be created via the multiparty system, which would enable the latter to take account of the diverse interests and social expectations of different strata and groups of society. Aside from the creation of a civil society and assurance of the functioning of a multiparty system, further democratization includes the following aspects: the real separation of the branches of power to prevent the authorities' slide toward political voluntarism and the tendency to establish an authoritarian regime of government; the realization at all levels of activity of the political system and state power of the principle of political liberalism, which contributes to control of the authorities on the part of society and of the "managers" on the part of the "managed"; the building of an effective state based on the rule of law and a defender of the rights and liberties of the citizen. The consistent conversion of the interventionist state and the legacy of the totalitarian regime into a management authority and state administration; the adoption of a constitution of the Republic of Moldova--the charter of power and the basic voluntary compact between the individual and the state; the improvement of legislation to create the legal conditions for the realization in day-to-day practice of the fundamental values of liberalism; the creation of a climate of broad cooperation among all political formations and social and political organizations of Moldova of a liberal-reform persuasion for the surmounting of reactionary-conservative trends still capable of winding down the reforms in society that have begun and restoring the totalitarian regime in an individual post-Soviet republic; maintenance of a high moral and ethical level in political activity and in public life as a whole without renunciation of particular principles and consistency in their defense. The pursuit of an active and consistent foreign policy and a guarantee of national security are a most important function of the young Moldovan state. The world community's recognition of the Republic of Moldova as an independent state and the country's membership of a number of international organizations have created for us a qualitatively new situation, where the foreign policy course, reflecting national-state interests, is developing in accordance with the principles of the United Nations and the European process, the rules of international law, and values common to all mankind. The particular features of Moldova's geopolitical location in the south of East Europe, the ethno-demographic composition of the population, and the economic and defense potential of the country predetermine political and diplomatic means as the basic means in assurance of the security of the republic at the complex stage of its development as a new European state in the post-totalitarian era. The maintenance of friendly and mutually beneficial relations with contiguous states, primarily with Romania and Ukraine, which are for us the gates to the West and to the East, is of exceptional significance for Moldova. The common ethnic roots, language, historical past, and culture objectively predetermine the priority relations of the Republic of Moldova and Romania. The Liberal Convention advocates the surmounting of the excessive politicization of Moldovan-Romanian relations and the consistent expansion and intensification of mutually profitable trade and economic, cultural, and other relations between the two states. By joint and concerted efforts we would succeed in ridding ourselves more quickly of the sinister legacy of totalitarianism and dictatorship engendering radical nationalism and nostalgia for the past. Relations with Russia remain a most important issue of Moldova's foreign policy. They should be built on the basis of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two states and the development of mutually beneficial relations in the economic sphere and science and culture. The exclusion of double standards and pressure in the solution of questions of a political nature and interference in internal affairs and, in particular, the withdrawal of Russian troops from the eastern parts of the republic and a resolution of the Dniester conflict in accordance with the rules of international law could consolidate Moldovan-Russian relations. Paramount significance, particularly at the transitional stage, is attached to mutual relations with the states of the CIS built on a treaty and bilateral and multilateral basis. They are conditioned by the continued economic ties and interdependence of the economies and the long-term possibilities of these countries as markets for the sale of Moldovan commodities and supplies of energy and raw material on terms beneficial to the republic. It is essential to stimulate Moldova's affiliation to the integration processes in Central and East Europe and the countries of the Black Sea in order to obtain access to the dynamically developing capital, technology, raw material, and industrial commodity markets. The formation and development of all-around cooperation with the United States remains an important strategic direction. Multilateral contacts and effective participation in the activity of international organizations--the United Nations, CSCE, IMF, World Bank, GATT, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and others--could contribute to a stabilization of the situation in Moldova and ensues logically from the policy of the openness of Moldovan society and the assurance of economic and national security. A most palpable threat to the security of Moldova and to the republic's existence as a sovereign state is the aspiration of certain influential circles of Russia to restore the former communist superpower within its previous borders. This threat, which acquired real outline following the victory of the Russian nationalist radicals at the recent parliamentary elections, can only be resisted by Moldova's active participation in the creation of an all-European system of security under the aegis of the CSCE. A broadening of contacts with the North Atlantic alliance, which has an interest in the prevention of regional conflicts and in the assurance of stability on the old continent, is in Moldova's interests in this context. A precise ascertainment of the structure of the real and potential threats to the country's security and independence should form the basis of the determination of the level of sufficiency and the organization of the armed forces of the republic and the determination of their manning level and the nature of their provision with equipment and arms. It is essential to bring the system of national security into line with the principles of the law-based, democratic state and the rules of international law, considering national-historical traditions and world experience. The army of the Republic of Moldova is not only an attribute of statehood but also a real force for countering potential military danger and our specific contribution to the European security system which is being created. The gradual and planned transition to professional armed forces smaller in size and providing for a high level of combat readiness would make it possible to accomplish efficiently the assignments confronting the army and to reduce appreciably the burden of military spending. Toward an Efficient Market Economy Via a Surmounting of the Crisis, Stabilization of the Situation, and the Realization of Comprehensive Programs of Transformations Not only the future of our state but also its very existence and, consequently, stability in this region of Europe will depend on the capacity for normalizing the situation in the economy and formulating and implementing adequate measures for a way out of the protracted crisis in which Moldova has found itself. The complexity of this problem is intensified by the need for the simultaneous accomplishment of several tasks which are difficult even for an economy which is developing in stable fashion: a halt to the decline in production and the reduction in the gross national product and the drop in society's living standard, a surmounting of the structural and technology gap, and continuation of the transition to a market economy. The Liberal Convention considers as the main causes of the intensification of the crisis in the economy the following: 1. An orientation toward the production and sale of agricultural raw material and its primary processing is predominant in the agro-industrial complex. The republic's industry, with the rare exception of individual enterprises, is in a neglected state and is practically unadapted to independent economic activity under the new conditions. All that is produced in the country and intended for export is barely sufficient to cover expenditure on the purchase of raw material and energy outside of Moldova. Hyperinflation is being imported together with them from the CIS countries. 2. The comprehensive and phased transfer of the economy to market mechanisms of the regulation of production activity is chronically behind schedule. The state retains, as before, the plenitude of power in the economic sphere, gravitating toward the customary administrative-command means and levers of control and engendering thereby voluntarism and, frequently, an inappropriate response to changing economic realities. 3. The half-baked nature and contradictoriness of the measures in the sphere of privatization and the fruitless waste of time in arguments about the forms and means of the denationalization of state property, instead of the creation of effective levers and the infrastructure of the engagement of private initiative--individual and group--in the accomplishment of national economic tasks, are imparting a chronic nature to the economic crisis. 4. Instead of stimulating small and medium-sized business and the process of the original accumulation of capital and its subsequent investment in the production sphere, the state, via a tax system of a manifestly confiscatory nature, is suppressing private initiative and provoking the mass drain of capital outside of Moldova. This is causing a chronic shortage of consumer goods and hyperinflation. 5. The sluggish nature of foreign economic policy, the absence of new markets for the sale of Moldovan products and imports of raw material and energy, and an incapacity for attracting to Moldova foreign investments in the sectors where this is justified by a lack of resources and progressive technology are making the situation in the economy worse. 6. None of the last three Moldovan governments has had a program, precise and considered in detail, of a way out of the socioeconomic crisis and transition to the market economy. The declared transition to a market model is being undertaken in a "groping" manner and by way of a copying of foreign experience. On the pretext of the realization of measures to stabilize the economy, a return to the old forms of administration and management is being undertaken. 7. The legislative base, which was originally created for support of the transition to the market, is frequently of a general nature and does not reflect the normalities and salient features of Moldova or a specific model and concept of transformations. The prerequisites for a free interpretation of the laws and the appearance of a mass of legally binding enactments creating an atmosphere of uncertainty in the majority of subjects of economic relations are being created hereby. An appreciable and positive role in the solution of the entire set of economic questions could be performed by foreign investments. The experience accumulated in the last three years testifies that it would be a mistake to rely exclusively on economic assistance from outside. The basis of an anticrisis program should be the stimulation of domestic manufacturers and investors. Assistance will be rendered to those who have shown their capacity for working efficiently and those who save and invest in the development of production and contribute to the creation of new jobs in all spheres of economic activity. Reliance first and foremost on our own potential possibilities, a policy of the coordination of efforts in the sphere of the economy with the CIS countries, and the attraction of foreign investments to the spheres in which it is impossible to overcome the crisis phenomena thanks to our own potential could set the necessary directions for overcoming the crisis. The second strategic direction consists of the choice of the correct priorities for surmounting the technology gap and providing for the structural reorganization of the economy. In the sphere of material production the priorities for Moldova are: saturation of the market in short order with food and consumer merchandise; the creation and modernization of the technological and production base of the processing of agricultural produce and the production of competitive foods; the structural reorganization and, where necessary, the conversion of the former defense enterprises of industry and the development of research-intensive and energy-saving works; the solution of questions of the republic's stable energy supply and supplies of the necessary quantity of energy resources; an expansion of the production of building materials using local raw material and a buildup of the facilities of construction and building materials industry, primarily for the erection of housing; the introduction universally of environmentally clean technology; the formation of a modern infrastructure--transport, communications, power engineering, tourism, and a hotel network. The main driving force of the special programs at the macro- and microeconomic levels should be the active denationalization and privatization of property and the large-scale inclusion of private initiative and free enterprise in the accomplishment of economic tasks combined with the regulatory role of the state. It is essential to formulate clear stages of the reform of the economy, moving from a stabilization of the situation to a full-fledged market model integrated in the world system of economic relations. The first stage is 1994. The main task: saturation of the consumer market with commodities, which is a principal condition of the assurance of social stability and the continuation of market reforms. The means and mechanisms of the accomplishment of the said task are: the active and large-scale privatization of small and medium-sized enterprises, facilities of the service sphere, and housing. The creation of an infrastructure for the support of efficient investment and the free movement of capital; securities markets, trust companies, investment funds, and so forth; the channeling of the resources obtained from privatization into the creation of a liberal fund for the support of the private sector and the stimulation of the initial accumulation and investment of capital in socially significant production sectors of the economy; the abandonment of a fiscal tax policy of total confiscatory taxation and the flexible use of economic levers to stimulate investments in the economy of the republic and prevent a drain of capital abroad; the liberalization of export and import activity and regulation of commodity-supply exports and imports by economic measures and the abandonment of rigid bureaucratic administration of trade and economic relations with other countries; the pursuit of an active antitrust policy and the stimulation of competition on the domestic market and the production of high-quality goods for export; the concessionary taxation of investments in the production sphere and in the priority areas of the development of industry, agriculture, and consumer service; the local concessionary transfer and long-term lease and sale of land to foreign investors on the strength of progressive engineering designs (model farms, processing complexes, and so forth); the creation of free economic zones to attract foreign investments and modern technology, the creation of jobs, and the training of personnel for work under the conditions of the market economy (the Danube-South zone, Dniester-East, Chisinau-Center, Beltsy-North). The development of comprehensive government programs of the creation of the zones and the legislative enshrinement of the conditions of their activity; the preservation of profitable agricultural enterprises and their conversion into stock companies. The denationalization of unprofitable production units and their conversion into private and cooperative enterprises and effective assistance to them at the stage of the formation of new forms of management in agriculture; the creation of the necessary base and infrastructure for agrarian reform; specialized banks, exchanges, investment funds, production of agricultural equipment, and so forth; an increase in the efficiency of the use of the research potential of Moldova and the development of venture enterprise providing for high returns and rapid savings. Development of the agro-industrial complex of Moldova and its consistent and decisive reform and also measures to saturate the consumer market with foodstuffs should remain a principal strategic priority. A key issue in this sphere is the development of small-scale rural processing industry. Utilizing economic levers, the main thing is to ensure the necessary investments for the construction or equipping of a designed number of small and medium-sized enterprises on the basis of compact equipment capable of manufacturing in situ a high-quality end product. This would make it possible to reduce losses of agricultural raw material and create additional and prestigious jobs for the rural population. The funds of shareholders in the person of agricultural enterprises with mixed capital, private investments, and government resources would be mobilized to this end. The destruction of the kolkhozes (stock companies) and the mass privatization of the land and fixed capital in the agrarian sector would be an unforgivable mistake. Consistent and carefully considered measures ensuring the proportionality and competition of all forms of ownership are needed more here than in any other sphere of economic activity. At the initial stage of comprehensive agrarian reform the state should render private initiative and the private farms effective support, creating for them the optimum conditions of activity and the prerequisites for healthy competition to emerge. The government should draw up as quickly as possible a program of the attraction and utilization of foreign investments and of the importation and assimilation of modern technology with regard to the chosen strategy and priorities. At the second stage (1995-1999) the denationalization of large-scale enterprises and their conversion into stock companies with the equal participation of the state as a shareholder in the sectors of strategic significance for Moldova and also the sale of production units to private individuals will continue. Important content of this stage of the formation of full-fledged market relations should be new driving forces and stimuli of the development of the economy: the genuine freedom of all commodity producers, the engagement of full-fledged market mechanisms, land reform and the rational use and conservation of natural resources, and the effective incorporation of free economic zones in the country's single economic complex. This stage will be characterized by the formation of developed commodity and currency markets and other markets--capital, manpower, securities, intellectual property. A competent personnel corps in the field of domestic and international business will gradually be created. Altogether these measures will create the necessary prerequisites of the normal functioning of an open-type market model of the economy with the minimum intervention on the part of the state and based on private initiative and competition protected by law. Problems of the budget deficit and the convertibility of the national currency will be resolved as the market relations are built. The surmounting of the extensive development of the economy and a rational approach to the utilization of natural resources, primarily the land and energy- and resource-saving technology, will create real prerequisites for the restoration of the upset balance in nature and make it possible to realize directed measures for protection of the environment also. The strategy of transition to a market economy should be the economic ideology of the whole of society, of everyone who considers Moldova his homeland and is prepared to share with it the burdens of the transitional period and the joy of future well-being. Lowering Tension in Society and Social Development Questions of social development are closely interconnected with society's achievement of a particular level of economic well-being making it possible to provide for the redistribution of material and financial resources for a solution of questions of a social nature. The saturation in short order of the consumer market with food and industrial commodities would create the prerequisites at the initial stage of the reforms for a lowering of social tension and the restoration of normal conditions for a stabilization of the situation in the economy. On the other hand, a reduction in the inflation hitting constantly at personal income could also stabilize the situation not only in the economy but in society as a whole as well. There is no doubt that as long as the republic is in a state of protracted economic crisis and until effective measures to get the better of inflation have been adopted, only irresponsible populists and political adventurers could promise a solution of absolutely all social questions. At the stage of stabilization of the situation in the socioeconomic sphere the Liberal Convention considers paramount the following questions: government support and the creation of normal living conditions for the disabled and needy strata of society--retirees, the handicapped, large families, and trainee youth. Strict consideration of the level of inflation and a timely increase in pensions, grants, and allowances; prevention of a decline in research, culture, education, and health care and government subsidies for them; stimulation of the creation of jobs and the assurance of social safeguards against unemployment; the development of diverse systems of insurance, private included, for the creation of additional channels of social protection. Provision will be made for these areas of social protection primarily from budget appropriations, the resources of the funds that are created, and with the help of government stimulation of philanthropy. Throughout the stabilization period, public medical services and education will remain free of charge. The subsequent and gradual introduction of private medical establishments and educational institutions must be undertaken so as not to be in any way detrimental to the general educational level of the citizens. With regard to the structural transformations in industry and agriculture close attention needs to be paid to the system of the retraining of specialists and workers and to the migration of manpower. A large share of responsibility will be borne by the fledgling class of entrepreneurs. The assistance they render the disabled part of society and the preservation of the solidarity of all strata of the populace in the difficult period of transition to the market economy could exert a positive influence on social processes and preserve peace and tranquillity in the country. An important condition of the achievement of this goal is the for assurance of each who so desires it of entrepreneurial freedom and the possibility of application of his powers in any sphere of activity in order that the more capable, industrious, and enterprising may attain to a higher social status in society. The appearance of a social stratum of Moldovan entrepreneurs, 15-20 percent of the total number of the able-bodied population, is a key factor of the realization of transformations, stabilization of the situation, continuation of market reforms, and assurance of economic upturn. The large social group of the intelligentsia, managers, and former career servicemen constitutes a good potential base of the future middle stratum. The formation of the new social structure of society will directly influence the machinery of state also and, via this latter, the efficiency of the activity of the state. It is essential to adopt measures to enhance the status, social image, and protection of public employees. The departure of skilled specialists for the commercial structures is exerting a negative influence on the capacity of the machinery of state for upholding public interests. The incomplete nature of the reforms and the retention in the hands of the machinery of state of practically the plenitude of power, economic included, with the low pay of the employees and the simultaneous accumulation of capital among representatives of business circles and also the absence of precise and long-term legal guarantees of their activity are creating altogether an extremely dangerous situation socially which is stimulating corruption and other crimes of office. The imperfection of the legislative base regulating the rights and obligations of the employees of the machinery of state and the activity of the law enforcement authorities in the fight against this social evil are making this situation worse and imparting a chronic nature to it. The Liberal Convention advocates the decisive eradication of corruption and other malfeasance by the authorities by way of the elimination of their causes and the strict application of the law in respect to all offenses, regardless of the position held. A change in the value orientation in society thanks to the directed formation of a pro-market consciousness in the population, in the young people primarily, is an important factor. A principal component of the social strategy of the Liberal Convention is the assurance on the basis of the development of the market economy of a high living standard and quality of life for all groups of the country's population, which would ensure the stability and dynamism of the development of Moldovan society. Considering the social stratification of society an inevitable process accompanying market reforms and the democratization of society, the Liberal Convention believes that a principal task in the social sphere, in the transitional period particularly, is the reduction to a rational minimum of the difference in personal income levels, economic levers being utilized for this. A balanced policy in this sphere would make it possible to avoid possible social conflicts caused by the difficulties of adaptation to the new realities. The fundamental principles of liberalism presuppose the introduction in all spheres of the activity of people and society of the principle of the equality before the law of all citizens, regardless of nationality and religious belief. The establishment of a climate of trust and dialogue, the removal of any form of discrimination, and the surmounting of egotism, group ambitions, and the habit of creating an enemy where constructive cooperation is needed would help us attain to a qualitatively new state of society that is freer and more civilized. In the future the combination in day-to-day practice of the principles of political and economic liberalism will make it possible to create a social environment in which the majority of people live freely, which will be guaranteed by private property and control over the political authorities on the part of the civil society.
