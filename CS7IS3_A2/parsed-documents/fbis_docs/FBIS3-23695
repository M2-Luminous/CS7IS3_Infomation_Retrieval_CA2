On 10 January, after a year-and-a-half silence, the separate tracking complex in Yevpatoriya, after connecting with the orbital station Mir, was "showing off" in the cosmic ether. Of course, Ukraine's attempt--the first in the history of the planet in which one state controls the space vehicle of another state -- wasn't without excesses. True enough, the people in orbit didn't notice that: knowledgeable staffers from the Flight Control Center near Moscow assure us that the contingency situation that arose when the Soyuz craft was docking with the station, for which some mass media have already blamed Ukraine, was caused by other circumstances. But then, on the ground, many have responded overly sensitively to the signals from Yevpatoriya. The fact of the matter is that a year and a half ago, all three tracking complexes located in Ukrainian territory (in Simferopol, Yevpatoriya, and Dunayevtsy in Khmelnitskaya Oblast) were disengaged from the unified Russian loop for controlling space vehicles. And, as we are told by the press service of the Military Space Forces of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, that step was absolutely necessary and justified for the interests of the Russian state. Ukraine, which at the time was going through the very peak of the self-effusive boom, nationalized the complexes and flatly refused to resubordinate the military servicing them to the Russian command. But that is a necessary condition for the normal functioning of orbital complexes and vehicles -- hardware, as we know, has nothing to do with democracy or pluralism. So in 1992, with one stroke of the pen, three complexes stuffed with super electronics and other "high-tech" gear were buried -- in a very literal sense, the not-very-sweet fate of the scrap yard was prepared for their remains. According to data from the Russia's Military Space Forces, nearly a third of the military servicemen were immediately placed on reserve status, 30 percent agreed to give up their warm and cozy southern nests for the prospect of work and were transferred to Russia, and the rest declared their oath of allegiance to Ukraine. What they did until 10 January, no one knows -- since, as our military people assure us, it is virtually impossible to operate the complexes "for what they're supposed to do" in unmanned mode. The only exception was the Yevpatoriya Center for Deep Space Communications, which was operating as before "in the system." In theory, substitutes were found in Russia for all three Ukrainian tracking complexes -- not full-fledged substitutes, of course, but substitutes that were entirely satisfactory. And only the Yevpatoriya center, with its 70-meter antenna (a second complex, and the only one in Russia, with similar capabilities is located near the Far East's Ussuriysk) couldn't be totally eliminated from the plans. Yevpatoriya figures in the agreement on the international space observatory Granat, which was concluded in 1988, when parties of the Belovezh agreement hadn't yet become political diehards. Violation of the conditions of the hard-currency agreement would have threatened Russia with rather large fines, and so, as happens in such cases, the question was solved very quickly and, without any problems on the Ukrainian side, agreed to. But nobody made any agreements on the control of Russian space vehicles from within Ukrainian territory! True, in the space circles people have long been talking as if Ukraine was ready to return to the unified control loop. In the Russian Space Agency, they assert that the problem is being studied -- in fact, nobody wants the unique equipment that, by the way, was created by the entire country (USSR) to get lost. And preliminary agreements already exist. But Russian Space Agency officials refuse for now to answer the question about who it was "on our side" who sanctioned the initiative regarding the separate tracking station in Yevpatoriya. In an interview with IZVESTIYA, the director of the tracking complex, Col Viktor Dubasov, declared that those under him are simply voluntarily backing up the work of their Russian colleagues. At the same time, however, it is obvious that such decisions are not being made by the officers of the middle ranks. In any case, all the talks are being conducted behind the backs of those who are directly involved in the control of Russian space hardware. For the Military Space Forces that are responsible for both military orbital equipment and all the "civilian" equipment, the "revival" of Yevpatoriya was a big, and not very pleasant, surprise. The commander of the Military Space Forces, Col Gen Vladimir Ivanov, who is also the chairman of the Interstate Commission on Manned Missions, came out against the initiative. The Russian military feel that all the attempts of Ukraine to return to the "loop" will be feasible only after the problem of the division of the juridical responsibility is solved and a bilateral agreement regulating the activity of the Ukrainian space forces is signed. And until then, any inclusion of Yevpatoriya is just senseless: the Ukrainians will not be able to control space vehicles without knowing the highly classified system of codes, but to create rather serious hindrances will be simple.
