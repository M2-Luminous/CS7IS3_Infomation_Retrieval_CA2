Bill Clinton was very firm: The United States is ready to support NATO air strikes in Bosnia if the situation in Sarajevo among Muslim enclaves besieged by the Serbs does not improve. However, the United Nations must give the go-ahead. The issue will probably be discussed in detail this evening. The famous Partnership for Peace initiative was the main topic of talks this afternoon. It was signed by 22 countries, including Russia and the former East Bloc countries. Willy van der Vort has just spoken to Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who talked about the two pillars of this Partnership for Peace, security and economy: [Begin recording] [Dehaene] I believe that the future of the East European countries as democracies will depend much more on economic evolution than on military alliances. Indeed, I believe that if the new democratic structures cannot bring about economic welfare, which means a step backwards economically, these democracies will never make it. It is clear that partnership with the European Union, which is first and foremost an economic partnership, is as important as partnership with NATO. [Van der Vort] Are you saying that it is as important, or rather, do you have the feeling that you have added an extra card to your game, but that what is important will be done by the European Union? [Dehaene] I think that the answer is both: Partnership with the European Union, with the prospect of the countries of East Europe participating in the European Union, also carries consequences concerning defense solidarity. [Van der Vort] But the Partnership includes some conditions which may slow down the process enabling these Central European countries to join the Atlantic alliance. Are you not under the impression that this will displease Central European countries? [Dehaene] I do not believe that the Partnership contains conditions which may slow down the process. On the contrary, I think that the Partnership for Peace contains conditions and an organization which should facilitate evolution toward the participation of these countries in NATO. Collaboration on the military and strategic levels, which is included in this Partnership for Peace, goes further than some may think, and I believe that it will be very important, during the meeting in Prague between President Clinton and [words indistinct] with the countries of the [word indistinct], that he should clearly explain the contents of the concrete proposal.
