The Federal Government also wants to support the European Union [EU] efforts to help Ukraine. Kinkel spoke in favor of an early partnership agreement between the European Union and Ukraine. Kinkel met in Bonn with members of a Ukrainian delegation, including Foreign Minister Zlenko, Economics Minister Shpek, Foreign Trade Minister Slyepichev, and Health Minister Spizhenko. For Minister Slyepichev, Bonn is one of the most important supporters of economic reforms in Ukraine. "Integration in the world market is decisive for our reforms," he stated in an interview with HANDELSBLATT. Since Chancellor Kohl visited President Kravchuk in Kiev last year, the exchange of views and information has become decisively faster and better. For Kiev, it is important to intensify the dialogue with institutions like GATT, the World Bank, the IMF, and the European Union to ensure that "we can participate in the international division of labor without any restrictions." He sees a considerable market potential for Ukraine's independent space industry (including missile technology, radar plants, and satellites) and, above all, in the agricultural industry. Slyepichev strongly rejected the often-voiced criticism by Western observers that there is not sufficient readiness for reform in Ukraine, that reforms are even being delayed. Ukraine even adopted more far-reaching reform laws in some areas than other reform states. No other country has so few restrictions for foreign investors who want to buy land within the framework of joint ventures or who want to establish enterprises. A list of 30,000 state-owned enterprises which are to be privatized in the course of this year will shortly be published. In fact, large and commercial enterprises are involved, but small and medium-sized enterprises represent the majority. A modification of rules designed to promote joint ventures more effectively is also expected for this year. One of the reasons for Ukraine's poor image is probably "that some media view Ukraine through special glasses." When assessing the country, one must not forget -- "which usually happens" -- that it was not possible for Ukraine to develop economic structures of its own in the past decades. "We were always part of the Soviet economic system." Slyepichev rules out Ukrainian membership in the ruble zone. "If we wanted to join the ruble zone, we would not negotiate loans or a stabilization fund with the IMF." Generally, it is important to stabilize the currencies. He does not foresee any negative consequences, such as losses in foreign exchange holdings. Slyepichev also sees positive aspects for his country resulting the agreement on the ruble zone between Belarus and the Russian Federation. Trade with the neighboring country Belarus, for example, can be carried out and cleared much more smoothly. Kiev is now negotiating a credit worth $700 million -- an IMF delegation is currently visiting Kiev -- but, according to Slyepichev, an additional fund should be discussed to stabilize the Ukrainian currency. "It takes much too long until the IMF actually provides the money, but our currency must be stabilized in the near future." Slyepichev sees a clear link between Western credits and President Kravchuk's promise to disarm the nuclear weapons inherited from the former USSR. Health Minister Yuriy Spizhenko also believes that Ukraine's readiness to eliminate the nuclear weapons arsenal has a certain "market value." "In fact, we are the only state in the world that wants to eliminate its nuclear weapons completely. One reason is Chernobyl." Thus, Ukraine hopes for humanitarian aid so that the enormous problems concerning medical care can be settled. The consequences of the Chernobyl disaster are not even in the foreground: "We have much more severe problems in the treatment of diabetes or in the sphere of anesthesia." The establishment of insulin factories is urgently required. The plans exist, and thus Ukraine is waiting for foreign aid to realize them according to the motto: We exchange weapons for health.
