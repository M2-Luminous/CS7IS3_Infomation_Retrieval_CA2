An article published by the newspaper TRABAJADORES explains local authorities allow all temporary trips abroad with a minimum of procedures and this has resulted in the issuance of 100,000 of these authorizations in 1993. Only 30,000 people, however, were able to fulfill their wishes because the others were denied the corresponding visa, mainly by the U.S. interests office in Havana. Regarding citizens who definitely wish to settle abroad, all the Cuban Immigration Directorate demands is a visa from the country to which the applicant is going, enough funds to pay for the ticket, and, in the case of males between 16 and 27 years of age, completion of their military service. The paper explains that thousands of Cubans who live abroad also received, in recent months, permission to visit the island following a simple procedure taken care of at the Cuban consulate in the country of their residency. The newspaper adds: Contrary to Cuba's attitude, Washington does everything it can to make the immigration issue another thorn in the extremely difficult bilateral relations, opening its doors to all kinds of enemies of the revolutionary process and encouraging the desertion of professionals as part of a preconceived policy. The newspaper states that no boundary whatsoever has been respected in this undertaking, and adds the fact that the normalization of immigration relations has always been a goal of the Cuban Government is rejected. For example, it mentions the failure to comply with an agreement signed in 1984 in which the United States accepted the figure of 20,000 visas per year for Cuban applicants who wished to travel to U.S. territory and an additional 3,000 visas for people who were punished for counterrevolutionary crimes. Also, it condemns the fact that the White House facilitates, without exception or numerical limit, risky illegal departures from Cuba, which extract a high price in lives of victims who are instruments of a destabilizing action which violates international laws.
