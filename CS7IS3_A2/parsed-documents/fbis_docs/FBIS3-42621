Smirnov, by EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN correspondent B. Rachkov: "Russia Will Be Reborn Through Entrepreneurship"] [Text] On the occasion of the new year, Stanislav Alekseyevich Smirnov, president of the Russian Federation Chamber of Commerce and Industry [TPP], talked with our EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN correspondent. The conversation began with the most important event to occur in the life of the Russian Chamber this past year. [Smirnov] This important event was, of course, the establishment of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as a public organization representing entrpreneurship in our country. Public, not state, as it essentially had been before. An organization expressing and defending the interests of entrepreneurs of all forms of property, not exclusively state property, as in the past. At the same time we are not repudiating everything positive accomplished by the former union chamber and its structural subdivisions. I want to emphasize, however, that under conditions of transition to the market, even the best of the former chamber has nearly always been turned into its opposite and has yielded to bureaucratic turnpikes on the new roads to initiative and independence. On the other hand, any independent energy and initiative from new market structures cowered before the shadow cast by the old official grandeur of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The chamber's former administrative skill had to be placed firmly in the service of the enterprise being born among us. Enterprise in all its forms, from large, medium, and small enterprises, from juridical and physical persons, from the leaders of state industrial giants to private entrepreneur just starting out. Bear in mind that the first stage in the establishment of the chamber came about in a legislative vacuum. Many factors hindered the actual legislation of the Russian chamber's new functions, which are the same as those generally accepted throughout the civilized world. The tension of the political struggle around economic transformations in Russia also took its toll on the reforming of public entrepreneurial organizations, the highest link of which are the chambers of commerce and industry. Actually, sticks have been thrust into the wheels of reform frequently just out of ordinary incompetence and sloppiness. Otherwise, how can we explain the impartial facts of looting and pilfering--if not by local authorities then by local "bosses"--of the bulk of what was created by the union chamber. By March 1993, however, the presidential edict "On the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation" had put a great deal in place. It not only put a stop to anarchy in the interpretation of the federal chamber's role under market conditions, it also defined the chamber's new functions as an important public entrepreneurial organization. The edict stimulated the passage of an even more necessary document, the corresponding law, which was also drafted under rather contradictory circumstances. Without going into depth, I will cite one telling detail: the bill's opponent, representing primarily the interests of yesterday's command system, unable to block passage of the law in parliament, actually drafted a presidential veto. It didn't work out, though. The law "On the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation" laid down precise legal bases for all lines of activity of the main public union for our country's entrepreneurs. Simultaneously, a new law was drafted "On International Commercial Arbitration," which, along with the first law, lent Russia's system of chambers of commerce and trade and their functions new meaning, like that generally accepted in world practice. [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Stanislav Alekseyevich, the difficult path and the drama of initiating the activities of the Russian TPP are similar to what is going on in general in our country's economy. What do you think, will the chamber in its new capacity be able to introduce any kind of organizing principle into the rebirth of the Russian economy? [Smirnov] Yes, we are not functioning in isolation from the country's economy. We are experiencing along with it and the people as a whole the same economic successes, losses, and failures. The definite advance toward a civilized market is our success as well. The colossal drop in production and foreign trade circulation for the country has had a negative effect on our activities as well. Most Russian Federation TPP members and many of its foreign partners agree that "shock therapy" has proved itself an inadequate means for pulling the economy out of its stagnation, that it did not take into consideration the country's social, ethnic, and cultural characteristics. Under these conditions, we see our chief task as introducing more common sense and social principles into the reforming of the economy. We are striving to do this on all levels--locally, in the various regions of Russia through the more than 60 territorial chambers of commerce and trade, and also at the highest level, in the capital, using our own legislative initiative, entrusted to us by the law, and also using our authorization to participate in the activities of the structures of executive power. Most importantly, we are directing our main efforts toward protecting and representing the interests of our country's entrepreneurship in the center and in the locales, in our own country and abroad. For the federal and territorial chambers, there are no higher interests than the interests of entrepreneurship in general and of each entrepreneur in particular. Our work has been complicated by continuing attempts to push the chamber away from economic creation, to nudge it onto the path of political confrontations. No farther back than at the recent session of the Russian Federation TPP, in December 1993, another attempt was made to draw entrepreneurs into a harsh political struggle. A corresponding resolution was even introduced. [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Yes, that was a dramatic episode toward the end of the congress. We journalists waited with impatience and alarm for your reaction to the next political maneuver within your representative forum for business people. After all, this was happening at the height of the Russia-wide election battles for the Duma and the Federal Assembly. [Smirnov] The chamber's administration and I as its president recognize full well how important it is for Russia to have effective legislative organs. That is why when it came to supporting candidates for the new parliament we bore in mind not so much their party affiliation as their potential ability to adopt a balanced reformist position and actively facilitate the development of Russian entrepreneurship. Nor did the TPP stand on the sidelines during the pre-election struggle. We held meetings with leaders from several blocs and parties, as a result of which we were able to clarify for ourselves the illnesses and tasks of young Russian business. In other words, our chamber is scarcely an apolitical organization. The only thing we are against is extremism, not only in the economy but also in politics. Extremism in any form is contraindicated for entrepreneurship. History teaches us this, too. [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Our weekly, and you are well aware of this, regularly and from time to time sheds detailed light on the specific lines of activity of the federal and territorial chambers of trade and commerce. I would like to take advantage of this conversation with you and report to the more than half-million subscribers to EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN your opinion on several other problems. [Smirnov] I think that none of us have any common problem more important than achieving Russia's rebirth. I am deeply convinced that this rebirth lies through the normal development of our country's entrepreneurship. For the time being, specifically through the development and logical shaping and organization of modern, competitive structures, and then through them prospering. An understanding of this mission permeates all links of the Russian Federation TPP, the territorial chambers, and our member organizations. It is gratifying that their number is constantly growing. Today the chamber comprises about 20 Russia-wide branch associations of entrepreneurs and nearly 90 local unions and associations of business people. If we were to talk about the most critical problems shared by all entrepreneurs, then they are obvious. The main problem is that the reforms carried out so far have not created auspicious conditions for the development of our country's entrepreneurship. Due to the pressure of taxation, our undeveloped legal base, and the miscalculations of privatization and stock distribution, our country's productive and scientific-technical potential are being undermined. Entrepreneurs have been forced to concentrate their activities in the sphere of circulation and are not risking investment in production with a long cycle or in the infrastructure. The permit-ridden, very complicated system for opening new objects of economic life is fettering entrepreneurial initiative and simultaneously expanding the ground for corruption and graft. Isn't the high inflation, the lack of advances in structural perestroika, and the looming unemployment that threatens to turn not 5 million but 15-20 million Russians into unemployed even more alarming? The committees and commissions of the Russian Federation TPP and the scientific, industrial, financial, and other economic institutions that are collaborating closely with them are actively involved in resolving those critical problems cited here as well as others. I assure you, this work is not pointless. Our proposals and drafts are always awaiting the attention of the legislative and executive structures now forming. So that our work does not find itself out in the cold with legislative institutions again, we are acquiring the ways of civilized lobbying as we go--naturally, in the interests of our country's entrepreneurship. [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Earlier you touched on the problem of employment. It's somehow unusual to associate this problem with the activities of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. [Smirnov] You are not the only one to think that. This is one more stereotype bequeathed to us from the times when employment here was given out as a per capita statistic, and so there was no one and no reason to worry about unemployment, especially for the chamber. In a developed modern market society, though, successful entrepreneurship and robust employment are two sides of the same coin. You can't have one without the other, as many chambers of commerce and industry in the West have clarified for themselves long since. Anyone in the know is aware that in Japan, Germany, Italy, Austria, and many other states, economic prosperity and civil stability are grounded specifically in a literate social partnership, which is significantly ensured by the well-regulated cooperation of the chambers of the trade unions, entrepreneurs, and the state. This is why our chamber's representatives are taking an increasingly active part in the activities of the Russian Trilateral Commission's working group on the regulation of social-labor disputes. [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] We have not had time to touch on several other lines of activity specific to the chambers. But your affairs are just unfolding, and the year has only begun. I look forward to meeting with you again. [Smirnov] I am always happy to get together with the readers of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, who, as I have been told, together with subscribers total more than 3 million. One has to assume that these are all people of business and primarily "decisionmaking," as people say nowadays, in economic life. It is a worthwhile audience for representatives of the chambers of commerce and industry.
