The mill topped its first quarterly plan this year by 2 percent and is now fulfilling daily quotas at more than 120 percent with the goal of hitting the first six months' target ahead of schedule. The mill is situated in the western part of North Hwanghae Province 56 kilometres south of Pyongyang. The output and variety of textiles are on an annual increase at the mill. Its total industrial output value now is 6.2 times that 20 years ago; cotton yarn output 1.4 times, textiles output 3 times and processed textiles output 6.3 times. The mill which had put out only a few kinds of cloth in the past now mass-produces over 40 kinds of refined-pattern and high-quality textiles including high-quality suit cloth, shirt cloth, water-resistant cloth, linings, printed cotton and processed plastic cloth. Several ten million metres of high-quality textiles are produced annually by the mill and they are exported to foreign countries and supplied to the population of the country. The material and technical foundations of the mill have been consolidated immensely. Workers and technicians there have made more than 1,000 kinds of accessories by their own efforts to remodel along modern lines several hundred machines including shinning machines, shuttleless knitters and hydraulic press looms. They have manufactured printing machines also by their own efforts and introduced them in production. Thus, the number of spinning machines has increased 11 times, weaving machines 3.8 times and printing machines 5 times at the mill over the past 20 years. A repair base has also been consolidated. A large number of innovators and thousands of recipients of state decorations have been produced there in this course. A well-arranged study-while-working higher educational base at the mill annually rears several hundred technicians and skilled workers.
