FR940816-0-00005 FR940816-0-00003 Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 558 New Animal Drugs For Use In Animal Feeds; Tiamulin AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect the approval of a supplemental new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Fermenta Animal Health Co. The supplemental NADA provides for the use of tiamulin (Denagard ® ) Type A medicated article to make a Type C medicated feed used for the treatment of swine dysentery. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: George K. Haibel, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;133), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1644. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Fermenta Animal Health Co., 10150 North Executive Hills Blvd., Kansas City, MO 64153, is the sponsor of NADA 139&hyph;472, which was approved on July 17, 1987 (52 FR 26955), for the use of tiamulin Type A medicated articles in the preparation of Type C medicated swine feeds. As first approved, the Type C medicated feed containing 35 grams per ton (g/t) of tiamulin could be used to control swine dysentery. The Type C medicated feed containing 10 g of tiamulin per ton could be used for increased rate of weight gain from weaning to 56.70 kilograms (kg) (125 pounds (lb)), which was later approved to 113.40 kg (250 lb) on October 6, 1988 (53 FR 39257). The sponsor has submitted a supplemental application providing for the use of tiamulin Type A medicated article containing 5, 10, or 113.4 g/lb of tiamulin hydrogen fumarate to make a Type C medicated swine feed containing 200 g/t of tiamulin for the treatment of swine dysentery. The supplemental NADA is approved as of July 7, 1994, and the regulations are amended by modifying §558.600 (21 CFR 558.600) to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. In addition, the regulation is amended by modifying the genera `` Treponema '' to include the currently scientifically accepted genera name `` Serpulina .'' Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this approval qualifies for 3 years exclusivity beginning July 7, 1994, because the supplemental application contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval of the application and conducted by the applicant. The 3 years of marketing exclusivity applies only to the new claim ``for treatment of swine dysentery'' for which the supplemental application was approved. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 558 Animal drugs, Animal feeds. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 21 CFR part 558 is amended as follows: PART 558_NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR USE IN ANIMAL FEEDS 1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 558 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 512, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b, 371). 2. Section 558.600 Tiamulin is amended in paragraph (c)(1)(i) by removing the word `` Treponema '' and adding in its place the words `` Serpulina (Treponema) '' and by adding new paragraph (c)(3) to read as follows: §558.600 Tiamulin. * * * * * (c) * * * (3) Amount . 200 grams of tiamulin per ton. (i) Indications for use . Treatment of swine dysentery associated with Serpulina (Treponema) hyodysenteriae susceptible to tiamulin. (ii) Limitations . Feed continuously as the sole feed for 14 consecutive days. Withdraw feed 7 days before slaughter. Not for use in swine over 113.40 kilograms (250 pounds) body weight. Use as the only source of tiamulin. Swine being treated with tiamulin should not have access to feeds containing polyether ionophores (e.g., monensin, lasalocid, narasin, semduramicin, or salinomycin) as adverse reactions may occur.
