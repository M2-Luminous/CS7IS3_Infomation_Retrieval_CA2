Commercial production is expected to begin during the first half of 1995. It is estimated that daily production will be 1,500 metric tons. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 13 Jan 94 p 6) The National State Railroad Company announced that it will put its freight subsidiary up for bids. Ignacio Echavarria, chairman of the National State Railroad Company, explained that the objective is to decentralize the national railroad system, improve its facilities, and expedite operations. The subsidiary was created in 1993 to handle freight in central and southern Chile. Echavarria stated that both Chilean and foreign investors will be able to bid for 51 percent of the subsidiary's shares, adding that this is the first and probably the only privatization of a sound and operational company that will be carried out under the current administration. The bidding terms will be available on 31 January. (Santiago Radio Cooperativa Network in Spanish 1000 GMT 22 Jan 94)
