The obstacle to the smooth implementation of the agreement was the right it granted the Russians to build an electricity plant in Thraki and sell energy to the Greek Power Corporation (DEI), as well as the right to sell to third parties any surplus quantities of natural gas not absorbed by the Public Natural Gas Enterprise (DEPA). According to available information, the two sides have agreed in principle that the Thraki electricity plant will be built by the Russians on the classic DEI "turnkey" system or a similar one so as not to contradict Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) preelectoral statements, rather than on a self-financing basis as was originally envisioned. With regard to another obstacle to the agreement (access by the Russians to the Greek delivery network), it seems that the two sides have reached an agreement, according to which DEPA will have the right to determine the volume of surplus quantities that the Russians will be able to sell to third parties. Finally, the remaining terms of the addendum, according to which the Russians will build the branches of the central pipeline toward Lavrion, etc., and the agreement will be lengthened by six years are definitely in Greece's interest.
