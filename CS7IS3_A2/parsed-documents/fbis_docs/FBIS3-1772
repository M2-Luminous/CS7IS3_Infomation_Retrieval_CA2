The spokesman pointed out: From April to November 1993, representatives of the Chinese and the British Governments held 17 rounds of talks on the 1994-95 election arrangements in Hong Kong. Prior to the talks, the two countries reached an understanding of confidentiality of the contents of talks. Now the British, without having consultation with China, have unilaterally published the contents of the talks, distorting and attacking the Chinese stance in an attempt to shift responsibility for disruption of the talks. China is compelled to make public relevant talks on this to ensure a correct understanding of the facts. The facts published by the spokesman concerning several major issues in the Sino-British talks consist of seven issues and a postscript. The seven issues are: 1) Britain obstinately clings to the "three violations" political system program during the talks; 2) Britain attempts to interfere with affairs which fall within the scope of Chinese sovereignty; 3) The agreement and understanding reached between the two countries on the issue of the Election Committee must be honored; 4) The original intention of functional constituency elections must be upheld; 5) The issue of the "through train" can only be resolved within the scope of the National People's Congress decision and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law; 6) China has exerted great efforts to reach agreement on the issue of election arrangements of regional organizations; and 7) Britain has deliberately disrupted the talks. The spokesman pointed out: The essence of the dispute between China and Britain on the issue of Hong Kong's political system is not a question of whether or not we want to develop democracy, but one of whether or not we should keep good faith internationally and converge the Basic Law with the realization of Hong Kong's smooth transition. The dispute has been started by the changes in Britain's policy toward Hong Kong. Facts will prove that such changes do not conform with Britain's interests and will cause damage to Hong Kong. The latest Sino-British talks have broken down because of Britain's disruption. China deems it necessary to sternly reiterated that in accordance with the stipulations of the Sino- British Joint Declaration, British administration of Hong Kong ends on 30 June 1997, and the Chinese Government will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. The components of the political system structure of the British administration of Hong Kong -- the last British Hong Kong District Board, the two municipal councils, and the Legislative Council -- must be dissolved along with the end of the British administration period. From 1 July 1997, the political system structure of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region will be organized and established according to the NPC decision and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. In conclusion, the spokesman emphatically pointed out: Nobody can obstruct Hong Kong's forthcoming return to the motherland's embrace. The Chinese Government and people are entirely confident that they will be able to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule, and to implement the principle of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law to preserve Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.
