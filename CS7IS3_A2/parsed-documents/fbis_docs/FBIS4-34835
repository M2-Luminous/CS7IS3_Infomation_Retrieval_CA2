"This is the only step that is lacking so the country can receive credit as a trustworthy country in the world," a diplomatic source said, and he explained that the president's promptness is due to the fact that the treaty is about to be revised and therefore it is the appropriate time for Argentina to sign the document, having refused to sign it in the 1970's. The president's promptness also is due to the fact that, as a UN Security Council member, the Argentine Government told the United States that it is willing to support that organization if economic sanctions are imposed on North Korea for having violated the treaty. If Jimmy Carter's mediation with North Korea to get the latter to accept routine inspections of its nuclear plants fails, then Argentina would find itself in the position of sanctioning the Koreans without having signed the treaty. In the 1970's the following countries, in addition to Argentina, did not sign the treaty: India, Pakistan, Israel, Cuba, and Brazil, although Brazil, like Argentina, signed the Tlatelolco Treaty, but it was not willing to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. "The countries that do not sign the treaties are saying that they reserve the right to develop nuclear technology for non-peaceful means. But we already have changed our position, and now we do not want to be left out of the meeting that will be held in April to decide whether the treaty, which is for 30 years, should be extended," the diplomat said. The most important local newspaper, the GLOBE AND MAIL, on 21 June on page 2 published an article lauding Menem for signing the agreement with Canada and the announcement regarding the treaty. Greenpeace [preceding word in English] had another interpretation: It organized a small demonstration to protest the agreement because the organization says the main objective is to pave the way for the sale of the Canadian reactor Candu-3 to Argentina. "Argentina does not need it because it already has one, but construction was postponed due to the lack of funds," according to Greenpeace [preceding word in English]. "It is evident that Canada is interested in selling the Candu to Argentina," admitted Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet.
