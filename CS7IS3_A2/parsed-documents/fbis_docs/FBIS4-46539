U.S. and Soviet Special Services Hunted for Them Even...Underground During Cold War. What About Now?"] [Text] Everything was going smoothly during the preparations for one of the first treaties between the USSR and the United States on limiting nuclear tests. The sides had agreed that nuclear explosions do irreparable damage to the environment. And in 1974 the treaty "On the Limitation of Underground Nuclear Tests" was signed. But it remained unratified for another 17 years (!) -- ratification only occurring in 1991. Why? First and foremost, owing to the lack of joint services to monitor nuclear weapons tests and the top-secret nature of the national services. During the Cold War everything relating to the development and testing of nuclear monsters was top-secret. Each state strove to retain its priorities in this sphere. But the most surprising point was something else. No intelligence service was able to obtain the information which was obtained by one of the USSR Defense Ministry's special services. It was set up by a 13 May 1958 government decree. As the document said, it was aimed at organizing permanent monitoring of nuclear weapons testing by foreign states and the development of the requisite ways and means to carry out this task. A great deal for the technical equipping of the USSR Special Monitoring Service was done by well-known Academicians I.V. Kurchatov and M.A. Sadovskiy.... The very first chief of the service and its creator was Doctor of Technical Sciences Major General A. Ustyumenko, a State Prize winner. Our Informational Note: Research into the fundamental possibilities of recording the physical phenomena accompanying nuclear explosions began in the USSR in 1954-1957. That was when the first Armed Forces subunits designed to monitor nuclear weapons tests abroad were set up. The main result of this period was the practical affirmation of the possibility of carrying out such monitoring. The results obtained formed the basis of the USSR's position at the Geneva talks on ending nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space, and underwater. For 35 years the Special Monitoring Service managed to stay "in the background," so to speak. (Although one of its subdivisions -- the Eshery Seismic Laboratory -- has been repeatedly mentioned by the mass media in connection with the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict). Only today can we say something about it. How is it organized? Is it true that it can determine the location of any nuclear test at any test range in the world? The brain center of the Special Monitoring Service of what is now the Russian Federation Defense Ministry is located in Moscow. This is where the organizational, operational, and scientific center is based. The city of Dubna in Moscow Oblast is home to the Information Collection and Processing Center. And then there are special monitoring laboratories, automated seismic stations, and autonomous observation centers dispersed throughout Russia and even the CIS. We entered the organizational and operations center. The duty officer -- Lieutenant Colonel V. Yakovlev -- got up to meet us. Alongside his console are automated workstations equipped with visual display terminals and personal computers for the duty seismologist engineers. Graphics of earthquake intensity cover the walls. On the other side is a huge three-color display screen for monitoring the seismic situation worldwide. "This is where the data from observation posts located around the country is collated and analyzed," Lt. Col. Yakovlev said. "We can time any nuclear explosion down to the second...." Readers will clearly already have guessed that the main way of detecting underground nuclear explosions is by seismic equipment. In order to register the seismic waves generated during the explosion special highly sensitive instruments -- seismographs set up in tunnels or wells -- are used. The more powerful the explosion, the stronger the seismic wave at the earth's crust and, consequently, the stronger the seismic signals recorded. Information is then transmitted by satellite to Dubna, where high-speed computers (up to 5 million operations per second) process it. For instance, seismic signals from the nuclear range in Nevada reach us a few minutes later. And in a very short time full details of the underground nuclear explosion (time, place, yield, type, and so forth) are reported to the General Staff. Data from other monitoring methods -- gas-aerosol, magnetic, acoustic, and electronic -- are used to detect ground, air, and space-based nuclear explosions. It is impossible to talk about each one. I will just say a few words about the aerosol method. There are observation posts on Russian territory equipped with devices to sample the tiniest aerosol particles from the air. These devices include very simple equipment -- gauze-covered tables to collect particles that settle on the ground -- and complex filtration and ventilation devices (a kind of huge vacuum cleaner that sucks in thousands of cubic meters of air). That is on the ground. At high altitude specially equipped aircraft are used to sample the aerosols. The heart of the matter is that radioactive products of nuclear explosions containing radionuclides can occur within the aerosols. From them it is possible to determine the design [ustroystvo] of the nuclear charge and find out whether the state has gone very far in improving its nuclear weapons. This is why at the central laboratory in Moscow aerosol samples are impatiently awaited by physicists and analytical chemists armed with numerous clever instruments. Specialists can learn a lot, for instance, from using gamma-spectroscopes with semiconductor detectors, mass spectrometers, and laser analyzers. Ultimately all this helps to improve the country's security and is a means of verifying the fulfillment of treaty commitments by other states. The experience of radiation research was very useful in 1986, when many Special Monitoring Service specialists had to take part in eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster in the first few days after it happened. They experienced all the "joys" of working in the airborne and ground reconnaissance zone and near the smoking reactor. Our Informational Note: Over the course of 35 years the Special Monitoring Service has recorded more than 600 different nuclear explosions at foreign test ranges by the United States, France, China, Britain, and India. This has helped the country's leaders to make not only appropriate but technically substantiated political decisions in good time. With the end of the Cold War the problems with monitoring nuclear explosions ought to have diminished. But no, explosions have begun to be carried out solely underground, in tunnels and boreholes. And with small and exceptionally small yields. This has made them harder to detect. Potential nuclear weapon states have also emerged -- Israel, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, South Africa, North Korea, and Brazil. The world has started talking about the threat of nuclear terrorism. All this has made sober-minded statesmen seek above all a political solution to this problem. Talks under UN auspices have begun in Geneva on a comprehensive nuclear test ban. But only two countries currently have highly developed and effective systems for monitoring nuclear tests -- Russia and the United States. In other words, the realities of life itself are forcing the two states to pool their efforts. In the quest for new and guaranteed ways and means to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. What progress has been made? "Plenty," Colonel V. Kovalenko, deputy chief of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry's Special Monitoring Service, said. "In December 1992 we signed a memorandum of cooperation with the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which deals with similar issues. This makes it possible for us to exchange seismic data of potential value for monitoring nuclear weapons tests and to carry out joint experiments...." This partnership is mutually advantageous, since both Russia and the United States have already reached the limits of the monitoring systems sited on their own territories. The computerized exchange of information between the centers in Dubna and Arlington near Washington is a substantial backup for this monitoring. Moreover, in accordance with the treaty between Russia and the United States on nuclear weapons limitation and testing, we have obtained an opportunity to carry out monitoring at U.S. stations (at Brekkhils [name as transliterated], Newport, and Tulsa), while they are able to do so here (at Obninsk, Arti, and Novosibirsk). It is interesting that other countries are already expressing interest in cooperating with the Special Monitoring Service, rightly believing that this will promote the process of global verification of a nuclear test ban and the speedy conclusion of an international treaty in this sphere. There are also some purely civilian aspects to the Special Monitoring service's work. Last year it was decided through the Russian Federation Government decree "On the Formation of a Federal Seismological Observation and Earthquake Forecasting System" to pool the efforts of seismologists from the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Special Monitoring Service, and certain other departments to purposefully work on curbing such a terrible force of nature as earthquakes -- even though forecasting them is quite a complex and risky business currently being cautiously tackled by only a few scientists around the world. But the Special Monitoring Service has done some good groundwork in this area too. A unique data base on earthquakes since 1978 has been compiled and a map of earthquake-prone areas has been drawn up.... Huge plans are afoot. There is a readiness to cooperate with Aeroflot and other airlines in issuing information on storm fronts. And to cooperate with customs officials in detecting certain narcotic substances with the help of air analyzers.... But, nonetheless, the main aim is to create a global computer network producing information on nuclear weapons, to become integrated into an international system for the seismic monitoring of nuclear weapons tests, and also to use space-based and other means for purposefully monitoring nuclear weapons. Almost everything -- experience, a high level of technical equipment, and unique specialists who training takes many years -- is in place to accomplish this. The United States and Russia are currently not carrying out nuclear tests. I would recall that we have declared a moratorium until September 1994. As has the United States -- although B. Clinton is said to have already promised to extend it for another year. We hope to goodness he does. But the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Special Monitoring Service's work will not, I repeat, be diminishing. After all, its very existence is a kind of guarantee and precondition for a nuclear-free world.
