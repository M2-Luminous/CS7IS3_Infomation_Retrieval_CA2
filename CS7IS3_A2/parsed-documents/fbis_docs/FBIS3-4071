The results of such control, according to Mr. Yin, will be the key to development of the national economy this year. The meeting centered on examination work by the banks nationwide, confirming that the main theme of financial supervision this year would concentrate on inspection of financial institutions with strict restrictions on the scale of loans for fixed assets investment by those institutions. This year is very important, according to Mr. Yin, as it be the time when intensive restructuring of the financial system takes place. Following the change of functions by the central bank, it should concentrate on supervision and administration of financial institutions with strengthened inspection. Examination work would guarantee effective implementation of the restructuring of the financial system and help financial enterprises develop in a healthy way while at the same keeping the financial system in order. Mr. Yin stressed that inspection departments of various levels of the bank had to gather their strength to launch examination work on the control of loans for fixed assets investment in the second half of this year. They had to deal harshly with excessive releases of loans, loans coming from working capital and loans for speculation in real estate shares.
