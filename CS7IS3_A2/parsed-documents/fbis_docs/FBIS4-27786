FBIS4-27786 "dreas108__a94017" FBIS-EAS-94-108-A Daily Report 6 June 1994 ANNEX Japan Defense Agency Says DPRK Missile Test Unlikely Defense Agency Says DPRK Missile Test Unlikely OW0506044194 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database in Japanese 5 Jun 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0506044194 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database Japanese BFN [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 4 June Evening Edition] [Text] On 4 June, Defense Agency [DA] sources commented on reports that the DPRK (North Korea) plans to conduct a ballistic missile-launching test, and said according to analysis conducted by the DA and the Self-Defense Forces, the possibility of the DPRK conducting the test is less than 50 percent. It was also learned that, since May 1993, the DPRK has conducted two or three preparations for ballistic missile test launches, but did not actually conduct the tests. According to DA officials, the ballistic missile the DPRK wants to test-fire is thought to be the Nodong-1, which has a firing range of about 1,000 km. The official said it is highly likely that the missile is the same type as the one fired at the end of May last year. The officials noted: 1) it has been confirmed that the DPRK has been prepared to test-fire Nodong missiles two to three times since the time of the test in May of last year, but did not actually perform the tests; and 2) though, no doubt, the DPRK is getting ready for another test launching, it will probably not go so far as to carry it out now, when tensions are high over the issue of that country going ahead with changing nuclear reactor fuel rods.
