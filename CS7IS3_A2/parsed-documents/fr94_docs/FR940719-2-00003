SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 2119 (7 U.S.C. 6518) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (FACT Act), as amended (7 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.), requires establishment of a NOSB. The purpose of the Board is to assist in the development of standards for substances to be used in organic production and to advise the Secretary on any other aspects of the implementation of Title XXI of the FACT Act. The NOSB met for the first time in Washington, DC, in March 1992 and formed six committees to work on various aspects of the program. The committees are: Crops Standards; Processing, Labelling and Packaging; Livestock Standards; Accreditation; National Materials List; and International Issues. Purpose and Agenda The main focus of this meeting is to approve recommendations from the full Board to the Secretary of Agriculture on major aspects of the organic program. These recommendations represent the results of extensive discussion of issues considered by working committees of the Board. The last meeting of the NOSB in February 1994 provided considerable time for the committees to present their issues and papers for discussion with the full Board. This meeting will have the committees presenting proposed amendments to their draft recommendations to the full Board for discussion, followed by a vote to approve the Board recommendations to the Secretary. Topics to be covered in the full Board meeting include processing and labeling standards; the process for reviewing materials needed for the National List of approved synthetics and prohibited natural substances; accreditation requirements and criteria for a peer review panel for accrediting certifying agents; draft recommendations for organic crop production, developed by the Crops Committee; antibiotics, and parasiticides positions, and draft recommendations prepared by the Livestock Committee; and import requirements for organic products. A final agenda will be available on May 1, 1994. Persons requesting copies should contact Ms. Faith Ashton at the above address or phone number. Type of Meeting All meetings will be open to the public. Individuals and organizations wishing to provide written comments on these issues or to express public comment on any organic issues should forward the request to Harold S. Ricker at the above address or FAXED to 202/690&hyph;0338 by May 27, 1994, in order to be scheduled. The NOSB has scheduled time for public input on Wednesday, June 1, 1994, beginning at 1 p.m. and continuing until 5:30 p.m. While people may sign up to speak at the door, advance scheduling assures an opportunity in the time allowed and helps the NOSB plan its activities. Each individual or organization will be allocated 10 minutes for presenting orally the key issues of concern, and should provide copies of written material elaborating on those issues for the Committees. Dated: May 12, 1994. Lon Hatamiya, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12376 Filed 05&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P
