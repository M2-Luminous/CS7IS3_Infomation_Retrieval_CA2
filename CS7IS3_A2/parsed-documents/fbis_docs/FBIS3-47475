The bank is now looking for appropriate fields to which export credits could be applied for the country, President Mitsuhide Yamaguchi told a press conference. He added quickly, however, that the step is conditional on smooth implementation of economic adjustment policies in the country. Yamaguchi said Russia's economic reforms need to advance to a level where it is entitled to receive stand-by credits under an economic stabilization scheme by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In October 1991, Japan pledged to provide to Russia 200 million dollars in export credits by the Export-Import Bank of Japan as part of a 2 billion dollar program to promote trade and economic activity in the country. Yamaguchi voiced hope that Russia will be fully eligible for the IMF's special facility set up for Russia and other nations struggling to shift to a market economy. Stand-by credits can be extended only under the new facility, called the Systemic Transformation Facility (STF). Russia has already received 1.5 billion dollars in the first portion of the STF that the IMF pledged last June. Talks are now under way over disbursement of the remaining portion of the credit, which does not demand strict criteria as imposed under ordinary loans, such as inflation control and budget deficit cuts.
