He added that "the purpose of the current meetings is to work for the implementation of what the signatories spelled out in their memorandum, particularly exercise of democracy in the management of PLO affairs and the employment of qualified Palestinians, irrespective of political and personal factors." Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, who was speaking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT by telephone from Tunis, described the meetings already held as good, with no fundamental differences and no emotionalism. The purpose of these meetings, he said, was to exchange views. He said that last night's session was devoted to a discussion of the brief memorandum submitted to the Executive Committee during the meeting. It should be noted that, in addition to Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, the reform delegation includes 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab (independent), Taysir 'Aruri (People's Party), Nabil 'Amr (member of Fatah's Revolutionary Council), Ibrahim Abu-'Abbas (former engineers' doyen in Jordan), Tawfiq Abu-Bakr (independent journalist), and Ghazi al-Khalili (Fida Party). Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi refused to say what the memorandum was about but said that it was derived from "the main document." Asked if the brief memorandum included practical steps for the implementation of their demands, Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said: "Let us not anticipate events." Commenting on the statement attributed to him that he would not leave Tunis "empty-handed," Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said: "We did not come to Tunis just to look at one another. Our people are facing major challenges and the necessary measures must be taken to meet these challenges." In reply to the question what do you hope to achieve, he said: "That our viewpoint should be upheld in principle. Before leaving Tunis we would like to feel somewhat reassured that our demands will be met or that they are on the way to being met."
