FR941202-2-00080 FR941202-2-00057 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION Draft NUREG: Issuance Availability On November 4, 1994 (59 FR 55299), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission published for public comment a draft report entitled ``Revised Analyses of Decommissioning for the Reference Boiling Water Reactor Power Station'' (NUREG/CR&hyph;6174). The draft report, prepared for the NRC by Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories (PNL), presented the results of a review and reevaluation of the 1980 boiling water reactor (BWR) decommissioning study which addressed technology, safety and cost issues associated with decommissioning a large nuclear power plant. A request has been made by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), which is an organization responsible for establishing unified nuclear industry policy on matters affecting the nuclear energy industry, to extend the comment period because of the importance of the decommissioning funding criteria. The NRC has no objections to this request and has agreed to extend the comment period from December 23, 1994 to January 20, 1995. As noted in the initial Federal Register notice (59 FR 55299), draft NUREG/CR&hyph;6174 should be viewed as a first step in developing a more parametric approach to estimating decommissioning costs and comments on the usefulness of such an approach are requested. Comments and suggestions on the draft NUREG/CR&hyph;6174 should be sent to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Copies of the comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., (Lower Level), Washington, DC.
