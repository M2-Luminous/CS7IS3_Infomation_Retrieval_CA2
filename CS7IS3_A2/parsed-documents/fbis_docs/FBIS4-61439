As Ukraine's Economics Minister, Roman Shpek, said during the talks, Kiev is not prepared to "use $350 million in the near future." The leadership of Ukraine's Cabinet criticized Washington for having advanced too many conditions for granting concrete economic aid. According to Deputy Premier Valentin Landik, under American proposals the granting of $95 million to support private enterprise will become possible only if leasing as a means of privatizing property is given up. According to American experts, leasing may hinder the "voucher privatization," which they view as the most progressive method of reforming property. Landik urged members of the U.S. delegation to refrain from advancing conditions for the granting of aid, and to stop their calls for "starting reforms." As he said, the lowering of inflation to 5.7 pct and the start of privatization indicate that reforms in Ukraine have already begun, and that concrete support for them is necessary. During the talks American negotiators also insisted that Ukraine should introduce a market rate for its karbovanets in relation to hard currencies. Landik for his part declared that the state will continue to regulate the karbovanets rate till the crisis is overcome. The two delegations are led by the Ukrainian Deputy Premier, Valentin Landik, and by Nicholas Burns, a senior official from the U.S. National Security Council.
