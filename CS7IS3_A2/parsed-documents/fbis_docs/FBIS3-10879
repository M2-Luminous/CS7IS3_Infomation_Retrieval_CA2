We were discussing the underground economy, or the submerged economy, as it is also called. I think there are many people with doubts, and surely this program seeks to clear up some of those doubts and explain some of these trends. I was talking with an economics student about this program. She did have the opportunity to listen. She said she was rather surprised over your definition of this matter as an underground economy, or black market, which are not the same. One is implicit in the other, but they are not the same. I also think this was the reason for an analysis of other subjects related to this issue. [Rodriguez] I can give you an additional definition: It is also called an informal economy in other countries, namely in Latin America. This submerged economy can be defined as an aspect of the economics that are affecting Cuba at this moment. [Roque] Yes, and in the previous program we said that this is not a problem in Cuba alone, but is a problem affecting all societies. Also that it comes from a capitalist society. [Rodriguez] Of course. [Roque] This problem is a derivative of capitalist society, and today this activity is at its peak in Latin American economies. To define it, I was saying that transactions of goods and services that are not officially authorized can be either legal or illegal. Here is where some confusion can emerge concerning the black market versus the underground economy. The black market can be part of the underground economy, but it is not the only thing within the underground economy. Recently, in a program when my friend Renato Recio was present, we were discussing the cigarette issue. We were saying that a large number of people are assigned certain allocations of cigarettes. One of the proposals submitted today in the parliament is that in work places we should to try eliminate these allocations. Well, according to a recent study conducted by a group of friends from the Research Institute to which I had access, they reached the conclusion that only 40 percent of the people who receive normal and controlled allocations of cigarettes are in fact smokers. The rest -- well, some of these allocations go to the family, but others use them to sell in the underground economy. This is the example I was giving the other day, because if I, a nonsmoker, receive cigarettes that are assigned to my house and I submit them to the informal economy, either by selling or bartering them, it is neither an illegal, nor a black-market activity. It is informal economics, nonofficial economics. Of course, this situation does not affect the economy as much as the black market because the black market is within the underground economy. Well, to make it clearer, let me tell you this: If I exchange one of my cigarette packs for a bag of rice, it is not black market. [Rodriguez] No, it is not black market, it is underground economy; and if you sell that box of cigarettes, as usually happens, at black-market price, it is not black market. It is underground economy, but it does have an effect. The same thing happens with those people who do not drink, but who sell their rum at black-market prices. [Roque] We are talking about the underground economy. Osvaldo, why has this term emerged, and why has this phenomenon occurred in the world economy? [Rodriguez] First, let us begin with why it emerged in Cuba. It was the shortage in state supplies to the population that enlarged and consolidated this type of economy, which we can call underground or informal economy. Undoubtedly, it is nourished by excess currency that is not backed by goods. That is its origin. I wish to point out that this existed or coexisted before, with financial stability, when there were undoubtedly deficiencies in the official market of products that were in great demand. We could talk about shoes, for example. [Roque] Yes, I believe that having discussed here the concepts of black-market and underground economies, we can see that it is not a phenomenon that has only now emerged, but as you said, it existed in parallel with the stability of certain years. I can remember that in the eighties -- I call this period the golden decade because we were very stable, especially with food products -- there were some products that were also sold on the street in that way. It was not a black market, but you needed to go to this underground economy to satisfy the need for products that you could not find on the official market. [Rodriguez] Yes, this study I was talking about makes an interesting point: During the period of financial stability, the population's expenses in the underground economy did not exceed 20 percent. I would also like to answer the other part of your question on how it emerged. I am sure that in your trips to Mexico you have seen the illicit street vendors. This underground economy is more prominent in Latin America and underdeveloped countries. It is the economy of immigrants in developed countries. [Roque] These people do not pay taxes. That is probably one of the main things that make it an underground economy: It is not controlled by the state. [Rodriguez] Right, they are not officially authorized. [Roque] There it has its beginnings. Here in Cuba it has a different beginning. [Rodriguez] Here it has other causes. Necessity is what drives this economy. The main difference between the presence of an underground economy in that market economy and in our economy is that over there they compete below official prices. [Roque] And the necessities are different. [Rodriguez] Yes, of course. Here it is the speculators who use the black market to try to get rich or to try to live better than the average citizen. [Roque] Something that stands out is that over there, it is the complete opposite. There they lower the prices. In other words, their prices are lower than those of the state. [Rodriguez] Inside that economy, there is also a black market because many of the products that are sold at lower prices are stolen, or are products that are smuggled into the country. They therefore are not charged customs or taxes, and have a shady origin. [Roque] Let us talk about our problem. How can we resolve this situation -- do away with the underground economy? We know that the main factor is production. We must stabilize production levels in general. Without goods to back the excess currency circulating on the streets... [pauses] everything is connected here. Everything is related to the other. People must accept this information and these explanations in order to understand the concepts of the economy. [Rodriguez] I think you are right. We must first increase our production, as you said before, but we must also remember that the official market will take some time to change. There is a group of needs, especially services. The underground economy involves not only the sale of goods, it also includes the sale of services. That too forms part of the underground economy. It is going to take some time to be able to solve that. [Roque] And in this case of services, can the tax system help, or contribute toward putting an end to this phenomenon? [Rodriguez] Well, if it is organized, it can. We cannot say that self-employed workers are part of the underground economy because they are authorized and licensed by the state. They pay taxes to the state and are authorized to produce and market their product in determined places. They are not the problem. The problem is those who do this illegally. It is those persons who provide services or who sell their products illegally. We cannot always call things illegal, because there are times when there is no law, as in the example we mentioned of selling something from our house. There is no law that prohibits me from selling something from my house and there is no law that imposes a tax on that sale. There are countries where that does exist. Any transaction between two people requires a tax to the state because it is a business transaction. [Roque] We are talking about the underground economy. I must admit that this is a topic I do not know much about since I am not an economist; but at the same time, I am very interested, as are many of the listeners. [Rodriguez] I am not an economist either, but I have read some material that I have received and I believe it is an interesting subject because it is a passionate subject. It is something we are currently living. [Roque] Let us look at this study that was conducted. I can see that we are concerned about this problem. We are at least studying the phenomenon and looking for ways or alternatives for its solution. [Rodriguez] Yes, this study has a series of proposals that we could leave for another program, because they are interesting proposals. [Roque] We are going to have to call them Underground Economy One, Underground Economy Two, and present a series of programs.... [Rodriguez, interrupting] ... and proposals for solutions to the underground economy. These researchers point out something very interesting: They say that everytime there is a structural imbalance between supply and demand, there will be economic space for the underground economy, which is created through the redistribution of income. Of course, we are talking about the Cuban phenomenon. We are not talking about the underground economy of other places where the prices are below those of the official market. We are talking about our situation. We must remember that people go to the underground economy to improve the structure of consumption, due to deficiencies in the assortment and existence of products from the state supply. People also go to the underground economy in cases when they have excess income, to try to increase satisfaction of their needs. These are the reasons why people go to this underground economy. Just recently, this was discussed on a Straight Talk program. For the most objective analysis of our current situation, the financial imbalance, we must look at the merchandise, not the money. Money keeps accruing because there is a lack of goods. As soon as these goods begin to appear, and these measures that we are all waiting for are applied to balance our domestic economy, the problems of this underground economy will also be solved. As these products we are all hoping to produce begin appearing, we start to hope that one day we will have the money to buy them. As the excess currency begins disappearing, the black-market prices will not be as high as those that the worker must pay with their salaries. [Roque] At least there can be an end to this black market. Is it the same for the underground economy, or is it a phenomenon that will be with us for many years to come? [Rodriguez] I believe that when the economy is stabilized and there is a balance between supply and demand, or when supply is slightly higher than demand -- when that happens, and it happens in any economy because there is always a supply facing the flow of currency -- I believe, because I am realistic, that what is happening in other countries will happen -- an underground economy will exist and will be below the official market. I do not think it will disappear. [Roque] The most important thing now is to keep producing, to gradually restore the value of our money, and to achieve market stability, as you said, so that people will feel relieved. [Rodriguez] Yes. I believe this relief will be experienced after a given period -- following the implementation of measures -- not immediately. We have said several times on this program that measures cannot be considered a magic wand to yield immediate results in the economy. All economies have a delayed, not an immediate effect, unless drastic shock measures are adopted such as changing the monetary system. [Roque] Yes. Well, I thank you for your participation in this program. Of course, I invite you to comment again on part three of The Underground Economy.
