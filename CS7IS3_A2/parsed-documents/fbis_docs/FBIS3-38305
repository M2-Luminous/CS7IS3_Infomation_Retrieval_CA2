The factory is to be assembled in Kirikkale by German and Turkish specialists and is to be used for the production of large caliber artillery shells that have a splinter effect. The Economics Ministry, which is responsible for authorizing such exports, only approved the export of the factory to the Netherlands. As recently as 1992, the Bonn-based Federal Security Council rejected an application from the Eurometaal subsidiary in Liebenau to export 18,000 special shells to Turkey. The main reason was that it could not be ruled out that the ammunition would be used against Kurdish rebels.
