It is considered that regarding the macroeconomic policy as well as individual priority sectors, "a well-balanced accord will be indispensable" at the summit talks (as stated by a senior MITI official). Hosokawa and Kumagai seem to have confirmed the plan of working out a macroeconomic policy, about which the United States has expressed strong concern, which in turn may lead to overall success at the framework talks. On the other hand, concerning individual sectors, Prime Minister Hosokawa and MITI Minister Kumagai have once again confirmed the stance of rejecting the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets.
