After eight years of enforcing the Frontier Health Quarantine Law, China's health quarantine has gradually moved closer to converging with international practice. As health quarantine is an important element of our preventive medical science, China has all along attached importance to strengthening legal provisions for health quarantine undertakings. The "Provisional Procedures for Transportation Quarantine" and the "Provisional Procedures for Civil Aviation Quarantine" were promulgated during the early days of our People's Republic; the "PRC Frontier Health Quarantine Regulations" were promulgated in 1957; China recognized the "International Health Regulations" in 1979; the "Health Supervision Procedures for Frontier Ports" were promulgated in 1981; the "PRC Frontier Health Quarantine Law" was promulgated in 1986; and the State Council approved the rules for implementation of the Frontier Health Quarantine Law in 1989. All these have made our health quarantine laws and regulations system increasingly complete. The quarantine law's implementation has played an important role in safeguarding the people's health and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. As the country is now in a period of transition from the old to the new system, our health quarantine work also extends from quarantine examination to international travel medicine, disease and health control at ports, and hygienic supervision of imported foodstuffs. As the task of health quarantine becomes increasingly demanding, there are many new problems in both legislation and law enforcement that need to be studied and inquired into. A Frontier Health Quarantine Law Society was set up recently to enable our health quarantine law enforcement personnel to carry out theoretical study and inquiry into the Frontier Health Quarantine Law aside from fully enforcing it in practice, thus upgrading the law enforcement standard. The society will actively carry out theoretical studies and academic exchanges on health quarantine laws and regulations of different countries and analyze typical cases to provide a basis of reference for problems encountered by health quarantine personnel in law enforcement practice and to promote legal studies on health quarantine. It has been learned that this year the State Health Quarantine Agency is also sponsoring, with Jilin University, a Master of Law course, which won the praise of Wu Jieping, vice chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee. He believes it is really meaningful for health quarantine organs, being law enforcement departments, to train transcentenary qualified personnel for health quarantine law enforcement to upgrade health quarantine law enforcement and promote legal construction in our health quarantine. He said it will leave a glorious page in our health quarantine history.
