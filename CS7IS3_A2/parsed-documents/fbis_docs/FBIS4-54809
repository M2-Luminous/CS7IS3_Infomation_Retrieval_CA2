The invitation was based on the fact that King Mihai is the founder of the Timisoara metropolitan cathedral. For the third time, the Romanian Government denied King Mihai the right to visit Timisoara, this time invoking false security problems. We wish to notify international public opinion that: 1. Mihai of Romania is a Romanian citizen who was born in Romania, his parents being Romanian citizens. According to Romania's current Constitution and the stipulations of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, that gesture of the government is an abuse. 2. Considering that not a single foreign citizen has been subject to circulation restrictions on the territory of Romania, the imposing of such restrictions upon a Romanian citizen is an arbitrary and discriminatory act. 3. The stance adopted by the Romanian Government offends our dignity as citizens of the city of Timisoara, by the sacrifice of which in Romania, in December 1989, the way was opened for liberty and democracy. At the same time, such practice maintains a state of tension in the country and creates suspicion that may divide Romanian society and prevent national reconciliation. We request that the Council of Europe should discuss in its special commissions, as well as in its plenary session, the abuse signaled by us. The attention granted by the Council of Europe to the present memorandum would represent moral reparation for us.
