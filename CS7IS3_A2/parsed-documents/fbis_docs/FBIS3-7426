These issues should be left to the international organisations that are already dealing with them, Mr Suphachai said. Dr Suphachai was speaking at the 21st meeting of the US Information Service's annual economic seminar entitled "Regionalisation of Thai-US Economic Relations". He told BUSINESS POST that it is possible to look at trade issues on their own merits by decoupling them from side issues. "Trade should be treated on its own merits, linked with real macroeconomic issues, and side issues that are now coupled with trade such as human rights, workers' rights and the environment should be left to international organisations that are already dealing with them," he said. He said a country that is trying to achieve greater economic development will try its best to improve standards of human rights and labour relations. "Through trade development expansion we can facilitate the process of paying adequate attention to human rights development," he said. If some of the major side issues are put in the forefront, such as the US linking of the Generalized System of Preferences with labour rights, it may not bring results in the end, he said. The GSP was conceived to help developing countries' exports by granting concession terms, and is not supposed to be linked with anything, he said. He said he understood the good intentions of the US administration which has a sense of humanity and is justifiably concerned with rights. But he questioned whether its policy is the most effective way of conditioning the whole world to move in that direction. Dr Suphachai said the more we want to promote trade and economic relations throughout the world the more we must work toward depoliticising trade issues. This will benefit not only the private sector but also the newly emerging countries, as at least world economic growth will be more predictable than in the past, he said. [passage omitted]
