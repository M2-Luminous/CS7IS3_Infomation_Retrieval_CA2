Muhammad Subayh, secretary of the Palestine National Council, told MENA that the misunderstanding resulted from the fact that the contents of several documents that had been submitted were inaccurately conveyed to the leaders. Subayh explained that the points raised by President Yasir 'Arafat in connection with the Gaza-Jericho agreement are part and parcel of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles signed in Washington 13 September. Subayh stressed that the Palestinians have a definite wish to implement the Gaza-Jericho agreement and they believe that the Israelis have the same wish.
