FR941206-0-00026 FR941206-0-00003 OPTION 2 The following takeoff procedure is used: WARNING: The following technique cannot be used unless the pilot-in-command has ensured that the aircraft surfaces are free of ice, frost, and snow, as required by sections 91.527 and 121.629 of the FAR. •(All Marks, except Mark 0100 and Mark 0070) When using flight director for takeoff, select HDG mode and 10 degrees pitch attitude. •Select the largest flap setting that is permissible for the takeoff weight/altitude/temperature conditions. •(All Marks, except Mark 0100 and Mark 0070) Use rated takeoff thrust. •(Mark 0100 and Mark 0070) Use takeoff/go-around (TOGA) thrust. •Do not use FLEXIBLE thrust. •At V R rotate slowly (less than 3 degrees per second) to 10 degrees pitch attitude. •When positively climbing, select gear UP. •DO NOT EXCEED 10 DEGREES PITCH UNTIL AIRSPEED IS ABOVE V 2 +20 KTS. •When above V 2 +20 KTS, slowly increase the pitch attitude, keeping the speed above V 2 +20 KTS. •Retract the flaps at or above V FR + 20 KTS. Notes to Option 2 1. The available field length must be greater than or equal to 120 percent of the takeoff distance required by regulation for the actual gross weight. Also, the 20 percent increase in takeoff distance must be accounted for in the obstacle clearance analysis. WEIGHT MUST BE OFF-LOADED, IF NECESSARY, TO MEET THESE CONDITIONS. 2. (Mark 0100 and Mark 0070) Do not follow the Flight Director pitch command during rotation for takeoff and initial climb, as this will result in exceeding the recommended maximum pitch angle of 10 degrees before reaching the speed of V 2 +20 KTS. 3. (Mark 0100 and Mark 0070) Do not engage the auto-pilot until leaving the Automated Flight Control and Augmentation System (AFCAS) takeoff (TO) mode. 4. For the case of an engine failure, refer to the applicable procedure in Section 4.17.01 SINGLE ENGINE OPERATION of the F28 Mark 0100 (Fokker 100) and F28 Mark 0070 (Fokker 70) AFM, or Section 1.7.4 OPERATION UNDER ABNORMAL CONDITIONS of the F28 FHB, as applicable. 5. During takeoff, the first indication of wing contamination will probably be airframe buffet when the pitch angle is increased above 10 degrees, followed by wing drop and insufficient climb rate. DO NOT EXCEED 10 DEGREES PITCH UNTIL AIRSPEED IS ABOVE V 2 +20 KTS.'' Note 1: If an operator elects to implement in its fleet only one of the two OPTIONS specified in this paragraph, the other OPTION does not have to be included in the Limitations Section of the AFM. However, the OPTION that is implemented must be incorporated in the AFM verbatim as it appears in this paragraph. (b) Modification of the thermal anti-ice system so that it can be operated on the ground, in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD. Note 2: Incorporation of the leading edge thermal anti-ice modification and associated operating instructions does not relieve the requirement that aircraft surfaces are free of ice, frost, and snow accumulation as required by sections 91.527 and 121.629 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 91.527 and 121.629). (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Operations Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note 3: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (e) This amendment becomes effective on December 21, 1994. Issued in Renton, Washington, on November 30, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29921 Filed 12&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;P
