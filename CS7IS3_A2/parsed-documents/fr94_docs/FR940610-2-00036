SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set out below. The Proposed Decision sets forth the procedures that DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute the total amount of $2,226,782.70 obtained under the terms of a Consent Order that DOE entered into with Mt. Airy Refining Company and its former shareholders on November 14, 1990. The Consent Order settles claims by DOE that Mt. Airy had violated reporting provisions of the Mandatory Petroleum Allocation Regulations and the Administrative Procedures and Sanctions Regulations with regard to its sale of crude oil. OHA proposes to distribute the Mt. Airy Consent Order funds in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases (the MSRP). 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are divided between the Federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the states are distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers are based on the total volume of petroleum products purchased and the degree to which they can demonstrate injury. Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting parties are requested to forward two copies of their submissions, within 30 days of publication of this notice in the Federal Register , to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. Comments so received, will be made available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room 1E&hyph;234, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. Dated: June 3, 1994. George B. Breznay, Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals.
