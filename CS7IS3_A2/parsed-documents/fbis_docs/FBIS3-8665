During the course of their meeting, which passed in an atmosphere of mutual openness and understanding, they spoke about the current EU policy toward the peace process and the resolution of the crisis on the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also about Serbia-Greece bilateral relations and cooperation, the Serbian president's office has announced. It was concluded that a fair and permanent solution to the situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina could be reached only if the peace option prevailed over the war option and if the international community displayed an unbiased attitude and readiness to treat equally the rights and interests of all the three warring sides in this area. President Milosevic stressed that the European Union had a huge political obligation with regard to lifting the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in light of the fact that the Serb side has accepted its peace plan, the integral part of which is the lifting of the embargo. The European Union ought to fulfill its part of the obligations from that plan, particularly because it is impossible to resolve the crisis in this area without equal treatment of all the sides by the international community. It was also stressed that maintaining sanctions against our country encourages those forces that are trying to realize their goals by force. It is of vital interest for all the countries suffering damage caused by the application of the economic blockade against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to launch an initiative as soon as possible for the lifting of the embargo. This is in the interest of the normalization of economic trends and the overall stabilization of the political situation in the region, in which the European Union should play an active role. It was stressed that bilateral relations between Serbia and Greece were developing well despite the imposed limitations, which confirms the firm friendship and shared interests of the Serbian and the Greek nations. The talks were also attended by Federal Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic.
