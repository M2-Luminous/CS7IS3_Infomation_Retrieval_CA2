The savage crime did not take place for political motives to have it be said that the occupied territory is witnessing political violence and that violence by its nature hits in all directions. The attack on the worshipers in Hebron clearly shows the religious dimension of the crime. The Jewish settlers think that the Muslims must leave their areas, that these territories belong to Israel, and that whoever refuses to leave will have to be liquidated in an ugly way. It is clear that the attack on the Muslim worshipers in a sacred place reflects the depth of the Jewish hatred, which has been manifested in more than one way. The Talmudic mentality agrees with the logic of force used by the Jews against the Palestinian people and the other Muslim peoples. The Zionist aim is to uproot the Palestinian people and force them to surrender so that the settlements can stay in the occupied territories and the Jews can have the upper hand politically, militarily, and economically. In light of the clear Zionist aims, the practical response to this crime is not to absorb the emotional reaction of the Muslim masses and regard the incident as a transient moment of madness. The Muslims are called upon to seriously and genuinely support the Palestinian people by supporting the intifadah and enabling the Palestinians to exercise the right of legitimate defense. It is unreasonable for the Palestinian people to remain the victims of Zionist terrorism and the continuing madness while the governments and regimes call on the Palestinian people to refrain from exercising their right of self-defense on the pretext of facilitating the peace process. The natural response to the Zionist crime is to make the Israelis understand that Palestinian blood is no less precious than Jewish blood, and that for every Palestinian that is killed an Israeli attacker must be killed. The battle in essence is one of existence between the Palestinian people and the new immigrant Jewish settlers. When the Jews seek to implement their designs through a Talmudic ideology, which they believe is sacred and regard as their strategic program, the resistance idea must rely on a solid basis, especially when the other ideas have been frustrated as a result of the miserable illusion of peace. The series of unending violence, blood, and terrorism that is affecting the Palestinian people confirms that the talk about peace is only designed to dope the Muslim masses and make them believe that the area is moving toward peaceful coexistence. This is at a time when the correct reaction is to give the masses freedom of action to prove their ability to defend the Muslim nation's sanctities and dignity. Restricting popular reaction will be the biggest service rendered to the Zionist-Western scheme in the area. Official, rhetorical reactions will not dress the wounds of the Palestinian people and will not make the Jews understand that their crimes will not remain unpunished. Israel is used to rhetorical statements and long communiques. But a single jihad operation in southern Lebanon or in the occupied territory is sufficient to teach the Jews many lessons. It will teach them that their security will always be threatened because security cannot be based on usurpation, terrorism, and the logic of force.
