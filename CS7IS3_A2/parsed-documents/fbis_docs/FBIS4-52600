The boom in timber smuggling has also financially benefited several police, soldiers, customs and forestry officials who man roadblocks from the Cambodian border to Bangkok. Chat Phatthana Party MP Thanit Traiwut of Trat, in an interview with the BANGKOK POST at the border here yesterday, said Thai timber traders had invested heavily in the logging business in Cambodia and they had managed to bring only a small fraction of their timber out of Cambodia before the March 31 deadline expired. "A large quantity of logs remain in Cambodia. So local businessmen have to resort to smuggling to recoup their investment otherwise the logs will be left to rot," said the MP, who said he quit the timber business only three months ago. Tens of thousands of felled logs have been left in Khmer Rouge- controlled territory in the Samraong area in Battambang alone, according to Lok Nong, a Khmer Rouge cadre in Samrod. One of the main problems discouraging Thai timber merchants from engaging in straight and legal dealings with Phnom Penh is the issuance of a new regulation requiring a Certificate of Origin to export Cambodian timber. Mr Thanit explained that to obtain the CO is a complicated process and also involves under-the-table money payments. A normal fee of US$35 is charged for a cubic metre of timber to be exported, but merchants sometimes have to pay up to US$60 if all the expenses to obtain a CO are added up. "With the CO, the Thai merchant must notify the Thai customs which will then pass on the document to the Finance Ministry, the Foreign Ministry the Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian Foreign Ministry and finally to the Forestry Department of Cambodia which has to verify the CO," said Mr Thanit. "The whole process may take up to three months and, by that time, the CO's term has almost expired and a new CO would have to be obtained." But even with the CO being verified the merchants will still have to pay taxes to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas because the logs are in guerrilla-controlled territories, said another timber merchant. "That means merchants will pay twice for each lot of timber to the Phnom Penh government and to the Khmer Rouge," he said. But the money and trouble saved by not obtaining the CO from Phnom Penh the merchants have to hand out in bribes to a host of Thai officials, namely the police, troops, customs and forestry officials, who man the various roadblocks along the roads leading from the Cambodian border to the sawmills in Thailand. The longer the trip for each truckload of timber, the higher the payment in bribes. "Sometimes, a temporary roadblock just pops up with the officials demanding money for convenient passage in addition to the permanent checkpoints," said the merchant who declined to be named. The timber merchant claimed he had to pay at least 50,000 baht to all the checkpoints for each truckload of processed wood. "We have to make arrangements with all the officials involved otherwise there will be problems," he said, adding that if this is not done in advance, the timber will run the risk of being impounded as contraband. And in that case, he said, some merchants had to pay as much as 300,000 baht "ransom" under the table to get back the truck as well as the cargo. Despite the small amount of royalties levied by Phnom Penh for the timber export, most timber merchants said they still prefer smuggling because they have to move the logs across the border as fast as possible otherwise they will rot. According to Mr Thanit, no less than 100 timber-laden trucks have been seized by officials for overloading and smuggling. The Chat Phatthana MP said he had received complaints from many merchants about the alleged extortion. But despite the "extortion" from the authorities, several merchants have sought -- and made--deals with the Khmer Rouge. "We care very much about the honesty and safety of the Thai merchants who invested their money in our territories,' Lok Nong told the Bangkok Post. He said he felt more comfortable dealing with Thai merchants than with European, Singaporean or Japanese traders. Lok Nong claimed that only 20 per cent of forests in Cambodia were cut. He said the committee had set some rules about logging and only mature trees are to be felled. He admitted that logging and gem mining were still the two major sources of income for the Khmer Rouge. He complained that after the UN-monitored general elections in Cambodia supplies to the guerrillas had been cut off. He gave his personal assurance to Thai loggers that felled trees in guerrilla-controlled territory would not be lost.
