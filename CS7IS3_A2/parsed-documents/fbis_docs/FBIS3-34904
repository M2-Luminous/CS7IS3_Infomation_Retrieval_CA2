FBIS3-34904 "drnes032_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-032 Document Type:Daily Report 16 Feb 1994 SYRIA Rabin Statements on Peace, Withdrawal Criticized JN1602091694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 16 Feb 94 JN1602091694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Press review] [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN addresses the resumption of the bilateral talks in Washington yesterday amidst unencouraging Israeli developments. This shows, the paper says, that Israel wants these talks to continue to revolve in a vicious circle and to remain monotonous and futile. TISHRIN also notes the encouraging U.S. position. It says the United States has renewed its full commitment to just and comprehensive peace, and underscored Syria's leading role in the peace process. TISHRIN adds: It is interesting that U.S. news reports have spoken of a new tour of the region in early March by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. This means that the United States will be awaiting the outcome of the second round of talks held at the chief delegates' level in Washington. Once this round is concluded, Secretary of State Christopher will make moves within the context of a regional tour. TISHRIN goes on to say: Israel has not thus far shown any concern over possible regional developments if the second round of the Washington chief delegates' talks fail and the peace process reaches a dead end. Israel alone has continued to oppose compliance with international legitimacy resolutions. That is why it is making strenuous attempts to render the U.S. role void of any meaningful content. As a matter of fact, Israel is casting doubts on the usefulness of this role. TISHRIN says: Israeli skepticism over the possible achievement of progress in the Washington bilateral talks is part of the Israeli procrastination and prevarication policy. It aims to frustrate all peace efforts. This has been corroborated by Israel's decision to ignore the outcome of the Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton, and its disregard for all peace efforts. TISHRIN concludes by saying: The peace process could be redeemed if the United States plays a constructive and positive role as a full partner and an honest broker. This is necessary to make Israel meet the requirements of just and comprehensive peace. The newspaper AL-BA'TH comments on the impossible conditions Rabin has raised anew, saying: The articulation of these conditions coincides with the resumption of the Washington bilateral talks. These conditions are designed to circumvent the true requirements of peace. Rabin resorts to these tunes whenever he experiences an increasing isolation with regard to peace efforts. AL-BA'TH adds: Since the convocation of the Madrid conference, Israel has continued to speak about the kind of peace we are offering, not because it is unaware of that, but because it deliberately seeks to circumvent the peace process unleashed by the Madrid conference, and promoted by the Geneva summit, which produced remarkable results. Israel alone does not want to acknowledge many facts pertaining to peace efforts, primarily those related to the need to achieve just and comprehensive peace. One of these facts concerns the need for the Zionist occupation troops to withdraw from all occupied Arab territories, as provided for in the U.S. peace initiative and the relevant international resolutions. AL-BA'TH goes on to say: Rabin's renewed refusal to address the question of withdrawal from the Golan or southern Lebanon before he knows the kind of peace advocated by Syria is a flagrant attempt at circumvention. There is no alternative to rehabilitating the Madrid conference formula and the Geneva summit outcome, which provided a definition of peace that is acceptable not only to Syria, but also to the entire world community, which is supposed to accord due respect to international legitimacy resolutions. AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Rabin, who must have been familiar with the U.S. peace initiative and the outcome of the Geneva summit, is well aware that the achievement of just and comprehensive peace in the region is contingent upon compliance with the provisions enshrined in this initiative, and also with the consensus of the entire world community. Consequently, attempts to evade the requirements of peace will not last long. In a commentary today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The statements made by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on the eve of the resumption of the Washington bilateral talks on the chief delegates' level, in which he reiterated Israel's refusal to withdraw to the pre-1967 borders, are not designed for domestic consumption. As a matter of fact, these statements enjoy the support of Zionist parties of all colors and hues. They reflect a desire to consecrate occupation and promote the Israeli scheme and strategy, which are grounded in aggression and expansion. AL-THAWRAH adds: Rabin's statements do not only reflect political oneupmanship. These statements, coupled with the Israeli conduct in the ongoing peace talks, show that Israel only seeks to consecrate the occupation, build biblical Israel, and subjugate the Arab region. Since the convocation of the Madrid conference, Israeli politicians and generals have been lending half-hearted support for the peace process. They are not sincere in their handling of the international and U.S. efforts to achieve peace. AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: The world has continued to feel a deliberate Israeli determination to scuttle the peace process and overlook the relevant international legitimacy resolutions. Israel is making feverish attempts to circumvent these resolutions, undermine them, and give them interpretations that would enable the aggressors to retain the gains of aggression and occupation. Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH wonders: Given all these international resolutions, which are the terms of reference of the peace process, this Israeli determination to defy the international community's wishes, and these constant Israeli human rights abuses, should the international community not act to render Israel accountable to the this community, particularly since less dangerous situations have resulted in the punishment of entire peoples and nations?
