Today is January 8 in the Tibetan Lunar Calendar. Hundreds of thousands of people from the urban Lhasa and its outskirts came by foot, taxi or tractors to monasteries such as Zhebung, Gandain, Sera and Johkang to give alms and pray. At the Zhebung Monastery, over 500 monks sat in the hall of the temple to recite the Buddhist sutra. There were huge crowds of Buddhists, many of whom went among the monks to give them money as alms. A worker from the Tibetan autonomous regional oil company gave the monks a huge sum of money and told XINHUA that he came with two wishes: namely a wish for good luck for all the members of his family and a wish for God's protection of the soul of his late father. Leading members of various departments of the Tibetan autonomous regional government also went to the temples to prepare food for the lama monks and the Buddhists. The regional government allocated a total of 150,000 yuan for the event, according to a government official. Moinlam Qenmo, meaning summons ceremony, dates back to 1409, the year Tsong Kapa, founder of the Yellow Sect of Tibetan Lamaism, sponsored the first such event. The Buddhist service will reach its peak in a week's time, on January 15 of the Tibetan calendar.
