Kist; UDC 541.15, 546.06.02, 621.039.86] [Abstract] The radiocarbon method for dating archeological specimens of biological origin is based on measurement of the carbon-14 activity under the assumption that this nuclide stopped entering the organism during the time of its demise. Many other assumptions are also made. In the present work the possibility of a change in isotope composition in cotton and flax fabrics as a result of heterogeneous isotope exchange between the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere and that in the fabric. Labeled carbon dioxide is shown to be fixated strongly in the fabrics. It was concluded that changes in carbon isotope composition in archeological specimens are possible and that this factor must not be overlooked. References 2: 1 Russian, 1 Western.
