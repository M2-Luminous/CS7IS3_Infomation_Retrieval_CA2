Television moderators, even those who were reminded of "an internal enemy" by the sound of church bells in earlier times, competed in who would speak with more inspiration and piety about his highness. The arrival of the patriarch of Moscow and Russia was interpreted in "all Serbian countries" as a diplomatic substitute for what the Serbian politicians with a strong affinity to Russia expected from President Yeltsin, who -- allegedly out of fear of the West -- does not want to support his Serbian brothers openly. Numerous representatives of the "Russian people" -- political vagabonds and senile officers of the former Red Army who toured Serbia, Montenegro and the self-proclaimed republic of Srpska during the last war years, inciting the Serbs to rebel and make terror by promising them senseless things and raising false hopes of the almighty Russian protection -- could not fulfill the requirements set by their host. The Difference Now everyone is raising hopes in the head of the Russian Church, which is still a mighty institution with a good political rating -- although democracy separates the church from the state -- because of the repression it was exposed to during the long period of the Soviet leadership. Patriarch Aleksiy II is an outstanding church dignitary who uses well-measured words and gestures, as is appropriate for a man of his rank. This is what constitutes the difference between him and his hosts, the Serbian rulers, whose prayers and public announcements are full of a certain hatred and false generosity and whose peace messages sound as if they were uttered under pressure, which has in no case come from God. The shepherds of the people of Saint Sava [Serbs] are probably not very happy to express their humble respect for their brother who is partially of German origin. Immediately after his arrival in Belgrade, the Russian patriarch said that the task he would like to accomplish within his mission was to end the bloodshed and solve all problems at the negotiating table. Variations of the same sentence were also included in other official statements issued in connection with the conversation between the two patriarchs. It was noticed that both dignitaries wanted to include all parties to the conflict in their peace message, that they did not want to blame only one party to the conflict, or to differentiate in any way between God's unrighteous children. This is the point that will make many people mistrust the sincerity of Aleksiy's mission. In the spirit of "gospel etiquette," [Serbian] Patriarch Pavle advised his nation: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you!" There is the danger, however, that many Serbs who can read and write will find a typing mistake in this Bible message. It will probably never become known what the dignitaries of the two Orthodox churches, in the present situation of huge national frustrations in their countries, discussed in private and with their closest assistants. Both churches have very delicate relations with their respective state leaderships. The Saint Sava believers from Pale are closer to the Serbian church than "the freshly refurbished" communists in Belgrade, regardless of the privileges they returned to the church. Its leadership fears that any concession to the West that would leave some of the Serbs in the domain of a mighty Catholic or Muslim influence would be a danger to the Serbian national entity that is derived from the Orthodox religion. Keeping Up With the West Through many schisms since the 17th century, through Peter's reforms and the Catholic influence under Polish rule, as well as through the contact with Scandinavian Protestantism in its neighborhood, the Russian church has actually kept up with the West. The appearance of the "Asiatic" orthodoxy after the collapse of communism is not a logical spiritual continuation of the Russian state religion. It is rather an anarchist protest of "the crazy with Christ," which is used as an explanation for unbelievable moves the red and the black are making in the present Russia. As far as help for the Serbs is concerned, the restrained behavior of the Russian patriarch is not caused by his neutral attitude toward the warring factions in the Balkans; it arises from his consultation with the Russian state leadership. It is not difficult to notice that the patriarch's messages for peace and his insistence on negotiations correspond to what has been concluded in ministerial meetings in Geneva. It was obviously made clear to the Moscow patriarch what the limits of help for the Serbs are. After the meeting with Milosevic, the patriarch did not spend many compliments on his conversation partner. This points to the possibility that the conversation was predominantly informative and strictly official, accompanied by conventional phrases about the traditional friendship between the two countries. When travelling to Pale, the Russian patriarch was accompanied by persons who were, with good reason, heavily accused by Russian diplomats, which has to be interpreted as a part of the inevitable protocol. It is not probable that the Pale leadership will hear from the head of the Russian Church something different from what his hosts in Belgrade heard. What they heard can be guessed at, based on the speech delivered by Serbian Patriarch Pavle in which he reminded his listeners of the time of Arsenije Carnojevic and his petition for mediation at the Austrian Court when Russia "was not able to do anything in order to help the Serbs." "The Serbs understood" and kept on loving Russia. They will probably understand this time also.
