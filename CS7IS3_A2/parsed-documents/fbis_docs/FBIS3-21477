The four countries developing the aircraft have pledged to buy 600 of the planes in the event it is produced. The company hopes to sell an additional 400-450 to a number of countries, including Saudi Arabia. There are currently seven experimental prototypes of the EFA 2000. Development of the plane is faced with numerous obstacles. However, it has been decided that the plane will make its first sortie, which has been postponed repeatedly, by the end of next April. It is estimated that by the start of the next century, Saudi Arabia will have its own aircraft industry. British Aerospace hopes that the Kingdom will be able by then to participate in the technologies and production of the EFA 2000. British Aerospace is currently manufacturing 48 Tornado military aircraft for Saudi Arabia as part of an accord announced last January. The cost of each Tornado, an interceptor-bomber, is 20 million pounds sterling. The British firm still hopes that Saudi Arabia will confirm its previous request to purchase 60 more Hawk training aircraft. It is evident that with its request to purchase 48 Tornado aircraft, plus 72 F-15's from the United States, Saudi Arabia will need additional training aircraft soon. British Aerospace will deliver the 48 Tornado's in 1997 and 1998 at the rate of two aircraft monthly. In addition to producing the Tornado's, the firm is making efforts to enhance this type of fighter plane. The company is currently making improvements on 17 out of 72 Tornado's previously purchased by Saudi Arabia. British weapons exports to Saudi Arabia are part of the al-Yamamah Program, which is being implemented in accordance with the two "memoranda of understanding" concluded by Britain and Saudi Arabia in 1985 and 1988. In addition to weapons sales, the program includes training plans. British Aerospace is the main company in al-Yamamah Program, and has 3,500 employees in Saudi Arabia currently. In the first phase of the program Saudi Arabia acquired from British Aerospace 72 Tornado aircraft, including 48 designed as interceptor-bombers and 24 designed for air defense operations. Saudi Arabia also acquired 30 Hawk-65 training aircraft. The second memorandum of understanding covered the latest 48 Tornado's, which were requested last year, and the 60 Hawks which the corporation is trying to get confirmed. British Aerospace directors say that contrary to the Americans, they have not received to date any Saudi request to reconsider payment arrangements. They added that should such proposals be submitted, they will be carefully considered. Last Saturday, Saudi Arabia and the United States concluded an accord that permits rescheduling the payment of $9.2 billion in weapons purchases from five U.S. corporations. The accord permits the payment period to be extended beyond the two years set in the original accord. British Aerospace points out the presence of large differences in the method by which U.S. and British weapons sales to Saudi Arabia are financed. Whereas U.S. military sales are in cash, the arrangement in accordance with which British weapons costs are paid includes the delivery of 500,000 barrels of Saudi oil daily. This deal is more flexible and permits for the introduction of greater modifications, when necessary. This confirms the successful character of the concept of al-Yamamah Program as a whole. British Aerospace may take care in the future of modernizing the Tornado's already owned by Saudi Arabia. It is likely that the corporation will upgrade 140 GR-1 to GR-4 [Tornado] aircraft belonging to the British Air Force by changing the capabilities of their computers and electronic equipment. The 48 aircraft purchased by Saudi Arabia are GR-1's. The Saudi Air Force may adopt the GR-4 after it is introduced to the British Air Force and after the aircraft proves its fitness practically. The Hawk 100 and Hawk 200 have been developed especially for export. The Hawk 100 is a two-seat training aircraft designed to attack ground targets. The Hawk 200 is a single-seat light fighter equipped with complex systems from Westinghouse. The cost of a Hawk aircraft is estimated at 9-11 million pounds sterling. It is to be noted that the old Hawks are of the Hawk 60 series. Several Gulf states have purchased Hawk aircraft. In addition to Saudi Arabia, these states include Kuwait, Abu-Dhabi (which recently received a number of Hawk 100's), and Oman (which purchased four Hawk 100's and 12 Hawk 200's in 1989). It is hoped that Qatar will become a new client. Qatar currently has French-made Alfa Jet and Mirage aircraft. But it will seek to upgrade its air force at a later time in the 1990's. Qatar has firm relations with France. Since 30 October 1993, i.e. when the Dubai Air Fair was held, British Aerospace has organized a major tour to market the Hawk 100 in the Gulf, Southeast Asia, and the Far East. During this tour, Hawk aircraft have traveled more than 40,000 miles and have presented 42 exhibitions and 22 air shows for clients. All this has been done using no more than four liters of engine oil and changing the tires just twice and the brakes just once.
