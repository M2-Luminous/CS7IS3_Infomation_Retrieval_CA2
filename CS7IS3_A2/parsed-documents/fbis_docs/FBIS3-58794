"Arms must not be silent when they are escorting essential goods to people who are dying of hunger, medicine for people who are ill or wounded, or concrete support for the poor," the pontiff said in an address during a day of prayer for Bosnia in which he invited all Christians to take part. The pope expressed pain at "so much cruelty" in the former Yugoslav republic and issued an "urgent appeal" for road access to be given to convoys bringing relief to "those who are dying of hunger" in Sarajevo, Tuzla and Mostar. "We suffer at the sight of so much cruelty, the repeated and very serious violations of human rights, the destruction of priceless monuments to civilisation. The acts of violence against women, children, elderly and defenceless people affect us deeply," he said. And he told the Bosnian people: "You are not abandoned. We are with you and we will be with you, we will always be with you." Meanwhile in Sarajevo, Bosnia's leading Moslem cleric Mustafa Efendi Ceric called on the Islamic authorities of Iran, Turkey and Egypt to end the suffering of the Bosnian people "whom all the others have betrayed and abandoned." In a letter written after the death of six Sarajevo children killed by a shell as they played in the snow, Ceric said he could no longer call "either on (UN chief) Butrus Butrus-Ghali, or on the European or world community, which remain deaf to the cries of our women and children." Ceric, whose letter was broadcast by Sarajevo radio, accused the international community of "looking on with indifference as the aggressor kills innocent children because the victims are Bosnian Moslems whom they themselves have deprived of the right of self-defence." The latter comment was a reference to the international arms embargo against the republics of former Yugoslavia which Bosnians regard as preventing them from defending themselves against the superior weaponry of separatist Serbs who are armed by Belgrade. The radio said the letter was sent to Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, to the chief ulema of Turkey and to the imam of Al Azhar in Egypt. Bosnian vice-president Ejup Ganic meanwhile called on U.S. President Bill Clinton to honour his pledge not to tolerate the strangling of Sarajevo "which has gone on for 22 months now." He said he hoped the United States "will not allow countries which tolerate genocide and reward aggression to dictate the policy of the international community on Bosnia-Herzegovina." After the killing of the six children on Saturday Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic called in a letter to Butrus-Ghali for airstrikes to break the stranglehold imposed by Bosnian Serb forces on the Bosnian capital.
