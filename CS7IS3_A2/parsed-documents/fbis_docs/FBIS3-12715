In a statement aired over the Yemeni Television last night and relayed by the INA correspondent in Sanaa, Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib and opposition National Grouping Chairman Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum said that they have become convinced beyond any shadow of doubt that the scheme to effect an irreversible secession in the country is being carried out with sure steps, and that secession will be effected through bloodshed and a bitter infighting between the two parties to the conflict. The two Yemeni officials asserted that the all Yemenis are responsible for safeguarding Yemen and its unity. They indicated that the accord document recently signed in Amman is the property of all the Yemeni people, and not that of a single ruler, party, or group. They held the Yemeni people responsible for protecting and defending this document. The statement issued by the two Yemeni officials appealed to the Yemeni Army not to get involved in acts that could shed the blood of their fathers, brothers, and sons just to promote the interests of certain persons or parties, as such a thing would harm the interests of 14 million Yemenis. They asserted that they have made persistent efforts to achieve a minimum understanding between the parties to the conflict.
