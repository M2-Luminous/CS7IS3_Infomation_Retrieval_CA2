During this period, the economic policy was senseless, helpless, and antinational. Only three years more of such policy are required to make Ukraine a source of raw materials, cheap labor, and to turn it into a underdeveloped colony. Let us recall who is the initiator and the advocate of this sycophantic policy. From the very beginning of the existence of the former Supreme Council, V. M. Pylypchuk, O. S. Emelyanov, and V. M. Pynzenyk played an active part in imposing the principles of market reforms. Their program foresaw the "liberalization" of prices, privatization of state enterprises, and the introduction of a national currency. This program praised the price policy of a "shock therapy" -- imposed on Russia and Ukraine -- which became a lever for robbing people. In March 1992, the president submitted "Fundamentals of National Economic Policy" for consideration by the Supreme Council. Former presidential adviser O. S. Emelyanov headed the drafting collective. Former instructor V. M. Pynzenyk and other persons also participated in drafting this program. V. M. Pylypchuk, chairman of Supreme Council commission for economic reforms, supported this program in its entirety. Key principles of this program are as follows: 1. Russia is an enemy. It is necessary to isolate Ukraine from Russia as soon as possible. This could lead to the disruption of contacts and stoppages of deliveries, and to a crisis in wholesale prices; 2. It is necessary to introduce a national currency as soon as possible (though it is not covered by goods or currency reserves!); 3. It is necessary to introduce a system of clearing accounting between the CIS states (which halted deliveries and thus triggered a payment crisis what cost Ukraine losses in the multibillions). 4. It is necessary to reorient the Ukrainian economy toward integration with the West (nothing comes of this, because entering new markets requires constant effort). These mindless adventurous measures complicated a situation in Ukraine that was already difficult. Meanwhile, V. G. Lanovyy -- who worked in the cost-accounting laboratory at a state enterprise, and later headed the department at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Institute of Economics -- appears on the scene. V. M. Pylypchuk and V. G. Lanovyy were involved in the introduction of tear-off coupons. All of a sudden, an abstract dogmatist became minister of economy and vice prime minister dealing with the reforms. He drafted a regular populist thick "program," the essence of which was narrowed to the illusory plans regarding privatization and liberalization of prices. Nobody took this program seriously because it did not correspond to Ukrainian reality. The program did not contain anything revolutionary or original. V. G. Lanovyy was dismissed because of his absolute inefficiency. However, currently, he depicts himself as a discredited fighter for reforms. There is nothing new in this. All populists behave this way. Rukh also suffers from the same illness. V. M. Pynzenyk, a theoretician of the same ilk, became minister of economy and vice prime minister dealing with implementing reforms. Therefore, his first moves -- the untimely withdrawal from the ruble zone, the recommendation that the National Bank chairman, who voiced doubts over the opportunity to quickly introduce new money, resign -- present nothing strange. He opposed union with Russia and CIS states. He and his friends drafted several dozens of programs and finally put the economy into a state of confusion. Beginning in late 1992, he embarked on a wild increase in prices which continued until January 1993. He also drafted three projects addressing the implementation of the "Fundamentals of National Economic Policy." Due to the lack of time, L. D. Kuchma had to submit the third draft -- without reading or introducing amendments -- for consideration by the Supreme Council. V. M. Pylypchuk, V. M. Pynzenyk, and V. G. Lanovyy did not consider the economic and social situation in Ukraine and advocated primitive measures, which they borrowed, first of all, from U.S. theories. All their reforms are reduced to one concept: liberalization of prices, introduction of free foreign trade, quick privatization, sale of land, bankruptcy of loss-bringing enterprises and collective agricultural collectives, and restoration of tough money and credit policy to oppose inflation. Life showed that all this is harmful to Ukraine. The international conference -- devoted to market reforms -- was held from 19 to 23 May in Ukraine. This was, in fact, a political meeting, which was attended by all avid proponents of shock therapy: Sachs, Balcerovicz, and others. Ukraine was represented by our "heroes" V. M. Pylypchuk, V. M. Pynzenyk, and V. G. Lanovyy. Ukrainian representatives of alternative economic methods did not participate in the conference. U.S. "professors" called for not protecting the Ukrainian economy from the crisis but allowing it to undergo "structural changes" prompted by blows arising from the crisis in sales and payments. Only when V. M. Pynzenyk and V. G. Lanovyy were dismissed and V. M. Pylypchuk bridled his energy by being unable to think realistically and in connection with launching an election campaign, the statements that inflation could be kept down and on the crisis in payments and production was challenged. Minister of Economy R. V. Shpek also tries to continue the implementation of the Western wild market policy. According to him, even state regulation means liberalization of prices (we cite him!). Under his office, the Ministry of Economy turned into an unimportant department for carrying out propaganda. V. M. Pynzenyk, V. G. Lanovyy, M. Pylypchuk, and R. V. Shpek make attempts to become real compradors, and encourage the policy of states-colonizers. All their reforms are new versions of primitive Western recipes that do not take Ukrainian conditions into consideration. They are pushing our people into poverty and Ukraine -- to a colonial dependence. They cannot become leaders of Supreme Council economic commissions.
