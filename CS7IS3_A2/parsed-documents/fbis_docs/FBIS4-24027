About 400 combat-ready gendarmes and policemen took up position in the very early hours of the day in front of lecture halls and tutorial blocks, AFP noted. No incident was reported by 1000. Several leaders of the FESCI, which is composed of the most radical students, were present on the campus but they answered questions with great caution. "The land is mined," they explained, refusing to comment further on the situation. [passage omitted] Six students entered the second week of their hunger strike today at the country's second university town, Bouake, which is 290 km north of Abidjan. They were transferred to Bouake central hospital on 16 June from the Burkina Faso Consulate where they began their strike. "They are still refusing food but they do accept water," the hospital director told AFP. "For the time being, their lives are not in danger. We cannot forcibly feed them but should their condition worsen we will be compelled to intervene," he stated. [passage omitted]
