I would advise "extreme caution" on the matter, Kinkel told journalists in Nuremberg today. There must be no deportation of Kurds threatened with human rights violations in Turkey. In spite of his reservations, he is prepared to consider changes to legislation in cases where the right to hospitality has been abused, Kinkel added. Nor would he tire of urging the Turkish Government, "in the spirit of friendship," to prevent human rights violations in Turkey. The European Union and Germany should spell out to its NATO partner, Turkey, "what we expect of it." Kinkel announced he wants to learn the truth about reports stating that German weapons are being used against the Kurds in Turkey. However, so far he has received no evidence of this despite intensive enquiries. If the reports are true, the German Government will "lodge massive diplomatic protests to the Turkish Government."
