C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan's strategy to promote strategic alliances with world-renowned multinational companies has begun to pay off as domestic computer products are making inroads into the Japanese market. Shu Liang, president of Mitac Inc., said Thursday [21 April] that his company will soon deliver 1,000 industrial computers to Tokyo's Narita International Airport. Mitac is a leading computer manufacturer in Taiwan. The computer deal is part of an international procurement contract won by the US-based Westinghouse Co., which entered into a strategic alliance with Mitac last August, Shu said. The computers, which will boost Narita's information control equipment, are designed and produced by Mitac with technical assistance from Westinghouse, he elaborated. Previously, he added, such computers were wholly manufactured by Westinghouse. The business executive saw bright prospects in the cooperative ties, saying aggregate orders from Japan for similar computers are expected to top 5,000 computers, or NT [new Taiwan]$200 million (US$7.54 million). Moreover, he pointed out, the deal certainly will have a positive impact on Mitac's computer quality and expertise. "We are happy to become Westinghouse' partner in the Asia-Pacific region," he said. Mitac and Westinghouse hosted a seminar on information technology in Taipei last month to explore the great market potential here, he noted.
