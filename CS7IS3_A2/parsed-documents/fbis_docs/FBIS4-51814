The Seoul-Pusan high-speed line will be the world's first to adopt a time-division multiple access (TDMA) cellular system, widely used by U.S. telecom companies in their cellular phone networks, a KHRC spokesman said. Existing bullet trains -- the TGV (Train a Grande Vitesse) of France, the ICE (Inter-City Express) of Germany and Sinkansen of Japan -- all use the less sensitive analog technology. The applicants are ASCOM of Switzerland (with participation by Korea's Goldstar Information and Communications), Motorola of the United States (together with Hantong Engineering), Siemens of Germany (Siemens Korea), Ericsson GE of the United States (Samsung Electronics and Kukje Electronics), AMCE and Union Pacific of the United States (Ujin Electronics), AEG of Germany (Hyundai Electronics) and Rohill of the Netherlands (Tongyang Telecommuncations). The KHRC will choose five successful companies by April 29 and send them RFP (Request For Proposal) so that it can name the final awardees by year-end after screening their proposals from June.
