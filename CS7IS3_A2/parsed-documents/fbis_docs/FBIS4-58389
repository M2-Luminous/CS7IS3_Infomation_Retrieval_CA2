FBIS4-58389 "drnes086_l_94005" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 ISRAEL Opposition Factions Submit Draft Bill To Disband Knesset Opposition Factions Submit Draft Bill To Disband Knesset TA0405075894 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 0730 GMT 4 May 94 TA0405075894 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Text] The leaders of the opposition have submitted a draft bill to disband the Knesset and to hold new elections. The argument attached to the motion states that the prime minister has been grossly violating specific commitments he made on the eve of the elections to the 13th Knesset. According to the opposition, a minority government, whose performance has been gradually deteriorating, cannot possibly stay in office and endanger Israel's security. Consequently, the leaders of the opposition argue, the 13th Knesset must disband so that the people may have their say in new elections and decide who deserves to lead it. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 4 May adds: "The Likud says that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has once again proven his inability to protect Israel's basic interests. The Likud's spokesman says that the man who until a few months ago promised a Palestinian tiny spot in the town of Jericho has given away more than 60 square km of Palestinian sovereignty in the Jordan Valley on a silver platter, and he is not yet done."]
