Solntseva, Brain Research Institute at Russia's Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow; UDC 612.829:612.822:577.352.5] [Abstract] Interest in biochemical and electric responses of the nerve cell to application of antibrain antibodies is attributed to the fact that such reactions serve as the biological basis of nervous and psychological disorders, and data on the intracellular mechanisms of the nerve cell's electric activity behavior under the effect of antibrain antibodies are reviewed. In particular, the electrophysiological effects of immunoglobulines (Ig) and blood serum of schizophrenia patients, electrophysiological effects of antibodies to S-100 proteins, i.e., AS-100 or genus-nonspecific proteins present in the glia or neurons both in the soluble and membrane-bound form, and the role of intracellular mediators in AS-100's electrophysiological effects are examined in detail. A study involving snail and rat hippocampal neurons shows that these antibodies suppress the action potential generation with or without the membrane depolarization, decrease the membrane's input resistance, and lower the amplitude of stimulating postsynaptic potentials. AS-100 lowers the potential-dependent inward current and induces steady-state inward current, yet these phenomena can be neutralized fully or partially by intracellular EGTA Ca[.sup]2+[/]-chelator or cAMP injection. Under the effect of antibrain antibodies on the nerve cell, events develop in its cytoplasma which are similar to those occurring in the cytoplasma of immunocompetent cells during the antigen-antibody complex formation in them. It is speculated that AS-100's electrophysiological effect is due to an increase in the Ca[.sup]2+[/] level and a decrease in the cAMP level in the nerve cell's cytoplasma. It is further speculated that these antibodies are also capable of inducing similar effects in human brain neurons and leading to significant shifts in the psychic status.
