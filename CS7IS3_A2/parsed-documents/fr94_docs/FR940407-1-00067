ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA; Bureau) is proposing to amend the existing Financial Assistance and Social Services Program regulations to incorporate rules for adult care services and the work experience program. Additionally, a quality assurance section is being incorporated to enable the BIA to assess the quality of the social services it provides, measure compliance with regulations and adherence to internal control requirements, and provide specific guidelines for administering the programs. An amendment is also being incorporated to establish rules on the treatment of per capita payments when determining eligibility for participation in social services programs. DATES: Comments must be received on or before June 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments may be mailed to the Division of Social Services, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 1849 C Street, NW., Mail Stop 310&hyph;SIB, Washington, DC 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Hickman, Chief, Division of Social Services, or Nancy Evans, Principal General Assistance Specialist, at 202 208&hyph;2721. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Experience in program administration and outside audit findings have indicated that regulatory amendments are needed to define with greater clarity the programs provided under this part. A primary purpose of the amendments is to provide clear, concise guidelines that will effect a reduction in eligibility error rates. Amendments are being made in 25 CFR 20.1, Definitions; 20.2, Purpose; 20.3, Policy; 20.20, General and 20.23 Miscellaneous Assistance. The following new sections are added: 20.15, Reporting requirements for all social services programs; 20.16, Staffing requirements; 20.26, Adult care assistance program; 20.27, Work experience program; and 20.35, Quality assurance reviews. The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed rule to the location identified in the ``addresses'' section of this document. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that these proposed regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) of Executive Order 12778. BIA has made every effort to ensure that the proposed rules specify their effect on existing regulations, and provide clear, certain language to promote burden reduction and avoid litigation. The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, and therefore will not be reviewed at the Office of Management and Budget. The rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that the rules do not have ``significant takings'' implications. The rules do not pertain to ``taking'' of private property interests, nor do they impact private property. The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule does not have significant federalism effects under Executive Order 12612 and will not interfere with the roles, rights and responsibilities of states. The Department of the Interior has determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The information collection requirements contained in 25 CFR 20.4 will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval as required by 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The collection of this information will not be required until it has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget. The primary author of this document is David Hickman, Chief, Division of Social Services, Office of Tribal Services.
