Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- The 13th economic and technical cooperation meeting Between Taiwan and Saudi Arabia opened at the Ministry of Economic Affairs Tuesday [12 April]. Addressing the opening ceremony, Vice Economic Affairs Minister S.J. Li said that this session of the Sino-Saudi Permanent Joint Committee on Economic and Technical Cooperation aims to review bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Li pledged that the two countries "will join hands to make the best use of what the other can offer in creating the greatest well- being for the people." Li represents Taiwan at the meeting, while the 30-member Saudi Arabian delegation is led by Ibrahim Bin Salamah, a vice minister and concurrently vice chairman of the semi-official Saudi Arabia Basic Industry Corporation. The meeting will focus discussion on trade, investment, and economic cooperation. The meeting, which will continue through Wednesday, marks the first vice ministerial-level contact in Taipei since the two countries suspended diplomatic relations in July 1990. The last meeting was held in Riyadh 1992. Meanwhile, a seminar on Saudi Arabia's investment climate, sponsored by the Taipei-based Sino-Arabian Cultural and Economic Association, will be held at the Taipei International Convention Center Wednesday. This will also be the first time such a seminar has taken place here since 1990. The two delegation leaders to the economic and technical cooperation meeting will be invited to the seminar, which aims to lure Taiwan manufacturers to Saudi Arabia and to promote business alliances between the two countries. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has long been one of Taiwan's most important trading partners. Taiwan exported about US$500 million worth of products to the kingdom last year, while imports from the kingdom totaled US$1.5 billion.
