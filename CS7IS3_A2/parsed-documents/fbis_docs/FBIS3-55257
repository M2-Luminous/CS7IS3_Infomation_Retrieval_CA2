Abbasov reported that his government had drafted a plan on joint bazaars, and the republican leadership had been doing all it could to open such markets. The project provides for stimulating the delivery of food and other prime necessity items to Azerbaijan from Iran. There will be primarily barter trade to keep Azerbaijan's currency reserves intact. Proceeds from market sales will be exempted from taxes. Abbasov spoke highly of Iran's humanitarian relief to Azerbaijani refugees and welcomed Iran's proposal to set up a chain of Iranian shops in Azerbaijan.
