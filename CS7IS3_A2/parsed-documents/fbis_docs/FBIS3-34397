Under this division, politicians have been dragging the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to a place where it does not belong: the arduous road of internal political struggle. The question is not what is the professional opinion voiced by the chief of staff and his subordinates in internal forums discussing the peace process but who is leaking the chief of staff's views and for what purpose. Last Friday, YEDI'OT AHARONOT -- which, according to the aforementioned division, gets its leaks from the tall people -- carried a front-page report that "the chief of staff is trying to create a crisis with 'Arafat." Five days have gone by, and we have not heard of the IDF spokesman issuing any denial. To make sure, I officially approached the spokesman and asked him whether he could deny the report, which I consider serious. After all, it is not every day that a chief of staff plans to sabotage a move decided upon by the government. The spokesman said he did not participate in the meeting and, consequently, could not issue a denial. I pursued my inquiries with a higher level and found that there are no plans to issue a denial. I was told: "We do not deny every report appearing in the press." Although this refusal in no way constitutes confirmation of the report, I got the impression that the Army top brass is not really sorry that its reservations about the Davos understandings are getting so much publicity. One need not be an erudite political commentator to realize that the chief of staff -- and definitely the prime minister -- are not averse to the leaks. The wave of reports about the Army's reservations has a purpose: to rein Shim'on Peres in. "There is a man who is very displeased with the rapid progress in the negotiations with the Palestinians, and he systematically leaks information against the agreement," says a man close to the foreign minister -- and we can only guess who he is referring to. Others look for the psychological angle. They think that to this day, the chief of staff has been unable to forget that he was not let in on the Oslo agreement. He has been very critical of the loopholes in the agreement and now wants to approve every comma and period. Into his fourth year as chief of staff and in view of his ambition to have a far-reaching political career, Baraq cannot afford to fail in the implementation of the agreement on Gaza and Jericho, those people say. The chief of staff, however, is not the main protagonist in the affair of the Army's public involvement. The main protagonist is the defense minister, who is disturbed by Peres' hyperactivity. In the meeting of the "peace team forum" held on the morning of 27 January (attended by Rabin, Peres, Baraq, Shahaq, Dayan, Sagi, Haber, Yatom, the head of the Shin Bet, and three senior Foreign Ministry officials), Peres found himself in the minority in the face of the criticism of the Army top brass. From that day on, but mainly after Peres and 'Arafat were seen holding hands and bursting with joy, there have been systematic leaks about the Army's opposition to the Davos agreement, including reports about this confidential meeting. Indeed, the signing in Davos was torpedoed successfully. Peres was forced to travel to Cairo with new demands. The General Staff's reservations may or may not be relevant, but that is not the point. The point is the way in which the IDF was ushered into the political decisionmaking process. Rabin's dominance as prime minister and defense minister, coupled with his disregard for his cabinet ministers and his suspicion of Peres, created a situation where Ehud Baraq became his confidant and his close adviser. The inner cabinet has been replaced by a group of senior officers trusted by Rabin and Baraq. And, somehow, the fine line dividing the executive branch from the elected level has been blurred. Suddenly we find Army officers negotiating peace or sitting on either side of Rabin in meetings with statesmen. Thus the Army finds itself siding with one minister against another and involved in decisions that are the exclusive prerogative of the elected level. A military putsch, if you forgive my expression, comes in many forms. It does not necessarily entail usurping a legitimate government by force. Excessive involvement of the army in government bodies, even if solicited by the highest level, is a type of putsch. Perhaps a creeping putsch. Those who want to uphold checks and balances, the separation of powers, and the subordination of civil servants to elected officials should put the Army back where it belongs as an apolitical entity.
