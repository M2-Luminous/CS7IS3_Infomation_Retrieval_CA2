An increase in customs tariffs on imports, which was confirmed a few days ago by the Russian Federation Government, runs counter to the principle of free trade. A fight within the government over the change in import tariffs has been under way for about half a year. As early as at the end of last year, all the necessary documents were submitted to the government, but at that time it did not resolve to proceed with raising the duties. At that time, other members of the government--Boris Fedorov, Yegor Gaydar--came out vigorously against such a step, along with the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations (whose position remains unchanged at present). As is known, the array of forces on the government team is different now. An energetic industrial lobby drawing on Oleg Soskovets and an agrarian lobby headed by Aleksandr Zaveryukha have ultimately "ramrodded through" the version of the document that they needed. Naturally, the revision of import duties is not being carried out for the sake of some abstract principles or established international rules. The interests of consumers and the development of competitive production within the country are the principal points. So, first of all a tariff should not raise the cost of living for the people. IZVESTIYA wrote in detail yesterday about the fact that the government decree on new import duties that was issued on 10 March will bring about a considerable growth of prices for foodstuffs. Let us note in addition to what has been said that the effectiveness of this measure with regard to the protection of our domestic market for foodstuffs, which to the mind of the authorities it is aimed to accomplish, is far from certain, too. Nowhere in the world are duties charged on the raw-material group of commodities. Meanwhile, the new tariff introduces, for example, a 25-percent duty on imported wool. However, it is known that our knitwear factories need wool of a particular quality--our wool, as a rule, is good only for military overcoats and felt boots. Therefore, in this case higher prices for imports will bring about yet another increase in prices for finished goods and a drop in their competitiveness on the foreign market. This will be happening at a time when restrictions on the delivery of our textiles and knitwear abroad exist to begin with; now we are ourselves hampering our own business. An increase in import duties on integrated circuits to 60 percent for certain types is another equally vivid example. It is clear that we will hardly reach the world level in electronic equipment in the immediate future; that is to say, we will set back our own consumers of chips. However, even the Japanese buy them. Of course, a reasonable protectionist policy occasionally benefits the national economy, and many states do resort to it, but for the most part temporarily. The very changes in the import tariff are a complex issue. For example, a domestic producer of powdered milk demands that a duty be levied on a similar product manufactured abroad, while asking at the same time that no duties be introduced on foreign equipment for his plant. The Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways are interested in the reduction of duties on railway cars, whereas the producers of the latter demand the opposite. It is virtually impossible to accommodate all at the same time. Finally, higher customs barriers to imports are very hard to combine with our aspiration to occupy a proper place in world trade and, in particular, to join the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and to sign a partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union. After all, the prevailing trend in world trade in the recent decades has consisted precisely of reducing the barriers to trade consistently.
