Jumilla] [Text] The government and the National Democratic Front [NDF] have agreed to form four "working committees" that will lay the groundwork for formal peace talks between the two parties. Howard Dee, chief government negotiator with the communists, yesterday said the committees will cover human rights, socio-economic reforms, political and constitutional reforms, and cease-fire and disposition of forces. Interviewed in Malacanang [presidential office], Dee said the creation of the committees was one of the two agreements forged between government and NDF representatives during their 10-14 June meeting in Breukelen, The Netherlands. The other agreement was to get the peace process moving, after having been stalled for several months. "In our next meeting before the end of the quarter -- we have not yet decided the exact site (in Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg) and date -- we will proceed to operationalize these working committees," Dee said. Both the government and the NDF will designate their respective representatives to the committees, who will then meet with their counterparts from the other side to discuss the issue assigned to them. During the meeting in the Benelux territories, the two sides are also expected to set the venue and date for the formal talks. Meanwhile, Dee said the government will keep its options open in regard to talking peace with breakaway communist factions. This, despite the NDF's warning that the government would be violating the joint declaration signed in Hague, The Netherlands in September 1992, should it decide to negotiate with other groups. "The government position is, it is the government's prerogative to address all those who want to have peace with the government because the government wants to make peace with everyone," Dee said. But he said there was no decision yet to talk with other groups as the government has yet to formulate a policy on the matter. Dee and acting presidential peace adviser Manuel Yan will meet shortly to discuss policy recommendations on holding talks with other groups, he said. So far, the only other communist faction that may seek to negotiate with the government is the breakaway Manila-Rizal Regional Committee [MRRC] headed by Filemon Lagman. The MRRC is the mother unit of the urban hit squad Alex Boncayao Brigade. Dee explained that the peace panel deals only with organizations with armed units, and these exclude mere political groupings such as those headed by other breakaway leaders as Ricardo Reyes and Romulo Kintanar. "The decision (to open talks with other factions, as in the case of Lagman) should be made at a higher level because the case of Lagman is complex," he said. In the case of Lagman, Dee added, the government would have to find out what group he represents. As this developed, former NDF chief negotiator Satur Ocampo said the NDF was likely to insist on holding formal talks abroad despite the government's shifting-venue policy. The NDF's position remains that holding the talks outside the Philippines would minimize the risks of its negotiators and staff being put under surveillance or arrest, he said.
