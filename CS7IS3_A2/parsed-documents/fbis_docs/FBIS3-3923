The remote-controlled robot, developed mainly by researchers at the Harbin Engineering University in Heilongjiang Province, is the first of its kind in China. It can adhere to the surface of storage tanks holding radioactive materials to check their brazing seams and the thickness of the tank walls. It can also carry out safety examinations, rust ridding and lacquer spraying for various containers in the chemical industry, and clean-up work on skyscrapers. The machine consists of six parts: a robot transporter, the robot itself, highly flexible mechanical arms, a control system, a visual system and an ultrasonic detection system.
