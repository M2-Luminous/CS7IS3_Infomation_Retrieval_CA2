He said this during a visit to Burgas, in answer to a question from a KONTINENT journalist about violations of the human rights of the Bulgarian minority in the FRY. Dr. Smilkovic declared that the Bulgarian minority even enjoys certain privileges as a Slavonic minority. He added that the Bulgarians there were enduring the same difficulties as the Serbs and that the facts reported in the press were false. He was surprised that even when describing the Los Angeles earthquake, Bulgarian journalists find it necessary to throw in a few profanities about the Serbs. According to Smilkovic, now, when Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] has been removed as a motive for conflict, the press is looking for a new apple of discord. This was unjustified, because the FRY leadership hopes that the border that separates us will become one that links us together. Dr. Smilkovic said that only the FRY and its neighbors were suffering from the embargo, and he described the blockade as genocide. Despite everything, the ambassador does not blame Bulgaria for observing the embargo, and he pointed out that incidents such as the "Khan Kubrat" case should not be used as a pretext for worsening relations.
