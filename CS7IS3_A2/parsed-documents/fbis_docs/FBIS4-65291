The 10-member delegation of members of parliament representing Finland on the council hosted the seminar. Delegation chairman Olli Rehn (Center Party) thought up the idea of organizing it. In the course of time the sizable network of groups occupying themselves with international affairs in parliament has grown. At the present time many members of parliament also have foreign policy duties either on official committees or delegations or in various friendship groups. Headed by Pertti Paasio (Social Democrat), the Foreign Affairs Committee has retained its leading position as a parliamentary monitor. The changed international situation has, however, also strengthened the Defense Committee's foreign policy role. As for that big committee, it is now being turned into an integration committee that deals with EEA [European Economic Area] and in future EU [European Union] affairs. Furthermore, delegations have been separately appointed in parliament in the EEA and EFTA [European Free Trade Association] members of parliament committees, the Council of Europe, the Nordic Council, the CSCE Parliamentary General Assembly, and the Interparliamentary Union (IPU). The Joint Finnish and European Parliaments Committee was formed over a year ago to keep track of the progress of the EU negotiations. Since last year, Paasio and Kalevi Lamminen (Conservative), the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Defense Committee, have been participating as observers at Western European Union (WEU) members of parliament meetings. Eeva Kuuskoski has been representing the Finnish parliament in the North Atlantic Assembly, an organ corresponding to NATO. Those members of parliament who are most active in terms of foreign policy simultaneously participate in many of the committees and delegations: Kimmo Sasi (Conservative) in six of them and Centrists Sirkka-Liisa Anttila, Juha Korkeaoja, and Mirjas Ryynanen, as well as Social Democrat Erkki Tuomioja in five of them. Olli Rehn, Jorn Donner (Swedish People's Party), and Ilkka Suominen (Conservative), who will be leaving parliament in May, each head two delegations. This heightening of parliament's standing in the handling of foreign affairs is not only a Finnish phenomenon; the same thing has in fact been happening in many European countries. In Finland, however, this development has been progressing in a surprisingly smooth fashion. Members of parliament have avoided interfering in matters of a sensitive nature without consulting the Foreign Ministry beforehand. Zhirinovskiy's visit also had the Foreign Ministry's blessing. However, a small territorial struggle arose on Arkadianmaki [parliament location] between the Foreign Affairs Committee (UAV) and the new delegations. In an unpublished official report drafted last December, the parliamentary International Affairs Committee alludes, among other things, to the UAV's desire to "strengthen the link" between it and the CSCE Members of Parliament Delegation. The same members of parliament -- and, in addition, the speaker of parliament -- are currently representing Finland at CSCE Parliamentary General Assembly meetings as are on the Council of Europe. Friendship Across Borders In parliament there are at present about 30 friendship groups with various countries. In addition to the most important European countries, China, Japan, Cuba, Israel, and Nicaragua, among others, have acquired their own groups. Most of them were formed after the mid-1980's. The oldest of them, the Finland-Korea group, has been active since 1974. In its report the International Affairs Committee also dealt with friendship groups. It expressed the opinion that members of parliament's activities built "on voluntary participation" were still necessary "because friendship groups enable us to more closely observe the countries involved, to enter into closer relations with the embassies of the countries in question, and to play host in parliament to the delegations arriving from these countries." Estonia has the largest friendship group -- over 50 members of parliament. About 40 members of parliament belong to each group involving the Arab nations, South Africa, China, and Hungary. The groups' political power relations vary considerably. The entire Christian League parliamentary delegation is in the Israel group, but only one leftist, Aarno von Bell (Social Democrat), is. There are as many Left Leaguers in the Cuba group as members of all the other parties together. Parliament's backbenchers also get a chance to give vent to their foreign policy activism in the friendship groups. Pekka Leppanen (Left League) belongs to 14 groups, Riitta Kamppinen (Center Party) and veteran Ensio Laine (Left League) to 13, and Hannu Kemppainen (Center Party) and Eeva-Liisa Moilanen (Christian League) to 11. Influential heavyweight members of parliament demonstrate their friendship much more selectively. Paavo Vayrynen is a member of only the Albania group and Esko Aho of only the South Africa group opposed to racial oppression, while Paavo Lipponen belongs to no group at all.
