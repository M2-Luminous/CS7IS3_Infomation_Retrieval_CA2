Things do not look good unless the rate of expansion can be brought above the average of the recent past. However, there are no indications that we can raise growth consistently. Of course, further economic growth has results which a mature industrial society does not favor; nevertheless, it is essential. Very few people would discourage progress in material terms. Sufficient economic growth represents just the beginning of the solution to the government's financial problems and the unemployment problem. The rate of economic growth is also of crucial importance in coping with the problem of the aging [population]. It is important that the growth not be accompanied by a significant rise in inflation or a sharp rise in interest rates. That would create more problems than it would solve. However, nobody can see where this faster growth will come from. The average over the past 20 years is just 2 percent, compared to 5 percent annually in the period from 1960 to 1973. If we look at the figures for each decade -- a questionable idea since it would be better to compare the entire economic cycle -- the systematic drop is even more striking: an average of 4.8 percent per year in the 1960's (1960-69), 3.5 percent in the 1970's, 2 percent in the 1980's, and 1.3 percent -- so far -- in the 1990's. When evaluating the figures, account must of course be taken of the level effect: High growth figures are more difficult to achieve as the economy grows. All the more reason to wonder how the Belgian economy will manage in the coming years to perform better than in the past 20 years. A difference of 1 point per year seems insignificant, but that is not true of course. If the economy maintains a cruising speed of 2 percent per year, then that would yield a cumulative total of 15 percent by the year 2000, and 71 percent by the year 2020. If an average of 3 percent were achieved, the respective percentages become 23 and 122. If growth were to reach just 1 percent per year, then the respective cumulative amounts would be 7 and 31 percent. More and Better The increase in the gross domestic product determines the growth in tax revenue and also influences spending. It has become apparent that growth of more than 2 percent is needed to avid a worsening condition in government finances and the labor market. What can be said about the growth prospects, with the necessary caution? One can depart from a reassuring conclusion: Growth is almost inevitable. Scientific and technological progress will continue, and this will spontaneously lead to a further increase in productivity. Higher productivity means more production with just as many people, or just as much production with fewer people. The policy would have to be very bad, or the circumstances would have to be strongly opposite to neutralize this productivity effect. Growth must primarily be brought about through a greater or better effort by labor, capital, and management. The percentage of people working in Belgium is lower than elsewhere in the industrial world, and the rise in unemployment and the trend toward early retirement further aggravate this problem. Further reductions in working time would accentuate this trend even more: lower employment because of slow growth, less growth because of falling employment. The way in which capital is used also does little to promote growth. The high volume of savings by individuals serves, in the first instance, to cover the government's borrowing requirement. It is good that the government only needs to turn to foreign financiers to a limited degree, but the situation would be better if it were not dependent on the creation of further debt. In all fairness, it should be added that money is always found for worthy and vital projects. As for management, there is no reason why we should have fewer clever entrepreneurs than other countries. It should be clear that over the past 30 years Belgium, more than any other industrial country, has depended on foreign investments, while the required capital was often found here. In recent years, there has been great concern about Belgium's declining attraction for foreign investors and the shrinking Belgian share in American and Japanese foreign investments, among others. Spending If we want to increase the potential growth of the Belgian economy, then investment must be increased. One requirement has already been met temporarily: Private savings have risen to 20 percent of disposable income, a level that has probably not been reached since the war. However, experience shows that such a high rate of saving can only be reached at the lowest point in a recession, if the people are very concerned, and if businesses do not feel much need to invest. In order to maintain a high level of saving in the coming period, with its improved economic climate, the government's lack of saving -- i.e., its deficit -- must be lowered. In addition, the cost effectiveness of capital, in other words the profitability of businesses, must be brought back to the level of the 1960's. In order to promote employment and make it possible to increase profits, wage costs must not rise for some time. Any wage increases may not absorb the entire increase in productivity. Lastly, Belgium must continue quickly adapting to changing international circumstances. World trade will probably be the most powerful driving force behind growth, and the best chances will be offered by the young industrial countries which strike fear in our heart.
