Recently, a local daily reported that Nigeria has revealed spending some $4 billion [figure as received] on what they call peacekeeping activities in Liberia. President Taylor said he views the pronouncement seriously, noting that this may be one of the reasons why Nigeria does not want to leave Liberia. The NPFL leader reminded Nigeria and the international community that Liberia is not for sale, and if Nigeria claims to have spent $4 billion here, and did not use the money wisely to bring about peace, Liberia should not be seen as a Nigerian savings bond for their continued perpetuation in this country. President Taylor said Nigerian reference to spending $4 billion here is sufficient cause to believe why the Nigerian ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] soldiers are behaving arrogantly and carrying acts of treachery in Liberia. Are the Nigerians saying they will not leave Liberia until we pay back the $4 billion -- president Taylor asked -- stressing that Liberia is not for sale. The NPFL leader said the statement by the former Nigerian vice president, that Liberia has lost its sovereignty in the war, is manifesting itself by the attitude of the Nigerians, who have commercialized efforts to return peace to Liberia through arms sales, drug trafficking, and support for armed groups to delay the Liberian peace process. President Taylor said the NPFL, through its vision, with Almighty God, will continue to fight, watch, and die, if necessary, in the continued preservation of the sovereignty of Liberia.
