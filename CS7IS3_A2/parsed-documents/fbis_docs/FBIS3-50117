[passage omitted] Over 1,000 highly destructive shells were fired today from tanks, 105-mm and 122-mm howitzers, and mortars deep into the [Croat-held] territory and on HVO [Croatian Defense Council] positions, and hundreds of explosive devices were also launched. [passage omitted] Reliable reports say that 30 jihad warriors [as heard] were killed and seven were captured. Three members of the 111th Brigade and professional Andrija Tadic Brigade [both HVO] were killed and 12 were seriously and lightly wounded. Four civilians died and five were seriously wounded in the treacherous bombardment [as heard]. Due to the heavy fighting and influx of the wounded the situation is dramatic in Zepce hospital. People are dying in the corridors and on stretchers, because Zepce has not had surgeons, oxygen, and other necessary resources for months.
