In a statement, issued in her capacity also as the General Secretary of the AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam], she said it would not be in the interest of the country to reject in toto the Dunkel proposal. However, some clauses in the draft badly hit the export-import trade. In particular, she referred to the patent clause which could push up the price of imported life-saving and also locally manufactured drugs. There would be the need for protection against any such price increase. Also, the provision for higher royalties on process patents would affect agriculture and other sectors of the economy, leading to price rise. Steps should be taken to obtain necessary safeguards for products manufactured within the country, she said. Ms. Jayalalitha pointed out that the prices of agricultural inputs, including fertilizers and hybrid seeds, might also go up as the agreement would compel the Centre to cut subsidies. Necessary remedial measures should be taken to continue the support extended to poor farmers, she said. When the countries of the world came together to sign an agreement particularly in the context of the changing international economic scenario, it would not be in the interest of India to live in isolation. At the same time, the Centre should take the steps to protect the nation against the clauses which would adversely affect economic growth.
