Since the issue was raised by your own party, are you favorable to the notion of the UDF [Union for the French Democracy] having its own presidential candidate, or would you rather have a single candidate for the majority? [Vasseur] I think we have been fostering a loathsome political climate. Let us be cautious: The Left has not lost the presidential election yet! This is worth a warning, or even a shout of alarm. The government's authority is being slowly undermined. And I believe that although people have every right to discuss what is being done, they have no right to denigrate. All those who have been almost systematically denigrating the government are picking the wrong fight. Because if the government falls, so will the majority. As for the presidential election, I believe that it is unwise to publicly air personal squabbles, and that we all bear some responsibility for it. In other words, this is a debate that poisons our political life. We should not be obsessed by the presidential election. Thinking about it and preparing it is fine; thinking about it constantly, but not speaking of it at all. Indeed, what is wrong is bringing the general public into our quarrels. Let us wait until the vote on the budgetary bill, that is, until late autumn, before we tackle the problem head on. Right now, I am opposed to any antagonistic debate on the matter. I would add that attempting to capitalize on the prime minister's declining ratings is indicative of excessive haste. [Huet] When some people call for the UDF fielding its own presidential candidate, do you think this is meant to increase pressure? [Vasseur] In a way, yes. Dealing with the issue in such a way inevitably causes pressures. There is a definite lack of calm [Huet] Are you favorable to a single candidate of the majority for the presidential election? [Vasseur] I believe one should be able to mention the possibility without anyone feeling threatened. The single candidacy is certainly problematic because what we currently have is a diverse, many-faceted majority. There is not one person that embodies the whole of this majority. The very fact that we have been considering "primaries" demonstrates there is diversity. The only answer to this is to pursue the logic of union. And I ask two questions: First, is everyone ready to play the game when it comes to primaries, or any other procedure meant to select a presidential candidate; and, second, are we ready to unite behind whatever single candidate whom would thus be chosen? I for one am ready for this. But we need to look at it from a strategic viewpoint. [Huet] Is it not true that the notion of a single candidate inevitably leads to that of establishing a single organization of the majority after the 1995 election? [Vasseur] This would indeed be in line with the choice of a single majority candidate. I am a passionate advocate of both union and the preservation of the identity of political parties and -- as far as the UDF is concerned -- their various components. The two notions are not incompatible. However, should we choose to establish a single organization, it would have to be a confederation. If we were to high-handedly kill our various parties, membership would suffer. Being in the same political family would cause tensions and centrifugal risks, as some people would have one foot inside the organization and the other outside. The best way to unite people is not to forcibly herd them into the same pen. The purpose of the Republican Party is rather to be the fulcrum on which a single movement might be established, with every component being given equal regard. But the issue of a potential "presidential party" will definitely arise after the election. [Huet] What do you think of holding "primary elections," an idea raised once again by Interior Minister Charles Pasqua in this paper? [Vasseur] I always thought it an excellent idea in theory. Now, we are told that we need to legislate. But is this not a little late in the day? Will this not exacerbate passions further, revive tensions? Furthermore, such a system creates an extra first round, since the first round of the presidential election already is a kind of primary. This would usher in another kind of logic. If we want to continue down this road, we also need to confront the issue of the first round in parliamentary elections. Because in a way, the notion of "primaries" calls into question the principle of selecting the president of the Republic in a two-round election. Also, if the bill goes through in the spring session -- and go through it will -- and if we hold primaries in January 1995, the campaign will take place right in the middle of the budgetary session. That will hardly make for a healthier political climate! To sum things up, I think this is an excellent idea because primaries are a way to avoid a dogfight between majority leaders -- but there are both benefits and drawbacks to the exercise. I do not mind going through with it, but I do have a few qualms, as some potential candidates may be tempted not to play by the rules, arguing that the spirit of the Constitution calls for a vote from the whole population. Therefore there may be a "boomerang" effect. Once the bill has been voted, the political game will not be any calmer, and this will inevitably extend the electoral campaign. [Huet] What if primaries should prove impossible to organize? [Vasseur] If we do not succeed, we will have no choice but to have two candidates. There is an obvious risk that the two presidential candidates may be at each other's throat before the first round of voting. The other risk is that once elected, a candidate might hoard all the "spoils," that is, appropriate every single position to be filled, allocate himself all the seats up for election. To avoid this, it is essential that the two men enter into a veritable "contract" before the presidential election. Such a contract would include a "minimum-service" clause, a code for good electoral behavior, so that the two men are unable to attack each other overtly, to criticize each other's policies, and so as to ensure that the rule of reciprocal withdrawal works properly. The way I see it, such a contract must go even further: It must delineate the way the potential president of the Republic intends to govern the country and with which men. I would also like this contract to be made public before the first round.
