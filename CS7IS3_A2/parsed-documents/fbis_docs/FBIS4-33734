In statements to the press on Thursday, Balaguer said the Haitian military leaders' Dominican bank accounts have not been frozen. Twelve U.S. Atlantic Command officers arrived at Santo Domingo on 8 June and immediately transferred to the Haitian border where they are coordinating with the operations of "their Dominican counterparts" to prevent violations of the UN-decreed embargo against Haiti. The Balaguer government's agreement with Caputo and Gray includes sending helicopters and sea craft to prevent the entry of fuel and other articles to Haiti that the embargo prohibits. Although it has been said the arrival of helicopters would be imminent, only the presence in Dominican waters of the USS Cyclone and USS Tempest has been officially reported so far. A diplomatic source consulted by AFP has said the arrival of the helicopters will depend on the report on "logistic needs" by the UN observer mission, which is comprised of approximately 60 people, who should arrive shortly in the Dominican Republic.
