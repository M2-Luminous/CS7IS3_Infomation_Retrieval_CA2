FR941004-2-00013 FR941004-2-00006 We calculated Interfit's PP sales based on packed, c.i.f., duty paid, landed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions to the U.S. price, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, foreign brokerage, marine insurance, ocean freight, U.S. brokerage, U.S. duties, and rebates. No commissions were paid to unrelated distributors in the United States or home market, and we do not have an appropriate benchmark against which to test whether the commission arrangements between Interfit and its related party are at arm's length. Therefore, we did not make an adjustment for commissions claimed by Interfit that were paid to its U.S. subsidiary for various charges incurred in selling the subject merchandise. ( See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Coated Groundwood Paper from Belgium, Finland, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, 56 FR 56359, November 4, 1992.) Foreign Market Value In order to determine whether Interfit had a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. On this basis, we determined that the home market was viable. For purposes of calculating FMV, we used reported CV for products sold by Interfit in the United States during the POI. Cost of Production Interfit provided incomplete and inappropriate cost data for home market sales. Specifically, Interfit did not provide COP information for all comparison models sold in France during the POI. Furthermore, Interfit provided transfer prices for the main input into its pipe fittings. As this input was purchased from related parties, it is the Department's practice to use the cost of producing the input, rather than the transfer price. See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from Venezuela (58 FR 27522; 1993). Finally, the costs reported by Interfit did not reflect the specific time period requested by the Department. Accordingly, we do not have the information necessary to make a determination whether Interfit's home market sales are being sold below the COP. In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act as best information available (``BIA'') we have determined that all sales in the home market were made at less than the COP and, in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we have based foreign market value on CV. Constructed Value We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. packing costs and profit. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act, we (1) included the greater of Interfit's reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the COM, as appropriate, and (2) used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses for profit. For comparisons to CV, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for differences in credit expenses between the two markets, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). In calculating U.S. credit expense, we used the rate respondent reported at which it could borrow in U.S. dollars during the POI. (For further discussions regarding the Department's treatment of credit in this investigation, please see September 26, 1994, Memorandum to Susan G. Esserman from Barbara R. Stafford on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the Department of Commerce.) We have not made a deduction for the direct selling expenses reported by respondent. We have determined that these expenses (product liability premiums and inventory carrying costs) are, in fact, indirect selling expenses. Because of the deficiencies in the cost data described above, we are requesting further information from Interfit. We also intend to verify that the prices paid by Interfit to its related suppliers are, in fact, at arms-length. The CV data originally provided by Interfit did not cover all of the models sold by the company in the United States during the POI. On September 23, 1994, Interfit supplied the CV data for the remaining models. Because this information was not received in time to be used in this preliminary determination, we have used BIA for sales involving these models. As BIA, we have imputed the highest non-aberrational margin calculated from the CV information that Interfit submitted on September 6, 1994. ( See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products and Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from the Netherlands , 58 FR 37199; July 9, 1993). In our final determination, we intend to use all the CV data submitted by Interfit so long as it can be verified. Currency Conversion We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Critical Circumstances Petitioner alleges that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of the subject merchandise from France. Section 733(e)(1) of the Act provides that the Department will determine that critical circumstances exist if:
