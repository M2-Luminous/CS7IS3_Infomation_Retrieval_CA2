In a statement received in Cyprus, the Iraqi National Congress (INC), an alliance of opposition groups, said the blasts occurred early Tuesday outside an army headquarters, a state-run oil company building and near a giant portrait of President Saddam Husayn painted on a wall. The INC is based in Salah al-Din, in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. Karkuk, an important oil city with nearly one million inhabitants, is near the Kurdish-held areas.
