Moscow and Tbilisi Sign Good-Neighbor Treaty"] [Text] On Thursday morning the Russian Federation president arrived in Tbilisi, where he is expected to sign a wide-ranging treaty with Georgia. In addition it is planned to sign a whole series of documents, including agreements on the status and conditions of the presence of Russian border troops in Georgia and a free-trade agreement between the two countries. According to Andrey Kozyrev, a centerpiece of the Tbilisi talks will be the problem of conflict settlement in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The friendship treaty between the Russian Federation and Georgia would not be different from other documents of such type were it not for two articles in the text that make it sound more like a military-political agreement. What is at issue in the first place is Article 3, which stipulates that Moscow and Tbilisi "conclude an agreement on providing assistance in organizing the armed forces of the Republic of Georgia; equipping them and procuring armaments, military hardware, and technology without the right to transfer them to third persons other than upon consent of the Russian Federation." Under Article 4, Russia and Georgia undertake to "take measures to stop attempts to use their territories to create subversive groups" and also to prevent "the infiltration into the territory of the other side of formations planning to overthrow or to change its constitutional order or to violate its territorial integrity." In light of the above two articles, Eduard Shevardnadze's recent statements that the thaw in Georgian-Russian relations is not to the Abkhazian leaders' advantage because it robs them of "a base for separatism" is becoming more understandable. In fact, that section of the treaty is clearly pro-Georgian or anti-Abkhazian, which is actually the same thing. To all appearances, it will be difficult to have the treaty ratified in the Federal Assembly. At any rate, yesterday the leaders of the agrarians, communists, "Russia's Choice," and "Yabloko" signaled their negative attitude to its current phrasing. As for President Yeltsin's immediate entourage, the greatest doubts were raised by the very idea of a head of the Russian state's paying a visit to Georgia. An authoritative presidential adviser said that the visit was supported only by Andrey Kozyrev. The other day Mr. Yeltsin had to learn a whole series of openly critical opinions from his consultants on international problems. In particular, although the duration of the visit was reduced to one day instead of two, its itinerary still included a meeting with representatives of the Georgian intelligentsia. In the view of presidential experts, Tbilisi's intellectuals have an extremely disapproving view of Eduard Shevardnadze, who will, naturally, accompany his Russian counterpart to the meeting. That same presidential adviser told SEGODNYA that "what is at issue is not whether the meeting will be conclusive and fruitful, but whether we will be able to avoid incidents." The problem of possible "incidents" was considered among the most serious ones during the preparation for the visit. An advance team of the Kremlin security service, which traveled to Tbilisi a few days ago "to study the situation on the ground," presented a detailed report to their patron, a reliable source said. The report concluded that going to the Georgian capital was simply impermissible given the degree of the spread of the most diverse firearms left from the time of the Abkhazian war. Boris Yeltsin, however, ignored the opinion of his own bodyguards. Georgian special services, too, have been taking emergency security measures on the eve of the visit. According to news agencies, the operations to protect and to keep track of the Russian president's route will involve 5,000 policemen and around 300 officers of the Georgian Security Ministry.
