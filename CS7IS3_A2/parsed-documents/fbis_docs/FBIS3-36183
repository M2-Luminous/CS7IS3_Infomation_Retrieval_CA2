He and Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze will first meet privately and are to join their delegations later, Yeltsin's press office told Interfax. The two countries are expected to sign about 20 agreements including an outline friendship and cooperation treaty. Others deal with trade and economic cooperation for 1994, free trade and the status of Russian border guards deployed in Georgia. Yeltsin and Shevardnadze are scheduled to hold a joint news conference afterwards. The Russian leader is due to fly back to Moscow at 21:00 local time. The framework agreement binds Russia and Georgia to build their relations as two friendly nations and to stay out of any blocs or alliances spearheaded *against each other. It also provides for a mechanism of consultations and subsequent measures to remove any threat to each other's interests or security. Experts say parts of the treaty dealing with legal and property matters are designed to help ease the process as much as possible. The two sides are committed to working out a package of measures to regulate migration and travelling. Russia and Georgia are also determined to promote economic cooperation by helping towards the formation of markets in the Black Sea region and Europe and a common economic area. The treaty enshrines the two sides' desire for cooperation in certain areas of the economy, science and technology. It also provides for mutual responsibility for a free flow of oil and gas and unimpeded passenger and freight traffic through each other's territory. The two countries are expected to promote closer cooperation in space research, personnel training and so on. The 10-year agreement is to be extended automatically unless one of the sides wishes to break it off upon its expiration.
