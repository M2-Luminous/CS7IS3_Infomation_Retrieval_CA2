The YSP circles' proposal, which reflects the depth of the crisis the united Yemeni state is experiencing, comes while circles close to the YSP have begun to believe that "the dialogue through the barrel of a gun" which began 21 February has made the federation proposal appear to have been overtaken by events. In Cairo, Shaykh Sinan Abu-Lahhum, member of the Yemeni Consultative Council and member of the Political Forces Dialogue Committee -- who had issued a joint statement with Brigadier Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, deputy prime minister, warning of secession in Yemen -- urged Yemeni leaders to abandon their differences and achieve reconciliation. He warned of the possibility of Yemen turning into a new Somalia and the south separating from the north. He said: "That would not solve the problem, but, rather, would bring ruin to the country." Abu-Lahhum attributed King Husayn's failure to achieve reconciliation to "Yemeni leaders' intransigence and failure to apply reason and reach an understanding." He described what is happening as "madness and a frightening nightmare." He expressed his fear that "the gap among Yemenis might widen and result in undermining national unity." Following a meeting with Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the Arab League, yesterday, he said: "The League is making extensive endeavors to secure a way out of the current crisis. This is in addition to numerous Arab mediations." He noted that he is going to meet with President Husni Mubarak "to ask him to intensify Egyptian efforts and reinforce Egypt's role in ending Yemeni disputes." He denied that he had asked the secretary general to dispatch a Arab force to disengage northern and southern forces. He stressed that what Yemen needs is living consciences, not forces. "And mediations do not require military forces, but sincere intentions." He said that recent military clashes "have left a deep wound in Yemeni hearts." He pointed out that the "cause of the deterioration in conditions is officials' failure to implement the Pledge and Accord Document signed in the Jordanian capital recently." In Sanaa, political and military sources spoke yesterday about the Yemeni-Jordanian-Omani committee's failure to complete the process of withdrawing military units from what used to be known as the "fringes" area before unity, and to return these units to their positions before the current crisis, which began on 19 August last year.
