In the report, Foreign Minister Alois Mock mentions the difficulties that Austria would be facing if it were forced to "go it alone" as far as European policies are concerned. Mock also tries to dispel fears that the Austria's foreign policy has narrowed in scope because of its orientation toward the EU, referring to Austria's participation in the Council of Europe and the European Free Trade Association, as well as to its commitment to the CSCE and the United Nations. Mock noted a particular focus on human rights. The report deals extensively with the United Nations and the Council of Europe. The country's commitment to the Council of Europe shows that, for Austria, European policies are not identical with the EU. Generally, the report assesses the Council of Europe as a catalyzer for the process of European unification. In 1993, too, the cruel war in the former Yugoslavia was the darkest chapter in Austria's foreign policy, according to Mock. "Our most important concern was to prevent efforts aimed at the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina," he stressed. The foreign minister expressed satisfaction at the creation of safety zones, which Austria has demanded for a long time. The foreign policy report explains the need for European integration with the argument that internal and external security can neither be ensured at the national level nor achieved against each other. The future Europe must share common values and a common political culture. For Austria, the EU is the center of the new Europe. Referring to the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mock stated that Austria is working from the premise that participation in the common foreign and security policy is compatible with its constitution. Legal amendments will be required as a result of Austria's entry into the EU. However, this does not entail any obligation to participate in wars or to join military alliances. Commenting on the Western European Union (WEU), the report stresses that it should be expanded as an instrument to strengthen NATO's European pillar. In this context, the report refers to current cooperation with regard to the embargo against Serbia. After entry into the EU, Austria wants to apply for the status of "observer" with the WEU.
