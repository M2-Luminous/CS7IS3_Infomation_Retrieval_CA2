At a meeting of the Protestant Academy in Bad Boll, Bubis said on Sunday [20 February]: "Throwing fire bombs into asylum-seekers' hostels is just as terrible as assassinating Hanns-Martin Schleyer." He does not understand why the state does not act against violent rightist organizations just as it acted against the terrorist Red Army Faction (RAF) in the past, which killed the president of the employers' association. In Bubis' view, the problem of rightist violence has been played down in Germany far too long. Despite a dangerous interconnection of the right-wing extremist scene, politicians still speak of individual perpetrators and people who are just running along. Addressing approximately 1,000 conference participants, Bubis came out against special laws and a tightening of the penal code: "The existing instruments are absolutely sufficient." However, the judiciary must not orient itself primarily "at the lower limit" in meting punishment for rightist acts of violence. Baden-Wuerttemberg Interior Minister Frieder Birzele (Social Democratic Party of Germany) also criticized the many cases of incomprehensibly mild punishment. Birzele thinks the danger to society posed by right-wing extremists is far greater than the threat that has emanated from leftist groups. With 400-500 right-wing extremists who are ready for violence in Baden-Wuerttemberg alone, the circle of potential perpetrators is far larger than it ever was in the case of the RAF.
