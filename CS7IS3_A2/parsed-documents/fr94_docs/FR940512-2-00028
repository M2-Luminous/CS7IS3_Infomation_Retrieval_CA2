FR940512-2-00028 FR940512-2-00018 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Project No. 2306] Citizens Utilities Companies; Intention To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement May 6, 1994. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for a new license for the Clyde River hydropower project, FERC No. 2306. The hydropower project is located on the Clyde River in Vermont. The FERC staff has determined that licensing this project would constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric project in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff's EIS will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis. A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all the interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision. Scoping The FERC staff prepared a scoping document (Scoping Document 1) and held a scoping meeting on March 9, 1994, in Newport, Vermont, to assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed. The results of scoping indicated that an EIS should be prepared for this project rather than an Environmental Assessment as staff had initially anticipated. A revised scoping document (Scoping Document 2) will be prepared and distributed by mail to parties on the FERC service list and mailing list. Scoping document 2 will reflect input received at the scoping meeting and comments on Scoping Document 1, and explain why staff determined that an EIS should be prepared.
