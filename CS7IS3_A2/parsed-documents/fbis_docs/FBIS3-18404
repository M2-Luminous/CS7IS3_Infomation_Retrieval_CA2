Tino Zava reports. [Tino Zava, voice over video] NATO is not a rusty machine -- on the contrary, it is an organization capable of acting with great timeliness and efficiency. According to Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri, this is demonstrated by what happened in Bosnia yesterday, where NATO and the United Nations had much of their credibility at stake. He said that the incident at Banja Luka was sad but inevitable. [passage omitted] Is there any possibility of reprisals against Italy, where the U.S. F-16's set out from? Fabbri promised that we would monitor the situation closely. [Fabbri] The protective shield created by NATO is able to warn us of any movement from that territory that might constitute a threat against our territory. [Zava] Fabbri praised Russia's stance over the Banja Luka incident, and then spoke about Italy's new defense plan. There will be more fighter planes rather than missiles.
