This was announced yesterday by Social Democratic Populist Party [SHP] leader Murat Karayalcin during an Assembly group meeting in Ankara. According to Karayalcin, the TL330.7 trillion will be derived thusly: TL70 trillion from tax reforms, TL204 trillion from increases, and TL58.1 trillion from other reforms. By "other reforms," Karayalcin stated he means the elimination of the nonproductive work sector, collection of back taxes, and avoidance of penalties. Karayalcin described the distribution of the total cost to the public sectors as follows: (a) wage and salaried sector (7.2 million people) 27.5 percent (TL91.1 trillion); (b) agricultural sector (8.5 million people) 14.2 percent (TL47.1 trillion); and (c) capital sector (8 million people) 58.2 percent (TL192.5 trillion). The breakdown of the wage and salaried sector cost is as follows: (a) TL16.6 trillion from tax reforms; (b) TL54.9 trillion from increases; (c) TL19.6 trillion from other reforms. The breakdown of the agricultural sector cost is as follows: (a) TL3.1 trillion from taxes; (b) TL38.9 trillion from increases; (c) TL7.1 trillion from other reforms. The breakdown of the capital sector is as follows: (a) TL90.3 trillion from taxes; (b) TL112.8 trillion from increases; (c) TL29.4 trillion from other reforms. Karayalcin noted the following concerning the Council of Ministers' new TL70 trillion tax reform package issued the previous day: (a) additional tax revenues TL13.9 trillion; (b) additional enterprise taxes TL10.1 trillion; (c) net tax credits TL29-30 trillion. Karayalcin said that the Council of Ministers had adopted the principle of deriving taxes not just from transportation, real estate, and other taxables, but also from transfers, whichever was higher. He described the distribution of the burden among the various sectors as unequal, but he said that the inequality was targeted not at any participating sector but at capital in general. Karayalcin thanked Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz and Democratic Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit for supporting the Stabilization Program, and he asked for the support of his own Assembly group in order to get the tax reform package through the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TBMM]. He also stressed the need for quick approval of the Radio and Television bill currently on the Assembly's agenda. Karayalcin further stated that the state enterprise closings will only take effect at the end of the year. Since there is no decision on firing workers, it is possible that only those who work at nonprofitable enterprises will lose their jobs. Karayalcin stressed that the government's first priority is to find ways to return these enterprises to profitability. Noting that at Zonguldak those working above the ground outnumber those working in the mines, Karayalcin said that efforts are being expedited to create new jobs for 21,000 people in the region.
