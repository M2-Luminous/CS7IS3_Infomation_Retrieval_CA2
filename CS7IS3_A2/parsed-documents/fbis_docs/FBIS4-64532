The talks with President Martti Ahtisaari, Prime Minister Esko Aho, and Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto raised issues concerning world politics, relations between China and Finland, and human rights in China. Matti Vaeisaenen reports. [Vaeisaenen] The treatment of Chinese dissidents -- oppression, harassment, detention, and arrests -- has aroused opposition from western governments toward the political leadership in China. Finland's line has been -- as shown during Prime Minister Esko Aho's visit to China a month ago -- that human rights are talked about but no big fuss is made about them, and an attempt is made to influence Chinese politics in a discreet fashion. In this sense the talks with Li Ruihuan were not very different. Both President Martti Ahtisaari and Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto raised the matter of human rights. Departmental head Jaakko Laajava from the Foreign Ministry said that Haavisto expressed Finland's basic views. [passage omitted] Li justified the events in Tiananmen Square five years ago with the explanation that chaos caused by some activists was threatening the country at the time. If the matter had not been dealt with, that is if the opposition, which was known as the democracy movement in the West, had not been crushed by armed force, China might have gone the way the Soviet Union went -- disintegration, Li Ruihuan said. The Chinese guest reiterated one of the main principles of Chinese politics, that it does not interfere in the affairs of other countries and it does not allow others to interfere in its affairs. This includes human rights; according to China, taking care of human rights is entirely an internal matter. Li Ruihuan explained to the Finnish leaders the basic principles and achievements of the economic and political reform process in China. The rapid pace of developing economic relations between Finland and China was mentioned in this connection. Finland and China agree that Russia is an important factor internationally and it must not be isolated. In the dispute on the Korean peninsula China attempts to keep the peninsula nuclear free by peaceful means. Li warned that China's influence is not limitless, and overly high expectations should not be attached to China's influence.
