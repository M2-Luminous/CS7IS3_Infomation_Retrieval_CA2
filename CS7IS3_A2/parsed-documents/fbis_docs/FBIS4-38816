"However, it may so happen that by that time the legislations of our states will become so different from one another that a good deal of effort would have to be made to bring them closer together again," Rybkin said. In view of this, "it is essential to seek cooperation in the lawmaking process within the CIS framework so that the legislations of our states would be adequate to one another as much is possible", pointed out the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament.
