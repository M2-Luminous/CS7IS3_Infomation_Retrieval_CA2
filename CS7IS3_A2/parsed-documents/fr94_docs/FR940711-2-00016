FR940711-2-00016 FR940711-2-00007 [Docket No. 940675&hyph;4175] RIN 0693&hyph;AB33 Proposed Revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180, Secure Hash Standard AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce. ACTION: Notice; Request for comments. SUMMARY: A revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180, Secure Hash Standard (SHS), is being proposed. This proposed revision corrects a technical flaw that made the standard less secure than had been thought. The algorithm is still reliable as a security mechanism, but the correction returns the SHS to the original level of security. The SHS produces a 160-bit output called a message digest for a message of any size. This message digest can be used with FIPS 186, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), to compute a signature for the message. The same message digest should be obtained by the verifier of the signature when the received version of the message is used as input to the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). Any change to the message in transmit should produce a different message digest, indicating to the verifier that a change has been made to the message. The purpose of this notice is to solicit views from the public, manufacturers, and Federal, state, and local government users prior to submission of this proposed revision to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval. The proposed revision contains two sections: (1) An announcement, which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) specifications which deal with the technical aspects of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interest parties may obtain copies of the specifications section from the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building, Room B&hyph;64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;2816. DATES: Comments on this proposed revision must be received on or before October 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning the proposed revision should be sent to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: Proposed Revision of FIPS 180, SHS, Technology Building, Room B&hyph;154, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 Written comments received in response to this notice will be made part of the public record and will be made available for inspection and copying in the Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW., Washington, DC 20230. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Miles Smid, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;2938. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NIST has been notified that Department of Defense authorities have approved the use of the SHS with the DSS to sign unclassified data processed by ``Warner Amendment'' systems (10 U.S.C. 2315 and 44 U.S.C. 3502(2)) as well as classified data in selected applications. Dated: July 5, 1994. Samuel Kramer, Associate Director.
