Fortebraccio, the legendary L'UNITA commentator, dubbed La Malfa senior "the Fernet [Branca, bitter digestive drink] of Italian politics." A caustic, brilliant, prophetic, impenitent, suspicious, and rather bothersome nonconfessional -- more than a Fernet, rather a drop of Angostura bitters that made the very indigestible cocktail of the First Republic less impossible to drink. The old man led a force that was numerically insignificant but of noble quality, using his huge personal charisma. Giorgio La Malfa resembles his father physically, but lacks his stature. Recent judicial developments have damaged his political image, without harming his personal image of unquestionable honesty. His return from a year's exile, spent partly in Rome and partly at his seaside house at Capalbio, was not exactly a major event. His decision to transfer to the center of Italian Popular Party [PPI] Secretary Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni split the Italian Republican Party [PRI], which is now clinging to Occhetto's Democratic Party of the Left [PDS], with the little party's "grands bourgeois," from Visentini to Ayala, in the role of the progressive front's elders. [Segantini] You declared total war on your friends who sided with the progressive forces. And now you find yourself alone at the helm. [La Malfa] I am not waging war on anyone. I merely asked the national court of arbitration to rule on a matter of discipline. A party's orientation is binding on everyone. When some members, however authoritative, decide otherwise, the secretary has no choice but to report a possible violation. [Segantini] But how did this split come about? [La Malfa] We proceeded from a shared analysis but reached different conclusions. The starting point was anxiety over the growth and danger of the right in Italy, which both I and Visentini consider a very major threat. But although this is our diagnosis, it does not make sense to force center political forces to adopt a left-wing stance, casting them into the embrace of the PDS, Communist Renewal, or the Rete. [Segantini] In what way is the right dangerous, in view of the fact that not even [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema is worried about it? On the one hand, we have two forces citing liberal-democratic values, albeit differently -- the Northern League and Forza Italia. On the other hand, we have an alliance -- i.e., [leader of the National Alliance and secretary of the Italian Social Movement, MSI] Fini's -- that declares itself to be closer to [French Rally for the Republic leader] Chirac than to [French National Front leader] Le Pen. What does this mean? [La Malfa] Of the three right-wing components, the one with which I would like to succeed in conducting a dialogue is the Northern League. Leaving aside his language, which I do not like, I did establish political relations with [Northern League Secretary] Bossi at a time when no one wanted to have anything to do with him. And I have never changed my opinion -- that the League represents a liberal protest in a country that very much needs it. Both its appeal for decentralization and its appeal for a protest against the tax system are legitimate and just forms of protest against an excessively oppressive state. [Segantini] What about the National Alliance? [La Malfa] I have formed a negative assessment of it. It has made no real revision of the past. Fini has merely said that fascism is dead. But that coroner's report is not enough. [Segantini] Unless I am mistaken, you do not seem equally strict in putting Occhetto to the democratic test. [La Malfa] That is different. Occhetto has behind him a lengthy process of deliberation which began with [former Communist Party leader] Berlinguer, the split that produced Communist Renewal, and a clear verdict on the harm done by communism in the Soviet Union. These assessments clearly condemn the communist phenomenon... [Segantini] But it would have been very difficult not to express those assessments. [La Malfa] Yes, yes, of course, and indeed that explains my cautiousness in my relations with the left. But if I am assessing democratic reliability, the PDS has no problems from this viewpoint. The real trouble with the PDS is its doubtful ability to govern a Western country in such a way as to encourage the market forces. [Segantini] But in the event of a victory by the right, do you really think that the National Alliance will have a major role to play? [La Malfa] Well, this is the crucial issue in the election debate. Both Occhetto and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, but above all Bossi, are giving us to understand that they had to form electoral alliances with groups with which they disagree politically, that is, the communists and fascists. They imply that after the elections these latter forces will go into opposition. My question is this: With whom will you form a majority, the majority that would enable you to consign them to the opposition? [Segantini] And so? [La Malfa] Both moderate components of the two alignments presuppose the existence of a center; they need an interlocutor. But unless there is a center, a third stance that will permit the division of the two electoral alignments and the orientation of the extremes in the opposition, Italy will have a Fini or [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti government. So we risk having as prime minister representatives of an old communist tradition that would prompt an outflow of capital or a right that would be dangerous because of domestic or international consequences. [Segantini] What is dangerous about Forza Italia? Are they subversive, too? [La Malfa] Berlusconi is the proof that everyone should deal with their own business. [Segantini] Let the voters decide... [La Malfa] I am sure that his entry into politics will increase Italy's problems rather than resolve them. This, because the left- right polarization is a good thing, but only if it does not cause the extremes to prevail. [Segantini] But Forza Italia's proposals seem a long way from any kind of extremism. [La Malfa] The fiscal part is demagogic, and the rest is characterized by common sense. The problem is a political one: If Berlusconi had formed his alliance with the League and isolated the MSI on the right, that would indeed have made sense. [Segantini] But if the center does emerge strong from the elections, with whom will you ally? [La Malfa] Look, with the first-past-the-post system, this question cannot be answered. Under the new rules, the aim is to achieve an absolute majority. If none of the groupings achieves a majority, the president will probably establish a provisional government with the task of completing the transformation of the electoral mechanism. [Segantini] That is, a short-lived government with an institutional mission. [La Malfa] It would, however, have a limitation -- the same one that affected the Ciampi government. Namely, that a government without a real majority cannot engage in politics. [Segantini] Could you see [Senate speaker] Spadolini performing such a task? [La Malfa] I find it embarrassing to say so, since he is a member of my party, but obviously I would be pleased. [Segantini] Is it true that [Fiat President] Mr. Agnelli's position influenced your decision to opt for the center? [La Malfa] I have not met with Mr. Agnelli for several months. Be that as it may, I hope that this political orientation will be appreciated by the sector of the business world that pays most attention to the other Western countries' assessments of us. [Segantini] What is your opinion of Italy's major entrepreneurs? [La Malfa] Italy's tragedy is that we have no major industry. This is because the Catholic world and the left, and sometimes even the League, are opposed to big business; they regard it as harmful in some way. Growing up in an unfavorable environment, our industries have faced greater difficulties than their foreign competitors. [Segantini] Do you not think that the various Agnellis and De Benedettis have also made mistakes in the management of their enterprises, despite the major aid received from the state? [La Malfa] Well, if they have made mistakes, they are now starting to pay for them too. Look at the Feruzzis: Their sad fate is a punishment decreed by the market. And they are not the only ones. Things have changed for Fiat too, with the latest increase in capital, albeit rather neatly: The family's influence has diminished in favor of that of the banks. [Segantini] But you are now in danger of proving to be your own party's liquidator. [La Malfa] You have no idea of the efforts that I made to persuade Visentini, Gualtieri, and Giovanni Ferrara not to break our unity. But it was all in vain. [Segantini] Are you not afraid of being sidelined by a Martinazzoli-Occhetto axis? [La Malfa] As I have already said, I believe that the next legislature will be a brief one, devoted to completing the electoral reform. After that there will be another election. It is to be hoped that something will be done to make the executive more stable, and I am in favor of the direct election of the prime minister. In order to carry out these reforms, it is likely that a government ranging from the League to the PDS will be formed.
