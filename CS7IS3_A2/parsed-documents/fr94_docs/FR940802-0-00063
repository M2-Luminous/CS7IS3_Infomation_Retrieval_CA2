(2) The requirements of this paragraph (f) shall apply in addition to the recordkeeping requirements specified in §80.74(e). (g) Reporting requirements. (1) Any refiner for each refinery, or any importer, shall for each batch of reformulated gasoline and RBOB include in the quarterly reports for reformulated gasoline required by §80.75(a) the total weight percent oxygen and the weight percent oxygen attributable to renewable oxygenate contained in the gasoline, or contained in the RBOB subsequent to oxygenate blending if allowed under paragraph (c) of this section. (2) Any refiner for each refinery, or any importer, shall submit to the Administrator, with the fourth quarterly report required by §80.75(a), a report for all reformulated gasoline and RBOB that was produced or imported during the previous calendar year averaging period, that includes the following information: (i) The total volume of reformulated gasoline and RBOB; (ii) The compliance total for renewable oxygen; (iii) The actual total for renewable oxygen; (iv) The number of renewable oxygen credits generated as a result of actual total renewable oxygen being greater than compliance total renewable oxygen; (v) The number of renewable oxygen credits required as a result of actual total renewable oxygen being less than compliance total renewable oxygen; (vi) The number of renewable oxygen credits transferred to another refinery or importer; (vii) The number of renewable oxygen credits obtained from another refinery or importer; and (viii) For any renewable oxygen credits that are transferred from or to another refinery or importer, for any such transfer: (A) The names, EPA-assigned registration numbers and facility identification numbers of the transferor and transferee of the credits; (B) The number of renewable oxygen credits that were transferred; and (C) The date of the transaction. (h) Renewable oxygenate requirements for reformulated gasoline used in the State of California. (1) Any refiner or importer of California gasoline, as defined in §80.81, shall meet the renewable oxygenate standard specified in paragraph (a) of this section for all reformulated gasoline or RBOB used in any reformulated gasoline covered area as specified in §80.70. (2) Any California gasoline shall be presumed to be used in a reformulated gasoline covered area: (i) (A) If the gasoline is produced at a refinery that is located within a reformulated gasoline covered area; or (B) If the gasoline is transported to a facility that is located within a reformulated gasoline covered area, or to a facility from which gasoline is transported by truck into a reformulated gasoline covered area; unless (ii) The refiner or importer is able to establish with documentation that the gasoline was used outside any reformulated gasoline covered area. (3) Any California gasoline shall be considered to be designated as VOC-controlled (for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section) if the Reid vapor pressure of the gasoline, or RBOB subsequent to oxygenate blending, is intended to meet a standard of: (i) 7.8 psi or less in the case of gasoline intended for use before March 1, 1996; or
