Viewpoints are at times diametrically opposed. So what is really happening? The mechanism for merging the two countries' monetary systems has been elaborated and agreed over the last three months. The commission working on these problems succeeded in making fairly good progress. Agreements were reached on many contentious issues, and a version of the treaty was proposed by the Russian side. However, when agreeing it with experts from Belorussia it proved impossible to surmount differences of opinion on four fundamental provisions. The first contentious issue concerns the exchange rate of Belorussian bank notes against Russian rubles. The Russian side believes that revaluation should be implemented according to the average value of the purchasing power parity of both countries' currencies and their market cross rate against the U.S. dollar. It is proposed that this rate be applied both for the exchange of cash and the revaluation of other monetary assets. The Belorussian side, however, proposes using a recalculation rate based on the purchasing power parity of bank notes. It is proposed that funds held by the population in savings and current bank accounts be revalued at a rate of one to one, but subject to a six-month delay before these funds can be withdrawn (until the complete withdrawal of Belorussian currency from cash circulation). Prices for deliveries of products between both countries' economic organizations constitute the next highly significant point of divergence. Russian experts propose a gradual reduction of export duties (starting with 30 percent) with commitments from Belorussia not to levy payment for the transit of Russian cargoes across its territory, or rental payment for Russian military facilities. The Belorussian side, however, proposes to abolish all reciprocal export duties and switch to domestic Russian prices for energy sources in mutual settlements as of the date of the monetary systems' unification. It is assumed that, in doing so, Russia's losses from lowering prices for energy sources will be offset by cuts in expenditure on transit and the lack of outlay on patrolling its Western border and of expenditure on the upkeep of military facilities. Moreover, lowering prices for energy sources will make it possible to cut the level of production costs for Belorussian output and thus reduce its end price for Russian consumers. The other two points of divergence are largely political. Since the unification of monetary systems presupposes unification of both the budgetary and the banking systems, the Russian side is insisting that this process be completed as quickly as possible (by the beginning of 1995). But as regards the budget, Belorussia is prepared merely to create the preconditions for its consolidation by the end of 1994. In order to merge the banking systems, Russia proposes to reorganize the National Bank of Belorussia as a branch of the Central Bank of Russia, transferring to the latter all assets and liabilities and extending to Belorussian territory the effect of Russian laws in this sphere, by the end of this year. Belorussia, however, is insisting on preserving the status of its National Bank while significantly curbing its functions. It seems that the current status of talks on the unification of the two countries' monetary systems offers opportunities to seek a compromise in solving the aforementioned problems. In particular, the adoption of Belorussia's proposal to exchange the population's savings at a rate of one to one could be quite painless from the point of view of consequences for Russia's economy. The sum total of the monetary accumulations of this republic's population converted in its entirety into Russian rubles represents a quantity which is not significant enough to substantially affect the unified system's total amount of money in circulation. Moreover, this option for exchanging the population's savings provides for the freezing of deposits throughout the period of exchanging bank notes. As for equalizing prices for reciprocal deliveries of products and abolishing export duties, then here, obviously, we ought to proceed from the premise that monetary union is the highest stage of economic integration. It must, undoubtedly, be preceded by the creation of a customs union with the abolition of reciprocal duties and nontariff restrictions, a common market with the abolition of obstacles to the movement of goods, capital, and labor, and an economic union involving, in addition to everything listed above, a high degree of coordination in economic policy. Only when these stages of integration have been traversed will it be possible to talk about creating a monetary union. In this connection, the Russian side's unwillingness to opt for the complete abolition of duties for imported goods means a restriction on implementing the first stage of integration -- the creation of a customs union. Furthermore, the Russian side is taking into account of current losses from deliveries of fuel at domestic prices, while taking no account of the possible gain (and not only economic gain) in the long term. And even the Belorussian side's arguments, substantiating compensation for lost profits, should be taken into account. After all, in the event of failure to sign the agreement on monetary union, Russia will have to set up a real border with Belorussia and a corresponding infrastructure in order to ensure effectively protect its economic interests. Apart from all else, Belorussia may introduce stringent customs duties for the transit of Russian cargoes across its territory, as well as demanding compensation for expenditure on the upkeep of Russian military facilities. All this together is quite comparable with that which Russia is losing on deliveries to Belorussia of energy sources at domestic prices. But the fate of the agreement in question depends on how far the sides are ready to go toward mutual concessions. What that agreement may give to both sides, and not only in the economic sense, has already been discussed on many occasions. But unfortunately, it seems that in this issue, as in all the economic processes under way in the CIS, it is not economic expediency which prevails when implementing specific actions, but political considerations. [Shirobokova ends] ...And Meanwhile The results of the latest stage in the talks on the unification of the monetary systems have been perceived ambiguously in Belorussia. National Bank Chairman S. Bogdankevich, for instance, stated: "I have no more illusions. It must be admitted that the 8 September treaty is not viable, it has not been accepted by the Russian side." Some of the republic's political forces have also been quick to exploit this for their propoganda ends. Thus, a statement by the Belorussian Association of Servicemen, recently abolished by decision of the Supreme Court but re-created in the form of an organizational council, sharply criticized the government for its desire to unify the monetary systems of Belorussia and Russia. And it issued an unequivocal warning: "We know the names of those who are campaigning to destroy the political autonomy of Belorussia, and we consider it our moral duty to warn these people." Nevertheless, the republic leaders' views on the unification of the monetary systems have not altered. And this, obviously, is primarily attributable to the state of the economy. According to data from the Belorussian State Committee for Statistics, its national income in the first two months of this year, compared with January-February last year, fell by 33 percent. The volume of industrial output stood at 63.5 percent. Reciprocal indebtedness rose significantly, and large stocks of unsold products have built up. As of 1 March, Belorussian enterprises had stock surpluses worth R2.114 billion. Some 88.9 percent of all outstanding debts comprised debts to Russian enterprises. This is why Belorussian Parliament Head Mechyslaw Hryb expressed concern regarding the prevailing situation since, pending the forthcoming unification, enterprises are standing still and trade is paralyzed. "It is neither to our advantage nor to that of Russia to prolong this issue further. If we cannot work things out, this means that it is necessary to elaborate a new content of the bilateral agreement, a large-scale treaty between the two states," Mechyslaw Hryb stated. In his words, the Supreme Soviet Presidium has already resolved this question: A commission has been set up under the leadership of Supreme Soviet First Deputy Chairman Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, which will work out a new agreement. Vyachaslaw Kebich, head of the Belorussian Government, also believes that the final documents will be signed in the interests of both states. He stressed that he sees the aim of his life as being the actual integration of the economy of two peoples, close in spirit and culture, and in mode of thinking, who want to be together.
