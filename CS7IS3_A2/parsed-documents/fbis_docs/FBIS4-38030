The source said this rebel gang continued its treacherous attacks against units of the Armed Forces on the Aden axis and against the brother citizens and residential quarters in the city. The rebels used naval units and bombarded the positions of the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy from the land and sea. They also intensified air sorties over the Armed Forces camps in al-Haswah, Dar Sa'd, al-Kamathri, Shaykh 'Uthman, and other areas. The source stressed that this gang, which sold itself, its mind, and conscience to the devil, continues its attacks, thinking that this will enable it to arrive at its objective of internationalizing the crisis of the domestic sedition which it flared to serve and execute its failed traitorous scheme against the people and their unity, security, stability.
