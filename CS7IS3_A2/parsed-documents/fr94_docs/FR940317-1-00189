FR940317-1-00189 FR940317-1-00016 The Commission is proposing further to amend Rule 15c2&hyph;12 to require brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers, prior to recommending the purchase or sale of a municipal security, to review the information the issuer of the municipal security has undertaken to provide. This amendment would apply to municipal securities issued on or after the effective date of the proposed amendment discussed in the preceding paragraph. Finally, the proposed amendments would define the term ``significant obligor,'' and amend the definition of the term ``final official statement'' for purposes of Rule 15c2&hyph;12. II. Description of the Proposed Amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 A. Underwriting Requirement One amendment proposed today would add paragraph (b)(5) to Rule 15c2&hyph;12. This paragraph would prohibit a Participating Underwriter from purchasing or selling municipal securities in connection with an Offering, unless the Participating Underwriter has reasonably determined that the issuer or its designated agent has undertaken in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of holders of such municipal securities to provide certain information to a NRMSIR. In using the terms ``purchase'' or ``sale,'' the proposed amendment contemplates that, at such time as the issuer of municipal securities delivers the securities to the Participating Underwriters, the issuer will have undertaken, in a written contract or agreement for the benefit of holders of the municipal securities, to provide information to a NRMSIR. 16 16 A Participating Underwriter would need to receive assurances from the issuer that such undertakings would be made before agreeing to act as an underwriter. With the exception of general obligation bonds, most offerings include a trust indenture which sets forth the undertakings between the issuer and the holders of municipal securities, and thus delineates the bondholders' rights. If there is no trust indenture, as in a general obligation bond offering, a bond resolution, ordinance, or written agreement or contract sets out the undertakings by the issuer for the benefit of the holders of the municipal securities. In order to satisfy its obligation under the rule, a Participating Underwriter would need to look to these documents for undertakings by the issuer to supply secondary market disclosure to a NRMSIR. A Participating Underwriter will have satisfied its obligation under proposed paragraph (b)(5), so long as it can conclude that all of the appropriate undertakings have been made. While the issuer's duty will be to its bondholders, all participants in the municipal securities market will benefit from having access to this information. Comment is requested on the use of a written agreement or contract for the provision of secondary market information by issuers for the benefit of holders of municipal securities, particularly in light of the provisions of proposed paragraph (c) prohibiting the recommendation by brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers of municipal securities when issuer information is unavailable. Comments should address specifically the consequences of a failure by an issuer to comply with its secondary market disclosure undertakings after the initial issuance of municipal securities. Comment is requested on whether the use of the issuer's undertakings is a necessary or appropriate approach to implementing procedures for providing information to the municipal securities market. Comment also is requested on whether, as an alternative to written undertakings, a statement in the final official statement of the issuer of municipal securities that it will provide secondary market disclosure would be sufficient. In addition, commenters are requested to address whether the use of written undertakings provides sufficient flexibility for issuers that, in the future, wish to change the type, timing, or presentation of the information, or whether some alternative mechanism should be used. 1. Annual Information Proposed paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) would prohibit Participating Underwriters from purchasing or selling municipal securities in connection with an Offering unless the Participating Underwriter has reasonably determined that the issuer or its designated agent has undertaken to provide to a NRMSIR, at least annually, current financial information concerning the issuer of the municipal security and any significant obligors, including annual audited financial statements and pertinent operating information. Current annual financial information is an important source of updated information for the market. The format for presenting such information is not specified in the proposed amendment, and may be accomplished through any disclosure document, whatever its form or principal purpose, that includes annual audited financial statements and pertinent operating information. The proposed amendment contemplates that sequential final official statements prepared by frequent issuers of municipal securities may meet the standards of the rule. Similarly, the audited financial statements should fairly present the current financial condition, the results of operations, and cash flows of the municipal issuer and any significant obligor. Proposed paragraph (b)(5) also does not dictate the content of the annual financial information, other than the audited financial statements. Rather, it provides discretion to offering participants. The Commission recognizes that there is great diversity in the municipal marketplace, both in terms of the types of issuers and the types of issues of municipal securities. The proposed amendment is, therefore, intended to permit issuers the flexibility to address the needs of the market by specifying in the written agreement or contract the particular financial and operating information that is to be provided on an annual basis, in addition to the annual audited financial statements. The Commission anticipates that issuers and offering participants will look to various voluntary guidelines, as well as the guidance provided in the Companion Release, in establishing an appropriate level of disclosure for each municipal securities issue. Of course, additional information, such as unaudited quarterly information, also could be specified. Under the proposed amendment, in paragraph (b)(5)(ii), the issuer of the municipal security also would be required to specify what accounting principles will be used in the preparation of the audited financial statements, the time within which the annual information for each year will be available, and the specific operating and financial information that will be provided on an annual basis, in addition to the audited financial statements. The covenant would not limit the issuer in its ability to supplement the specific information, where necessary or appropriate. Proposed paragraph (b)(5)(ii) does not specify the timing of availability of the annual financial information in each year. Rather, any written contract or agreement would be required to specify the annual time frame in which the current financial information covering the previous fiscal year will be provided by the issuer of the municipal security and any significant obligors. As noted above, this permits issuers some flexibility in disseminating this information, and also allows investors and the marketplace to know when such information will be available. Comment is requested on whether the rule should specify the minimum content of the information to be provided on an annual basis. Comment is requested on whether audited financial statements should be required, and whether they should be required to be audited using GAAS. Comment also is requested on whether the financial statements should be required to conform to generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'') or should include discussions of material deviations from GAAP if prepared on some other basis. Further, comment is requested on whether the rule should specify the time frame, such as six months or nine months after the fiscal year end, in which the annual financial information should be made available in each year. 2. Material Events Proposed paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) requires that Participating Underwriters assure themselves that issuers have undertaken to provide, in a timely manner, notice of any of the following events, if material: ( 1 ) Principal and interest payment delinquencies;
