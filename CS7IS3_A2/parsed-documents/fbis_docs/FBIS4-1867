He said: As China and the United States are two big and influential countries, statesmen of the two countries should look toward the future and the 21st century when handling bilateral relations. Li Peng said: China and the United States are very strongly complementary to each other economically [jing ji hu bu xing hen qiang 4842 3444 0062 5943 1840 1771 1730]. The United States has a very strong economic force and leads the world in the fields of high technology and infrastructures, while China enjoys sustained economic growth and has a vast market, rich labor force resource, and fairly strong technical force. There are bright prospects for Sino-U. S. multiform economic and technological cooperation. He said: "We are pleased to see that many large U.S. corporations have recently submitted tenders in China. They are very enthusiastic about participating in China's infrastructures constructions." Li Peng said: If Sino-U.S. relations were to continually improve and develop, this would undoubtedly [wu yi 2477 3992] be very favorable for U.S. enterprises to expand their business in China. At the guest's request, Li Peng gave a briefing on the progress of reform of China's taxation system, policies for attracting foreign funds, the role played by the People's Bank of China as a central bank, and how interest rates are fixed. Vance said he was very pleased to have the opportunity to visit China again. He said he personally saw the tremendous changes in Beijing on his arrival. Vance will revisit Shanghai, where he visited in 1984. He believed there would be even greater development and prosperity over there. Vance said that to his knowledge, President Clinton attaches great importance to establishing a stable and healthy relationship with China. He believed there would be further development of the mutually beneficial Sino-U.S. cooperation in various fields. Li Peng said: The doors leading to China were opened when the Republican Party was in power while diplomatic relations were established under the rule of the Democratic Party. "We have many friends in both parties." Vance said: The United States will work to develop relations with China no matter which party is in power. This is a unanimous point. The meeting was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere. Premier Li Peng's wife Zhu Lin, Mrs Vance, and former U.S. deputy secretary of state Whitehead and his wife were present at the meeting.
