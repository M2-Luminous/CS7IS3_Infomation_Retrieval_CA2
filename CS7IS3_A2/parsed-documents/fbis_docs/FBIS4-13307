He also denied that the question of dialogue was one of the causes of the movement's split from the National Front for the Salvation of Libya [NFSL] at the beginning of the month of Ramadan. He stressed that the movement wanted "a peaceful solution to the Libayn question" but that did not mean "forfeiting our right to use all legitimate means, including force, for the salvation of our country." In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Suwaysi said that the movement's constitutent assembly would be held within months to approve the organizational, ideological, and political structure and to elect a leadership. [passage omitted] Asked about the movement's willingness for dialogue, Suwaysi said: "I say again that when the prerequisites are fulfilled and the principles are clear, especially al-Qadhdhafi's recognition of the patriotic opposition and his expression of willingness to respond to the legitimate national demands of the Libyan people and true recourse to the people.... If all that happens, then it would be another matter. "We want a peaceful solution to the Libyan question, a solution that would spare our country more conflict and bloodshed and spare our people more difficulty, but that certainly does not mean forfeiting our right to struggle and use all legitimate means, including force, for the salvation of our country." [passage omitted] On the question of the Libyan National Army joining the movement and its announcement that it would remain open to all Libyans, and the conflict that that would create with sound organized work, Suwaysi said: "Not at all. There is no conflict. The Libyan National Army is an integral part of the movement and it is open to all Libyans interested in military struggle and not necessarily in joining the ideological and political organization." Asked about the leadership of the new organization, Suwaysi said that "the present leadership is a provisional leadership; we have called it the Constituent Committee and thought it best not to divulge the names of its members, but it consists of the brothers who took the initial practical steps of crystallizing the idea of forming the organization." [passage omitted] On the question of unification of the opposition factions, Suwaysi emphasized that the movement "seeks cooperation and coordination with all patriotic forces and opposition factions to fulfill our people's demands because the current challenge in Libya requires the pooling of the efforts of all patriotic parties, factions, and individuals." [passage omitted] On the question of who finances the new movement, Suwaysi said: "We will rely on the Libyan national capabilities and resources inside and outside the homeland. All the organization's programs and activities will be kept within the limits of the national intrinsic capabilities out of faith in the principle of an independent national will free from foreign and external pressures." [passage omitted] On relations with the United States, Suwaysi believes that "they will be the same as relations with any other state, the sole aim being to serve the national cause without undermining the Libyan people's interests and the independence of national decisionmaking."
