The president of Macedonia will pay his first official visit on April 25-26 this year at the invitation of Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev. "The presidents of Bulgaria and Macedonia will consider the situation in the Balkans after NATO's military intervention in Bosnia Herzegovina and the acceleration of economic ties between Bulgaria and Macedonia," Mr. Spasov said. In his opinion, there is a high degree of agreement between Bulgaria and Macedonia about the problems of all-Balkan policy. Asked about his opinion on the idea of an all-Balkan peace conference, Mr. Spasov stated that the peace conference idea is acceptable for Macedonia, provided all the Balkan countries take part in it. "The Macedonian president will come to Sofia accompanied by the two vice presidents, Jovan Andov and Riste Ivanov," Mr. Spasov said. "As the time for arranging the visit is short, the experts will not be able to prepare the agreements on the encouragement of investments and the avoidance of double taxation for signing at a governmental level," he explained. In Mr. Spasov's view, although the agreement on the construction of a railway line between Bulgaria and Macedonia as part of the East-West trans-Balkan highway will not be signed too, its construction is expected to begin in May and be finished in about a year. There is no railway between Bulgaria and Macedonia, they are connected only by three motor roads. Bulgaria and Macedonia raised their diplomatic relations to the level of embassies in December last year. Until then they had consulates general in Sofia and Skopje respectively. Bulgaria was the first country in the world which recognized Macedonia's independence in February 1992.
