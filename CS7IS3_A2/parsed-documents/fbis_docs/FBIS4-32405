The question of whether or not Romania possesses chemical weapons was raised, she said, during National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca's visit to the United States as a consequence of confusing statements made on Romania's joining the Australia Group for the non-proliferation of the chemical weapons. "We once again reiterate our previous statement and underline once more that Romania is ready to fulfill the conditions for the ban on chemical weapons," the Spokeswoman said. She also pointed out that the Romanian side invited through the Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca a team of U.S. experts to visit all the chemical plants so as to dispel any doubts as to Romania's credibility in this respect. Under the same topic the press was informed that an agreement was signed during Mr. Tinca's U.S. tour, laying the legal foundations of the cooperation between the Romanian and U.S. armies. The agreement outlines the main directions for the development of the military cooperation, the participation in the Partnership for Peace and the assessments on the stability and security in Central and Eastern Europe. Mr. Tinca in his turn imparted on his American colleagues Romania's assessments of the stability in this area, informed them about the reform of the army, the training of the staff and the endowment with modern weaponry and equipment so that Romania's Army could be on a par with NATO standards. Mr. Tinca's opinion, the spokeswoman said, is that the relations between Romania and the United States in the military sphere are good and that there is the willingness to deepen them.
