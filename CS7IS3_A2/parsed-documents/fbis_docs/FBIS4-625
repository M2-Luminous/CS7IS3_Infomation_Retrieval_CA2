The organization brushed aside criticism that the program is too ambitious and said problems of financing would be overcome within the current national budget. Jennifer Wilson reports: [Begin recording] [Wilson] A cut in the defense budget is one way the ANC is proposing to raise the 39 billion rands it says the implementation of the RDP would cost over the first 5 years. [ANC economic affairs spokesman Trevor Manuel] In the current budget defense gets some 10.7 billion, against 1.6 billion for housing. The defense secret account alone is two-and-a-half times larger than the housing budget, at some 3.83 billion rands. That's a contradiction that we can't sustain in our country. If one looks at the combination of the secret account for the current budget and the previous budget, it adds up to more than 8 billion rands. That's about the figure that we're looking for annually for the RDP. [Wilson] Mr. Manuel said he did not foresee having to raise tax levels, but would allocate more revenue to collecting taxes. The ANC says the document has not changed significantly since it was first published. It still promises to provide 1 million houses, electrify 2.5 million houses, and provide 2.5 million jobs over 5 years. [end recording]
