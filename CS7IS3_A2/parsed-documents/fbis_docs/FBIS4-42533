The Ministry said the meeting underlined the attention Paris was paying to the situation in Kosovo, a Serb-administered province but whose population almost exclusively comprises ethnic Albanians. Lamassoure said France favoured a policy of dialogue between communities in the province along with respect for human rights. He added Paris supported internationally-recognised autonomy for Kosovo, which had been repealed by Belgrade in 1989. Rugova told a press conference Thursday he hoped France would back the idea of establishing a United Nations protectorate in Kosovo, in line with a plan he proposed to the world body early last year.
