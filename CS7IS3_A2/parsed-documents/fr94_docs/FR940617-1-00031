FR940617-1-00031 FR940617-1-00012 In the Federal Register of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), FDA published, under ยง330.10(a)(7), a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, based on the recommendations of the Antimicrobial I Panel and the agency's response to comments submitted following publication of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. Interested persons were invited to submit objections or requests for oral hearing by February 6, 1978. In response to numerous requests to extend the time period for submitting objections or requests for oral hearing, the agency issued a notice in the Federal Register of February 3, 1978 (43 FR 4637) granting an extension of the deadline to March 6, 1978. During this time period, the agency received 6 petitions that requested reopening the administrative record and 11 requests for an oral hearing. In a notice published in the Federal Register of March 9, 1979 (44 FR 13041), the agency deferred action on the requests for a hearing, but granted the petitions to reopen the record to allow interested persons to submit comments and any new or additional data by June 7, 1979, and reply comments by July 9, 1979. FDA also stated its intent to publish an updated (amended) tentative final monograph based on the review and evaluation of new submissions and a reevaluation of existing data. In a notice published in the Federal Register of October 26, 1979 (44 FR 61609), the agency again reopened the administrative record for the submission of new data by March 26, 1980, and for comments on the new data by May 27, 1980. This action was taken to permit manufacturers to submit the results of testing to FDA as expeditiously as possible prior to establishment of a final monograph. Subsequent to the June 7, 1979, closing date for the submission of new data, and prior to the October 26, 1979, reopening of the administrative record, data and information were submitted to FDA. In a notice published in the Federal Register of March 21, 1980 (45 FR 18398), the agency advised that it had reopened the administrative record for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products to allow for consideration of data and information that had been filed in the Dockets Management Branch after the date the administrative record on the tentative final monograph had officially closed on March 6, 1978. The agency concluded that any new data and information filed prior to March 21, 1980, should be available to the agency in developing a proposed regulation in the form of a tentative final monograph. In a notice published in the Federal Register on January 5, 1982 (47 FR 436), the agency advised that it had again reopened the administrative record for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products to allow for consideration of the recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Miscellaneous External Drug Products (Miscellaneous External Panel) on mercury-containing drug products. Interested persons were invited to submit comments by April 5, 1982, and reply comments by May 5, 1982. FDA stated that the proceeding to develop a monograph for mercury-containing drug products would be merged with the general proceeding to establish a monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products. In a notice published in the Federal Register on May 21, 1982 (47 FR 22324), the agency advised that it had again reopened the administrative record for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products to allow for consideration of the recommendations of the Miscellaneous External Panel on alcohol drug products. Interested persons were invited to submit comments by August 19, 1982, and reply comments by September 20, 1982. The notice stated that the proceeding to develop a monograph for alcohol drug products would be merged with the general proceeding to establish a monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products.
