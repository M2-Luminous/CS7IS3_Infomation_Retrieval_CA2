One can agree or disagree with the arguments expressed here. However, in order to argue with someone with good reasoning, one must first listen to him attentively. The person with whom we are talking today is Doctor of Economic Sciences Aleksandr Yakovlevich Livshits, professor, director of a group of experts under the RF President. He graduated from the Institute of the National Economy imeni G.V. Plekhanov in the specialized field of economic cybernetics and worked at Moscow State Technological University. He defended his candidate dissertation in the department headed by academician L. Abalkin. He is the author of the first textbook in market economy in Russia. [Pokrovskiy] Aleksandr Yakovlevich, recently, representatives of various parties and scientific schools and trends have published such a large number of economic theories, guesses, and forecasts that it looks as if so-called simple folk, business people, and foreign investors simply have lost their orientation in the ways of Russia's development. However, not long ago the RF President issued a whole package of edicts of an economic nature. Does this mean that, as physicists say, islands of stability, on the basis of which we can move toward an upsurge in Russia's economy, have finally been discovered? [Livshits] I am one of the people who think that we have more than enough programs, if not other things. At least one of them should be fulfilled, instead of inventing new theoretical dreams. I will say right away that the government has a specific program and there is also the president's message. This is quite sufficient for the beginning of purposeful work. I have a very firm impression that, with the exception of very extremist positions--for example, the state is weak, one cannot rely on it, it will lead us to the wrong place, let everything proceed by itself--there is a general understanding of what should be done. Please note: The president's message is devoted to the strengthening of the state. This is its main point. And so, what is to be done? The idea is as follows: To maintain the saturation of the consumer market to the maximum possible degree at tolerable prices. Not to permit sharp jumps here, at the same time, shifting the center of gravity of reforms to production reform. Of what can we boast here? People's economic psychology, including that of boards of directors, has changed noticeably. Enterprise managers now think about demand, although some people, in the old way, try only to extract money from the budget. But a breakthrough did occur. There is voucher privatization and there are a number of other changes. However, production reform is a long and difficult matter and we must deal with it step-by-step. In particular, let us examine the problem of prices. Here my personal point of view does not coincide in everything with my friends' opinion. During these years we have learned the ability to affect inflation rates, if nothing else. In principle, if the task of reducing inflation rates to 2 or 3 percent in 2 months is set, the government knows how to do this technically. However, Russia's industry and Russia's economy will not withstand the methods, by means of which it is possible to bring down inflation so sharply. Yes, all of us want prices of goods not to rise, but this can be achieved only at too high a price. Therefore, I have taken the liberty of saying that there is a dangerously high inflation, but there is also a dangerously low inflation, which will immediately affect production development. [Pokrovskiy] Very likely, this threatens to cause not only a decline in production, but also a rise in unemployment. [Livshits] Yes, it is also necessary to significantly limit state expenditures. Yet many enterprises now live and work at their expense. If these expenditures are cut down completely, enterprises will not withstand this. For now such is our life, whether we like this or not. Therefore, the whole subtle point is to maintain the forecast moderate inflation and to direct all efforts toward production reform. One of the president's key edicts is devoted to reform of state enterprises. I assume that it will be followed by some other edicts. However, their meaning is one--to establish the rights of the state as an owner in a sector where state enterprises operate. In other words, to restore the manageability of enterprises belonging to the state itself. After all, it is obvious that such an enterprise belongs not to the director alone. It is common and cannot serve the interests of one person or groups of people. [Pokrovskiy] Please excuse me, but then what is to be done with conversion into joint stock companies and privatization? [Livshits] There is no contradiction here, because it is only a matter of "public" enterprises. The edict states this precisely: A decision on the establishment of a public plant can be made only with regard to an industrial or an agricultural federal state enterprise, the privatization of which is prohibited by the state program. And so, there can be no questions with the private sector. I will even say more. I think that some time will pass and the word "nationalization" will cease to be abusive. There is no contradiction here and I am by no means an admirer of the planning system. I am simply for a flexible, pragmatic approach to economic development without any "taboos." In normal economies there is both privatization and temporary nationalization with subsequent reprivatization. The point is that in economic policy there is nothing absolutely harmful or absolutely useful. These qualities are determined only by expediency and extent. If during some period privatization is advantageous and useful for Russia, it should be carried out to the extent to which it is useful. If, however, nationalization is needed, this, too, should be done without thinking about some ideological lack of coordination. Such an approach to this matter dominates in the world with benefit for production. I repeat: Everything in moderation. When one nationalizes everything and makes a single state machine, we all know that this ends sadly. However, it by no means follows from this that "nationalization" should be eliminated from the dictionary of the Russian language. [Pokrovskiy] Then the meaning of the president's latest edicts is that all forms of ownership must be used? [Livshits] It is more utilitarian and concrete. They have double meaning. First: To begin production reform. Second: Strengthening of financial discipline and introduction of order in payments and taxes. In this connection I want to say: There is nothing exotic in them. Now we have already received the first information on the reaction to them. What is especially interesting here? No one accepts this fully, but no one fully rejects this either. This is good. Our president should be the president of all Russia--not communist, or democratic, or monarchic, or some other Russia. He would be able to find the common things that unite the maximum number of Russians. Now we often hear from some people: Yes, this is correct, but I talked about this a year ago. From others: Yes, this is correct, but we talked about this 2 years ago. They finally have begun to act. And this is good, because this means: There is nothing extravagant, which no one expects, in the edicts. If this were vice versa--"we need this like snow on the head"--this would be harmful. And if they talked about this earlier, this means that the problem is urgent. And another thing. Well, who does not want to introduce order in finances and to establish discipline in calculations? However, is it really normal that an enterprise is almost sinking and withholding workers' wages, at the same time, having currency funds in its account? Therefore, under certain conditions one of the president's edicts introduces an obligatory exchange of currency for rubles: Pay into the budget, pay wages. However, why does the president in his edict have to force the owner to spend his funds on these purposes? This is strictly a phenomenon of the transitional period. Can you imagine such a thing in England? There, if an owner does not have pounds sterling, he calmly converts dollars and settles his account. It does not even occur to him to hold back payments. I will explain: The president did not begin with edicts. There were negotiations, there was a message, and there was a memorandum on the most acute problem--nonpayments. It came to the government and to the State Duma. The government reacted quickly. An answer came from the State Duma: We approve everything. Well, what of that? For 1 and 1/2 months we waited for the Duma, from the approval, to turn to the necessary amendments to the law, which would make it possible to weaken the acuteness of nonpayments. In brief, there is no confrontation, but there is also no action. I would say the following: When the president has to undertake such decisions, these are forced steps. After all, in principle, the economy should be regulated by statutes and by economic law. Of course, if clear-cut decisions had been adopted promptly, in accordance with the demands of life, these edicts would not have been needed. [Pokrovskiy] However, who should adopt such decisions? [Livshits] Of course, the Duma. The Duma, who else? It adopts laws. However, production cannot wait. We received data on 22 days in May... The decline continues. How much can one wait? Therefore, it was very hard for me to receive the news from the Duma. I will tell you as the representative of PRAVDA that communists in the Duma came out against these edicts as anticonstitutional. However, did communists not propose that order and discipline be introduced? And if someone tries to do this, what is bad about this? [Pokrovskiy] However, every party in its policy proceeds from its own principles, from its own programs... [Livshits] To this I will answer that the time has come to free ourselves from some customary illusions. The first of them--the idea of the beneficial nature of constant prices. However, weather changes and over the years even a wife changes. Why should prices be constant? After all, the stiffness of prices fetters the market mechanism. The second--the need for a full loading of enterprise capacities. To many it seems that, previously, we worked in three shifts and now we have changed over to one--this is a disaster! I assure you that this is a normal situation. In all countries with a market economy there is even a specific index for the government--the level of loading of a production apparatus. For example, in the United States a loading of 75 to 80 percent is considered normal. A loading of 20 to 25 percent represents a frozen capacity in case of changes in demand. If there is a package of orders, it is put into operation. An economy, the capacities of which constantly operate 100 percent, is just as unnatural and unpleasant for life as a country in which there is always summer. The main problem lies in reliably controlling the optimum degree of loading: Does the decline proceed in an uncontrolled manner? This is the problem for the government. Finally, the third illusion, to part with which, probably, is most difficult. This is the illusion of full employment. It comes from 70 years of our life, when we believed that we got rid of unemployment--this ulcer of capitalism. However, the work place is not granted by God or by the state. It is a blessing that must be earned. We will be fair. Under socialism there were also tens and sometimes even hundreds of thousands of people, who were dismissed, for example, from the Krasnyy Proletariy Plant and did not yet come to the Plant imeni Ordzhonikidze. Who were they? At that moment, the unemployed. Such unemployment is not dangerous. The true danger lies not in the number of the unemployed, but in the length of unemployment for every given person. If he cannot find a new place for 1, 2, or 4 months, this is already a true human tragedy. And so, two things--lengthy unemployment and focal unemployment, mainly at our famous plant cities--cannot be allowed. These are the true and difficult problems on the employment market. Whoever may say this to me, whatever they may frighten me with, I do not believe in mass unemployment in Russia. However, the threat of lengthy focal, regional unemployment is a real threat. The government understands this, but concrete measures are also needed; for example, for Ivanovo Oblast, where these phenomena are already very tangible. It is necessary to monitor and to prevent this danger in other regions as well. Here the state program should be put into effect automatically. As soon as unemployment is above the average level somewhere, it is necessary to put into effect incentives for the creation of work places. Yes, we must part with the illusion of a complete elimination of unemployment, as difficult as this may be. And again I would like to turn to the position of the Communist Party. Those that are familiar with Lenin's works remember his work, which begins with the words: "The approaching disaster..." And so, often communists rightly talk a great deal about approaching disasters. But it seems that they forget the second half of Lenin's title: "...And How To Fight Against It." I carefully read the constructive part of the communists' program. What is there? To ensure a normal standard of living... However, show me within these walls at least one person who would not want the same. But how to do this and from what resources? How to stimulate private owners and to establish a nonstate pension fund if the state does not have enough money for this and so forth? There are no answers to these questions. At the same time, I want to say that the pendulum of political life in Russia moves, even if slowly, to the left, toward social-democracy. This is a known process. It is visible in many countries of the former socialist camp. This is a normal process. However, I am afraid: Did it not begin in our country rather too early? We do not yet have enough normal social-democracy, the one that could continue reforms if the voter gives it his votes. But in order to achieve social justice, it is necessary to accumulate what can be divided later. This cannot be done with our weak economy. Let us observe, using Western Europe as an example, what happens when socialists come to power in a country. Everything begins with partial nationalization and measures to reduce unemployment, but very often ends with considerable inflation. Then conservatives come to power and begin to lower inflation, but unemployment rises again and again comes the time of socialists. Such an alternation is fully normal. [Pokrovskiy] The need to strengthen the state and its regulating role is constantly seen in your remarks. Do I understand you correctly? [Livshits] Yes, correctly. [Pokrovskiy] Then what prevents this? Mass psychology, or the lack of a legislative base? [Livshits] Most probably, the latter. I simply must say this to your readers. The tradition to hurl abuse at power has long existed in Russia--on the sly, so that someone does not make a report to the authorities anonymously or openly as now. However, please note: Russia does not strive to go anywhere, for example, to the "Karbovanets zone." But some try to get into the ruble zone and sometimes simply want to join us, which, in my view, would be dangerous. However, this is a separate topic. The point is that, if you come to near abroad with rubles, the ratio is as though you come with dollars. Here is the latest report from Ukraine: Auctions of rubles have been stopped, because the demand for them is 10-fold bigger than supply. I say this not because everything is remarkable here. But scattering ashes on one's head is also going overboard. Russia was and remains a great power. And now, when such an attitude toward the ruble exists, it is by no means the last. [Pokrovskiy] Nevertheless, dollars are leaving the country. Are people afraid to invest them? [Livshits] They are. But we must analyze for what reasons. Let us assume that a firm engages in import operations. It needs currency to purchase goods abroad! Many such examples can be cited, but this does not mean at all that I fully want to justify the currency "flight." A lot of money is leaving the country legally and illegally. How to stop this? To close the border, or to take some other forceful measures? However, this is not the way out. There is one way out--to give motivation for the investment of currency in the country. Today I have talked with bankers from a very rich bank. They say: Preparations are being made to let foreign banks into our country, but we are known to be weaker. How is that? I ask: You do not want this? We do not. Very good. However, all commercial people should realize: There must be an equal exchange. For example, we will not let foreign banks in here. But in return you put the vast amount of money that you made in trade and received on credit in investments. What else do you need? There is money, the political situation in the country is more or less stable, there are no fights for power, prices have already been rising moderately for 4 months, the situation can be predicted, there are vacant capacities, and plants do not have to be built from the foundation. What prevents you from investing funds in production? Yes, they answer, we have already begun to do this little by little. Yes, investments in production have begun now. Even 1 year ago it made no sense to talk about this--money would have been spent for nothing, inflation would have eaten it up. Now the situation is different. The totality of factors, which I mentioned to you, is favorable for investments. One would like to see a decision, perhaps of the Duma, perhaps of the president--this is not the chief thing--on measures to stimulate investments. However, the state does not have enough funds for investments. Moreover, even state investments, as is well known, are not very effective. But, in general, the locomotive stands on tracks, rails need not be laid, they exist. The locomotive must be stoked and then it will move by itself. [Pokrovskiy] It seems that you and I have approached the favorite question of journalists: How do you evaluate our prospects? [Livshits] I have already said that no more than 1 year and, perhaps, even less than this remains before the initial stages of an economic upsurge--in the absence of a political confrontation and with a clear course on the part of the government. It should work very actively now. However, all of us must have a more careful attitude toward the government. Vast efforts are required of it and it must be helped in this. It is primarily a matter of production restructuring and reorganization. This is production reform. The government adopted a very important decree on the procedure for the realization of bankruptcy and so forth. It is not that they want to dismiss people, but simply the economy will not withstand the production ballast. Other decisions were also adopted. However, it is not only a matter of them. They must be realized. We began our talk by saying that new programs are not needed, but there is a need for a real implementation of adopted decisions. Now we have again returned to this. The lack of a thought-out structural policy and of a system of priorities is one of our main sore points. We will strive to see to it that all the necessary priorities are included in the 1995 budget. It is well known that the budget is the face of power. All the rest are words. Things begin when money is given. Comments by Igor Lenskiy, Editor of the Issue The published interview is very unexpected for our newspaper. It is a question of the author's frank attempt to substantiate the capitalization of society and reforms, with which each of us is familiar from his own experience. Not by chance did Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, in his first interview upon arrival in Russia, call them "brainless." Yuriy Polyakov, a writer from another generation, who has distinctly established himself in the literature of the last decade, who is not a historian, but rather an investigator of the contemporary way of life, noted recently: "Now everyone admits that reforms did not turn out and, if they did, only badly..." The reader will add here his own attitude. And so, according to life there is a breakdown in our country, while according to Professor Livshits there is total order. During the first reading of the interview a number of contradictions are conspicuous. 1. "Everyone tries to get into the ruble zone, but Russia does not strive to go anywhere." This key argument has been constantly used for a long time by ultrareformers, beginning with Ye. Gaydar and B. Fedorov, to prove the correctness of the course of reforms. However, everything is simpler. Did a land as great as Russia form part of the former Union? Do such vast reserves of raw materials and minerals and such a powerful industry exist anywhere? Today we are only burning what God (and socialism) gave us, generating an inertia effect for the first fruits of reforms. 2. Professor A. Livshits asks: "Why should prices be constant? After all, the weather changes and over the years even a wife changes." Seemingly, everything is right, everything is logical. However, why out of all the phenomena accompanying shock therapy only an increase in prices is justificatory and explainable? And what about real income and the standard of living? Are they supposed to be rooted to the spot? Or should they also move, but in the opposite direction? 3. Professor Livshits' aphorism "the work place is a blessing that must be earned." No reasons are given for this thought--it is put forward as a fact, as an axiom. But let us ponder: In order to earn, it is necessary to work! Why suddenly people must contest the natural, primordial right to work (which, as is well known, created man), shoving each others with elbows? 4. "Did communists not propose that order and discipline be introduced?" asks A. Livshits, outraged at the position of the Duma fraction of the RF Communist Party, which considered the president's six recent edicts anticonstitutional. However, nowhere, not in a single program document of the Communist Party, is legislative norm creation in a nonparliamentary manner allowed. * * * During the first quarter the decline in industrial production in Russia made up 25 percent. This is what should not be forgotten when discussing the course of reforms.
