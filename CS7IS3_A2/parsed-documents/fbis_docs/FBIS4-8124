Butrus-Ghali said in a statement released by his spokeswoman Therese Gastaut that the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in former Yugoslavia must "use all available means as authorized by the relevant Security Council resolutions to attain this objective." Gastaut said the resolutions included the possible recourse to NATO air strikes because Gorazde was a protected UN "safe haven". The statement was issued as the Bosnian Serbs seized strategic high ground overlooking Gorazde as part of a 10-day offensive on the Moslem pocket in eastern Bosnia. In his statement, Butrus-Ghali welcomed ``the positive momentum and progress towards peace and stability in the former Yugoslavia. ``With regard to the safe area of Gorazde, the Secretary-General has taken note of the improvement in the situation there which was reported to him this (Saturday) morning. "At the same time, he calls for a return by the parties, especially the Bosnian Serbs, to the positions they held before the outbreak of the recent fighting." The statement was issued after the UN chief held meetings in Geneva earlier on Saturday with his special representative to former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, as well as UN mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg, Sarajevo special coordinator William Eagleton and UNPROFOR chief General Bertrand de Sauville de Lapresle.
