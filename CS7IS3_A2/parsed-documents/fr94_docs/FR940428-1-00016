FR940428-1-00016 FR940428-1-00007 Thursday April 28, 1994 Part V Department of Education 34 CFR Part 668 Student Assistance General Provisions; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 81␣/␣Thursday, April 28, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Part 668 RIN 1840&hyph;AC10 Student Assistance General Provisions AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Secretary proposes to amend Subpart E of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, 34 CFR Part 668, Verification of Student Aid Application Information, to implement revisions resulting from the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325) and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208). In this issue of the Federal Register the Secretary is publishing final regulations revising the existing Student Assistance General Provisions regulations to conform to statutory changes and clarify existing requirements associated with the verification of student aid application information. The Secretary requests comments on proposed changes in the percentage of Title IV applicants an institution is required to verify annually in an award year and the dollar tolerance amount. DATES: Comments must be received on or before May 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments concerning these proposed regulations should be addressed to Lorraine Kennedy, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW., Regional Office Building 3, room 4318, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5451. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lorraine Kennedy, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW., Regional Office Building 3, room 4318, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5451. Telephone (202) 708&hyph;4601. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Subpart E of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations (34 CFR part 668) governs the verification of the information that is used to calculate an applicant's expected family contribution (EFC) as part of the determination of an applicant's need for student financial assistance. Based on the need analysis formula established in the statute, the EFC is the amount that an applicant and the applicant's family can reasonably be expected to contribute towards the applicant's cost of attendance at an institution of higher education. Summary of Proposed Changes The Secretary proposes to change the requirement in §668.54 that determines the percentage of selected applicants required to be verified annually by an institution in any award year. The Secretary also proposes to change the amount of the dollar tolerance option in §668.59 for the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal Direct Student Loan, campus-based, and Presidential Access Scholarship programs. The Secretary has amended §668.54 to remove the 30 percent verification limitation and require institutions to verify all selected applicants. This change is required by the deletion of section 484(f) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, by the enactment of the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993. The Secretary is extending an invitation to comment to determine if there should be an option available to institutions to not verify more than a certain percentage of applicants and if so, what would be an appropriate percentage and evidence for that threshold. The new percentage would be published in the Federal Register , after all comments from the aid community have been reviewed and analyzed by the Secretary. The Secretary also proposes a $400 tolerance option to be used for all Title IV programs in place of the prior $200 Pell and $800 Stafford Loan and campus-based tolerance options. The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 provided a single formula for establishing need for all Title IV student financial assistance programs. Under one of the former need analysis formulas, Congressional Methodology, a larger tolerance for calculating the EFC was allowed because it did not result in a change in the applicant's award. In determining the single $400 tolerance figure for all Title IV programs, the Secretary analyzed the data to determine the appropriate tolerance amount that would not result in a change in the applicant's award.
