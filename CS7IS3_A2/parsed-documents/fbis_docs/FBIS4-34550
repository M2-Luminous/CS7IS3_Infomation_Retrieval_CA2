He said: "The largest world powers are making a considerable effort to prevent a small country from causing a true holocaust on the planet." Without mentioning the Asian country, Menem said: "It is a small country, which went practically unnoticed in the past few years, that has embarked on intensive development of nuclear energy, and has obviously built atomic bombs that can cause grave damage to the planet." The president emphasized: "We Argentines work for life while others work for death." Menem made these remarks during the inauguration and beginning of operation of the plant for cyclotron-produced radioisotopes for medical use [planta de produccion de ciclotron de radioisotopos de uso medico] in the Ezeiza Atomic Center. The plant has state-of-the-art German equipment and will permit the manufacturing of products vital in modern medicine. It will reduce costs and permit the use of these products in hospitals located far from urban centers. Radioisotopes are radioactive atoms with a nucleus with a different mass. Their use in improving living conditions is increasingly diverse. They are useful in increasing the yield of vegetables, preserving food, sterilizing medical products, conducting hormone analysis, using X-ray tubes in the control of industrial processes, or studying environmental contamination. Menem was accompanied by Manuel Mondino, head of the National Commission for Atomic Energy (CNEA), and Buenos Aires Production Minister Carlos Brown and Public Works Minister Hugo Toledo. Menem made a list of CNEA achievements and then added that "some countries develop nuclear energy for death. We Argentines have been working for life ever since we began operating in this area 44 years ago, perhaps a little more, under the inspiration of General Juan Domingo Peron." Menem added: "There are two countries with this type of development in the Southern Hemisphere: Australia and Argentina." "When you work on atoms you realize that they can be used not only for medical purposes but also for production to improve all types of activities in rural areas such as agriculture and livestock or pest eradication and control. We work on these aspects here and we are at the same level as the world's other great countries."
