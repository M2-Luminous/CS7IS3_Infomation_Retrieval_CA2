So said Social Democratic Party leader Ingvar Carlsson at a news conference yesterday afternoon. "It is the most important question of the 20th century that is now to be the subject of a referendum. It is very important to allow the democratic process to take the time it needs," Ingvar Carlsson said. He expects that in the early summer the Social Democrats will be able to hold an extraordinary party congress on EU membership and hopes to get a yes to Swedish EU membership at that congress. "I would view it as a setback if the congress said no," Ingvar Carlsson said at yesterday's news conference. In addition to the the party leader, Mats Hellstrom, the Social Democrats' spokesman on European questions, took part in the news conference. Both were very positive toward the outcome of the Swedish negotiations in Brussels earlier in the day. "It is a historic agreement," said Social Democratic leader Ingvar Carlsson, who was satisfied on all points with the exception of the Swedish membership contribution to the EU during an initial phasing-in period. "On that point we had been hoping to make greater progress, but we think nevertheless that a more or less acceptable result has been achieved. In all negotiations it is a question of give and take," Ingvar Carlsson said. "I do not think that a result from the negotiations under a Social Democratic government would have been very much different from the result we have now achieved," he added, assessing that the prospects after the successes in the negotiations in Brussels of a Swedish yes to the EU in a future referendum are increasing. Both Ingvar Carlsson and Mats Hellstrom praised European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel for his input into the membership negotiations. Carlsson and Hellstrom also said that they are satisfied that the government took account of the demands that the Social Democrats voiced during the negotiations. "The government accepted that the Social Democratic opposition's demands should have an effect on the Swedish positions," Mats Hellstrom said. "It is good that Sweden has been able to unite behind important national interests."
