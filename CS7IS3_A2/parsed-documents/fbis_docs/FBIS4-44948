He gave a press conference in Pakistan's Sind Province in which he accused Iran of interfering in Pakistan's domestic affairs. He said: Ever since Pakistan's new government first came to power, Iran has continuously interfered in our country's domestic affairs. The general secretary of the Corps of the Companions, which receives financial and political support from Saudi Arabia, said that the existence of Iran's cultural houses in Pakistan's cities is a danger to Pakistan's security. He said: The Corps of the Companions has expressed concern about the existence of Iran's cultural houses in eight of Pakistan's cities and it demands that the constant entry of Iranian delegations into Pakistan be stopped. He expressed sharp opposition to the project to lay Iran's gas pipeline across Pakistan to India, calling it interference in Pakistan's domestic affairs. He warned that the Corps of the Companions will not permit one inch of this pipeline to cross Pakistani soil. Hafez Ahmad protested the move by the Islamabad government to expel Arab terrorists residing in Pakistan. He called them Arab mojahedin and said: The current government of Pakistan has called the Arab mojahedin living in Pakistan terrorists and has ordered their expulsion, yet they fought to protect Pakistan's territorial integrity. The Islamabad government has recently arrested several Arabs living in Pakistan for the crime of creating fear and terror and for engaging in terrorist acts, and intends to expel them from Pakistan. The general secretary of the Corps of the Companions warned the Islamabad government not to expel the Arab terrorists and said: If the Arab mojahedin are treated in an inappropriate and unethical way, the Corps of the Companions will vigorously fight this action. The Corps of the Companions is one of the Pakistani groups that have caused many factional and religious clashes in this country. This corps, which is maintained by Saudi Arabia, is openly hostile to the Shiites of Pakistan, and one of its permanent programs is to mount armed attacks against Shiite religious and ideological gatherings and to kill and maim innocent people.
