According to party president Dr. Janez Drnovsek, they assessed favorably the work of the party and the government coalition so far. They have only agreed that they will try to continue the work of the present coalition, and, in connection with this, resolve the most vital problems. Our reporter, Manca Ocvirk, has interviewed party president Dr. Janez Drnovsek about this: [Begin recording] [Ocvirk] Can we expect any changes in the government coalition after today's meeting, Mr. Drnovsek? [Drnovsek] Not on the basis of this meeting. On the contrary, my assessment is that this meeting will, in a way, strengthen the relations within the LDS as well as within the coalition. I do not expect any such changes in the long term. [Ocvirk] How long will you wait for the reply of the Social Democrats? [Drnovsek] I would not like to set any deadlines, however, I expect their positive reply regarding the annex to the coalition agreement in the very near future. Namely, this annex is supposed to facilitate a more efficient work of the coalition. Of course, if they will not extend such a consent and signature, a question about the purpose of this party's work in the present coalition will arise, as, by this, the party will express its interest, that is to say, its lack of interest for something like this. However, I expect that they will sign this in the shortest possible time. [end recording]
