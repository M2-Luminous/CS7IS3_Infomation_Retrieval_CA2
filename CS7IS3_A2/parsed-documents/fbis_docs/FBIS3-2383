Figures from the municipal foreign economic relations and trade commission show that 256 of these foreign-funded projects are in industry, with a total contractual investment of about 320 million U.S. dollars. Other popular sectors, such as real estate and public utilities services, which last year absorbed most of the foreign funds flowing into Shanghai, in February attracted the smaller proportion of the total overseas investment. However, experts say that overseas investors will still take interest in the real estate sector as Shanghai is stepping up the construction of an international financial and trade power houses. "Anyway, the amount of foreign investment in real estate this year will not be less than 1993's," they predicted. Official statistics show that though the number of foreign-funded projects in February was sightly higher than in the same period last year, the total of contractual foreign investment was 150 million U.S. dollars less than last year. According to sources from the commission, Hong Kong is currently ranking top among investors, pouring some 410 million U.S. dollars into 136 projects, accounting for 64 percent of the total overseas investment. The sources said that Japanese businesses have expanded their investment in Shanghai this year. In February, they invested more than 50 million U.S. dollars in Shanghai, up 54 percent on the same period last year. Countries which each have invested more than ten million U.S. dollars in Shanghai include the United States, Britain, Singapore and the Philippines. Official statistics show that to date, business people from 56 countries and regions in the world have invested in Shanghai, involving a total investment of some 14.9 billion U.S. dollars in 7,547 projects.
