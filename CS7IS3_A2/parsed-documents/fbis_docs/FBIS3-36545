An INTERFAX correspondent reports from the republican capital of Groznyy that opposition units remain in the barracks and are holding no exercises at the moment. The Chechen presidential office told INTERFAX that it was a "gross provocation by certain forces in the Russian leadership trying to disrupt the dialogue between Russia and Chechnya which has just begun." All this is happening on the eve of the Chechen government delegation's departure for Moscow for the bilateral interstate talks, the same sources said. Meanwhile, Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev had his usual busy day on Monday. This morning he visited an officers' college in Groznyy.
