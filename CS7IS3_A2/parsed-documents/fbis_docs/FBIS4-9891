The increase in crime and repression in Haiti coincides with the so-called parliamentary plan supported by the U.S. Administration, writes CHR. After reading recent news releases by the UN/OAS civilian mission on increased violence in Haiti, the Haitian Religious Conference asserts that hands washed in vain by U.S. Administration authorities, and all those who together with them plan for the death of innocent people, are stained by their victims' blood. The Haitian Religious Conference especially denounces the contradictions and disparities between the international community's words and deeds in Haiti's case.
