Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said if the report by THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH is true, it is a serious matter and it shows foreign interference in Malaysia's affairs. He said the matter was among several issues he discussed with Australian High Commissioner to Malaysia John Dauth when the latter called on him at the ministry yesterday. He added that Malaysia and Australia will try to verify the report. So far it is only a press report. Speaking to newsmen in Kuala Lumpur, Datuk Abdullah also stressed that his meeting with Dauth was fixed some time ago and had nothing to do with the report. According to the report, ASIS agents had paid thousands of Australian dollars to certain senior political leaders in Malaysia and Singapore since they became members of parliament. Government leaders and DAP [Democratic Action Party] leaders have strongly criticized the report and called on Canberra to name those involved if the allegations were indeed true.
