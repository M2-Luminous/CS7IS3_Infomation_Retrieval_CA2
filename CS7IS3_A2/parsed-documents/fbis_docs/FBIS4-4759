The Eastern Maori MP has met the chairman of the Chinese Government's Standing Committee, Qiao Shi, in Beijing. From Beijing, Peter Tapsell says Chairman Qiao told him he resists the United States' confrontational stance and says China doesn't have the influence over North Korea that Western nations seem to think it has. [Begin Tapsell recording] He was confident that left alone, North and South Korea would iron out their difficulties in the course of time. It wouldn't happen quickly, but he said the last thing we wanted was to demonstrate a confrontational attitude which might bring things to a head in this region. [end recording]
