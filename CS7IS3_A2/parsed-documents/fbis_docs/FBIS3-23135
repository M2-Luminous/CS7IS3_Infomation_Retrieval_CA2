[Hawatimah] As soon as we received word about the massacre, the DFLP urged our people inside the occupied homeland and abroad to observe a general strike for three days. I declared this personally over the radio. Our people's response was excellent. Confrontations are still going on. They covered all of the 1948-occupied territory, from the Galilee to the Negev. [passage omitted] [Salihah] Do you support fedayeen operations against the settlers? How will you react militarily? [Hawatimah] We have stated clearly that the crime will not go unpunished. The punishment will definitely be against the settlers who are armed to the teeth in full view of the occupation. The crimes of the settlers are the outcome of the current political climate and Rabin's hawkish policy. Rabin insists on having everything: territory, crossings, and security. He is also pursuing settlement activity. He earmarked $100 million in 1994 to expand the settlements. This is in addition to the ideology preached by the Israeli rabbis, urging settlement and expansion and making the Palestinian territory a disputed land. Therefore, our fedayeen operations will necessarily target the settlers. Every settler is a target of the strugglers of the Red Star Battalions, the DFLP's armed wing. The past stands witness that we are faithful to what we declare. The coming days will see appropriate reactions to this horrendous massacre. [passage omitted]
