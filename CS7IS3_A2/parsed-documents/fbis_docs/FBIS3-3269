Gao Dezhan set forth three opinions on reform and development of industrial enterprises. First, it is necessary to deepen reform, make overall improvement, and concentrate energy on enlivening industrial enterprises. Gao Dezhan said: The industrial front should adopt major measures to change the appearance of the enterprises with difficulties; and do a good job in using foreign capital, making structural readjustment, strengthening management, developing products, conducting technological transformation, and building leading bodies. By deepening reform, the industrial front should change their mechanisms; increase economic results; and ensure to hand over more to finance, to have enterprises obtain more profits, and to have the staff and workers gain more benefits. We should focus the deepening of enterprise reform on changing the managerial mechanisms. It is necessary to continue to implement well the enterprise law and regulations; delimit small accounting units with enterprises; deepen the reform of the employment, labor personnel, and distribution systems; simplify organizations; and reform and improve the organizational management system. Second, we should conscientiously implement the system of responsibility for fulfillment of assigned tasks and ceaselessly improve the leadership level. Gao Dezhan said: On the basis of grasping the work of his own department, each and every leading cadre at or above the bureau level on the industrial front should assume responsibility for the management of two good enterprises and two money-losing enterprises. The implementation of the system of responsibility for fulfillment of assigned tasks should be examined and assessed every quarter and comprehensively be assessed at the end of the year. The assessment of the implementation of the system should be linked up with the assessment of the cadres' political achievements. Third, we should comprehensively carry out the "222" project, change the appearance of the industrial enterprises as soon as possible, and rejuvenate Tianjin's industry. Gao Dezhan said: The second plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee stressed the necessity to carry out the "222" project. That is, the municipality should grasp two large enterprises of key importance, including the vehicle industrial corporation and the [words indistinct] company, and grasp 20 municipal-level key enterprises; and all levels and districts and counties should also grasp 200 key enterprises.
