FR941110-1-00009 FR941110-1-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;92&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 (Military) Series Airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;88 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 (military) series airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes, that currently requires certain inspections and structural modifications. This action would require additional inspections and structural modifications. This proposal is prompted by an evaluation conducted by the Airworthiness Assurance Working Group (AAWG), Model DC&hyph;9/MD&hyph;80 Task Group, which identified additional modifications for mandatory action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent degradation in the structural capabilities of the affected airplanes. This action also reflects the FAA's decision that long term continued operational safety should be assured by actual modification of the airframe, where feasible, rather than only by repetitive inspections for known service problems. DATES: Comments must be received by December 23, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;92&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;92&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;92&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On August 6, 1990, the FAA issued AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03, amendment 39&hyph;6701 (55 FR 34704, August 24, 1990), applicable to Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 (military) series airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes, to require certain inspections and structural modifications. That action was prompted by reports of incidents involving fatigue cracking, corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking in transport category airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. These incidents have jeopardized the airworthiness of the affected airplanes. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent degradation in the structural capabilities of the affected airplanes. Since the issuance of that AD, the Airworthiness Assurance Working Group (AAWG), Model DC&hyph;9/MD&hyph;80 Task Group, comprised of representatives from operators of Model DC&hyph;9/MD&hyph;80 series airplanes, the manufacturer, and the FAA, has completed its review of certain service bulletins that are applicable to aging Model DC&hyph;9/MD&hyph;80 series airplanes. The Task Group has recommended these service bulletins for mandatory inspection and structural modification in order to reduce the potential for major structural failure of those airplanes. Consequently, McDonnell Douglas has issued Revision B to Report No. MDC K1572, ``DC&hyph;9/MD80 Aging Aircraft Service Action Requirements Document,'' dated January 15, 1993. The Task Group's most recent recommendations for mandatory actions are contained in Tables 2.3, 2.4, and 3.1 of that document. (The actions contained in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 were made mandatory by AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;03.) The FAA has reviewed and approved that document. Tables 2.3 and 2.4 of the document reference the following service bulletins: 1. One service bulletin that describes inspections and modification of the slat drive mechanism; 2. Four service bulletins that describe inspections and modifications of the doors; 3. Eleven service bulletins that describe inspections and modifications of the fuselage; 4. Four service bulletins that describe inspections and modifications of the horizontal stabilizers; 5. Two service bulletins that describe inspections and modifications of the wings; 6. One service bulletin that describes inspections and modification of the engine thrust reverser system; 7. One service bulletin that describes inspections and modification of the nose gear steering; 8. Two service bulletins that describe inspections and modifications of the engine pylon; 9. One service bulletin that describes inspections and modification of the rudder; and 10. Two service bulletins that describe inspections and modifications of the main landing gear structures. Table 3.1 of the document references the following service bulletins for mandatory inspections: 1. One service bulletin that describes inspections of the doors; 2. One service bulletin that describes inspections of the engine pylons; and
