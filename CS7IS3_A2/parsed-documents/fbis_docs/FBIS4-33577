The combative trade union leader described the provincial government's decision as "a slap in the face of the people of Jujuy" because workers' wages are way below those earned by government officials. The mobilization, involving about 2,000 people, began at about 1130 after representatives from various trade union organizations held meetings at their respective headquarters and then marched without incident to Belgrano Square in downtown San Salvador de Jujuy. The SEOM unionist was joined by former Zapla Blast Furnace workers, retirees, Cederm (Secondary Education Center) members, ADEP (Association of Provincial Teachers) members, and APUAP (Association of Public Administration University Professionals) members, among others. Santillan noted that the salary increase for government officials "is unconstitutional" because according to the provincial constitution "the ministers' salaries must be established by law." Santillan added: "We, the trade unions, therefore went to Belgrano Square. We want the decree to be abolished, or an authorization for an equal increase for state workers." The trade union leader stressed that "there was an excessive increase -- even for municipal officials -- that reached about 200 percent." He asked for "a little respect and justice for the workers." Santillan indicated that it is contradictory for these gentlemen to approve such an increase in Jujuy, "where there is malnutrition and infant mortality, school desertion, and the worst crisis in history."
