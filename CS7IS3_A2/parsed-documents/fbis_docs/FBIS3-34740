At the session, Mr. Nateq-Nuri thanked the nation for their wise and active presence at the Ten Days of Dawn ceremonies that culminated in massive and magnificent marches on February 11. The massive participation of our sensible people at the marches, Mr. Nateq-Nuri said, once again proved to the world that the Iranian Muslim people have remained loyal to the revolution's causes and principles and are diligent in safeguarding its achievement and values. The Majlis speaker then urged the officials to serve this brave and heroic nation more than before. Mr. Nateq-Nuri further described as a deceitful scheme NATO's ultimatum to Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo, adding that inwardly NATO, Serbs, and Croats are allies. The head of the legislative branch later expressed hope that Muslims would no longer be deceived by their enemies' conspiracies and, with greater resolve than in the past, continue to defend the oppressed Bosnian people. Mr. Nateq-Nuri then appreciated the stance of the Nonaligned Movement in backing the Bosnian Muslims.
