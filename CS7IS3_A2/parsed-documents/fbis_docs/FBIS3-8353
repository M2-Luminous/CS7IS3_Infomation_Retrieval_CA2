Jovanovska: "Greek List of Wishes"] [Text] In agreement with the folk proverb "The hungry dream of full plates," our neighbor, Greece, is once again sending us dramatic announcements. These range from the announcement that this week will be conclusive for the Macedonian-Greek negotiations, that mediator Vance has already prepared a memorandum that Skopje and Athens have to support, that Delors and Van den Broek have prepared their "formulas" for solving the crisis after the Greek closure of the borders, that the European mediator will again visit Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], to a possible meeting between Papoulias and Crvenkovski in Brussels or Geneva. According to what we could learn from reliable Macedonian sources, nothing can be expected from all these dramatic announcements. That is to say, there is no Vance memorandum and Macedonia has not been informed of it, and even laymen can be assured by reading between the lines that it is comparable to a Greek list of wishes and another testing "balloon" for us and the European Union. According to the mentioned memorandum, Macedonia should agree to withdraw the symbols [Star of Vergina on FYROM flag], alter the Constitution where it deals with care for the minorities abroad, and guarantee the borders -- all as a precondition for placing the name issue under international arbitration. This had no chance hitherto, and the Macedonian side was never asked directly to do that. In return, Greece should lift the embargo and the "veto" from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, from the European Union, and NATO, to which Macedonia is waiting to be admitted. Also, some other benefits could be allotted to it [Macedonia] if it fulfills some of the conditions that are not so dramatic for us, and that were not acceptable when recognition of this state was at stake. However, NATO is present in Macedonia with the presence of the U.S. troops, and all European countries can give the country their help separately, and not as members of the Union (some have already done that), and the Republic is already present in the CSCE, regardless of the status it has been given. According to all this, all the drama has but one goal -- to return the Macedonian-Greek dispute to the European Union, and instead of reviewing the closure of the borders as a legal problem (which it really is), it is adding a political dimension to it, because the main defense of official Athens is based on this trump, contained in the two articles of the Maastricht agreement. That is, in the case of a threat to the stability of this region, it is possible to close the borders with a particular neighboring country, although it says "in consultation with other EU countries." The way matters are now, it is evident that these efforts are not echoed in Brussels, where the closure of the borders is seen as an internal question and as a violation of the regulations signed by all the member states, starting from those on free trade and the transfer of services, up to the fact that the Greek border also represents a EU border. All this speaks in favor of the announcement that this week will really be conclusive, but for Greece, which could definitely be put on the agenda of the European Justice Court. What we are particularly interested in is the possible, though not yet scheduled, meeting between Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski and Cyrus Vance in Geneva, after he has met and talked to Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias. It is also sure that our position will remain the same, and it means that we are constantly ready to talk about all disputed questions -- "a basket" that has already been offered a few times so far, in which there is no "item" on the change of the name of Macedonia, regardless of how much Greece wants it and of what it is capable of doing to achieve it.
