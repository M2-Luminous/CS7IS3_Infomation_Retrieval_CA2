FR940224-2-00131 FR940224-2-00082 18. Cash Management, the Money Market Series, the Government Series, and Treasury Cash Management currently invest approximately 33%, 33%, 25%, and 50%, respectively, of their net assets on an overnight basis. Each Fund's average daily portfolio maturity customarily is between 40 and 60 days. Applicants intend to limit the Maximum Purchase Amount at a level that they believe should avoid reducing average daily portfolio maturity and thus the yield for a Fund. 19. FNBC will continue to solicit independent quotes from third parties for the proposed ``sweep'' transactions, but to date FNBC has been unable to find any unaffiliated entity willing to engage in such transactions on a basis as favorable to the Funds as the proposed arrangement with FNBC. The repurchase agreement counterpart will not know until the next day the amount, if any, of such transactions. This delay results because the daily processing for FNBC's accounting system normally is completed well into the night of the day the order is placed and the actual amount to be invested in the repurchase transaction is not known and, thus, monies in respect thereof cannot be transmitted until the next morning. Unaffiliated third parties will not agree to operate in this ``look back'' manner with the Fund on a basis as favorable to the Fund as the proposed arrangement with FNBC. 20. Before any repurchase agreements are entered into pursuant to the exemption, the participating Fund or FNBC must obtain and document competitive quotations from at least two other dealers with respect to repurchase agreements that are comparable in terms of size, maturity, and collateral, except that if quotations are unavailable from two such dealers only one other competitive quotation is required. In addition, the transactions for which quotations are sought will be conventional overnight repurchase agreements in which the funds would be transferred by the participating Fund on the same day that the transaction is entered into, and then returned by the counterpart on the following day. Before entering into a transaction pursuant to the exemption, a determination will be required that the income to be earned from the repurchase agreement is at least equal to that available from the other dealers from which quotes were obtained. As set forth in the application, applicants enter into repurchase agreements on an ongoing basis and, therefore, believe they are capable of obtaining such quotes. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 17(a) of the Act, among other things, generally prohibits certain entities affiliated with an registered investment company, when acting as principal, from knowingly selling to or purchasing from the investment company, any security. Among the entities precluded from dealing as principal with a registered investment company under section 17(a) are any affiliated person of the investment company and any affiliated person of an affiliated person of the investment company. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines the term ``affiliated person'' of an investment company to include any investment adviser of such company. Therefore, FNBC, as each Fund's investment adviser, and its affiliates are subject to the prohibitions contained in section 17(a) with respect to the Fund. 2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides in relevant part that ``the Commission, *␣*␣* by order upon application, may *␣*␣* exempt any person, security, or transaction *␣*␣* from any provision or provisions of [the Act] or of any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of [the Act].'' 3. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that ``notwithstanding [section 17(a)], any person may file with the Commission an application for an order exempting a proposed transaction *␣*␣* from one or more provisions of that subsection. The Commission shall grant such application and issue such order of exemption if evidence establishes that *␣*␣* (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (2) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under [the Act]; and (3) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of [the Act].'' 4. Each Fund believes that the relief requested is appropriate and in the public interest because it will permit the Fund to invest at a favorable price net assets attributable to the ``sweep'' program on the same day that such assets are available for investment. Applicants believe that a more attractive ``sweep'' program will result in increased assets for the Funds. A larger asset base for a Fund will benefit all Fund shareholders by reducing the amount of Fund expenses indirectly borne by each shareholder, thereby increasing investors' returns. 5. FNBC and its affiliates are aware of the potential conflict of interest inherent in the operation of the ``sweep'' program if the proposed relief is granted. FNBC, therefore, has established procedures and conditions to be followed by its employees and agents to prevent any overreaching on the part of any person that could act to the detriment of the Funds and to ensure that each transaction is effected on a reasonable and fair basis. 6. A Fund's overnight position should not necessarily reduce its yield. If the operation of the proposed ``sweep'' program shortens a Fund's average daily portfolio maturity, the effect of such reduction would be minimal because: (i) the Fund currently maintains a relatively short average daily portfolio maturity; (ii) as FNBC develops more experience operating the ``sweep'' program, FNBC will be able to manage the maturity of that portion of the Fund's assets held outside the sub-custodian account for the program so as to provide optimal liquidity levels; and (iii) upon receipt of such assets currently, the Fund has invested such assets in overnight or very short-term obligations in any event, but such investment occurs one day later. Thus, applicant believe that any effect on yield as a result of the proposed relief would be negligible. In addition, operation pursuant to the independent pricing mechanism set forth in condition 8 should provide yields from ``sweep'' investments that are no lower than similar non-sweep Fund investments. 7. Based on the arguments set forth above, applicants believe that the requested relief is necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants also believe that the terms of the proposed transactions, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, that the proposed transactions are consistent with the policy of each Fund, as set forth in the Fund's registration statement and reports filed under the Act, and that the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. No. FNBC or affiliate ``sweep'' account client will be permitted to affect a transaction for a Fund after the sweep has occurred and the Fund's net assets value has been computed for that day.
