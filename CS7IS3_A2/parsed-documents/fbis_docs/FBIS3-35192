The reports said the Iraqi people are effectively on the threshold of a mammoth revolution to express their anger with the unjust regime, which is primarily responsible for the people's bitter suffering today. The reports said a state of extreme tension and anxiety prevail in the streets of Baghdad and the governorates in anticipation of possible developments in the next few days if the economic deterioration and collapse continue and hunger, want, and destitution affecting the overwhelming majority of citizens sharpen.
