Inspired by the principles on which the peace process was launched, our position has been absolutely clear. In contrast, Israel has consistently sought to throw the peace process off course. The Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has put forward fresh proposals under the heading "Majdal Shams First" along the lines of the Gaza-Jericho First. Syria will have nothing to do with a first or second. This is because if we engage in such phrases, it will lead to our engagement in the labyrinth of separate settlements and deals, something to which we are totally opposed as it threatens the foundations of the peace initiative itself. Syria advocates a complete Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories as the road leading to the peace of the brave. All that Syria wants is full peace as envisaged by the peace initiative. Out of a commitment to a universal solution as laid out by the peace initiative, Syria wants the entire Golan Heights back and a full withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories. Any other options are a waste of time and an attempt to gain time and evade the requirements of peace. This is where the responsibility of the sponsors of the peace conference come in. It is a test of their ability to put an end to Israel's continuing maneuvers, AL-BA'TH concludes.
