FR940812-0-00013 FR940812-0-00006 The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of California dates. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. The Committee met on March 17, 1994, and by a vote of 6 to 2 with one abstention recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget and assessment rate. The Committee again met on July 7, 1994, and unanimously recommended the line item operating expenses and by a vote of 6 to 2 recommended the line item promotional expenses in the budget. The 1994&hyph;95 budget of $571,000 is $101,440 less than the previous year. Included in the budgeted expenditures is an operating budget of $135,135, $13,335 more than last year, with a 26 percent surplus account allocation, for a net operating budget of $100,000, or $2,560 more than last year. Budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Executive Director's salary, $57,500 ($55,000), Administrative Assistant's salary, $18,500 ($15,000), health and related benefits, $8,500 ($7,500), utilities, $1,500 ($1,200), telephone, $5,000 ($3,000), office supplies, $3,600 ($1,500), furniture and equipment, $7,400 ($1,000), printing, $1,600 ($1,000), and insurance, $2,500 ($2,300). Items which have decreased compared to the amount budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: payroll taxes, $5,814 ($6,000), postage and meter rental, $1,700 ($2,000), repair and maintenance $500 ($600), travel and mileage, $1,500 ($2,000), contingency, $221 ($4,000), and market promotion, $450,000 ($575,000). The Committee also eliminated funding for a clerk, unemployment reserve, and USDA compliance audits for which $6,000, $1,000, and $1,900 were recommended last year, respectively. All other items are budgeted at last year's amounts. The assessment rate of $1.50 per hundredweight is $0.25 more than last season. This rate, when applied to anticipated date shipments of 38,000,000 pounds, will yield $570,000 in assessable income. This, along with $1,000 in interest income, will result in $21,000 in excess income which the Committee recommended be allocated to its reserve. These reserve funds, which the Committee estimates would be $121,000 as of September 30, 1995, would be within the maximum amount permitted by the order of not to exceed 50 percent of the average of expenses incurred during the most recent five preceding crop years, except that an established reserve need not be reduced to conform to any recomputed average. Funds held by the Committee at the end of the crop year, including the reserve, which are in excess of the crop year's expenses may be used to defray expenses for four months and thereafter the Committee shall refund or credit the excess funds to the handlers. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the crop year begins on October 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the crop year apply to all assessable dates handled during the crop year; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.
