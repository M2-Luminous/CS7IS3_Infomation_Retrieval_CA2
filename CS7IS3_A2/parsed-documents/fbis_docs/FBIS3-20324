It does not permit one to see any basic position on economic policy, he said after a meeting of the FDP Presidium. The SPD lacks at least 8 billion German marks to implement its plans, because investment subsidies or raising children's allowances have an effect on the costs. In addition, it is not made clear how the SPD wants to reduce expenditures for personnel and defense. FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel criticized the "demonization" of high-wage earners; the SPD is "on the wrong track concerning tax and financial policy." "In the foreseeable future," Kinkel said, the liberals want to make a decision on the coalition statement. During the weekend Rexrodt suggested that a coalition statement should be made at the federal congress in Rostock in June; originally it had been planned for the election congress in September. The Presidium supported the Brandenburg FDP leaders, who, after the failure of the coalition between SPD, FDP, and Greens, are the only party that rejects a self-dissolution of the Potsdam Landtag and early new elections. The FDP in Brandenburg will not "let itself be bent," Kinkel said. Referring to the intervention of the federal Christian Democratic Union [CDU], which has urged the Brandenburg CDU to hold new elections, the FDP federal chairman said that he does not think anything of "remote control."
