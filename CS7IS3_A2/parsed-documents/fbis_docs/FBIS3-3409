They are now experimenting with establishing foreign-funded shareholding companies, using the BOT (build-operate-transfer) mode in infrastructure projects and establishing foreign-funded trust and investment and foreign investment companies. China has so far approved establishment of 170,000 foreign-funded enterprises, of which about half have gone into operation, and used 60 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment. Now the Chinese have begun to think deeply over how to use foreign investment more efficiently and push ahead the opening up program to a higher level while opening wider. This new tendency can find expression in discussions among deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) on the government work report at the current NPC session. China began to open to the outside world in the late 1970s and since then five special economic zones have been established in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen cities and Hainan Province. Shenzhen Mayor Li Youwei and Xiamen Mayor Hong Yongshi maintained that under the new situation, special economic zones should pay due attention to readjusting the foreign investment structure and develop new and high-tech industries. In the future, while continuing serving as showcases for absorbing foreign investment, technology and management expertise, special economic zones should fully play an exemplary role to other areas in establishing a socialist market economy, boosting economic growth by relying on science and technology and exercising economic management according to law, Hong Yongshi said. As a step to open wider to the outside world, China successively opened 14 coastal cities, cities along the Chang Jiang River and borders and inland provincial capital cities, and Pudong New Development Area in Shanghai. Since then an all-round opening up pattern has taken shape in China. Under such a situation, opening wider not only means opening more fields for foreign investment and opening domestic markets, but also means priority of preferences will be shifted to industries instead of to certain regions. NPC deputies from economically under-developed central and western areas made a strong call for opening their areas wider to the outside world, saying this is a major measure to narrow, step by step, the gap between economically developed eastern areas and western areas. Wang Youjie, secretary of Luohe city party committee in Henan Province, called for pushing ahead with opening in various fields in central and western areas, while deputies from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shaanxi Province suggested such areas attract foreign investment to develop agricultural and animal husbandry, communications and energy and exploit their abundant resources. What the deputies suggested coincides with policies the Chinese Government is preparing to institute. These policies are explained by Chinese Premier Li Peng and State Planning Commission Minister Chen Jinhua in their reports to the current NPC session. Another Chinese senior leader further explained that to encourage central and western areas to use foreign investment and encourage flow of foreign investment into infrastructure and basic industries are the "same thing in essence." During a group discussion with NPC deputies from Gansu Province, Hu Jintao, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, emphasized the significance of opening to the development of central and western areas, saying that opening wide can promote development. State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises afflicted with difficulties have been a difficult problem for the Chinese for years. Jin Zhezhu, vice-governor of Jilin Province, an old industrial base, and an NPC deputy, pointed out that to actively use foreign investment for technical renovation for enterprises is an important approach to raise efficiency of state-owned enterprises. To make sure that the opening program moves towards a higher level, many deputies said, efforts should be made to perfect relevant laws and regulations and more attention be paid to assimilation of imported advanced foreign technology while improving investment environment. Chen Bingzhen, professor of Qinghua University, maintained that in importing foreign technology, the old practice of importing by different channels, redundant, blind and disorderly import of overseas technology and equipment and import of isolated parts should be abandoned. Deputies expressed their belief that along with the opening moving towards a higher level, China will expand its scale of using foreign investment, technology and advanced management expertise, and will be more mature and efficient in this regard. China's economy will converge with the world economy in a faster pace.
