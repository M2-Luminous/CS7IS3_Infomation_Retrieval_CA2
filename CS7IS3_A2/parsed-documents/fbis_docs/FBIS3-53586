In remarks to REUTERS, he said the bank will start off with $250 million, partly contributed by the Palestinian authority and Palestinian and foreign private sectors, including (?French) banks. Brother Abu-al-'Ala' said the establishment of the bank marks a key step, which, besides facilitating the flow of assistance to the occupied land, will be the conduit for loans to the private sector. International aid donors met in Paris last month and pledged $570 million in 1994 toward funding Palestinian projects in the areas due to come under the interim Palestinian self-rule authority. The decision to set up a Palestinian development bank was made by the accountants of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction when it convened last week. The PLO Executive Committee will meet in a few days to name a constituent body for the bank, which is expected to begin its operations within months.
