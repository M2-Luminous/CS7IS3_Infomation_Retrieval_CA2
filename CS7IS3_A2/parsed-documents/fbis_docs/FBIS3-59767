MITI will establish a joint research system for national research institutes and private companies, begin work on the creation of carbon and carbon-containing (new diamond) materials and on development of their basic manufacturing technology, and even get involved in the control of their properties and their evaluation. MITI will also work on development of basic technology for their use as threshold electronics materials. More specifically, beginning in 1994 MITI will seek out the possibilities of creating a variety of carbon materials using AIST's advanced research system and plans to promote it as a national project by 1996. The use of diamonds has expanded dramatically with the advent of gas phase synthesis technology. Not only in the field of wear resistance, which utilizes the hardness properties of diamonds, but also in the fields of electronics and optics the uses of diamonds have expanded rapidly, and already researchers have created primitive transistors and several passive devices. On the other hand, the group of substances that have carbon as their main component include a variety of forms such as DLC (diamond lattice carbon films), fullerenes (C<inf> 60</inf> ), carbon tubes and carbenes. Moreover, their crystal structures can be linear, planar, three-dimensional or amorphous. In addition to SiC and B<inf> 4</inf> C, we can also expect still unknown carbon compounds such as C<inf> 3</inf> N<inf> 4</inf> and BCN to appear. It is projected that these new diamonds will become a one trillion yen market in the 21st century. In order to promote the sophisticated use of these carbon and carbon-containing compounds, the policy toward new diamonds planned by MITI involves R&D on a large scale from basic to applied research including development of basic materials and the techniques to manufacture them, development of technology to control their crystalline and electronic properties, and development of applications focusing on electronic materials. First MITI plans to establish a system for joint R&D by private corporations and university experts anchored by national research institutes and then conduct advanced research for one or two years. The following specific themes have been proposed: 1. Research on basic technology to create new substances 2. Research on basic techniques for growing crystals 3. Study of basic techniques to control electronic structure 4. Research concerning applied technology. New diamonds are attracting attention as possible electronic devices that can be used under extreme environmental conditions. Active research is being carried out in Japan, the U.S. and European Community. MITI's commitment to new diamond technology will surely encourage further R&D in the industry.
