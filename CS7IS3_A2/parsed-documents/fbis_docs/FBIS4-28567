Speaking at a conference on "Pacific Trade and Investment: Options for the 90's," Anan, who initiated the Asean Free Trade Area (Afta), said he inclined to disagree with more cautious views of the future role of Apec. "I would urge our leaders to be bolder in hastening the process of regional economic integration," he said. Anan, the Afta architect, spoke from Canada where he was receiving the honourary degree from Queen's University. He said, "Vision is not really the issue here anymore, since market forces and past successes have already shown the way." Thailand and Canada are both members of Apec, the grouping of 17 Asia Pacific nations whose leaders are scheduled to have the second meeting in Indonesia later this year to determine the future course of the group. Anan viewed that the past patterns of vertically-integrated production relations seem now to be giving way to more equal business partnerships, characterized by horizontal interdependence. In other words, economic convergence between developed countries and the NIEs [newly industrializing economies] and emerging NIEs will mean that the latter two groups represent distinct sets of investment and market opportunities fed by the economies of China and Indochina. Anan also predicted that while the world's economies will become more integrated, the financial services sector will continue to be an area of expanding opportunities in the Apec region. He said, "I also observe that the rapidly expanding investment needs, in both the private and public sectors of developing Apec economies, will generate enormous opportunities for trade and technology transfer in financing services. By their nature, financial services will be those that are most characteristically global." "I foresee that the financial services sector, which has already grown significantly in recent years, will continue to be an area of expanding opportunity in the Apec region. Capital mobility, especially in the Asia Pacific, is linking regional financial markets in an unprecedented manner," he said.
