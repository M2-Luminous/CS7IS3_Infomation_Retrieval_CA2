Lu Ping says: The Chinese observe a very good tradition: They always greet and give each other best wishes during the spring festival. On the eve of this festive occasion, on behalf of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs, I would like to say Happy New Year to all Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and may the new year bring joy and good fortune to you and your families, and may everything come your way. Lu Ping says: In the past year, to ensure a smooth transition in 1997 for Hong Kong and to ensure its economic prosperity, the Chinese Government showed deep sincerity in important issues such as the Sino-British talks on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements and the financial arrangements for Hong Kong's new airport, making enormous efforts to solve the problems. Our objective was to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability through cooperation with Britain. Regrettably, Britain disregarded the Chinese Government's sincerity, the wishes of the Hong Kong compatriots, and Hong Kong's need for a stable transition, by flagrantly and unilaterally halting the negotiations, adopting a confrontational attitude toward China, and creating obstacles to a smooth transition for Hong Kong, thereby indicating the colonialists' reluctance to retreat from the historical arena in peace. Lu Ping says: To abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration, safeguard the long-term interests of Hong Kong society, and ensure that the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] will be implemented after 1 July 1997, the Chinese Government in 1993 increased the pace of preparations for restoring China's sovereignty over Hong Kong, set up a Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong SAR under the National People's Congress, marshaled all forces from different quarters in Hong Kong, and mobilized every positive factor, in a joint effort to safeguard a smooth transition for Hong Kong. On the economic front, meanwhile, deepening reforms on the mainland enabled Hong Kong to escape the impact of economic recession in the West and to continue its strong momentum of growth. There was considerable growth in Hong Kong's economy, finance, trade, and shipping in 1993. The Hong Kong and mainland economies promoted and supplemented each other. The development of the mainland's economy will be increasingly critical for Hong Kong's prosperity. Hong Kong compatriots can be assured that whatever happens, we will stand together through thick and thin, and will be united in mind and heart with Hong Kong in upholding the policy of "one country, two systems," implementing the Basic Law, and achieving a smooth transition in Hong Kong. Lu Ping said that the deliberation, adoption, and promulgation in 1993 of the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region by the National People's Congress provides a fundamental guarantee for Macao's smooth transition and political handover, and for long-term stability and development after 1999. To implement the Sino- Portuguese Joint Declaration and ensure Macao's smooth transition, China and Portugal will continue friendly cooperation. In 1993, through the joint efforts of people from various quarters, Macao enjoyed social stability, as well as sustained and steady economic development. Its large-scale projects, such as the international airport, progressed well. Of course, work on Macao's transition still requires further cooperation between China and Portugal. The pace of work must be increased. Macao's economy also needs to adopt appropriate measures to solve the problem of industrial transformation and to promote growth. We believe that as long as China and Portugal continue to strengthen friendly cooperation on the basis of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, and as long as people of all quarters are further united in mind and action, there certainly will be a better tomorrow for Macao!
