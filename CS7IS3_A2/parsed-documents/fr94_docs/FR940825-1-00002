FR940825-1-00002 FR940825-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;08&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Brackett Aircraft Company, Inc.; Air Filter Assemblies Installed on Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to airplanes with certain Brackett Aircraft Company, Inc. (Brackett) air filter assemblies incorporating a neoprene gasket design installed between the carburetor heat box and the air filter frame. The proposed action would require repetitively inspecting (visually) the air filter frame for a loose or deteriorating gasket, and replacing any gasket found loose or deteriorated. An accident report where a Cessna Model 172 airplane experienced engine loss because a six-inch piece of neoprene gasket material was lodged in the carburetor prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent gasket particles from entering the carburetor because of air filter gasket failure, which could result in partial or complete loss of engine power. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;08&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, holidays excepted. Service information that applies to the proposed AD may be obtained from the Brackett Aircraft Company, Inc., 7045 Flightline Drive, Kingman, Arizona 86401. This information also may be examined at the Rules Docket at the address above.
