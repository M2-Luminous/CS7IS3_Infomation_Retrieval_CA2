New Hampshire's Department of Environmental Services requires all existing MSWLFs to have either an existing permit or a temporary permit, both of which require compliance with the Federal Criteria in 40 CFR Part 258 pursuant to state laws and regulations, found at New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated Chapter 149&hyph;M:11 and New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules Env-Wm 308.03. The State of New Hampshire is not asserting jurisdiction over Indian land recognized by the United States government for the purpose of this notice. Tribes recognized by the United States government are also required to comply with the terms and conditions found at 40 CFR Part 258. The State of New Hampshire is committed to implementing its MSWLF program in accordance with the principles of environmental justice. The State has expressed this commitment in the narrative portion of its application. EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and during any public hearing held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for New Hampshire's program. EPA will make a final decision on approval of the State of New Hampshire's program and will give notice of the final determination in the Federal Register . The notice shall include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all significant comments. Section 4005(a) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945(a), provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of Section 7002 of RCRA, 42 USC 6972, to enforce the Federal Criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See, 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).
