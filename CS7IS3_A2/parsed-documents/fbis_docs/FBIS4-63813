He stressed in an exclusive interview with Interfax in Brussels today that the Black Sea Fleet was subordinate to the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. This to say that any unilateral actions towards the fleet are illegal, he pointed out. Grachev said that Black Sea Fleet Commander, Admiral Eduard Baltin was right when taking preventive measures and strengthening defense of military facilities within the context of the present situation in Crimea. Commenting on movements by Ukrainian military formations in Crimea, Grachev called this an attempt to exercise military and psychological pressure on the Crimean leadership. This represents no military threat. Ukrainian formations are acting separately, he emphasized. Grachev suggested that this was done in accordance with orders of the Kiev leaders. However, he was sure that Ukraine would not declare war on Crimea since it was a civilized state. On 23 May Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk had discussed the situation in Crimea on the phone. They had unanimously agreed that the situation in Crimea was Ukraine's internal affair. However, Grachev stressed that Russia could not overlook the situation in Crimea. "If an armed conflict starts in this region, it may lead to a civil war between eastern and western Ukraine," Grachev suggested. He emphasized that the presidents had concluded that the situation must be settled by peace political means and negotiations.
