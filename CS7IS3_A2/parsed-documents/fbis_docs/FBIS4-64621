He added that necessary action will be taken against those who were responsible, in line with the outcome of the investigation. Mentese replied to an off-the-agenda speech by Celal Kurkoglu, Social Democratic Populist Party deputy from Adiyaman, at the Turkish Grand National Assembly, which convened under the chairmanship of Vefa Tanir today. In his statement, Mentese remarked that the Ankara security director has been removed from office pending the conclusion of the investigation and the other persons involved in the incident have also been identified. Mentese pointed out that although Turk-Is [Turkish Confederation of Labor], DISK [Confederation of Revolutionary Worker Unions], and Hak-Is [Turkish Moral Rights Workers Union] acquired a permit for the demonstration, many illegal organizations also participated in the demonstrations in Ankara. Members of these organizations, Mentese noted, shouted separatist slogans and carried placards with similar contents. [Begin Mentese recording] As far as we could determine, legal unions belonging to Turk-Is, DISK, and Hak-Is, as well as illegal unions, and the civil servants platform attended the demonstrations. Also attending were members of the Turkish Communist Party [TCP] Marxist-Leninist [ML] organization under the placard of the "Banner of labor"; members of the TCP Spark [Kivilcim] Dev-Genc [Revolutionary Youth] Resistance [Direnis] under the placard of the DIRENIS magazine; members of the Turkish Northern Kurdistan Liberation Organization [Turkiye Kuzey Kurdistan Kurtulus Orgutu] under the placard of the "United socialist alternative, young hope, young liberation"; and members of the Dev-Yol [Revolutionary Path] organization under the placards of "Revolutionary youth, the right to speak, authority, power to the people," and "Struggle until the liberation of Huseyin Mahil Ulas." These are illegal organizations. I continue: Members of the Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left] organization marched under the banners of "Dev-Genc [Revolutionary Youth] free [word indistinct] struggle"; members of the Turkish Revolutionary Communist Party under the banner of "Work, bread, freedom"; members of the Turkish Revolutionary Communists Union [Turkiye Ihtilalci Komunistler Birligi] under the banner of "Sweat of the brow"; members of the TCP-ML-TMLGP [expansion unknown] under the banner of "New democratic youth, partisan youth"; members of Direnis Movement under the banner of ODAK [FOCUS] magazine; members of the Militants for Anarchy and Terrorism under the banner of "Anarchist"; members of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] under the banner of "Long live the brotherhood of peoples"; and members of the Rizgari organization marched under the banner of "Rizgari." [end recording] Mentese declared that despite this, the demonstration was followed with patience to prevent any incidents. When the crowds were about to disperse, however, a group of about 200 people belonging to illegal organizations refused to disperse despite all warnings and insisted on marching towards Kizilay, Mentese reported. He explained that the members of the group stoned the security forces, who in turn, prevented them from entering the prohibited zone. Mentese expressed regret and condemned the action against Ankara Deputy Salman Kaya, who was present at the scene of the incident. Mentese said that those who stoned the security forces, who were fulfilling their duty, should also be condemned in the same way.
