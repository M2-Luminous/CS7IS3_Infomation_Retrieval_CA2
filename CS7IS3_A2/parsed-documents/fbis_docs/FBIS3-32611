This statement was made by Economy Minister Ignacio de Posadas yesterday upon his return from Iran where he headed a commercial mission. De Posadas, who refrained from discussing domestic economic policy, told television Channel 10 that Iranian authorities and businessmen welcomed the initiative to resume the exchange of products, such as meat, where Uruguay has lost its privileged position in the Iranian market. De Posadas explained: "There is interest in establishing a payment mechanism to safeguard the two parties, which was one of the important subjects discussed." Regarding the products that may be of greater interest in the Iranian market, he mentioned rice, beef, milk by-products, and textiles.
