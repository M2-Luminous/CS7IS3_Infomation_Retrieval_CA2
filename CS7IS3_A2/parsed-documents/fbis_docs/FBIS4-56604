FBIS4-56604 "drlat088_j_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-088 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Panama PRD Official Denies Party Linked to Cuba PRD Official Denies Party Linked to Cuba PA0505223694 Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 4 May 94 PA0505223694 Panama City Telemetro Television Network Spanish BFN [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] [Text] PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] Secretary General Mitchel Doens has denied reports that his party is receiving support from the Cuban Government, as claimed by Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] legislator Leo Gonzalez. Doens said PRD members had previous knowledge about the document Gonzalez presented, which Doens described as a political gambit, and he announced that he will file slander complaints against the Molirena legislator in the Peace and Justice Commission and in the Electoral Tribunal. [Begin Doens recording] The only thing I can say is that Mr. Gonzalez is a mouse who got caught in his own trap. A few weeks ago, we had this document in our possession because a friend in the government gave it to us. We immediately wrote a letter to the Justice and Peace Commission and delivered it to commission member Ms. Irene Perurena with the document Mr. Gonzalez yesterday brought to the Foreign Ministry. Earlier, we talked with a top Cuban Embassy official to have him explain that document to us. We found the document to be completely false, considering it contains seven mistakes, including forged signatures of the officials who are allegedly in charge of directions at the Cuban Embassy and in Cuba. Later, Cuban Charge d'Affaires Miguel Martinez delivered this document to the Foreign Ministry, before Mr. Gonzalez did, precisely because of the implications this could have on his diplomatic mission in the country. We can categorically say this is a political gambit that is part of the dirty propaganda tactics being used against our party. [end recording]
