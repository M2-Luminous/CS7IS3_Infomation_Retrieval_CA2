This is a direct relay of the discussion program "Pressclub." Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, Health Minister Irena Belohorska, and Minister of Labor, Social Affairs, and Family Olga Keltosova are here to report on the results of the 84th meeting of the Slovak Government today. As you know, the government today followed an amended agenda. Most points were left out of the agenda, and the session concentrated on the assessment and endorsement of privatization projects and a statement on the current internal political situation. We want to concentrate on both. [passage omitted] What stance has been assumed by the government today on the current situation, and what solutions can you envisage? [Meciar] [passage omitted] The Government of the Slovak Republic therefore proposes that this election period be shortened by half and that it end by 30 June 1994. It is submitting a bill of the constitutional law to the Slovak parliament to this effect. The Slovak Government proceeds from the proposals made within the movement [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)], which state that, should the government reject this date, it would be necessary to rely on the citizens' decision in a referendum. If there is a delay in solving this situation, this will have a negative impact on this state with regard to its position abroad and its internal economic and social situation. What is being prepared for tomorrow and for the day after is extremely foolish and irresponsible. Therefore, the government's stance is that the crisis should be overcome by the citizens as soon as possible. [Announcer] Mr. Prime Minister, you held talks today also in parliamentary, groups where all this has been discussed. Do all deputies agree that early elections should be held in June? [Unidentified speaker] The chairman of the Slovak National Party's parliamentary club, Miroslav Kona, said that early parliamentary elections would suit them, too, but only in the fall. [Meciar] [passage omitted] Can we afford a provisional government and instability for several months? Who would hold talks with it, and what important decisions could such a government make? What would be its time span? The second problem: A number of economic issues are already being worked on, such as loans, talks on transport lines, on commerce and so on. [passage omitted] Having a provisional government can have a serious impact on commercial relations. [passage omitted] Everything will come to a standstill. Take the visit of Mr. Kozyrev, which was to be of key importance and which is not going to take place for these political reasons. This is a great loss for the Slovak Republic, and not only in the political sense. It will, naturally, be reflected elsewhere as well. Therefore a delay is not good for us. [passage omitted] If the governmental bill is not passed in parliament--and we shall submit the proposal already at this parliamentary session--we envisage that petitions will start immediately from the coming Monday. Should 350,000 citizens sign a petition in favor of early elections or in favor of changing the ratio of deputies in parliament or in favor of two other questions, which, according to our proposal, should be answered in a referendum, a referendum is necessary. This means that all citizens will make a decision in a pan-national vote. It is a new institution, common in Switzerland, still not used in our country but it is the most democratic one. [passage omitted] We have been given responsibility by the people; we must humbly and respectfully go to them and ask whether they continue to want us and trust us. If they confirm us, we shall continue to work. If they reject us it is their right which we have to respect. In any case, however, things must be left to run freely in this direction and till then the simplest thing is to leave the government to prepare the elections in a democratic way because any other change would mean enormous losses. [passage omitted] [Unidentified man] I would like to ask about a debate on two amendments to the law on large-scale privatization. You have said that you would like to connect it with a vote of confidence in the government. Is it still true or have you given up this intention? My second question: There have been rumors that pressure actions are being prepared, and that coach trips to Bratislava to support you are being prepared by the districts. Do you know something about this? [Meciar] [passage omitted] We are willing, with regard to this bill, to make some concessions. For example, the finance minister does not need to be the chairman of the supervisory council. We will, however, not retreat on the point of the government having influence on the Presidium of the [National Property] Fund and being interlined with its personnel because the proposal of the other side contains some badly thought-out mechanisms. [passage omitted] [Unidentified man] You have not answered my question: Will you consider the vote of confidence in the government if the privatization bill is not passed? [Meciar] We have discussed it in the government. Part of the cabinet was for connecting the two, the majority was against. This means that the government will not link tomorrow the privatization bill with the proposal of the vote of confidence in the government. Should the Slovak parliament pass a law which is not acceptable by the government, we should return it to parliament in a constitutional way, through the president. [Announcer] What about the pressure actions? [Meciar] This is a novelty to me. If somebody wants to change some structures, he cannot leave out the citizens because consequently they have behaved without restraint. We have, however, not organized it and I know nothing of it. [Announcer] Is the government prepared, for example, for the presence of several hundred people in front of parliament tomorrow who would not behave in a very civilized fashion? [Meciar] [passage omitted] Why should the government deal with it if the public order is not in jeopardy? [passage omitted] Until the citizens violate the public order the government will not take any measures against them. [passage omitted] [Announcer] The president has also given a press conference today: he asked his constitutional experts for opinion on the question to be asked in a referendum with regard to retroactivity. If 350,000 citizens sign a petition in favor of a referendum he will submit the issue to the constitutional court before the referendum is called. [Meciar] [passage omitted] If there are 350,000 signatories, the president is obliged to call a referendum within 30 days. [passage omitted] The force of a referendum surpasses that of the constitutional court. [passage omitted] [Announcer] The constitution says that a deputy is to carry out his duty according to his conscience. A referendum on this issue would be about this basic human right. The constitution says that there can be no referendum on basic human rights. [Meciar] [passage omitted] A deputy cannot be free to the extent that he can act independently of his original programm and of the party on behalf of which he is elected. [passage omitted] It is up to the citizens to decide whether they want to be represented in parliament by Messrs Knazko and company, by Messrs Cernak and company: if the citizens say that they do not want them they will be replaced by people who will, on their behalf, carry out their duties following from their original programs. It is not possible to have part of a movement tear itself away, for the intentions which might not be always be that of common good, and then having them start to destroy the party which has paid for them to be provided for for quite a long time by an institution such as parliament. [passage omitted] [Meciar] According to the Constitution, political parties are independent of the state, and the state representatives have no right to interfere in their internal affairs. If the presidential castle had not been mentioning for months that Mr. Kovac or Mr. Moravcik were to be alternative prime ministers, this crisis did not have to happen. [passage omitted] Therefore the HZDS has decided: Either it will continue to form a government--and we are sincerely willing to talk about coalition--or it will be in opposition and nobody will force upon it any prime minister. [passage omitted] [Announcer] We are to discuss here the course of the government session today. In the afternoon, this session was closed but we presume that you decided about the further destiny of Roman Kovac and Moravcik. They told Slovak Television today that you asked them to leave while Lexa and Hanko said at noon that they left on their own accord. What was the decision you made this afternoon? [Meciar] They went on their own accord. I recommended to them to resign, but it is not the same thing as dismissing them. Mr. Kovac said that they were leaving the cabinet session and they left; it is their business. If somebody has the courage for a political action, he must be able to face the consequences. If somebody is preparing a new government, behind the back of the existing government--and I have spoken to five people who told me that Mr. Kovac had told them to be ready to join the government this week and a sixth was being discussed by somebody else [as heard]--this is an unfair action, to say the least. When we asked Mr. Kovac openly whether he acted in this way he denied it. Mr. Moravcik did the same. When we asked them whether they were preparing a fraction within the parliamentary group, they gave their word of honor that they were not. When we asked them whether they were conducting negotiations with opposition parties, they claimed not only to me but before the whole political board of the movement that this was a lie. This is not an opinion of a minority; this is a political construction which has grown into a destruction of the parliamentary group of the HZDS, into almost conspiratorial talks with other political entities and into the formation of a new government without being asked to do so by the Movement, or by the president, or by the legitimate constitutional bodies. If this is called a normal or alternative activity, we cannot approve of it. Therefore we have said that the right thing is for these gentlemen to leave of their own will. As they do not want to do so, the government finds it natural that in this case I have to submit to the president a proposal to have them recalled because they lost the confidence of the Movement. [passage omitted] Now they rely on the positive attitude of the president towards them. Meciar will propose their dismissal, and the president will not accept it, they think. The government, however, does not want to have them in its midst. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Does it mean, Mr. Prime Minister, that you are going to submit a proposal to have them dismissed? [Meciar] I am going to submit the proposal for their dismissal tomorrow. I have informed the president about it on Monday [14 February]; he asked for time to think it over. The government was unanimous on this. The great majority of the HZDS presidium has decided that they cannot be trusted in this office. Then it is up to me to decide on what pretext to keep them in the government: as representatives of the opposition which they joined? And of what sort of opposition? On what basis? This is against democratic principles and this is another pretext for the creation of a new political problem. [Announcer] The president has said today that you had pointed out to you today that the dismissal of the deputy prime minister and minister Moravcik could have a negative impact on the international reputation of Slovakia. [Meciar] I have told the president that this argument cannot be accepted. What sort of foreign minister announces publicly that the government of which he forms a part should be overthrown? Is this a good signal for the world? Is it good when Mr. Kozyrev is to come, and the government agrees with his visit and decides which member of the government is to hold talks with him and in the meantime, somebody else is holding talks about cancelling this visit? This is working against the government and its policy. There have been also many specific objections to the work of the foreign minister, which the government frequently criticised. The foreign minister knew about them and also the president knew about them. [passage omitted] The president was looking for a pretext to justify what he told me on Monday, and none of us accepted it. I and my deputies, with the exception of Mr. Kovac, and Parliamentary Speaker Mr. Gasparovic held those talks with him. The president has the right to have his opinion and he has also the right, according to that unfortunate constitutional court, to say that he would not accept the dismissals. What will be achieved by this? There will a minister in the government who will represent nobody, who will be there against the will of all, apart from the will of the president. But I am the one who is responsible for the work of the government. Will I be assessed on the work of the person who was forced upon me? [passage omitted] The world wants us to be stable, instead of having another source of tension. I would therefore ask the president to solve the situation speedily to stabilize the situation. [passage omitted] [Announcer] The Czech side has obviously been taken by surprise that the Slovak customs officers have started to ask for special certificates on the quality of [exported] foodstuffs. Minister Dlouhy called it unfair; allegedly you had informed them only 24 hours before the introduction of these measures, and Prime Minister Klaus allegedly had a telephone conversation with you yesterday morning and you promised him that the government would be discussing this problem seriously at its session today. According to the Czech press, he asked us to halt these measures prior to the extraordinary session of the Customs Union. What measures have you adopted? [Meciar] The government has discussed it. It is not such a big problem as it seems as these are usual [word indistinct] norms which must be observed, and everybody who exports food must submit a certificate that his goods are of the agreed quality. The only change is that in the past, the quality certificate was to be submitted to the customs office at the destination and now it is demanded at the border because at the destination this had not been done. Naturally it caused problems for people who had neglected this obligation. Few lorries--not too many--were stuck on the Czech side and this created anxiety. Therefore the government reassessed the situation and asked Mr. Ducky, as chairman of the Customs Union Council, to convene an extraordinary session of the Council tomorrow where everything is to be discussed--not only the quality of goods but also the balance of payment.
