A total of 92 ballots were distributed; the two votes were then held separately. Rudolf Janac, who had been proposed by the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], received 77 votes, and Viliam Vaskovic (proposed by the "Center" coalition) won the support of 76 deputies. A third secret ballot determined that Zoltan Zimmermann (Christian Democratic Movement), Pavol Kinces (Center), Juraj Kamaras (Center), Karol Pittner (SDL), Frantisek Szomolay (Coexistence/Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement), and Igor Mathe (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) became members of the FNM Presidium. No other candidate won the needed more than 50 percent of vote. The seventh member of the FNM Presidium will therefore be elected at the next meeting of parliament. After the promulgation of the results of the secret ballot, NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic declared the extraordinary meeting of parliament closed. The next, 29th, NRSR extraordinary meeting, which will open on 12 April, will be devoted to the Slovak Government's Policy Statement. [passage omitted]
