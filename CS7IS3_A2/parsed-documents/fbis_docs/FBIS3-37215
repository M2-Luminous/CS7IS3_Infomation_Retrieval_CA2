He told journalists on Monday [14 February] that bomb attacks could escalate the military crisis in the center of Europe. To quote Grachev, bomb attacks, even if they are carried out with extreme precision, which he doubts would be the case, would kill many people. He also said that the decision on the withdrawal of the Russian peacekeeping force from Bosnia, if bomb attacks begin, must be taken by the country's political leaders. He said that Russian servicemen would have to perform their peacekeeping mission all the same. "So I don't think the Russian troops should be removed even after bombings," he said. Speaking about Russia's possible participation in the Partnership for Peace project, Grachev said that this document had not yet been discussed by all the parties concerned. Every country interprets this document in its own way, he said. For instance, Eastern Europe and the Baltic States view this document in the context of a transitional period till joining NATO. "For us this is a document which has to do with all European countries because it is expected to ensure European security," said Grachev. He also noted that Russia considered the Partnership for Peace project to be an intermediary step towards an even closer European political alliance under the leading role of the CSCE. On the whole, Russia supports the Partnership for Peace project, he said. He did not say, though, when Russia would join it because, he said, the final instrument of joining this program has not been worked out yet.
