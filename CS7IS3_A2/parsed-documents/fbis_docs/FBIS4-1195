This is the promise given at IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] headquarters yesterday at a special briefing on security at polling stations. [Correspondent Arlene Wainstein] Independent Electoral Commission chairman, Judge Johann Kriegler, says it's unrealistic to expect that there won't be some problems. Flanked by two high-ranking police and army officials, he said firearms would not be allowed at polling stations. [Kriegler] Voters who disregard this request and instruction will be liable for arrest and prosecution. [Wainstein] Nearly 100,000 members of the police will be on duty during the critical voting days next week; and they are ready to arrest anyone who tries to disrupt the voting process. [Police Commissioner Johan Swart] And they will be detained in the police cells until after the election. And the South African Police will do everything in our power to oppose any application for bail. [Wainstein] The SADF [South African Defense Force] also has at least 67 companies of troops on standby with more due to report in the next few days.
