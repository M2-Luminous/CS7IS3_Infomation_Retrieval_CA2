He added that such accusation had adverse impacts on China's export trade worth billions of U.S. dollars. Last year saw 37 such cases, registering the greatest ever number in a single year. There were 12 cases under the anti-dumping accusation during the first quarter of this year which should arouse great concern because such accusation from abroad targeting China's export trade have tended to grow serious. The United States, Canada, the European Community and Australia were the very countries in the past to file protest with China for its alleged dumping overseas. Other countries including Japan, South Korea, Denmark [as received], South Africa, Chile Brazil, Mexico and Nigeria followed suit since 1992. The anti-dumping practice was just against a particular kind of export item in the past but such practice turns to most of China's export items at present. Some South America countries such as Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela accused China of committing alleged dumping of a certain kind of export item in great quantity nearly in each of their anti-dumping movements [sentence as received]. Key export items including machinery products and textiles showed an increasing portion in the items which were alleged to be involved in the dumping practice. Colour televisions, microwave ovens, electric fans and bicycles were put under anti-dumping investigation by the U.S., South Africa and the European Community last year while preparations on anti-dumping campaign were made by Japan, South American countries and the European Community to target China's other export items such as textiles, clothing and sport shoes. Three type foreign-funded enterprises run in China tended to be under attack for their alleged dumping practice overseas. Nearly each anti-dumping campaign carried out abroad in recent years involved products turned out by these enterprises. Bad influence will be cast on the use of foreign capital by China in a long run [sentence as received]. Accusation of dumping made by foreign countries on many occasions mainly lied in some reasons [sentence as received]. First, a long term economic slump in Western countries, the rising trade protectionism and being jealous of China's vast trade surplus in recent years played an important role in such accusation. Second, following the reform of the foreign trade system in China, the export channels tended to increase but administration of and control over export items which carry no export quota nor export permit stopped short. Some enterprises' practice of lowering prices of their products in order to strengthen their competitiveness gave a pretext for such accusation.
