Authoritative sources cited Li Peng's speech at the national work meeting on politics and law: The central authorities are urging the departments of politics and law to study the history and conditions of the formation of triad society inside and outside China and to move to fight against it. Triad society is a major force of disruption -- not only does it constitute an element hostile to social order on its own but it will also be able to collude with other hostile elements in the future. We must mobilize all social forces to nip every kind of triad society in the bud.
