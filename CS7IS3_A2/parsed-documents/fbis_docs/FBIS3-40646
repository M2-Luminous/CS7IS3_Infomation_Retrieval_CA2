K. Sharma: "Biodiversity Convention Comes Into Force"] [Text] London, December 30--The international convention on biological diversity came into force yesterday amid fears that the GATT agreement would make it difficult to address some of the issues raised by the convention. It is a pious hope that provisions of intellectual property rights on genetic resources will not run counter to the wider objectives of the convention. The occasion was used by `Friends of the Earth' and the Labour Party to attack the British government for its failure to fulfil its own obligations to preserve endangered species and habitats. `Friends of the Earth' said the British government was allowing imports of tropical timber that would never be replaced. A Labour spokesman said while the government lectured the Third World nations about preserving rain-forests, it was not protecting natural habitats in Britain. Hedgerows were being destroyed and these needed legal protection. `Friends of the Earth' said the GATT agreement would make things worse in the area of biodiversity. Aid workers, development economists and environmentalists here have been very critical of the GATT agreement's impact on genetic resources and on small farmers, the latter constituting 80 percent of the total in developing countries. In these countries, farmers play an important role in conserving local plant genetic resources and restrictions on free access to these will reduce global biological diversity. Farmers are informal plant breeders and patents on plants are likely to restrict access to a common pool of plant genetic resources, essential to plant breeding. Western experts, barring those employed by biotechnology and seed companies, take a cautious view of the consequences of the extension of intellectual property protection to plant genetic resources for farmers as producers and conservers of biodiversity. They have been pointing out the irony of developing countries being confronted with a system which maintains open access over their genetic resources while establishing private property rights for improved products based on those resources. They wonder whether developing countries could use the patent system to protect their "unimproved" genetic resources and use them as a tool in biodiversity conservation. In the furious debate over GATT in India, perhaps no one suggested that the government could at least do what the state of Queensland in Australia has done. It has passed its own legislation giving it intellectual property rights over genetic information embodied in the animals and plants found in the state. India and other developing countries could use the argument that if genes, gene constructs and genetic characteristics can be patented in industrialised countries, developing countries could also patent their own genetic resources. Of course, there are potential problems, claiming patent rights over genes or genetic characteristics which occur in the wild or in farmers' varieties would give rise to the problem of ownership and if that was vested in the sovereign state, competing claims might be made by other states. The wild plant varieties as well as `landraces' and other farmers' varieties also will not meet the criteria that varieties must be distinct, uniform and stable for protection under plant breeders' rights. But then the system could be adapted. And despite such problems, it is not a developing country but the state of Queensland that has taken as initiative.[Sentence as printed] A study by the Overseas Development Institute points out that pressures towards the wider granting of intellectual property rights over genetic material originate within industrialised countries and the benefits will accrue primarily to companies located there. The erosion of biodiversity in developing countries will continue as commercial agriculture expands into these areas. The intellectual property rights will hinder the protection of agricultural biodiversity, if they jeopardise co-operation between the formal and informal sectors. Any restrictions on access to and exchange of genetic plant material by farmers and public sector plant breeders will have a negative impact in areas where a high proportion of planting material is not purchased. However, a lot would depend on the extent to which ways to protect farmers' informal exchange mechanism and re-use of saved seed can be implemented. Agriculture in developing countries could suffer if free access to plant genetic resources ends, not least because the types of plant produced by the private commercial sector are unlikely to meet the diverse needs of peasant farmers. Diversity is deemed important for food security at global and local levels and agriculture in practically all countries is heavily dependent on a supply of plant genetic resources from other parts of the world. The agricultural systems of the industrialised world are particularly dependent on plant genetic resources from tropical and subtropical regions of developing countries having most of the centres of diversity from which these resources originated.
