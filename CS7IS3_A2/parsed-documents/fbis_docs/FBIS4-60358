This represents one of the primary bases of the economic plan to help increase production. Finance Minister Dr. Muhammad al-Razzaz said that from the allocated amount 7 billion pounds have been designated for services agencies--the administrative body, local administration, and service authorities--and that 5.8 billion pounds have been designated for economic and similar agencies. He added that 22.2 billion pounds have been allocated for investments in the public and private business sectors. He said that the new budget includes some 12.8 billion pounds as investments for the state's service agencies and economic bodies representing approximately 37 percent of the total investments contained in the state's general budget. He emphasized that this increase in investment allocations will help complete necessary projects in very important sectors achieve the goals of economic development. Foremost of these, he said, are the projects of infrastructure and public utilities, such as water, sewage, and development of slum areas, in addition to educational and health requirements, such as schools and hospitals. He said the share of public and private business and cooperative sectors, which amounts to 22.2 billion pounds and represents 63 percent of the 1994-1995 plan investments, reflects the prospective pivotal role of these sectors in increasing production and employment. He noted the new budget's reliance in funding the development plan's projects on intrinsic financing, as well as financing from local savings without resorting to banks to avoid inflationary effects detrimental to the national economy. The finance minister said that foreign loans will be sought on a limited basis and only for production projects, hence the foreign loans included in the general budget do not exceed 2.3 percent.
