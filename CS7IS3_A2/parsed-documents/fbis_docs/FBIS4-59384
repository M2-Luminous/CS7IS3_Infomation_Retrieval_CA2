Andoni: "PLO Reformists Gain Strength Ahead of Self-Rule"] [Text] Deliberations to form a Palestinian authority have triggered an unprecedented internal power struggle as Palestinian officials and leaders seem determined to put an end to Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's single-handed leadership prior to moving to Jericho and Gaza. So far most PLO officials and leaders from the Israeli-occupied territories have declined to take part in the 25-member authority either in protest against the agreement on Palestinan autonomy signed in Cairo on May 4, or against Mr. 'Arafat autocratic style, which, they fear, will dominate the new authority. Prior to Mr. 'Arafat's departure for South Africa to attend the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela, the PLO leadership in Tunis challenged his attempt to single-handedly appoint the Palestinian authority. But, during his brief stay in South Africa, the PLO chairman defied the challenge by appointing by telephone four members from the occupied territories. So far the four leaders from the occupied territories, who are said to have accepted membership in the Palestinian authority, are Fatah head in Gaza Zakariya al-Agha, Frayh Abu-Middayn (also a Gaza close to Fatah), Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas Frayj, and the head of the Palestinian side of the liaison with Israel, Jamil al-Tarifi. By going over the heads of the PLO Executive Committee and prominent PLO leaders in the occupied territories, Mr. 'Arafat is apparently trying to force the reluctant leaders to follow--a tactic that he has perfected in the past. But this time the situation is more complicated as many officials and leaders are wary about the implications of taking part in an authority in charge of implementing an agreement that they either oppose or have strong reservations about. Most, including his partners in the 30-month-of peace process, feel that they were marginalised in the actual negotiations and that Mr. 'Arafat is now trying to impose on them an agreement that they were not party to. In a strongly-worded statment, the Palestine Democratic Union, FIDA, led by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, charged that the pact enables Israel to practically maintain its control over the Gaza Strip and Jericho. FIDA officials, however said that Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh was ready to take part in the Palestinian authority provided Mr. 'Arafat accepted clearly defined terms and democratic basis for the functions of the authority. According to FIDA, the main immediate task is to work on freeing the Palestinian authority from the constraints imposed on it by the agreement. According to the agreement, the Palestinian authority cannot take major or minor decisions without the approval of the Israeli side through a maze of joint committees and subcommittees that will oversee its implementation. Some argue that it is already too late to try to alter the role of the Palestinian authority that has been limitted by the terms of the agreement. Some argue that it is already too late to try to alter the role of the Palestinian authority that has been limitted by the terms of the agreement. The Palestine People's party (PPP), which maintains such a view, has already informed Mr. 'Arafat that it was not participating in the Palestinian authority according to the conditions outlined in the Israeli-Palestinian pact. But it seems that Mr. 'Arafat has underestimated early signs of defiance by completely ignoring last-minute appeals to him not to sign the agreement as soon as the details became known to his colleagues and PLO leaders in the occupied territories. Both Faysal al-Husayni, Fatah's leader in the West Bank, and Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Washington bilateral talks, had urged Mr. 'Arafat not to sign the pact and try to renegotiate some of its terms. In a lengthy memo to the PLO chairman, Dr. 'Urayqat wrote that the pact aimed "at perpetuating, instead of ending, the occupation." Mr. 'Arafat was not able to secure full-fledged support for the accord by his own PLO Executive Committee or the Fatah Central Committee. At a meeting in Tunis on May [no date given], Mr. 'Arafat was said to have not even sought the approval of his colleagues as the issue was presented as a fait accompli. PLO Executive Committee member Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi was particularly outraged by the terms of the economic agreement signed in Paris on April 29. In an internal memo to the PLO Executive Committee, made available to the JORDAN TIMES, Mr. al-Nashashibi said that the Paris pact allowed Israel total control over the Palestinian economy through the joint Palestinian-Israeli economic committee. In Mr. al-Nashashibi's view, by allowing Israel to share, If not to control, economic decision-making, the pact will obstruct the building of a Palestinian national economy. Mr. al-Nashashibi is said to have declined membership in the Palestinian authority. A senior Fatah Central Committee member, Hani al-Hasan, believes that the Paris economic accord is the most dangerous part of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement. Mr. al-Hasan, and his brother, Khalid, who is currently under medical treatment at the Farah centre of the al-Husayn Medical City, are both against the accord and refuse to move to Jericho and Gaza under its terms. So far Mr. 'Arafat has failed in talking any of the cofounders of his Fatah movement to join the authority, as head of the PLO Political Department Faruq Qaddumi has already refused to be part of the new authority. The only exception could be Intisar al-Wazir, widow of PLO military leader Khalil al-Wazir, Abu-Jihad, who has reluctantly accepted her appointment to the authority. But if most PLO leaders are mainly reacting to being excluded from the negotiations process, resulting in an agreement they were not party to, Mr. 'Arafat is not having an easier time with two of his closest partners that continued with the deal all the way through the signing, PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas and economic chief Ahmad Quray'. Both are said to have declined invitations to join the Palestinian authority citing differences with Mr. 'Arafat over the handling of the Palestine Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR). Analysts and PLO officials, however, believe that Mr. 'Arafat will eventually succeed in forming a Palestinan authority. But they say the body will not be a strong one if he failed to recruit credible names with broad following in the occupied territories, especially after losing the support of important leaders like the estranged chief Palestinan negotiator Haydar 'Abd al-Shafi. But many, including opponents of the peace pact, now argue that the only way to contain the damage and to open the way for the emergence of strong nationalist leaders is to ensure that free elections will be held after the setting up of the Palestinian authonomy.
