He highly appreciated the pledge made by CIS member states not to interfere into one another's internal affairs, respect one another's territorial integrity, never apply economic pressure and fight expansionism, chauvinism and ethnic enmity. Suleymenov also stressed the importance of Ashgabat decisions on the setting up of a Commonwealth economic union. "We should follow the example set by Western countries," he emphasized.
