I would say that the cardinal had carried out a very impressive analysis of the global character of the sanctions and their counterproductiveness. We agreed that the sanctions were in fact the inability of the international community to find a political solution for certain conflicts, and that sanctions were hitting the weakest and the most innocent and were, therefore, untenable. The main event of yesterday was the meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. These talks concerned the Yugoslav crisis and its solution, particularly in view of the latest NATO ultimatum concerning the air strikes against the positions of the Bosnian Serbs. We agreed that the only just and justifiable solution is a political one, a political agreement that could be reached among the three warring sides without much interference from outside, an agreement that would take into account their legitimate interests. We also agreed that the agreement on the deployment of a UN peacekeeping battalion between the warring sides -- after the withdrawal of the Serb artillery -- is a sufficient guarantee for a peaceful outcome to the crisis around Sarajevo -- that is, the demilitarization of Sarajevo -- and that this in effect removed all reasons for a possible air raid by NATO against the Serb positions. I would say that the secretary general had a positive attitude toward out request for the lifting of the sanctions, but he stressed that this depends not only on him and his views but primarily on the Security Council members -- that is, some of its members, who are still not ready to do so. We said he preferred a gradual lifting of the sanctions, just as they were imposed. At our request for the reintegration of Yugoslavia into the United Nations, I think he reacted positively, but he also stressed that this also depended on the General Assembly. He suggested that we start preparing the ground for our return to the United Nations. I personally think that he was slightly surprised by the hard attitude, which I presented to him, that the Commission for Sanctions was taking when it came to giving permission connected to humanitarian aid, the humanitarian needs of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. Of course, this relates primarily to energy suppliers and raw materials for medicine. He promised that he would intervene with the Commission for Sanctions so as to make it have a more benevolent attitude, and he personally asked to be informed about my talks with the chairman of the Commission for Sanctions.
