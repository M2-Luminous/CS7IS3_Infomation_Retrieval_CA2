And a day later when asked "Is Boris Yeltsin ruling himself out of the election campaign?" Press Secretary V. Kostikov unequivocally told journalists: "I do not think that the president will leave the bridge unless he is confident that the helm is in safe hands." Your IZVESTIYA correspondent learned that the press secretary had a conversation with the president the day before to obtain explanations ahead of his meeting with journalists regarding the main problems worrying society today. Needless to say, they included the subject of the presidential election campaign. Here is a significant detail: The president's aides put around a dozen newspapers on his desk every day. More often than not he only looks at the headlines, the leads, because he does not have time for anything else. But the president did want to read in full the article published in IZVESTIYA 29 March entitled "Boris Yeltsin Launches Election Campaign," since he did not trust his services' reports and summaries. Here is his response (according to his press secretary). The first signs of political peace or at least truce have emerged in society. The idea of a political accord among various social forces is beginning to take shape. It would be rash to turn Russia into a boxing ring. There are two years to go until the presidential election. Election fever would fuel the situation. A political breathing space is what is needed, a moratorium on political battles. V. Kostikov also hinted at a possible way of B. Yeltsin's joining the election campaign. "Analysts forecasting Yeltsin's departure from the political scene in 1996," he said, "are formulating schemes based on the theoretical party structure in Russia today. At the same time they are becoming distracted from the most important thing -- the population, the voters. Can we rule out the idea of large groups of Russians nominating Yeltsin to stand for another term? In that case Yeltsin would naturally have to make a decision. And that decision would depend on his personal wishes, concept of duty, and political responsibility...." The press secretary did not shirk the question of a possible presidential election victory for Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy. "The very idea of that being possible dramatically reduces the standard of political ethics in society," he said. "A whole series of their statements are outside the law. Implementing these appeals could be disastrous for the country and the population. You cannot inure the population to the idea that a man with the mentality and vocabulary of a street hooligan can end up head of a great country. Yeltsin's team is confident that the president will not surrender Russia to these people." He dwelt in detail on the content of the Accord on Civil Peace, which is being drafted and which the president is consistently forcing through despite certain opposition forces' skeptical attitude to it. According to the press secretary, the eight-page text contains a preamble and the following sections: -- the political life of society; -- regional policy; -- nationalities policy; -- socioeconomic policy; -- the security of citizens and the state; -- integrity, ethics, morality, and culture; -- the conditions and mechanisms for the fulfillment of the agreement; -- the responsibility of the signatories to the document. Presidential aides G. Satarov and Yu. Baturin, as well as representatives of the parliament, government, and public organizations, have taken part in drafting the Accord on Civil Peace. The press secretary stressed that the sides did not seek compromises in the field of ideology because that is impossible. The task was to highlight those points that would act as a reliable base for cooperation among all forces in order to ensure peace in the country. Efforts must be concentrated on specific issues, for instance a contentious government decision or the threat of wholesale strikes, etc. The document makes provision for the creation of a conciliation commission. But the president is not happy with the text at the moment. He thinks it ponderous and reminiscent of a constitution. There will be consultations over the next few days with the future parties to the agreement. It is already known that the president has had conversations on this issue with V. Shumeyko, who voiced a positive opinion of the draft document. Regrettably, the State Duma will probably give it, if not a hostile reception, then at least a very critical one. Nevertheless, no matter what the result of these efforts, one thing is important. The whole range of political views and party plans will be manifested during the consultations.
