In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR, Dudin said it has become important that the Arab parties meet to discuss this subject very seriously so that the Arab measures will have a collective meaning, as did the original Arab League decision on the Arab boycott of Israel. However, he said it is not strange that the U.S. Senate adopts such decisions that are supportive of, and openly biased toward Israel. This decision also shows disrespect for the broad relations between Arab countries and the United States. He wondered how the U.S. Administration would be able to reconcile the Senate decision with the desire to activate U.S. arms sales to the Arab countries, especially the rich ones whose arms purchase figures are astronomical. Dudin ruled out the possibility that the U.S. Administration could implement this decision unless implementation is accompanied by U.S. pressures on Britain, France, Russia, and other countries that compete with the United States in supplying Arab countries with weapons. He expected the U.S. Administration to circumvent this decision by arguing that the peace process is at an advanced stage, and its success will lead, sooner or later, to the lifting of this boycott of Israel. He said, however, that from the practical point of view, the decision may have one direct effect; it will intensify pressures on the Arab parties to the Arab-Israeli negotiations to expedite reaching reconciliation arrangements with Israel that are below these parties' aspirations, and said such an effect is very likely.
