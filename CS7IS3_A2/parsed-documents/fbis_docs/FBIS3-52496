It was expected that the Indians would reiterate their well-known position on Kashmir that the UNCIP's [UN Commission for India and Pakistan] resolutions on the issue were no longer relevant. Equally predictable was Pakistan's response that any efficacious solution to the Kashmir problem must be sought within the framework of these resolutions. As both sides stuck to their own positions, the talks could not but founder on the rock of disagreement on Kashmir. And though the joint statement issued at the end of the seventh round mentions the possibility of the continuation of talks, no date has been fixed for these. This itself is a tacit admission of the growing futility of negotiations at the foreign secretary-level. The outcome of the talks could, however, have been different had the Indians not come to the negotiating table with an agenda which did not leave any room for compromise. One indication of this was a statement by Dinesh Singh, India's minister for external affairs, on the eve of the talks, parroting the old theme of Kashmir being part of India. The Indians, in fact, had sealed the fate of the seventh round before it had even begun. But the intransigence and obduracy are the hallmarks of Indian diplomacy that for long have blighted the prospects of peace in the South Asian region. And though it is important to keep this factor in view while dealing with Delhi, more significant is to devise an effective, long-term counter to this Indian attitude. Sadly, so far our foreign office mandarins have failed to come up with such a strategy. Their flaccid response to India's intense diplomatic moves on Kashmir is a testimony to this fact. The Indians, despite committing some of the worst crimes against humanity in Kashmir, have been trying hard, with some success, to convince the world that they have a case on Kashmir. Pakistan, on the other hand, has not been able to elicit a positive response from the world community, even though its stand on Kashmir is much stronger and more cogent than Delhi's. This failure becomes all the more glaring if seen in the light of the fact that in today's world no State can violate human rights with impunity and not incur international odium and censure. But thanks to our diplomatic fecklessness, Delhi has been able to perform the are feat of killing Kashmiris and feigning innocence in the court of international public opinion at the same time. The failure of the seventh round of secretary-level talks should be an occasion for our policy makers to draw a long-term India policy with clear cut and well-defined goals; one of which should be to not let world focus shift from Delhi's oppression in Kashmir. Once the goals have been defined, all diplomatic efforts should be geared towards achieving these. More crucially, the political leadership now has to realise that foreign policy is too serious a business to be left to erring bureaucrats. Difficult political problems, whether domestic or foreign, are best dealt with at the political level.
