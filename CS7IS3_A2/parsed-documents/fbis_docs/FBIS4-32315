In the course of the previous day as well as last night the entire line of Brcko's defense was the target of the Chetnik infantry arms, antiaircraft machine guns, and rifles. The enemy started the shelling early yesterday evening. The most powerful artillery activities were against Boderiste." "There was no peace on the central part of the Brcko front either," Deronjic continues, reporting attacks from Browning guns, portable launchers, and rifles. Deronjic also reports the "regrouping of enemy forces" and says that a "high concentration of the aggressor's manpower has been spotted in the western part of Brcko's defense. The soldiers of the Brcko 108th Motorized and the 108th Infantry Brigades are ready to resist any possible attacks of the Serbian aggressor." From Gradacac, the Information Service of the (?105th) Chivalrous Motorized Brigade says that "the aggressor violated the cease-fire considerably on the Gradacac front last night." As the service says, from a 120-mm mortar in Gornje Krecane he fired (?five) bombs at Gradacac and its suburbs, however, "luckily without any major consequences. At the same time the entire western defense sector was exposed to sporadic but very intense fire from antiaircraft guns, antiaircraft machine guns, and all types of infantry arms. The situation calmed down at approximately 2200. Our fighters did not respond to the fire." As it is reported, "the morning in Gradacac is peaceful." "On the Zavidovici front the Chetnik offensive continues with unabated intensity," the Press Center of the 3d Corps reports. "Following an artillery preparation from all types of mortars and tanks and the entire antiaircraft arsenal, infantry attacks were attempted in several directions. Major forces attempted a breakthrough in the direction of access to Kazici, Donja Blizna, Gornja Blizna, and on the line Lokve-Zedni Vrh. The units of the 3d Corps have resisted all the attacks," the press center reports. "A gross violation of cease-fire was also noted on the Teslic-Tesanj front, where Tesanjke, Tesanj, the region of Vrt, (?Salamanov) and [word indistinct] Klanje were shelled. The intensified movement of buses and trucks in this area heralds new Chetnik infantry attacks."
