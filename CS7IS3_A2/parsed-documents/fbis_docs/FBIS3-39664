Defense Minister Ter Beek informed the Second Chamber on Wednesday [16 February] that (confidential) plans had been drawn up for that eventuality. The troops -- which include 3,100 Netherlanders following the "deployment" of the reinforced mobile air battalion at the end of March -- can be withdrawn from Bosnia if they become, or threaten to become, the target of retaliatory acts by the Serbs. In the event, Netherlands transport units will be protected by British troops. The signal corps will leave with the battalion with which they are on active service. The Nordic (Scandinavian) battalion will assume responsibility for the logistics unit, comprising roughly 400 men, stationed in Lukavac. "Dutchbat," the battalion of infantrymen from the mobile air battalion, will be assigned its own area of responsibility (Srebrenica and Zepa in eastern Bosnia), and will have to supervise less heavily armed UN troops from other countries in the event of evacuation. The evacuation will be carried out as quickly as possible from the port of Split using Navy vessels from various countries, including the Netherlands. Yesterday, Minister Ter Beek went into the evacuation plans in detail; the Chamber expressed concern over the risks run by UN troops in Bosnia. Both Ter Beek and Foreign Minister Kooijmans left it in no doubt that if the Serbs fail to carry out the desired withdrawal of their heavy weaponry around Sarajevo or submit them to UN control before the ultimatum -- Monday morning 0000 GMT -- expires, then the United Nations and NATO will carry out their threat of air strikes on Serbian artillery positions. Both ministers maintained that there could be no question of the deadline being extended. In addition, the possibility proposed by the United Nations of bringing the heavy weapons under radar control was rejected by The Hague. Physical control is absolutely essential. Moreover, the Netherlands does not support the idea of urgent European Union consultations before Monday, as the Greek presidency has proposed. NATO and the United Nations must both lend their support to air support and air strikes. The authority to give this support resides in the first instance with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's special envoy in Bosnia, the Japanese Akashi. Thereafter, the use of air strikes will be jointly decided by the commander of the NATO southern sector, U.S. General Boorda, and the UNPROFOR commanders in the former Yugoslavia and Bosnia, the French General Cot and the British General Rose. According to Kooijmans, an effective ultimatum must make the warring factions see that they are heading for disaster. He hopes that demilitarization and the placing under UN control of the Bosnian capital constitutes a first step toward an overall peace settlement. The international community must exploit the situation by also guaranteeing to protect the other five "safe areas" against the Muslims. Kooijmans and Ter Beek emphasized that the ultimatum primarily constitutes a means of exerting political pressure with a view to urging the warring factions to resume peace talks. Ter Beek said: "The ultimatum will only prove successful if there is no need to resort to bombardments. Nonetheless, there may, and can, be no misunderstanding the fact that the Netherlands and other allies are prepared to go ahead with air attacks."
