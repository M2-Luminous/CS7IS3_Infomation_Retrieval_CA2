He said that the Thai Government has been trying to both suppress and prevent prostitution and the abuse of women and children. He said the problem exists not only in Thailand, but everywhere, and therefore it is unfair to accuse Thailand in that manner. Regarding the procurement of Thai women for prostitution abroad, the deputy permanent secretary said those responsible for the trade are foreigners, including the American people themselves who lure Thai women for prostitution with the connivance of Thai people. He believed other countries have an understanding for Thailand regarding the U.S. accusation. The Foreign Ministry and Thai embassies will explain this matter to foreigners for the sake of better understanding. They will also launch a campaign to prevent Thai women from being lured for prostitution abroad.
