The Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, and Family provided us today with information on this material. Marta Cierna comments: [Cierna] The members of the Moravcik Cabinet had the opportunity to acquaint themselves with the real social situation last year. The report says that there was a further decline in living standards in 1993. The worsening of living standards manifested itself mainly in the continuing increase in the cost of living, the reduction of the purchasing power of the population, and rising unemployment. The introduction of the new tax system, changes in the VAT [value-added tax], and the devaluation of the currency also affected the social situation. Therefore, although the overall income of the population grew by 19 percent compared to 1992, its real value fell by 2.6 percent. The average nominal income was 5,310 korunas [Sk]; the average income of employees in the private sector was Sk42 more. The cost of living, however, grew much faster than incomes. The social groups most affected were families with small children, large families, and pensioners. The number of families that asked municipal authorities for social benefits--for example, the food allowance--went up by as much as 25 percent compared to 1992. The social situation affected families with one or both unemployed parents in particular. This was caused, apart from other things, by stricter conditions for the payment of social benefits to the unemployed. Regional differences in the rate of unemployment became greater as unemployment grew. The number of long-term unemployed went up as well. With regard to pensioners: Although pensions went up twice in 1993, the first increase beginning 1 March was only 3 percent, and the second, from 1 December, was 6 percent. The average pension was Sk2,367. Although the state spent Sk2.7 billion more on pensions in 1993 than in 1992, pensioners' living standards declined significantly.
