The passing of the law will strengthen the legal framework which is now operating on the basis of the regulation signed by the president in January. While in the FCIS, Yeltsin proposed to restore the investigative department to the service, which had been taken away from it after the president had signed a decree in December ordering the reorganization of the security agencies of the Russian Federation. It has become clear since that time that the move complicated the activity of the FCIS, as well as of the prosecutor's office and the interior affairs agencies. They had to investigate cases for which they had no adequate experience and lacked appropriate support.
