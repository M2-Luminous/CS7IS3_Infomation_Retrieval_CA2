It is creating the conditions for an upturn in the economy, laying the foundations for the way to a stable society and well- being. Today not everyone has decided what to do with their privatization vouchers. I understand that this is a difficult question for many -- where can they invest their voucher profitably, how not to miscalculate. I want to tell you that in April and May enterprises from the oil and gas industry, non-ferrous metallurgy, and telecommunications, high-tech enterprises from the defense complex, and major Russian exporters will be put forward at voucher auctions. This is the most reliable and profitable sector of our economy. There is still time before 30 June to think about this. But I would advise you to hurry and not put off until tomorrow what can be done today. The choice is yours. I wish you success.
