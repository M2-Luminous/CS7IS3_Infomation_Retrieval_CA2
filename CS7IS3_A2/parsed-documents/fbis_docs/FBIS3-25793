In an interview with this reporter some days ago, the person in charge of the Complaints Office of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission responded to a number of relevant questions raised by the masses. When this reporter asked the official how discipline inspection offices process accusations and complaints against party members, he said: According to the "Regulations," discipline inspection offices have a duty to handle accusations and complaints against party members or party organizations which violate the party constitution, intra-party regulations, and the party's lines, principles, policies, and decisions, and against those party members who abuse their powers for personal gain or corrupt the party's work style. Specifically, everyone is allowed to send to discipline inspection organs reports against those party members or party organizations that distort or refuse to implement the party's lines, principles, and policies in violation of political discipline; those who refuse to follow the party's decisions or to accept the job assigned by the party in violation of organizational discipline; those who do not abide by the state financial laws and regulations in violation of financial and economic discipline; those who do not act in accordance with relevant policies in foreign-related dealings in violation of the discipline relating to foreign affairs; those who perpetrate economic crimes, including practicing graft; and those who are overly bureaucratic, neglect their duties, abuse their power for personal gain, bend the law for the benefit of their relatives and friends, harbor evildoers and cover up evil deeds, employ trickery, and are morally degenerate. According to the "Regulations," the discipline inspection offices also tackle appeals lodged by party members or party organizations against party disciplinary punishment or other punishment meted out to them by discipline inspection offices. "Party disciplinary punishment" refers to five disciplinary measures against individual party members and to punishment of convicted party organizations by reorganizing or disbanding them. In addition, the discipline inspection offices as supervisory organs within the party also address problems concerning party discipline and the party's work style including opinions, suggestions, enquiries, and reports against the people concerned. Regarding the rights and duties of the persons involved, the official said: The six rights and three duties stipulated in the "Regulations" give, through the process of making accusations and complaints, concrete expression to the citizens' rights and duties stipulated in the constitution and to the party members' rights and duties stipulated in the party constitution and in the "norms [zhun ze 0402 0463]." No organizations or individuals are allowed to prevent the persons involved to exercise these rights; neither are any persons involved allowed to refuse to perform their duties. As required by the "Regulations," we must protect the accuser and earnestly investigate and handle retaliation cases; on the other hand, we must safeguard the accused's rights and interests and expose and deal with frame-up cases. When asked about measures taken by the discipline inspection offices to protect informants, the official said: Discipline inspection offices at all level take the following measures according to the party constitution, the "norms," and the "Regulations": One, keep the informant and his report secret. The person to whom the case is assigned is required not to leak the informant's name and his report to any irrelevant people, and if he does, he will be investigated to determine his liabilities. Two, no unauthorized attempts are allowed to find out the anonymous letter writer. Support and encouragement should be given to those informants who reveal matters as they stand. Even if what they expose does not agree with facts, no organizations and individuals are allowed to take disciplinary action against them so long as they do not intentionally invent a story to frame up others. No unauthorized efforts are allowed to identify the handwriting of the anonymous letter. If the accusation does not tally with the facts, we should find out whether the accuser has made a mistake or has tried to frame up others on purpose. In the former case, we should clarify the facts among a limited number of people to eliminate the harm done to the accused and exhort the accuser to make no more similar mistakes in future; in the latter case, we must make investigations, which should be conducted by the units handling the accusation with the assistance of relevant party organizations, to determine the accuser's liabilities.
