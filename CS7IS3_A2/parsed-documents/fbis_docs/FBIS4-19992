Rapid progress in negotiations is expected when the United Nations arms embargo against South Africa is lifted after this week's elections. BAe has strong prospects of securing the sale of well over 20 Hawk trainer-fighter aircraft, ultimately worth more than 500m pounds. Any deal could involve initial exports from Britain, followed by local manufacture in South Africa. An alternative would be for all the manufacturing to be carried out in South Africa under licence. BAe and Denel, the South African defence manufacturer, are understood to have been in talks for months about a Hawk purchase. Swan Hunter, GEC's Yarrow subsidiary in Glasgow and Southampton-based Vosper are battling for a near-450m pound order for up to six corvettes. Victory for Swan Hunter would secure the survival of the Tyneside yard. CMN [Maritime Shipping Company], a French shipbuilder, is in negotiations to buy Swan. In the past, both Vosper and GEC have expressed an interest in the company. South Africa wants the small warships to modernise its navy, which has been run down during the years of the embargo under UN Resolution 558. The resolution is widely expected to be repealed soon atter the elections. The British government has cleared the way for both Hawk and corvette deals by inviting Denel's Atlas Aviation subsidiary to bid for the 2 billion pound contract for a new British army attack helicopter. Atlas is offering its Rooivalk helicopter and has teamed up with Marshall Aerospace of Cambridge which would assemble the aircraft if it wins the competition. Rival bidders include Westland with McDonnell Douglas's Apache, GEC with the Amencan Cobra helicopter, and BAe with the Franco-German Eurocopter. The government move emerged in a written parliamentary answer by Jonathan Aitken, the defence-procurement minister and is conditional on the UN arms embargo being lifted. It has given a big fillip to BAe, which has been in contact with the South African air force about a possible Hawk sale for two years. The Hawk 100 and Hawk 200 models are widely regarded as the best trainer-fighters in the world, and would replace South Africa's Impala two-seat trainers, which are made by Atlas. The form of a deal, involving substantial local manufacture would be similar to a BAe contract with South Korea, agreed two years ago and worth about 1.7 billion pounds. Most of the Hawks will be built in South Korea after export of an initial tranche from Britain. A BAe-Atlas deal could open the way to further Hawk sales in southern Africa. Zimbabwe already operates the original Hawk 60 jet and might want to buy a newer model. John Weston, head of BAe's defence subsidiary, has forecast that the company will win orders for up to 400 Hawks worth 7 billion pounds during this decade. Apart from South Africa and long-established prospects in Saudi Arabia and India BAe has high hopes of selling to Australia and Singapore. The order prospects were revealed last month in a briefing to City analysts by Rolls-Royce, whose Adour engine powers the aircraft.
