International commercial flights to Haiti stop at midnight tonight. Shortly before the deadline set by the United States and Canada, U.S. airlines stopped flying to Haiti in compliance with the extension of the embargo declared by the UN Security Council against the Haitian military government. These measures, together with the cancellation of visas to Haitian businessmen, important civilian officials, and military officers, are designed to force the coupist government to step down and reinstate deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Stanley Schrager, U.S. Embassy spokesman in Port-au-Prince, has confirmed that petitions for asylum from approximately 1,000 Haitians are being reviewed. If the petitions are approved, these Haitians will permitted to travel on chartered flights. Meanwhile, internal repression is increasing in Haiti. The government of Emile Jonassaint, which has not been recognized internationally, has forbidden foreign journalists to travel outside the Haitian capital. Today in Santo Domingo, President Joaquin Balaguer voiced his hope that the economic embargo against Haiti will come to an end soon, arguing that the Dominican Republic is having to spend enormous amounts of money to prevent contraband. Balaguer added that his country is strictly complying with the embargo by closely monitoring the border. Nevertheless, he did not rule out the possibility of a few gallons of fuel being smuggled across the extensive border. Meanwhile, officials of the Balaguer government said they will move to ban the presence of foreign troops on Dominican territory to reinforce the economic embargo against Haiti. Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral said: "We cannot accept, whatsoever, the presence of foreign troops to reinforce the border." Herrera Cabral's remarks came into response to President Carlos Menem's offer to dispatch Argentine troops to reinforce the embargo against Haiti. The offer had been made during Menem's meeting with President Bill Clinton in Washington. Two weeks ago, Argentina became a member of the "Friends of Haiti" group, which includes France, the United States, Canada, and Venezuela. Herrera Cabral said the Dominican Republic is bearing the full financial burden of maintaining troops along the border without the assistance of any international organization.
