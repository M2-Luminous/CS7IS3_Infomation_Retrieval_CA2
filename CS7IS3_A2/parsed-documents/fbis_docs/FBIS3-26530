At the meeting, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, expressed important opinions on how to successfully implement the guidelines of the instructions of the central authorities. He said: In his speech to the national propaganda and ideological work conference, Comrade Jiang Zemin explicitly pointed out that the fundamental principle for the 1994 work is to comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to accelerate the building of the socialist market economic structure, to maintain the sustained, rapid, and sound development of the national economy, to safeguard political stability, and to promote the all-round progress of society, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line. The provincial party committee, the provincial government, and all other levels of party committees and governments should firmly implement the fundamental principle for the 1994 work set forth by the central authorities, should explicitly, firmly, and unswervingly follow the instructions of the central authorities, should consciously submit themselves to the overall interest of the whole party, and should appropriately organize, arrange, and guide the work in all fields in line with the guidelines and instructions of the central authorities. Cheng Weigao said: This year, centering on accelerating the pace of building the socialist market economic structure, we should really attend to the propaganda by media and use correct public opinions to guide the vast numbers of cadres and the masses to support, plunge into, and take part in reform. We should strengthen the sense of overall interest and handle affairs in accordance with the reform plans worked out by the central authorities. We should be meticulous in organization and careful in arrangements to ensure the smooth implementation of all reform measures. Cheng Weigao said: Reform is in fact a process of readjusting the pattern and relationship of profits. At present, in maintaining stability, we should pay attention to the following several fields: We should correctly comprehend and comprehensively implement the principle of developing the national economy in a sustained, rapid, and sound manner and seize all possible opportunities to accelerate the pace of economic development in an effort to fulfill the goal of quadrupling the 1980 GNP and making the people relatively well-off. We must, however, persist in the principles of doing our best and acting according to our capability rather than lopsidedly pursuing high growth speed, blindly expand the scale, undertaking low-level and duplicated construction projects, and running after the output value without social demands and economic returns. We should place the emphasis of economic development on readjusting structure and deepening reform. We should pay high attention to and concentrate our efforts on the price work and on the price reform. At the same time, we should strengthen the inspection, supervision, and control over commodity prices. We must pay attention to the work concerning daily necessities to ensure the supply of daily necessities of the masses. We should conscientiously persist in the principle that first the people must have sufficient food and second socialist construction must be carried out. We should ensure the on-schedule issuance of wages to the administrative and institutional units. We should understand the weal and woe of the masses and properly solve the masses' difficulties in livelihood. We should resolutely deal blows to fake and inferior products to safeguard the interests of consumers. We should further attend to the building of democracy and the legal system, deeply conduct the education on the legal system, foster the authority of the law, and handle affairs in strict accordance with the law. Cheng Weigao demanded: The emphasis of economic work should be really shifted to deepening reform, changing mechanisms, optimizing structures, and improving efficiency. At present, we should give prominence to the work in the following several aspects: We should truly put agriculture in an essential position, and firmly and unremittingly grasp the production of grain, cotton, and edible oil. We should develop the rural economy in an all-round manner. We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference, stabilize the basic policies concerning the countryside, deepen the rural reform, and ensure the stable increase in grain, cotton, and edible oil output. We should appropriately fix the scale of investment in fixed assets and the speed of economic development. We should not only ensure the fulfillment of the targets set for every quarter but also ensure the basic balance between total supply and total demand in an effort to avoid major ups and major downs in the economy and to ensure the smooth progress of reform in a relatively relaxed environment. We should energetically develop the large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, should continue to guide enterprises to change their mechanisms and make explorations and innovations for the modern enterprise system. In opening to the outside world, we should accelerate the pace and stress on practical results. At the same time, we should further pay attention to opening to the domestic areas, extensively develop lateral integrations and cooperation, energetically develop education and scientific and technological undertakings. Cheng Weigao stressed in conclusion: In face of the arduous tasks on this year's reform and construction, leading organs and leading cadres at all levels must further improve their leadership art, improve their work style, and pay attention to implementation of their work.
