From 21 to 24 December, Chen Junsheng conducted inspections of Hunan's grain market and studied problems in the province's agriculture and rural economic development. Chen Junsheng said: Grain procurement prices were rather low. Therefore, the appropriate upward movement of grain prices has a reasonable side to it because peasants will be able to get good prices for their grain. However, in some localities grain prices have risen sharply over a short period of time; this is abnormal. He pointed out: Total grain output for 1993 is expected to top 450 billion kg. The amount of grain procured will be roughly the same as last year. As of now, the grain procurement plan is 80 percent complete, state grain depots are well-stocked, and there is more than enough grain to ensure adequate supply. He added: Why are grain prices rising sharply in some localities? Reports from localities indicate the following reasons: 1) A chain reaction to grain price rises in some major grain marketing areas. 2) Some peasants are unwilling to sell grain in the belief grain prices will increase next year; certainly, natural disasters are also a factor. 3) State-owned grain departments -- notwithstanding the great deal of work they have done in terms of procurement and marketing -- have failed to bring into full play their role as the major channel of circulation. Chen Junsheng stressed: We must increase macroeconomic control; we must ensure market stability and bring to a quick end the irrational, runaway increases in grain price in some localities so the interests of both producers and consumers are protected. Chen Junsheng pointed out: In drafting next year's production plans, we must see to it the readjustment of the rural production structure and the development of a type of farming that provides high yields of fine quality with maximum efficiency are carried out under the preconditions of a steady increase in grain output. He added: We are in the middle of a severe winter. Localities must take advantage of all favorable conditions to help people in disaster-ridden areas; in particular, they should properly handle the food supply for the victims of natural calamities. Accompanying him in the inspection tour were Yang Yongzhe, deputy director of the State Council Research Office, and Zhang Yanxi, vice minister of agriculture.
