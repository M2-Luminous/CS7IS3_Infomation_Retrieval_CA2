Speaking to CTK after his meeting with President Michal Kovac, Dzurinda said he wanted to proceed according to a concept of the development of the Slovak infrastructure which he had started before Meciar's government. "I have received signals that a number of privatization acts in this field were lately quite strange and I intend to check on them thoroughly," he said. "I hold the opinion that a new government should suspend the privatization decisions the previous cabinet took after February 15 and to check them before proceeding to its own activity in this field," Dzurinda said. Asked how he intended to solve the conflict of former Transport Minister Roman Hofbauer with the Radio Free Europe (RFE) Dzurinda said that if it became clear that the outgoing cabinet tried to stop RFE broadcasting in Slovakia then he would see that it was resumed as soon as possible and the matter settled so that RFE could broadcast in the future in an absolutely calm atmosphere.
