Cooperation between the Liberals and the Conservatives has been shaken several times recently. Following a reconciliation meeting between the two parties' coordinating committee last Tuesday [15 March], it was decided that the parties would continue to work toward creating a nonsocialist-liberal government after the coming Folketing elections. Conservative leader Hans Engell was the cause of the latest furor in the nonsocialist camp. He opened the door to discussions on expanding the possibility of investing wage-earner funds in businesses. This elicited harsh criticism from the Liberals, from the Danish Employers Association, and from Danish Industry. On the other hand, as expected, Engell was warmly embraced verbally by Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, since the government is making a conscious effort to split Liberal-Conservative cooperation. This kind of basic political truth is known all too well by the leaders of the Liberal and Conservative Parties and their main concern is to keep the two parties together as a possible alterative government. Consequently, the two parties issued a joint news release following the Tuesday meeting of their coordinating committee. The meeting, by the way, had already been arranged before Engell stole the nonsocialist scene last week. Nothing was left to chance, however. Engell and Liberal leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen clarified a number of issued over the telephone on Monday. They agreed to issue a joint statement to the press and it was polished up by Liberal Vice Chairman Anders Fogh Rasmussen the same day. After a friendly luncheon meeting of the coordinating committee at Engell's office on Tuesday, the news release was sent out. It stated that the two parties had begun to develop a joint election platform, containing general guidelines for economic policy. It was stressed that during the coming months the parties would strive to coordinate their political statements at regular meetings of the coordinating committee. However, the political reality is such that a power struggle between the two parties has now clearly begun. The Conservatives are now emerging from the shadows of the Tamil affair, and they have recently become more and more irritated over the Liberals' posture as the leading opposition party and Ellemann-Jensen's style as a prime minister candidate. Moreover, Engell is now confident enough to act more firmly as the Conservative leader who must demonstrate that the Conservative Party is an independent party and not the Liberal Party's little brother. "Nonsocialist votes that work" was Poul Schluter's slogan in the 1977 elections, and it is still valid. During the past half year, Engell has talked to a number of business leaders and he has noted an increasing need for new ways of thinking in many areas. The question of ATP [Labor Market Supplementary Pension] and the Wage Earners Cost of Living Fund investments are one example. Thus, Engell spoke out in an interview with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE last Sunday, without first informing the Conservative Folketing group and, of course, without informing Liberal Party members. Many Conservatives were pleased by Engell's manner of making the political agenda, at least for a time, for the Liberals and for the government. The political turmoil has strengthened Engell's position. The Conservative leadership is simply shrugging off the Liberals' reaction to the proposal in the form of predictable objections to "fund socialism through the back door." In the view of the Conservatives, every time the Liberals have brought up controversial proposals they have assumed that the Conservatives would simply stand by silently. But now that the Conservatives have spoken, the Liberals are suddenly talking about a threat to Conservative-Liberal cooperation. The Liberals feel that the Conservatives not only take positions on Liberal proposals, but that they clearly criticize Liberal policies. And it is this that is the threat to Conservative-Liberal cooperation. Among other things, the Liberal leadership is still bitter over the fact that the day before the Liberal Party's national meeting on the EU on 26 February, Engell (in an interview with JYLLANDS-POSTEN) distanced himself from the Liberals' EU policy and warned against making EU policy a political battle ground in Denmark. Liberal politicians warn that the two parties could end up as they did in the 1970's, when in every decisive situation the Social Democrats managed to play the Liberals and Conservatives off against each other so that, despite a nonsocialist Folketing majority most years, Denmark had a Social Democratic minority government. Another concern is also clearly discernible in the Liberal Party. The party's leading politicians are afraid that, in reality, the Conservatives do not actually want the Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party majority after the Folketing elections, toward which the Liberals are working. This majority would make Ellemann-Jensen prime minister of a strong nonsocialist bloc that would work against the Social Democrats and the middle parties. This concern of the Liberals is not without basis in reality. The Conservatives want a Liberal-Conservative government, but they are not particularly interested in forming a bloc with the Progress Party as a supporting party in Folketing. The Conservatives would like to use a Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party majority as a battering ram for creating a nonsocialist government. But they would also like for a future nonsocialist government to work together with the middle parties. This is why many Conservatives stress the idea of including the middle parties in a coalition, knowing full well that a nonsocialist government after the next elections is highly unlikely. Regardless of the election outcome, the three small parties in the present government cannot go from Rasmussen to Ellemann-Jensen in the fall of 1994. But perhaps in the following elections, possibly in 1996, they could turn from Rasmussen to Engell. Engell's statements on the wage-earner funds have served as a catalyst in the escalating debate over the difference between the Liberals and the Conservatives. But EU policy is certainly the area in which the major difference between the Liberals and Conservatives will be seen. The Liberals' proposal for a national referendum in the near future on Danish membership in the WEU [Western European Union], the party's official line in favor of eliminating all of Denmark's exception clauses as soon as possible, the Liberals' acceptance of less power for the smaller EU nations and, especially, the decision at the Liberal Party EU congress that the EU should have a two-chamber system in which the European Parliament would be one of the legislative chambers are all elements that the Conservatives oppose. The Conservatives do not want a confrontation over Denmark's EU policy. A more peaceful development that would guarantee a yes vote in a future referendum is more in line with the Conservatives' thinking. EU policy is also an area that can make cooperation difficult for the Liberals, Conservatives, and Progress Party. It would be difficult to reconcile the EU position of the Liberals with that of the Progress Party. Even though the Liberals and Conservatives are now drawing up a joint election platform, they will continue to act as independent parties, the party leaderships state. The Liberals released a tax plan the other day that the Conservatives knew nothing about. The Conservatives have remained silent on the plan, while the government is shooting it down. Next week the Conservatives will present a report on the political economy of education, taxation, and business policy. And what about the candidate for prime minister? After the meeting on Tuesday, Ellemann-Jensen was asked if they had discussed who would become prime minister. "Yes, we did. One of us two," Ellemann-Jensen said, with a nod toward Hans Engell.
