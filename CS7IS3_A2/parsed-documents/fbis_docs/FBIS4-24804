To change these conditions, it is necessary to invest more in the technical transformation in state-owned enterprises, step up the pace of transformation, and take the road of developing extended reproduction, on the basis of the existing scale. Xu Penghang said: To encourage technical progress in enterprises, the state has, in the past, implemented a series of preferential policies for enterprises, like putting fish in a suitable place to breed, and it has positively promoted technical progress in enterprises. Under the new circumstances, however, we can no longer rely on tax breaks and benefits granted to upgrade technology for enterprises; instead, we should transform enterprise operating mechanisms, strive to strengthen their capacity, actively adopt new technologies and techniques, improve the level of management and overall quality of enterprises, and practice a system of fair competition to keep the superior and eliminate the inferior. To this end, the State Economic and Trade Commission will select a group of enterprises with favorable conditions to engage in a number of high-level technical transformation projects, so as to amass the limited capital to upgrade key industries and enterprises. We should consider the overall situation in approaching this issue; while supporting some key state enterprises, we should also guide the "leading sheep" among collective enterprises, village and town enterprises, and other economies to cultivate new economic growth points. Xu Penghang said: Following the launch of measures for reforming the financial and taxation, banking, foreign exchange, and investment systems, the sources of capital for technical transformations in enterprises have increased, bodies have cooperated in investing, and the modes of investment have been diversified. Taking the year 1993 as an example, of the investments in the state's two technical transformation projects, each of which was worth hundreds of million of yuan, only 1.1 percent of the total investment was from the state budget, 35.5 percent was from domestic loans, 3.8 percent was from foreign funds, 53.2 percent was from self-raised capital, and 6.4 percent was from other investments. Capital raised by enterprises themselves and foreign funds have become an important source of investment in the technical transformation. Because the power of examining and approving investment projects is delegated to the lower authorities, state-owned, collective, village, and town enterprises and a variety of economic entities have gradually become investing bodies. As for the modes of investment, more and more projects are jointly invested in by the central and local authorities, two or more localities, governments and enterprises, or enterprises and foreign businesses. It has been learned that in the first three years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, China has altogether invested 467.9 billion yuan in the technical transformation, thus exceeding the total investment in the five years of the Seventh Five-Year Plan period. Thanks to the state's attention to the technical transformation in enterprises and investment in energy resources, undersupplied raw and semifinished materials industries, transportation, and telecommunications, the limitations caused by the "bottleneck" industries have been alleviated to some extent. Meanwhile, the state's vigorous support of the technical transformation for export-oriented enterprises engaged in processing industries has increased the textile industry's foreign exchange earnings by $1 billion; a significant increase has also been seen in light industry, electronics, and machine building. In addition, the technical equipment produced by a number of key industries -- products such as video recorders, textile machines, air conditioner compressors, and automobile engines -- have become highly indigenous, thanks to the import of technologies, the technical transformation, and technological development.
