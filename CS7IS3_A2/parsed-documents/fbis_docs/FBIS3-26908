He told the council that 1993 was the year when China carried out the spirit of the 14th national congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in an all-round way, and marched victoriously forward along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Great achievements were made during the year in the reform, opening up and socialist modernization drive and all other aspects of work. The annual tasks set for the year by the first NPC session were basically accomplished, he said. Premier Li said 1994 is an important year for China to maintain a sustained and healthy development of the national economy and a critical year for the country to make further reforms. On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the current domestic and international situation, he said, the CPC Central Committee had put forth a basic principle for the work of the whole party and the whole nation this year. The principle is to be under the guidance of comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, carry out in an all-round way the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, speed up the pace of building a socialist market economic system, ensure a sustained, quick and healthy development of the national economy, maintain political stability, and promote social progress in an all-round way. Premier Li said that the CPC Central Committee had emphasized that to seize the current opportunity to deepen the reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development and maintain stability are the major tasks of the whole party and the whole nation. The State Council and governments at other levels should keep this in mind in every aspect of their work and seriously handle the relations between reform, development and stability.
