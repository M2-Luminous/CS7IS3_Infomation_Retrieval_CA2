The alleged victims are mainly political exiles, prisoners, and members of the Jehovah's Witness religious sect forced into exile into neighboring countries when their church was banned by the Government of Malawi in the 1970s. Property running into millions of dollars was seized from members of the sect and taken over by the governing Malawi Congress Party or its now disbanded militia, the Malawi Young Pioneers. A former exile and now member of the opposition United Front for Multiparty Democracy, Mr. Frank Jiya, said that compensation would be seen as a symbol of apology and reconciliation to those who had suffered.
