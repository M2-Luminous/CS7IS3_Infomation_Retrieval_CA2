Ministry Gets Government Support"] [Text] Officially circulated yesterday was a Russian Federation Government decree, "Questions of the Russian Federation Ministry on Cooperation with Member States of the Commonwealth of Independent States." The Ministry on Cooperation with the CIS Member States has received a stable material base in the shape of personnel, financial support, and buildings. Besides, until provisions on the Ministry of Cooperation with the CIS Member States have been approved, the government decree will provide the legal basis for the ministry's operation. The Russian Federation State Committee on Economic Cooperation with Member States of the Commonwealth (Goskomsotrudnichestvo) was formed in late 1991. One of the committee's prerogatives, as it was steadily gaining in influence, was defending Russia's interests in matters of cooperation with former Union republics. As of last fall, the committee took up the problems of restoring Russia's trade and economic links with countries of the former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance for which purpose a special directorate was created inside its apparatus. There was a valid reason for it: before the CMEA's dissolution, the share of its participants in Russia's foreign trade was 50 percent, and as little as 20 percent in 1993. In forming an economic union of CIS countries (whose founding documents were signed in Moscow on 24 September 1993), the Russian Committee on Economic Cooperation with Member States of the Commonwealth was also virtually the only coordination-consultative and expert organ having what in fact were intergovernmental prerogatives because similar government structures were not in place yet in the other CIS member countries. Besides, one should take account of the fact that the currently functioning Commonwealth organizational structure, which includes councils of the heads of states and governments, a coordination-consultative committee, and an executive secretariat, has no bodies so far that regularly check up on the observance of decisions made by the executive organs of the economic union. The question of setting up an Interstate Economic Council is only to be considered at the upcoming summit in late April. The committee's broader functions increased its status, with the result that it was turned into a ministry early in 1994. At the same time, its activities have not undergone appreciable changes: the ministry remains a test ground (proceeding from the priority of Russian interests) for various projects of development of economic integration with a special stress on the credit and finance sphere.
