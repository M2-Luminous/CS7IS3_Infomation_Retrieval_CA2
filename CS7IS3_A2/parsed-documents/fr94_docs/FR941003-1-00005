FR941003-1-00005 FR941003-1-00001 Section 105(a) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, requires an agency, with certain limited exceptions, to make available to the public any public financial disclosure report (SF 278) filed with the agency. Section 105(b)(1) permits an agency to charge a fee adequate to recover the cost of reproduction and mailing of a public financial disclosure report (SF 278) requested by any person in accordance with the requirements of section 105. However, the fee may not include any charge attributable to the salary of any employee involved in the reproduction or mailing of these reports. To implement this provision for such reports filed with it, OGE is proposing to create a fee structure separate from the FOIA fee structure set forth in subpart E of this proposed rule. Proposed subpart G contains provisions to implement this authority. Section 2604.702 as proposed provides that public financial disclosure reports will be furnished upon payment of $.03 per page and the actual direct cost of mailing. The $.03 per page charge includes the actual cost of the paper used and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. It does not include any overhead charges (such as lighting and heat), nor does it include the salary of any employee involved in operating a duplicating machine. No change will be made for individual requests if the total charge would be $10.00 or less. Proposed ยง2604.702(d) specifically provides that the miscellaneous fee provisions in ยง2604.504 of subpart E will apply to requests for public financial disclosure reports (SF 278s). However, no other provisions in subpart E concerning fees, fee waivers, and fee reductions apply to requests for public financial disclosure reports. Executive Order 12866 In promulgating this proposed rule, the Office of Government Ethics has adhered to the regulatory philosophy and the applicable principles of regulations set forth in section 1 of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. This proposed regulation has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Executive order. Regulatory Flexibility Act As Director of the Office of Government Ethics, I certify under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) that this proposed regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) does not apply to this proposed regulation because it does not contain information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget.
