This is called creative practice, the highest level of human practice. It is the most essential characteristic of the concept of Marxist practice. Experiments are the main form for promoting and deepening reform and for creative practice. There are risks in creative practice. Reform is a new thing, as is creative practice, where there is no ready experience to follow. There is no perfect policy, method, or scheme and mistakes are unavoidable. Creative practice is bound to encounter obstructions which may not be accepted by the public. Creative practice, which means developing and exploring practice, itself contains high efficiency. Only with creative thinking can we have creative practice. We should uphold the line of practice, knowledge, again practice, and again knowledge; constantly carry out "ideological reform and emancipation"; and always maintain ideological vitality. This is the scientific course of creative thinking. [end abstract] Taking our own road, boldly breaking a new path, and creating through practice -- This is an important theme which runs through the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." In resolving any problem, Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed on numerous occasions that we should take our own road, using new methods and new language, rather than stick to old conventions, mechanically copying the models of our predecessors or taking the beaten path. This is a very important conclusion drawn after profoundly summing up the basic experience of Chinese revolution and construction. I. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "The success of the Chinese revolution is result of Comrade Mao Zedong integrating Marxism- Leninism with China's reality and taking our own road. While carrying out construction today, we should also integrate Marxism- Leninism with China's reality and take our own road." (p 95) He repeatedly emphasized: We should firmly stick to this point which conforms to our reality. The experience of other countries can only be taken as reference. The problems of the world cannot be settled by applying one set model. The key lies in learning through doing and making explorations in practice. "If we stick to conventions or follow the beaten path, without making any experiments or attempts, including certain setbacks, we will definitely not be able to attain our strategic objective." (p 318) Besides maintaining that a country should creatively take its own road and start a new undertaking in its revolution and construction, Comrade Deng Xiaoping also urged all localities and fronts to have their own creations. In "the gist of the talks made in Wuchang, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shanghai," he enthusiastically encouraged and spoke highly of "the rich experience gained every day in building Chinese- style socialism. There is a lot of experience. Viewed from the newspapers and material from various provinces, they have their own characteristics. This is good. We must have creativity." He reminded us that reform and opening up face new emerging things and experience can only be created by ourselves. He was fond of listening to and using "new concepts." He criticized the lengthy articles and speeches, which repeated the contents and failed to use new terms. Obviously, mechanically copying the experience of others, sticking to old conventions, and repeating the words of others are tantamount to repetitive practice and cyclic practice. But creative practice means taking our own road, inheriting and developing Marxism with new thinking and concepts, making explorations in practice, and starting brand new undertakings, including some experiments and attempts. Such creative practice, which is the highest level of human practice, has the most essential characteristic of the concept of Marxist practice. Only by constantly creating can revolution and construction continuously develop. Comrade Deng Xiaoping used succinct language to strictly distinguish between creative practice and repetitive practice, which is of great significance to reform and construction. II. Experiment, an important means for promoting and deepening reform, is the practice of creating and exploring. To create, it is necessary to boldly and resolutely experiment. Reform, as a creative practice, must have its own unique form. Comrade Deng Xiaoping regarded experiment as reform and the main form of creative practice. He said: "Reform and opening up constitute a big experiment," "which cannot be found in books." "In a sense, what we are doing now are all experiments." In other words, experiment is the basic and main form of reform, which is the most realistic creative practice. This is the case judged from both the macroscopic and microscopic viewpoints. The specific problems encountered in reform should all be resolved through experiments. For instance, there were no securities or stock markets in traditional socialism. Can we introduce such a thing? Comrade Deng Xiaoping's attitude is to allow observance and resolutely carry out experiments. He said that the comprehensive reform of China's economic structure has just started. When we have the general orientation and principles, it is necessary to further formulate specific rules and regulations in the course of the experiments. If the aforementioned exposition refers to a specific thing such as reform and opening up, which is distinctive, the following two expositions are of general and universal significance. The first one is: "No matter what we do, there must be a person who first makes an experiment and breaks a new path." In other words, to create and blaze new trails in whatever we do, it is necessary to experiment and there must be a person who makes the first attempt. Experiment is the main form for promoting and deepening reform and also for creative practice. The other one is: "No quarreling, boldly experiment, and break a new path." No quarreling is one of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's innovations. Instead of quarreling worthlessly over a matter, the most important and fundamental thing is to seize the opportunity to practice, create, and experiment. While carrying out bold experiments, we should seek unity of thinking and start a new undertaking. Hence, he always encouraged us to boldly and resolutely experiment. III. There are risks in creation which might lead to mistakes and be unacceptable to the public. Nevertheless, facts will eventually prove that creative practice will turn out revolutionary effects. Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a penetrating analysis in this regard, including three important expositions. First, there are risks in creative practice. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Reform is China's second revolution. Despite the risks, it is a very important thing that we must do." (p 113) "Urban reform is more complicated and risky than rural reform." (p 117) There are risks because reform involves the vital interests of the people and every step taken will affect millions upon millions of people. Meanwhile, reform is a new thing, as is creative practice, which has no ready experience to follow. There is no perfect policy, method, or scheme and mistakes are unavoidable. Second, creative practice may encounter obstructions and not be accepted by the public. This is mainly due to the influence of the old system, pattern, and concepts and the obstruction of "leftist" ideas. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: In the past, we were used to conventions and it was no easy job to change this. "It was a difficult job to correct the `leftist' ideas which took shape over the decades. Our main task is to oppose `leftism' because it has become a force of habit." "The habitual practice of yearning for the past easily crops up while formulating and implementing specific policies." (p 228) As creative practice means blazing new trails, which itself constitutes a revolution and a negation of the old things, obstacles will be unavoidable. Meanwhile, as creative practice is an experiment, which has no ready facts to serve as grounds, it will take time to persuade people to accept it. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "People could not understand the policy of reform at the beginning. Reform was universally accepted only when it was proved by facts." (p 155) Third, creative practice may take a long time to show its effects, the results may be unexpected, and, what is more, it could be a failure. The problems in these three points raised by Comrade Deng Xiaoping directly involved the appraisal of the efficiency and effect of creative practice. Viewed from the process of practice, creative practice is riskier than repetitive practice. It may encounter great obstructions and is likely to lead to mistakes and even failure. As a consequence, its efficiency will be affected. However, from a fundamental point of view, creative practice is a developing and exploratory practice which involves doing innovative things. This itself contains extremely high efficiency. Viewed from the results of practice, the social effect and success of creative practice will not be limited to a certain matter within a period. It may bring about a breakthrough in a field or sphere. Such progress may not even be expected by the persons involved in the practice. This was the case in rural reform. The line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee aroused the enthusiasm of the peasants and invigorated the rural areas. In addition to the development of agricultural production, township enterprises suddenly came to the fore and scored unexpected results. Similarly, the failure of creative practice is also of great social significance because it proves the mistakes of the thinking and methods never practiced before. This itself is a discovery which offers a new basis for opening up a new path. Successful experience, experience gained from mistakes, and lessons drawn from failure are all valuable wealth. For this reason, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always encouraged us to be fearless and to advance boldly in spite of risks and difficulties. IV Only by emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, thinking independently, and applying creative thinking to guide practice can we constantly make creations. Comrade Deng Xiaoping encouraged us to creatively practice and think because practice is the conscious activity of men with intentions and objectives. Only with creative thinking can there be creative practice. He said: "The basic spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee is to emancipate the mind, think independently, and formulate policies by proceeding from our reality." We cannot find the answer to building Chinese-style socialism from the books of Marx or Lenin. As the conditions and experience of each country differ from the other, we can create new things only through independent thinking. Unless we break with rigid ideas and think creatively, there will be no hope for reform and construction. He urged us to use our brains and be bold in thinking and blazing new trails. He was against those lazy people who repeated what others said and made empty talk instead of using their own brains. He hoped that the leading bodies at all levels could be a collective which thought independently, could face reality, genuinely and carefully studied the new circumstances, formed new trains of thought, offered new methods, and used new language. From whence does creative thinking come? Comrade Deng Xiaoping used many accurate remarks to express it. To sum up, first, it is necessary to uphold the ideological line of seeking truth from facts and integrate Marxism-Leninism with the reality of Chinese revolution. Marx could not give ready answers to problems cropping up centuries after his death. Similarly, Lenin could not undertake the task of offering ready answers to the problems emerging 50 to 100 years after his death. We should study Marxist theory and also make theoretical creation in light of the new circumstances and conditions of the contemporary world and China. Second, it is necessary to rely on the creative practice of the basic levels and the masses. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "A lot of good things from rural reform were created by the basic levels. These were then defined and improved and taken as a guide for the whole country." While examining the manuscripts from the 14th Party Congress he said that many good things in reform and opening up were created by the masses in practice. They are the wisdom of the masses and the collective rather than something new thought up by any individual through racking his brains. My contribution was summarizing and advocating these new emerging things. Third, it is necessary to constantly sum up new experience; uphold the line of practice, knowledge, again practice, and again knowledge; look back after every step taken forward; continuously carry out "ideological reform and emancipation"; and always maintain ideological vigor. This is the scientific process for developing creative thinking. China's economic structural reform has now entered a new stage of establishing a socialist market economic system, requiring us to creatively resolve many complicated matters. In the reform practice we urgently need, more than any period in the past, to carry forward the spirit of creative practice vigorously advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and boldly make creations and advance in the practice of the socialist modernization program.
