A Foreign Ministry statement on the issue notes that Turkey has, on various occasions in the past, noted that the death sentence has not been implemented in the country for the last 10 years and that every legal and operative measure has been taken to prevent torture. Stressing that Turkish-German talks are continuing on the preparation of a memorandum of understanding concerning those to be extradited, the statement expresses the hope that a solution will be reached on the issue soon. The statement continues: We are sorry [words indistinct] efforts by certain German laender to prevent the extradition of these persons. No one should doubt that Turkey, just like Germany, is a constitutional state and everyone should refrain from behavior that might encourage acts of terrorism. The existing friendship and mutual trust between Turkey and Germany is the strongest guarantee to the solution of such problems.
