The 10-truck convoy was expected to cross by midday the Gradiska Bridge, linking Croatia and Bosnia, and continue on toward the beseiged enclave via Banja Luka, the main city in northern Bosnian under Serb control. Another convoy reached the city Sunday delivering 80 tonnes of supplies, the first to reach the beleaguered city in five months. Shortly thereafter Bosnian Serb leaders had given their approval for another convoy to reach the city, Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said. He said the latest convoy would amount to a real "test" on the Serbs' apparent willingness to allow much-needed aid to reach the pocket's 100,000 population.
