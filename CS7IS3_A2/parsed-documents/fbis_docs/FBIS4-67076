These are three of the 18 new offenses which have been included in the draft supplementary provisions to the regulations governing offenses against public order, which was submitted to the current session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislative body, for deliberation this morning. Minister of public security, Tao Siju, explained to the session that along with the present changing social order, some new problems and offenses have occurred which have disturbed the social order and public security and hurt public interests. "However, the original regulations had made no provisions about these activities and it has become difficult to handle these cases according to law," said the minister. The existing regulation was put into effect on January 1, 1987. Other newly prescribed offenses include: --- disobeying the provisions on the management of social organizations, and carrying out activities under the name of a social organization without registration; or to keep on working under the name of social organization after its registration was revoked, it has been ordered to disband, or simply banned; --- organizing activities of superstitious sects and secret societies to disrupt public order, do harm to the public interest, or damage people's health through feudal superstition; --- disobeying supervisory provisions while undergoing a period of being put under surveillance, or deprivation of political rights, probation with suspended prison sentence or being paroled. Those who commit such offenses, but not to the extent to be punished according to criminal law, will be put under 15 days detention, with fines of up to 200 yuan or a warning. Meanwhile, those fabricating or distorting facts, spreading rumors or otherwise disrupting public order, or doing harm to the public interest through other means, will be put under 15 days detention and ordered to write a confession or warning, if the offenses are still not severe enough for criminal punishment.
