Vasilyev, leader of "Pamyat," a well-known monarchist movement, to register his organization. The reasons are clear: "Pamyat's" extremist program is at odds with Russian laws. In his first public appearance literally two hours after the incident, Mr. Vasilyev described this decision by the Justice Ministry as "genocide against the Russians" -- "the Justice Ministry has been registering all conceivable pornographic organizations, but has not registered ours, a national-patriotic one!" Vasilyev's words were echoed by V. Bogachev, chief of the European Liberal Democratic Party [ELDP] (it turns out that we have a party like this, too -- S.K.). V. Bogachev called on all patriotic forces to write "an open letter against the Justice Ministry." As a matter of fact, the ELDP does not have any relation to V. Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, a fact Mr. Bogachev was swift to confirm by calling the latter a fascist party and expressing his astonishment that it was registered by that same Justice Ministry.
