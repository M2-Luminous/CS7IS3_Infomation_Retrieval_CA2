ACTION: Correcting amendments. SUMMARY: These corrections amend the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska (50 CFR part 100 and 36 CFR part 242, published in the Federal Register on June 3, 1994) implementing the subsistence priority for rural residents of Alaska under Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980. DATES: Effective July 1, 1994, these corrections amend the Subsistence Management Regulations, 50 CFR part 100 and 36 CFR part 242. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard S.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background_Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) (16 U.S.C. 3111&hyph;3126) requires that the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretaries) implement a joint program to grant a preference for subsistence uses of fish and wildlife resources on public lands, unless the State of Alaska enacts and implements laws of general applicability which are consistent with ANILCA, and which provide for the subsistence definition, preference, and participation specified in Sections 803, 804, and 805 of ANILCA. The State implemented a program that the Department of the Interior previously found to be consistent with ANILCA. However, in December 1989, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in McDowell v. State of Alaska that the rural preference in the State subsistence statute violated the Alaska Constitution. The court's ruling in McDowell required the State to delete the rural preference from the subsistence statute, and therefore, negated State compliance with ANILCA. The Court stayed the effect of the decision until July 1, 1990. As a result of the McDowell decision, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (Departments) assumed, on July 1, 1990, responsibility for implementation of Title VIII of ANILCA on public lands. On June 29, 1990, the Temporary Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska were published in the Federal Register (55 FR 27114&hyph;27170). Consistent with subparts A, B, and C of these regulations, a Federal Subsistence Board (Board) was established to administer the Federal Subsistence Management Program. The Board's composition includes a Chair appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. National Park Service; the Alaska State Director, U.S. Bureau of Land Management; the Alaska Area Director, U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs; and the Alaska Regional Forester, USDA Forest Service. Through the Board, these agencies have participated in development of regulations for Subparts A, B, and C, and the annual Subpart D regulations. All Board members have reviewed these corrections and agree with their substance. Because Subpart D relates to public lands managed by an agency or agencies in both the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior, identical correcting text will be incorporated into 36 CFR part 242 and 50 CFR part 100. Proposed Subpart D regulations for the 1994&hyph;1995 seasons and bag limits, and methods and means were published on September 2, 1993, in the Federal Register (58 FR 46678&hyph;46706). A 60-day comment period providing for public review of the proposed rule was advertised by mail, radio, and newspaper. Subsequent to that 60-day review period, the Board prepared a booklet describing all proposals for change to Subpart D. The public then had an additional 60 days in which to comment on the proposals for changes to the regulations. The Federal Subsistence Regional Advisory Councils (Regional Councils) met in regional centers, received public comments, and formulated recommendations to the Board on proposals for their respective regions. The final regulations, published on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 29032&hyph;29063) reflect Board review and consideration of Regional Council recommendations and public comments submitted to the Board during their April meeting. These correcting amendments are a result of Requests for Reconsideration of some of the Board's decisions in April and some requests for Special Action as a result of resource concerns. Below are summaries of each action. Unit 1(B)_Goat The Board reopened the Frosty Bay Ridge area of Unit 1(B) to goat hunting. This area had been closed due to timber harvest activities in the area which could have subjected the small herd to excessive hunting pressure. Timber harvest activities were completed during the summer of 1994. The Board, having analyzed the available data, found that the harvest of goats in the area was consistent with the conservation of healthy populations and the justification for the closure no longer applied. The change will provide an August 1&hyph;December 31 season with a harvest limit of two goats by State registration permit only. Unit 18_Moose The Board acted on a Request for Reconsideration from the Lower Yukon Moose Management Committee to revise the action the Board took in April opening the lower Yukon area to moose hunting. Unit 18 is a large area encompassing over 26 million acres primarily in the Yukon and Kuskokwim River deltas. The traditional hunting periods for moose are slightly different in different areas of the Unit. The Request to the Board sought to revise the season in the Unit based on those differences. The Board reviewed the data and determined that providing different seasons in different areas of the unit would best accommodate traditional hunting periods and still be consistent with the conservation of healthy populations. The change will also correct a misprint in the June 3, Federal Register printing: The Kanektok and Goodnews drainages will remain closed to moose hunting, as they have been in the past. The Unit will also be divided into three other areas with different seasons (September 5&hyph;25, September 1&hyph;30, and August 25&hyph;September 25). Two of the areas will continue to have a 10-day winter hunt that will be announced later.
