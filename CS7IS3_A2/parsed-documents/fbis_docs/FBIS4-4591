Coalition sources said the decision by Parliament to endorse the Opposition draft, strongly criticized for being drafted hastily from the 1978 constitution, has made a dissolution unavoidable. Mr. Chuan is expected to dissolve the Lower House before the draft passes it third reading if it appears the draft will be less democratic than the present charter, said one source. A senior Democrat Party member said the Premier, after the Government's humiliating defeat in Parliament, sought a meeting with former prime minister Prem Tinsulanon at his home on Thursday. He said Gen. Prem advised the Prime Minister to dissolve the House in order to avoid an embarrassing defeat. The Opposition on Thursday managed to recruit Senate support in pushing through its constitution amendment proposal after the draft was accept for deliberation less than 24 hours earlier. The bloc prepared the draft hastily by dusting off the l978 constitution and inserting most of the 26 amendment points previously agreed to by the 10 political parties making up the coalition and Opposition. But the Opposition removed those bills seeking to reduce the number of senators and their power, apparently to ensure the support of the Upper House for the bill. "The Prime Minister will definitely not allow this disgraceful constitution draft to be put into use," said the source. He said a dissolution was among measures discussed by government whips yesterday. Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan also hinted at the possibility of a dissolution because of worries over future cooperation between the coalition and Upper House. He said the Senate could vote against a key government bill. Although he insisted the Senate vote for the Opposition's constitution draft was not unusual, Mr. Banyat admitted there could be grave problems if the Upper House should one day voted against a key government bill involving the distribution of power, the administration court or taxation. "If these bills do not get the support of the Senate, we will really have to do some heavy thinking," said Mr. Banyat. Deputy Transport and Communications Minister Charat Phuachuai said the extraordinary committee appointed Thursday to scrutinize the Opposition-sponsored amendment draft was expected to recommend that the second and third readings be held during the next House session from May and July. He said the debate would start another political uproar. "The draft may be amended in a way so as to become totally unacceptable to the people," he said. "Under this scenario, the Prime Minister has only two political options -- either to resign or dissolve the House. I am quite confident that after the committee finishes its scrutiny, there will be a political change in the country." Mr. Charat said it was widely known the opposition parties were trying their best to topple the Government. Fellow Deputy Transport and Communications Minister Phinit Charusombat said a major change may be inevitable if the Opposition joins with senators in amending the Constitution to the extent where it becomes unacceptable to the public. "The people should monitor developments closely," he said, but hoped a compromise could be reached. Democrat Party secretary-general Sanan Kachonprasat ruled out any political change in the near future how ever, saying the party representatives on the scrutiny committee would do their best to ensure the opposition constitution draft is more democratic. "Prime Minister Chuan is not the kind of person who submits easily to pressure. There is no political reason for the Premier to dissolve Parliament," he said. Deputy Government Spokesman Sudarat Keyuraphan said her Phalang Tham Party may propose a dissolution if the details in the constitution amendments do not benefit the people. Democrat MP Niphon Bunyamani said he was confident the Prime Minister would not allow the opposition amendment draft to be approved if it was unacceptable to the people. "I think the Prime Minister will eventually have to return power to the people by dissolving Parliament as the Government has far fewer representatives on the scrutiny than Senate and Opposition combined," he said. The government whips met yesterday morning and were later joined by the Prime Minister and the leaders of the other coalition parties. Solidarity whip Ekkaphap Phosun said they discussed the call for a dissolution but thought it would be of no use since the Senate would not be dissolved as well. The charter amendment problem would also not have been addressed. "We confirm the Government will continue to administer the country. If we cannot amend the charter this time, we will just resubmit the bills," he said. "If we dissolve Parliament and the Opposition gets elected into the House, they will not amend the charter." Mr. Ekkaphap said Mr. Chuan was asked why Defense Minister Wichit Sukmak voted with the Opposition Thursday and replied this showed the charter amendments were not a Government affair and there had been no lobbying of ministers who are senators. The matter was left to the conscience of each parliamentarian. Earlier, there had been calls from within the Democrat Party for House Speaker Marut Bunnak to be sacked after be scheduled the Opposition charter draft and for Gen. Wichit to be ousted for voting with the Opposition despite being a Cabinet minister. New Aspiration Party leader Chawalit Yongchaiyut insisted the Government had not "lost face" through its defeat in Parliament. It is the people who will be affected, he said. The Interior Minister said the Government would continue to push for the charter amendments. Democrat MP Alongkon Pholabut said the Senate and Opposition vote showed disrespect for the people, but there was still time for them to remedy that during the scrutiny process. "The power and number of senators constitute a large force and it goes against the wishes of the people to have senators hold the majority," he said.
