Federal minister of environment and protection of nature, Claus Tefer, said at a press release that "as far as I know the pesticides have been illegally exported to Albania. There derives no obligation to take them back. But we accept that it is an inheritance from the unification of the two Germanies. In order to avoid grave consequences in the foreign policy, we shall make a human gesture by taking the pesticides back." The pesticides have been brought in barrels on a train to Albania in March 1992 and have been centred mostly in the border railway station of Bajze, near Shkoder. Among the pesticides, according to specialists, there is toxaphene whose usage has been banned in the European Union countries since 10 years ago. "The death train," as the Albanian press refers to it, has come to Albania as an humanitarian aid from the "Schmidt Cretan GmbH" company of Hanover. As time has passed, the pesticides have ruined the barrels and leaked on the ground, thus threatening for polluting the Shkoder Lake, which borders Albania and Montenegro. The German Government has planned to take the pesticides back by sea within May.
