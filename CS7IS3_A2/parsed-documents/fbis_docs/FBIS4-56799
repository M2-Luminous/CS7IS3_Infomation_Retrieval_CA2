[Begin Gilles recording in Creole] I would like to send this call to all political leaders, especially the moderate ones; all Haitian political leaders; all Haitian political parties that belong to the center. This does not mean that I exclude the others, but I think the moderates can understand me better. They must meet, they must discuss, they must issue a statement in which they clearly express their position to the international community. I am also calling on the social sectors, all the labor unions, to put their heads together to find a consensus, to express their position, and to make the international community know that if the new sanctions are applied, the Haitian people will disappear. Finally, my call goes out to General Cedras and President Aristide to do their best, to make all possible and imaginary concessions in order to solve the problem within the framework of the parliamentary plan. I believe it is possible. [end recording]
