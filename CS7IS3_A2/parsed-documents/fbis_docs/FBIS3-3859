Ms Liu's resignation yesterday from the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) came as no surprise. She has long been an outspoken critic of the body, which oversees preparations for the transition. In recent weeks, she had vocally criticised the nomination of pro-British Hong Kong personalities to the PWC. Ms Liu had already threatened to resign on several occasions, at one time openly crying when forced to be seated next to a pro-British appointee during a meeting. Her resignation was accepted during an hour-long meeting with China's most senior official dealing with the territory, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping. "As a delegate to the NPC (National People's Congress), I have the responsibility to watch the work of the PWC and to give advice to the PWC," Ms Liu stated after her meeting with Mr Lu. "I think that's enough for me. In order to work better in the NPC, I want to resign as a member of the PWC." Mr Lu will now formally report Ms Liu's resignation to the NPC Standing Committee. When granted Mr Lu's approval to resign, it felt "just like a stone lifting up from my heart," Ms Liu said. But she warned that the Chinese government should not ignore the results of the 1994-95 elections, the last ones under British rule.
