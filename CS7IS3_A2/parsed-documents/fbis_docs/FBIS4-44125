Commenting on press reports that he is looking for someone to replace Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, Kliridhis says he fully trusts Mikhailidhis. He adds: The foreign minister has played an important role--both general and specific--on the confidence-building measures and our efforts to promote membership in the European Union. The foreign minister's meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has appropriately prepared the ground for my own meeting with Hurd. Asked if press reports are harming the foreign minister's image, the government spokesman replied: I believe the statement that I have just read restores the foreign minister's image if it was harmed by the press reports. Asked to comment on the press reports, Mikhailidhis referred to Kliridhis' statement, adding that the government has a lot of work to do and is not disturbed by press reports. He noted that the newspapers might have their own reasons for carrying such reports.
