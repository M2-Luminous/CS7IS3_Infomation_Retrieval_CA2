The minister refrained from saying whether the national strike had been a success or a failure but asserted that such actions will not solve the country's critical problems. [Begin Corral recording] Transportation workers have not joined this drastic measure, nor have construction workers. As far as this ministry is concerned, that is, speaking strictly about labor issues, the reports we have received from all labor inspection offices throughout the country indicate there has been a partial work stoppage at businesses, enterprises, factories, and so forth. Some cities have been more affected than others. If we establish an average evaluation for the work stoppage, we can say that it is approximately 50 percent. That implies that the other 50 percent of the workers have been working and continue to work despite the strike decreed by the FUT. Information received from the country's agrarian and livestock areas indicates that everything dealing with the labor sector has proceeded normally. Consequently, labor activities in the countryside are normal. [end recording] Labor Minister Alfredo Corral also said that social compensations include the freezing of urban transportation service fares and a possible increase in some of the components of the Ecuadoran workers' salaries.
