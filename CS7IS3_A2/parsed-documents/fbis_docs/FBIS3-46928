The magazine was gazetted in August last year for refusing to print a reply from the government. The reply was sent by Singapore's high commissioner in London to rebut a letter which Mr. J.B. Jeyaretnam [former opposition MP] wrote to the magazine about his 1986 criminal conviction. At the time of gazetting, THE ECONOMIST had a circulation of 7,500 copies here. The government had then said it would reduce the circulation progressively. A statement from the Ministry of Information and the Arts said with the degazetting, THE ECONOMIST will not need to appoint an authorized distributor. It will also not be required to have all its copies marked with stickers.
