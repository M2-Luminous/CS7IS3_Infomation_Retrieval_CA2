Now the task of freeing hostages captured on the border will be handled by specially trained border guard groups. There will be no conscripts serving in this special task force. At present work is under way to select graduates from border guard schools and reenlisted men for this unit. Antiterrorist groups will not be very large: 15 to 20 people. So far it is planned to create five groups based in different regions of Russian, as a rule near the state border. They will be geared toward securing the release of hostages taken on the country's territory and taken abroad; that is to say, actions on the territory of other states. The special force will be used primarily to free Russian servicemen, including border guards. The decision to use the special unit will be made at a level not below Russian border guards commander. According to some reports, these groups will be trained by the Alfa force and its regional subdivisions.
