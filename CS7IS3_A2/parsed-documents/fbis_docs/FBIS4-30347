The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the biggest opposition group, and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] agreed that the two parties bear great responsibility to get the current political turmoil under control, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference. LDP President Yohei Kono and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama "shared a view that a new prime minister should be elected before the end of June 28," said Kubo, the No. 2 man of the SDP. "But our stances to have the situation in hand are not necessarily the same," Kubo said, indicating there would be no immediate formation of a coalition government by the two parties. With Japan facing serious issues at home and abroad, and the summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized economies approaching, it is crucial to pick a new premier and launch a new government as quickly as possible, Kono and Murayama agreed, according to Kubo. The meeting of the leaders of the LDP and the SDP came two days after Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and his two-month-old minority government resigned. During the 40-minute meeting, Kono called on Murayama to consider the opening of new government negotiations with New Party Sakigake, in addition to negotiations with the LDP, Kubo said. The SDP and Sakigake, both former members of the ruling coalition, have already kicked off talks on a joint policy platform to be released soon. Asked about the possibility of a new government being launched by Tuesday, Kubo replied, "I cannot tell." "In the case of a single-party government, you can tell the schedule. But as for a coalition government, you cannot start until it is known which parties will share the government," he said. Kubo revealed that he has proposed via Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai holding a meeting between Hata and Murayama to explore the possibility of the SDP forming a new government with the current ruling coalition. The coalition must be weighing how to respond to the offer, he said. Hata resigned with his minority government Saturday in the face of an LDP-proposed no-confidence motion and an SDP demand for the collective resignation of his cabinet as a prerequisite for the SDP's return to the ruling camp. The coalition insists it is the LDP and the SDP that should chart a course for the formation of a new government, not the coalition. Although some LDP and SDP leaders have voiced readiness for a tie-up of the two parties to succeed the Hata government, resistance to such an alliance is strong within both parties as they have sharp differences on key policy issues. Notably, the SDP central executive committee has decided not to ally with the LDP. Kubo, who favors the SDP rejoining the ruling coalition, asserted that the party should follow the committee decision as it examines ways to form a new government. "I have been told by party members to abide by the central executive committee decision and I myself have followed the decision sincerely," kubo said. "The decision must be observed by all means," he said. The House of Representatives steering committee canceled a lower house plenary session scheduled for 1PM [0400 GMT] because the parliament was not prepared to pick a successor to Prime Minister Hata, committee sources said.
