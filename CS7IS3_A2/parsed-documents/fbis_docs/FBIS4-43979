The Council of Ministers met today under Prime Minister Hakki Atun and discussed various issues, including the latest developments in the Cyprus problem. Foreign and Defense Minister Atay Ahmet Rasit informed the correspondents while the meeting was still in progress that the Council of Ministers had assessed the developments that may take place on the Cyprus problem during the EU summit in Corfu. He said the following: [Begin Rasit recording] The TRNC Council of Ministers feels there is a need to issue a statement on the 24 June EU summit on Corfu. The statement is as follows: We are worried that the furthering of the issue of the Greek Cypriot side becoming a full EU member during the EU summit may have adverse effects on the negotiations process in Cyprus. The Greek Cypriot side does not represent the legitimate government of the whole of Cyprus, nor can it act on behalf of the Turkish Cypriot people. The treaty oaf 1960 clearly stipulates that Cyprus cannot be a part of international organizations in which Turkey and Greece, which are the guarantor powers of Cyprus, are not members. The Turkish Cypriot people's separate consent is required for Cyprus to become an EU member. That fact is outlined in UN documents. The Turkish Cypriot people are opposed to Cyprus becoming a member of the EU, in which Greece is a member and Turkey is not. Such a development, which can be interpreted as enosis [union with Greece], will have negative effects on the negotiation process. Considering the continuing talks on the confidence-building measures in Cyprus, the intensive effort that has been made to further the Greek Cypriot side's application to become a full EU member conflicts with the initiatives that have been made to establish mutual confidence on the island. The Turkish Cypriot side has done its utmost with regard to the confidence-building measures. It is prepared to sign the agreement on the confidence-building measures if the points that were agreed upon in Vienna some time ago are included in it. It has the political will for that purpose.
