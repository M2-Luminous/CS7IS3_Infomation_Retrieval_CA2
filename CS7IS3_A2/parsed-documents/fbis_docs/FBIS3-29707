Since the government cannot simply print banknotes, it must be careful and make sure that the money is spent properly. It is apparent that someone has profited from commission fees associated with every weapons purchase the armed forces have made. Hence, the thundering news conference held by the military top brass reminds us of the old saying: "A careless utterance tarnishes a good image."
