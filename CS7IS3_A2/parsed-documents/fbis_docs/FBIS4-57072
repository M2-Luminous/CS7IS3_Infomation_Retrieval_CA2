Since last year, whenever Sarney is included in IBOPE's scenarios, Lula's rating drops. Today, neither is Lula's 31 percent his most modest performance vis-a-vis Sarney, nor does the former president's current 13 percent represent his best score against the PT [Workers Party] candidate. Last September, Lula had 27 percent to Sarney's 14 percent. The tally was 26 to 12 percent in January of this year, and 30 percent to 11 percent at the end of March. It is interesting to observe how Lula and Sarney, whose ideological traits differ so greatly, have such similar profiles in the IBOPE surveys. Both do better with low-income voters who have less schooling and live in the Northeast. Sarney has hovered in the 11 to 14 percent range since last year, fluctuating with the drubbings he gets. He has still not been heavily attacked enough by the opposing candidates for measures to be taken of the resistance of the armor that keeps him stuck in the same IBOPE bracket, regardless of the changing cast of characters of candidates around him. Quercia enters, Maluf leaves, Amin and Flavio Rocha appear, Fernando Henrique settles in--and Sarney holds on to his captive electorate. There are two ways of interpreting Lula's persistent leadership in the polls. One is the reading given by IBOPE. The institute's experts think it is strange that Lula does not get 60 percent of voter intentions when he is not in office, is not living in a glass house, has become the counterpoint to all the bad that Fernando Collar embodied, and has passed unscathed through the tough times experienced by politicians in general in the past three years. The other, and more accurate, way to look at this is to consider Lula's first-place position as an electoral miracle. He has a little more than 30 percent thanks to the virtues that, in IBOPE's opinion, ought to propel him up to 60 percent. And one of the reasons he is not reaching that 60 percent is that his face is not on everyone's TV sets in prime time as is Fernando Henrique's, for example. The slippage of two or three percentage points in Fernando Henrique's rating compared with the previous poll falls within the survey's sampling error, IBOPE says. What is most important to the tucano candidate are the trends recorded within his own universe of likely voters. Although he has not risen in the general index, Fernando Henrique has improved his profile in the heartland of the survey. In that fat slice of voters who have gone no further in school than 4th grade--50 percent of the electorate--he has climbed from 8 to 12 percent. In the 25 percent slice of the electorate that finished 8th grade, Fernando Henrique has risen from 13 to 19 percent. In the other groups (high school and college graduates), his standing is stable. In other words, Fernando Henrique has grown in stature right where he needs to grow--among the 75 percent of voters who will actually control the outcome of the election. This evolution of the tucano candidate is consistent with the findings in another variant of the survey, the one that groups voters by family income bracket. Fernando Henrique has improved his likability rating from 6 to 10 percent among the multitude of Brazilians who earn no more than one minimum monthly wage. And among the neighboring population that earns from one to two minimum wages he has jumped from 10 to 14 percent. Separating voters by regions, Fernando Henrique turns in his best performances in the Northeast, home to almost 30 percent of the electorate (where he went from 6 to 11 percent), and in the South (he increased from 13 to 17 percent). Seen as a whole, the poll sends certain messages. One of them is that Fernando Henrique still depends on the favorable breeze from the real, a monetary unit that has a flair for becoming election currency. Another is that Sarney is establishing himself in the mind of the voter-in-the-street as a more viable candidate than Quercia, which does not mean he will have the same success among voters in the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] who will choose their candidate in a primary. A third message is the remarkable 10-point (from 39 to 49 percent) growth in the index that measures voter rejection of Leonel Brizola. Pollsters did not ask about motivation for this change, but suspects it is a repercussion of the numbers-game scandal in Rio de Janeiro that involves politicians associated with the former governor. But none of these indications is more important than the certainty that a lot of water has yet to flow under the bridge. The election campaign will not heat up until after the World Cup, and will not go into high gear until after 2 August, when free radio and TV air time becomes available.
