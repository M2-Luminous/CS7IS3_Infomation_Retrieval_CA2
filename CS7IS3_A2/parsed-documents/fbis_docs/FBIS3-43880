Already, protests by Ogoni people have been squashed and the leaders arrested. A rally by maverick businessman, Arthur Nzeribe, was interrupted by security forces, and now the police have issued a warning that the authorities will not accept any public political statements, which sounds ominously like a gag on freedom of speech. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports. [Begin recording] The tough statement from Police Federal Headquarters in Abuja warned those described as members of the political class to stop making statements, which it said, were capable of threatening government's good intentions to bequeath a viable democratic institution in the country. The police said that it would not tolerate any further political statement at this period of a ban on political activities. It said that those who had positive contributions to make towards the political development of Nigeria should wait until the proposed constitutional conference commission was inaugurated or else risk arrest and possible prosecution. Shortly before the statement was issued, about 50 armed policemen aborted the press conference called in Lagos by the leader of the Association for a Better Nigeria, Chief Arthur Nzeribe. The policemen turned back journalists from the venue, which ironically was the property of the Nigerian Union of Journalists. Later, Chief Nzeribe described the police action as unfortunate and he said that it undermined the very foundation of democracy. Last weekend, Chief Nzeribe said that the government of Gen. Sani Abacha was incapable of solving Nigeria's complex political crisis and it should therefore resign and hand over to a civilian government of national unity. Two days ago, former presidential contestant, Major Gen. Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, called for the immediate restoration of the right to free association and free speech. Addressing journalists in Lagos, he suggested that the decisions of the proposed constitutional conference should not be subject to approval by the Provisional Ruling Council and he advised the military government to ensure that its tenure did not extend beyond the end of this year. Such statements are now covered by the police warning. However, the government today constituted the National Constitutional Conference Commission. It has 19 members, most of whom are well-known politicians from across the country. It is headed by a retired justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, Alhaji Saidu Kawu. The commission's terms of reference are expected to be announced at its formal inauguration next week. [end recording]
