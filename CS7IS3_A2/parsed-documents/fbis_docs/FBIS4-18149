He added that Iran and Turkey had many political and economic commonalties which required continuous contacts between the officials of the two countries. Bank also said that during the talks with the Turkish officials the issue of Karabakh was raised and the two sides were informed on each other's stances in this regard. Iran, Turkey and Russia maintain their own views regarding the Karabakh issue, but the commonalties of the countries of the region require more closness of these views, he added. He noted that the Armenian and Azeri officials seriously feel that the ongoing war of attrition had gravely affected their economy, therefore, both countries were prepared to maintain peace. Bank also added that the interference of some foreign elements as well as particular approaches of certain Armenian factions had caused the continuation of the war, however, he said, peace needs to be restored in the region.
