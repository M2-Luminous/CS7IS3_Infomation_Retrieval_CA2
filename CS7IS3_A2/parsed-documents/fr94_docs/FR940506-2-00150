The Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to support any distribution or service fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the Trustees to support any distribution or servicing fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review of the Independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 8. Dividends paid by a Fund as to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that any distribution fees, service fees, shareholder servicing fees and Class Expenses allocated to a class will be borne exclusively by that class. 9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses between or among the various classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered to the applicants a report, which has been provided to the staff of the Commission, stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert concerning such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request to the Fund for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Regional Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``Report on Policies and Procedures in Existence,'' and the ongoing reports will be ``Reports on Policies and Procedures Placed in Operation and Tests of Operating Effectiveness,'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as they may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between or among such classes of shares; and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition (9) above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition (9) above. Applicants agree to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur with the ongoing reports. 11. The prospectuses of each Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation as to one class of Fund shares in relation to another. 12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees of the Funds concerning the Multiple Distribution System will be set forth in guidelines that will be furnished to the Trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees. 13. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, deferred sales loads, conversion features, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares other than Institutional Shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Institutional Shares will be offered solely pursuant to a separate prospectus. The prospectus for Institutional Shares will disclose the existence of the Fund's other classes, and the prospectus for the Fund's other classes will disclose the existence of Institutional Shares and will identify the persons eligible to purchase Institutional Shares. The shareholder reports on each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis for all classes of shares of that Fund. To the extent that any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares except Institutional Shares. Advertising materials reflecting the expenses or performance data for Institutional Shares will be available only to those persons eligible to purchase Institutional Shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will present separately each class of shares except Institutional Shares.
