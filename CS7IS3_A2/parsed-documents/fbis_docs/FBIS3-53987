['Arafat] Actually I followed what happened, and I express my strong satisfaction with what has been achieved and consider it complementary to what has been achieved on the Palestinian and Jordanian track. It is now the Lebanese track's turn after the Syrian track, God willing. Because we aspire to a comprehensive Arab solution that takes account of our Arab nation's interests to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the region. [Khayrallah] Your position sounds very positive with regard to what has happened. So how would you assess what President Clinton said in that meeting? ['Arafat] What he said emphasized the importance of what happened on the Palestinian-Israeli track and the Washington agreement between Israel and the PLO in order to reach the declaration of principles agreement we signed. What President Clinton said is a new driving force for the current peace process in the region. [Khayrallah] What about what President al-Asad said and his focus on a comprehensive peace? ['Arafat] That is not the demand of Syria only. I mention President al-Asad because he stressed a comprehensive peace, which is the demand of the Arab nation as a whole. It is a Palestinian, Jordanian, Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese, and Arab demand. [Khayrallah] It is now four months since the Gaza-Jericho First agreement was signed in Washington. How would you assess the course that began after the White House ceremony? ['Arafat] Regrettably, the Israeli side continues to try to get around what was agreed upon. I hope that the conference's cosponsors, who signed the agreement with us, will hasten to intervene to force Israel to implement precisely and honestly what was agreed, including compliance with the dates stipulated in the agreement. Israeli maneuvers are continuing, in order to evade the dates and try to win as much support as possible for the Israeli view with regard to the implementation of the agreement. This is expected from the Israeli side and came as no surprise to us. We know how to run the negotiations with the Israelis. We know the nature of the negotiations; they are not easy. We always try to urge them to comply precisely and honestly with what was agreed. But regrettably, the Israeli maneuvers are still continuing. In this context we are not begging from Israel, but, rather, demanding an implementation that serves peace and its march. Peace is in the interests of all: us, them, and the region as a whole. This is the comprehensive peace we are talking about as an Arab nation. [Khayrallah] There is an Israeli view that President 'Arafat is not convinced that what the two sides have reached so far is an agreement on a transitional, not final, phase, and that you want to begin the final phase now. ['Arafat] Any Israeli official who says that seems not to have read the agreement. The agreement specified phases for that; it is a phased agreement. As for Gaza and Jericho, the Israeli withdrawal from there means that they will become a liberated territory in the legal and international sense. And if some Israeli officials know this fact, let them refer to international law and international stipulations to see what withdrawal means. The withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho means that this territory becomes liberated the minute the (Israeli) withdrawal begins, just as happened when the French withdrew from Lebanon and Syria, the British from India and Egypt, and the French from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. But, as we agreed, the implementation will be in stages. For example, the withdrawal from the densely populated areas in the other parts of the West Bank will take place before the elections. This is because the elections should be conducted under international supervision and under the Palestinian National Authority's supervision. We will set up a national authority in Gaza and Jericho which will extend to all Palestinian territories. [Khayrallah] That is in the context of the negotiations.... ['Arafat] No, in the context of reality...only in the first stage this authority is not entitled to set up an army or to have embassies. But when the PLO signed--and (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin signed with the PLO, which has a bigger international recognition than Israel. [as published] [Khayrallah] But if we want to determine what the disagreement is and take the crossings issue for example, what are the points of disagreement? ['Arafat] Are we going to live in Bantustans or ghettos? No. When we say "withdrawal," it means complete withdrawal. They are using security as an excuse. Assuming you do not trust the Palestinian policeman or officer standing at the crossing point, do you also not trust the international presence? We too do not trust the Israeli soldier. In Sinai they trust the international presence. The Likud party trusted the international presence there. So there is at least a precedent for him [Rabin] to rely on, namely the Likud's agreement to the international presence in Sinai. What different does it make for the international forces in Sinai to expand to the finger, or [Gaza] Strip -- the strip resembles a toe on the map with regard to Sinai, which is why they call it the Gaza Strip. [Khayrallah] So how do you believe that can be resolved? ['Arafat] We are following up the matter. We also urge the cosponsors of the conference and the international parties to participate in persuading the Israelis to understand this matter. [Khayrallah] Are you satisfied with Israel's request that there be a ceiling of 7,000 Palestinian policemen? ['Arafat] There is no Israeli demand to that effect. On the contrary, they are aware of the importance of the police. In the developed states there is a policeman for every 200-250 citizens. As for Third World countries, there is one policeman for every 100-150 people. But this applies to states that have armies which they can use at any moment. We Palestinians are not allowed in the first stage to have an army. So we will rely mainly on the police. The number agreed in the security committee ranges between 20,000 and 25,000 policeman. They say that they have no objection to the number we specified. Our talks with World Bank (officials) and the recent meeting in Oslo with the donor states and the World Bank showed that the first group in Gaza and Jericho only should be 12,000 to 15,000 policemen, and the other groups are to be sent when the withdrawal from the other Palestinian territories has been completed. [Khayrallah] In view of that, do you expect progress to be achieved in the near future, based on compromises with regard to the crossings, for example? ['Arafat] We hope so. But not compromises, but, rather, solutions that give us our rights in full. [Khayrallah] But at what stage? ['Arafat] The negotiations are continuing in Taba. Negotiations were held this month in Oslo, Paris, and Cairo, and now are being held in Taba. [Khayrallah] Why were the economic negotiations in Paris suspended? ['Arafat] Because politics comes before economics. There must be an agreement on political matters in order for economic negotiations to progress. [Khayrallah] The negotiations are continuing now. Are you satisfied with the Palestinian delegation's performance? ['Arafat] Yes. The Palestinian delegation is implementing its leadership's instructions. So we are satisfied. [Khayrallah] Completely satisfied? ['Arafat] Of course. The delegation takes account of the Palestinian people's interests. [Khayrallah] Do you believe that better elements could be used in the negotiations? ['Arafat] If necessary, we will send [other] elements. And, praise God, we have sufficient competent and capable cadres. [Khayrallah] How do you explain Palestinian differences? ['Arafat] What differences? [Khayrallah] Among Palestinian leaderships.... ['Arafat] There are no differences. But Palestinian democracy is strong, which means.... Differences exist in Israel. And in the United States there are differences over NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] (the economic agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico). And in Europe there are those who are for GATT and those who are against. It is one of the characteristics of any democratic arena. We are proud of Palestinian democracy, even if it does not appeal to some people. We are exercising it to serve the Palestinian people. [Khayrallah] How do you explain the press campaigns against you these days? ['Arafat] They are incited. They reflect -- whether in the Arab or foreign press -- their surprise at the resoluteness of the Palestinian position. But there is a Palestinian proverb which says, "the wind cannot shake a mountain." [Khayrallah] Let us move to the Jordan issue. What is the status of relations with Jordan at present? ['Arafat] Relations are "fine," and we have signed a very good economic agreement with the Jordanian brothers, and the joint committee has begun its work. We are proud of Palestinian-Jordanian relations. [Khayrallah] But what was the reason for the delay in signing the agreement? ['Arafat] We had to wait for what was going to happen between us and the Israelis. [Khayrallah] So relations with Israel are not given precedence over relations with Jordan? ['Arafat] That is impossible. And an agreement will be signed between us and the brothers in Egypt; you were the first to read the "draft agreement on economic and technological cooperation between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the PLO." It will, God willing, be signed this month, because we are seeking protection through Arab economic relations against Israeli infiltration among the Palestinian people, who have been under the occupation for many years. [Khayrallah] So you do not in any way give precedence to relations with Israel over relations with any Arab party? ['Arafat] It is not possible, because our Arab relations are fundamental. [Khayrallah] But how do you explain your request to set up a Palestinian central bank or to have a Palestinian currency? ['Arafat] We are entitled to demand everything the next Palestinian entity should have. We are on our way to a state which is supposed to unite confederally with Jordan, in accordance with the resolution adopted by our National Council and the two fraternal peoples' free choice. If our brothers in Jordan agree, we will establish the confederation with them immediately. The state to be established, God willing, should have all these capabilities. [Khayrallah] When do you expect to reach Gaza or Jericho? ['Arafat] We hope that Israeli intransigence will end. The Israelis should understand that, if the central issue in the Middle East and the Arab nation, that is the Palestinian issue, is not resolved, there will be no stability, security, or peace, but rather, total chaos. So they should take account of the importance of resolving this issue. [Khayrallah] But how? What is your advice to them? ['Arafat] The agreement signed was not between us and Israel only. The world took part in it and it was signed by the U.S. and Russian cosponsors of the conference, under the U.S. President's auspices and before the eyes of the entire world, which blesses it. [Khayrallah] What are you actually requesting Israel to do? ['Arafat] To implement honestly and precisely what has been agreed. [Khayrallah] Do you believe that Israel has not read the agreement well? ['Arafat] No, it has read it well, but it is trying to maneuver and evade the substance of the agreement. [Khayrallah] What would you say about relations with Rabin? How do you find the man? ['Arafat] I say that military men honor their word, and I hope this will apply to the implementation of the agreement. [Khayrallah] What was the status of the talks with him, given it is the first time you have met with an Israeli prime minister? ['Arafat] They were not easy. The first meeting was difficult. But after that we moved to lay new foundations to implement the agreement, and when he requested the postponement of the withdrawal, I agreed. [Khayrallah] What attracted you in his personality? ['Arafat] He honors his word. [Khayrallah] What about Shim'on Peres? ['Arafat] He is an experienced politician. [Khayrallah] What is the difference between him and Rabin? ['Arafat] I do not interfere in the Israeli Government's private affairs. [Khayrallah] Yasir 'Arafat is accused of wanting to control everything, as though the stage can accommodate one person only. What is your opinion? ['Arafat] You know, building a homeland requires a man who works day and night. It is now 0115 hrs, and the work has just started. By God, if a child is wounded in the intifadah, I am responsible for him, and.... I would like to remind you of the committees we have set up to tackle the new situation with regard to building the Palestinian national authority. These committees have been formed at all levels. For example, the economic committee follows up matters with the donors and the World Bank. We have also started to set up establishments like the human rights committee as well as the environment, census, health, education, and housing establishments. [Khayrallah] How do you view Arab relations in general? ['Arafat] By God, they need further efforts from Arab leaders to restore Arab cohesion, because we are facing a new order and it will be to our cost if we do not confront it united. I call for further Arab unity in the interests of our children and posterity. [Khayrallah] Can you make an initiative in this connection? ['Arafat] I support the Arab League secretary general's initiative. [Khayrallah] What about Palestinian national unity and [Palestinian] opposition organizations? ['Arafat] I tell them one thing. Now that an understanding has been reached between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton and signs of a solution have begun to emerge on the Syrian front, I tell these organizations: My hand is extended to you in order to build the Palestinian National Authority and a free homeland for all the free people of Palestine -- a democratic, civilized, contemporary homeland based on the principles, values, ethics, and religious radiation derived from Palestine's traditions and civilization and the religious tolerance for which this land -- the land of Palestine, the land of peace, the land of sanctity -- is known. I extend my hand to you all in order to reinforce our national unity, because Palestine is being reborn, and Palestine needs all its women and children. [Khayrallah] How many hours do you work a day? ['Arafat] Between 17 and 18 hours, as usual. [Khayrallah] Are there any more visits coming up? ['Arafat] A visit to Egypt and a meeting with President Mubarak on Thursday, and a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Brown. Then I will go to Oslo to take part in the funeral of Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst, an old friend of mine since he was defense minister. He used to visit southern Lebanon to inspect his country's unit there.
