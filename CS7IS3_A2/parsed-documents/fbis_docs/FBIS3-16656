According to him, "the conflict between the Republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia is extremely acute, since one of the main human rights, the right to live, is being violated". Shumeyko reported that lawmakers instructed the Federation Council chairman to set up a special commission for further investigation into this issue. After this, the commission is to submit its proposals for the president's consideration. Lawmakers think it necessary to hold an enlarged meeting of the Security Council with the participation of the special commission so that the next meeting of the upper house could pass the final decision. The Federation Council chairman emphasised that this mechanism of decision-making was the most expedient. In his opinion, many decisions have been taken earlier, but all of them were never implemented. Therefore, Shumeyko stressed, "it is critical that all the three branches of power (the Federation Council, the president and the government) discuss this issue and make a joint decision". The upper house speaker also told reporters that deputies adopted at their meeting an appeal to the peoples of Ingushetia and North Ossetia. The document stresses the need "to lay down arms and solve the problems piled over many years by peaceful means".
