The shelling caused destruction, deaths, and injuries. The situation remained tense on the borders of Idzhevanskiy and Noyemberyanskiy rayons between 1830-2315. The Azerbaijani border troops fired towards Diran, Voskepar, and (?Sosi) using tanks, artillery, and infantry fighting vehicles. The shelling caused some injuries in Noyemberyanskiy. This periodic aggression proves that, as a rule, Azerbaijan uses the relative calm on the Armenian borders to prepare for new border violations. The Armenian Army's fighters had no choice but to retaliate in kind in all directions yesterday evening to force the Azerbaijanis stop the shelling. The situation was calm on Armenia's borders during the night and this morning.
