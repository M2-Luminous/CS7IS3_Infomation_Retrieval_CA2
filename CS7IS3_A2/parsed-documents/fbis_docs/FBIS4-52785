My wife and I are honored and pleased to welcome the delegation headed by Your Excellency on its visit to Myanmar and to host this banquet in honor of Your Excellency. The Union of Myanmar and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam [SRV] are two regional countries linked by traditional friendship. From the efforts made by leaders of both countries to restore independence, we still remember the lasting friendship fostered through the traditions of mutual assistance and understanding. During the Cold War era, ours were among the developing countries that participated in the Nonaligned Movement [NAM]. We have shared similar views on regional and international issues. We have also shared almost similar views on ways of building each country into a modern nation, while at the same time making efforts to improve the people's living standards and contributing to regional stability. Now that agricultural countries have shifted to market-oriented economies, I follow with keen interest the considerable achievements by Vietnam within a short time in the framework of its market-oriented economic policy. The application of knowledge acquired from each country's experiences and the promotion of cooperation for mutual benefit will help us bring about lasting stability and prosperity in each country, and thereby contributing to regional prosperity. Your Excellency: The relations between Vietnam and Myanmar are based on friendship, goodwill, and mutual understanding. Those relations have been consolidated and strengthened through exchanges of visits by leaders of our two countries. I am convinced that your visit will further consolidate the existing friendly ties between our two countries. I am pleased to say that during your current visit, we can exchange views on regional and international issues of common concern. I am positive that through straightforward and open-minded exchanges of views, we can further enhance the traditions of mutual respect, mutual understanding, and friendship between our two countries. Based on that willingness to share, the traditions of mutual assistance, goodwill, mutual understanding, and cooperation will become dynamic in our Southeast Asian region. Prompted by that spirit of mutual assistance, let us be determined to work toward the birth of modern and prosperous countries. Excellencies, distinguished guests, and dear friends: I would like to invite you to a toast to the lasting friendship between the Union of Myanmar and the SRV as well as for the good health and happiness of His Excellency Le Duc Anh, president of the SRV; His Excellency Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his wife, our distinguished guests; and all of our distinguished guests and friends present here this evening. [end recording] Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet then delivered his reply speech. He said: [Begin Vo Van Kiet recording] Your Excellency Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen: I am delighted to make my first visit to the friendly neighboring country of Myanmar, a country with a rich cultural heritage reflected in the well-known Golden Temple, and to meet the warm-hearted, diligent, and friendly people of Myanmar. I am deeply moved at the memory of our late beloved leader President Ho Chi Minh, who visited your country 36 years ago and opened a new stage for the relationship between our countries. I would like to express our sincere gratitude for the warm and solemn reception that Your Excellency Prime Minister and Madame Than Shwe and the people of Myanmar have given me and my delegation in our official and friendly visit to Myanmar. I would also like to thank Your Excellency for your fine statement about the country and people of Vietnam, as well as on the traditional and friendly relations between the two peoples. Vietnam and Myanmar are both located in Southeastern Asia and share numerous similarities in culture and history. The two peoples have traditional, long-lasting relations during our struggles for independence. People of Vietnam never forget the valuable support that the government and people of Myanmar gave us from the very early years when our republic was still in its infancy. Rangoon was the first gateway for Vietnam to reach the rest of the world during the time Vietnam was isolated during the 1940's. Vietnam and Myanmar were shoulder to shoulder in the Afro-Asia Solidarity Movement against colonialism during the 1950's. We are happy to see that in the new situation, our fine traditional relations, which had always been heartily fostered by the two peoples, are now developing along with our sincere cooperation in the aim to bring prosperity for each of our countries. I share with you the joy of seeing the great pace of positive changes which are taking place in your beautiful country, and I sincerely wish the people of the Union of Myanmar stability and prosperity. In recent years, with our correct renovation policy, the people of Vietnam have made important achievements, and are now entering the first stage of industrialization and modernization aimed at reaching the objectives of being a wealthy people, a powerful country, and an equitable and civilized society. Our achievements are also closely connected with our independent, self-reliant, open, and diversified foreign policy, with the active cooperation of friends, far and near alike, including Myanmar, a neighbor country which always have friendly sentiments towards Vietnam. On this occasion, I would like to affirm to Your Excellency that the government and people of Vietnam always regard highly the development of multi-faceted and friendly cooperation with Myanmar on the basis of respect for independence, sovereignty, non- interference in each other's internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit. We consider this a positive contribution to the development of our countries and also an important contribution to the cooperation developing in Southeast Asia. I am pleased with the results of our meeting this afternoon, and with our joint statement affirming the scope of cooperation and direction for development of our relations, our trade agreement, our tourism cooperation agreement, and our agreement on establishment of the joint cooperation committee. I think that this is an important new step in the relationship between our countries, and I believe that our official visit to Myanmar will contribute to further accelerating the friendship and cooperation between our countries for the interests of the two peoples, and for peace, stability, cooperation, and prosperity for Southeast Asia. In this warm and friendly atmosphere today, I would like to propose a toast for the happiness and prosperity of the people of Myanmar, for the good health of Your Excellency Prime Minister, Madame Than Shwe, and the leaders of Myanmar, and for the ever-developing friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and Myanmar, and for the good health of all guests and friends [end recording]. Dear friends: After the solemn banquet, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, his wife, and members of our government delegation viewed an interesting concert program performed by Burmese artists.
