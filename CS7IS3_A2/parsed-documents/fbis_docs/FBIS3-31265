These figures seem rather small to me considering that they are seen as a turning point in economic development. Apparently, all the basic things in reform have been done. [Dlouhy] Are you sure that everything has been done? [Paral] The prime minister declared recently that reform was over. [Dlouhy] We will certainly still get round to enterprise management, enterprises that have gone through coupon privatization, the role of the privatization funds, and the real state of relations between the owner and management. This is all just in the process of being defined and will be defined. On the other hand, I would not make an issue out of the differences between the government's estimate and that of the CNB. Bankers everywhere are, by nature, more skeptical than politicians, who "must" instill optimism. [Paral] I am not making an issue out of it. It is just that the two estimates seem low to me. [Dlouhy] If 2-percent growth is achieved, it will be a very good result, and I will consider it a real success. However, this is conditional on several facts. First and foremost, on whether the current dynamism of exports can be maintained. It will also depend, in the annual context, on how 1993 turned out. I said in July that the second half of the year would be worse and that we should expect decline. I was criticized for this, but we had a decline in the third quarter--for a rather prosaic reason. The third quarter of 1992 was so high that the year-to-year comparison simply had to be worse. On the other hand, the first quarter of 1993 was very low, so the first quarter of this year may be high. This is what reporters have said, after all. So, when growth is being considered, statistical issues play a role. It is also of no fundamental importance whether economic growth this year is 1 or 2 or 2.5 percent. On the other hand, what is of fundamental importance is the fact that the trend in the gross domestic product [GDP] is from - 14.2 percent in 1991 to - 7.1 percent in 1992, zero in 1993, and + 1.8 or + 2.2 percent in 1994, which not even RUDE PRAVO, which is associated more with the opposition political parties, can overlook as successful economic development. Growth will depend on the dynamism of exports. I have to mention that, from the point of view of the UN European Economic Commission, for instance, the Czech Republic was the only former communist country that recorded an increase in exports. In view of the figures already referred to, further growth in the first quarter is virtually certain. Furthermore, we can expect growth in real domestic demand, both in investments and in households' consumption. [Paral] In your opinion, then, is this year going to be a real turning point in the Czech economy's performance? [Dlouhy] You always use shock therapy terminology. Why do you always expect a turning point? I like this trend, - 1.1 in 1990, then - 14.2, - 7.1, and 0, and now it is improving slowly and, in time, cyclical fluctuations will become the norm. Would you want economic development like this? (Vladimir Dlouhy draws a V-shaped graph) [Paral] Yes. [Dlouhy] I do not advocate the Asian Tigers' principle for this country. [Paral] Do you think that, after such a profound decline, growth rates between 2 and 3 percent are acceptable for this country? [Dlouhy] Let us be realists in 1994 and 1995. The basic building blocks for a market economy have been laid in a rudimentary form here and, from this point of view, we are really a market economy. However, from the point of view of privatization, we see that small private enterprises are the only effective segment. This applies to only a few of the large enterprises, and a number of them will still undergo restructuring under the management of new owners. Nevertheless, they will also undergo a certain learning process, how to own and manage properly, which is, without a doubt, a bit of an impediment. Therefore, I do not anticipate particularly rapid growth for the next two years. It will then depend on the kinds of lessons this country learns and on the external conditions. Given a sensible economic policy, we can then achieve greater economic growth. I repeat, however, that I have never claimed that we can become an Asian Tiger. Nevertheless, if I am mistaken, all the better. [Paral] We have a Polish neighbor, however, who has conducted a very similar economic policy, apart from privatization, and recorded a growth rate of approximately 4 percent last year and expects to do the same this year. [Dlouhy] Of course, the situation is a little different in Poland. You have to realize that they have a different situation as far as their debt, inflation, and other macroeconomic indexes are concerned. Apart from this, I feel that there is a danger of the economy in Poland overheating. All the data tells me that we did well when we embarked on a path of maximum macroeconomic stabilization. Now, of course, while maintaining stability, we are looking for growth as fast as possible. If it is 2 percent next year, thank God. [Paral] Are the Poles not achieving higher growth because they have also paid more attention to structural changes? [Dlouhy] We compiled special industrial figures for the first three quarters of 1993. We can elicit a specific change in the structure from these figures. Industry is contracting. This is not a tragedy, however. After all, we said that industry has to be reduced in size. Of course, it must not disappear into a black hole, but it is quite in order for industry to be reduced in size from the point of view of the number of employees and from the point of view of its proportion of the GDP. This is a natural restructuring process. The issue here mainly involves whether restructuring is taking place during a period of decline. An average of 35,000-40,000 people per month are made redundant in our country. Despite this, the unemployment rate is rising relatively slowly. This means that the majority of these people find a new job immediately. At the same time, I see changes in the cost structure, in productivity, and in employment away from heavier branches such as metallurgy, the power-generating industry, and bulk chemicals toward general engineering and certain branches of light industry. Therefore, I am able to argue that slowly but surely changes are taking place. [Paral] Don't you think that branches such as heavy engineering should be shaped and restructured according to demand? After all, they know that we have to build roads and highways, reconstruct railroads, and modernize the telephone network and that materials and equipment are necessary for this. [Dlouhy] Am I preventing the managements of these firms from making the predictions you mention? I sincerely hope that they are making them. If they are not doing this, they are bad managements. [Paral] But the government has a very stepmotherly attitude toward these projects? [Dlouhy] This is not true. Last year, especially in the second half of it, was the first time we said something more conceptual about the infrastructure. You have to realize that we inherited a divided state. A strategy was devised in the second half of the year to construct a highway network before the year 2005. By the way, the Bavarian industry minister told me that it is clear to him that we will complete the highway from Prague to Rozvadov in 1997, but they will not complete their 35 kilometers from Amberg until the year 2000. This means that these projects do not proceed so fast even in Germany. We now know that the Prague-Berlin, Breclav-Vienna, and Nuremberg-Prague railroad routes will be constructed. Other issues are also under discussion. Tenders are being issued for the Ingolstadt oil pipeline. The fundamental trends in the upgrading of telecommunications are also obvious. No company is being prevented from structuring itself in accordance with anticipated demand. [Paral] I have heard that only half of the budget resources intended for investment were drawn on last year. [Dlouhy] I do not know these figures by heart. If this were indeed the case, it would not be due to unwillingness on the part of the government. I have not come across a case whereby the Finance Ministry has not wanted to apportion the funds projected by the state budget for investments. If this is the case, it means that these projects were not ready. [Paral] As far as I am aware, your opinion of the budget was somewhat different from the current budget concept asserted by the Finance Ministry. Do you think that the budget also has to be balanced in the short term? [Dlouhy] It depends on whether you look as this issue as the trade and industry minister or as the finance minister. If I were finance minister, I would work for a constantly balanced budget. As industry minister, I like the idea of expenditure temporarily exceeding revenue with its possibilities for rejuvenating the economy and for facilitating the opposite ratio between income and revenue in the future. The problem is that few people have recorded such development in the history of advanced countries. This is an argument against my point of view. The Reagan policy began well in this regard in 1981, then, under political pressure following the deployment of SS-20 missiles, the United States had to increase its armaments, and the potential budget surplus was nullified in this process. Despite this, I would at least leave it open to discussion that it is unnecessary to be afraid of a sensible deficit if it really has the effect of economic growth. On the other hand, the question is to what extent our economy is ready for such stimuli. To what extent the businessman is capable of using tax relief, the foreign investor will really use such relief for our development, and so on. The question is, what effect would a greater volume of state orders and so on have on demand? We could take the prime minister at his word here. If we have indeed laid the foundations of the market economy, we should begin to believe more in the progrowth effect of the budget deficit. [Paral] Now, of course, enterprises both private and state are grappling with the fact that they have no money. The reason is widespread insolvency. However, they have not been provided with sufficient capital since the era of state ownership. [Dlouhy] This is a combination of several problems. The first is the problem of primary and secondary insolvency. A number of people have expressed opinions that insolvency should begin to be perceived as a specific business credit. I am not saying that insolvency has ceased to be a problem to me. It is enforced, whereas business credit is voluntary. [Paral] I think the fact that the enterprise cannot afford this is an even greater problem. It cannot afford to defer payment because it would not have anything to make purchases with. [Dlouhy] But this is also because the banks do not want to give it anything because it is in a poor financial situation, and it is in a poor financial situation because the firms it supplies do not pay it. Low capitalization is associated with the level of savings--how people and companies are able to make a profit and how they are willing to turn it into capital. We have too short a time behind us for this. A number of businesses are making a loss. Only a few businesses make such a large profit that they can immediately invest it. Credit is also accessible to only a limited circle of enterprises. There is no long-term financing or long-term credit in this country. After all, RUDE PRAVO should be closer to Marx--from the point of view of membership in political parties--than I am. If something is perfectly described in Das Kapital, then it is, in the first volume, the original accumulation of capital. This is quite relevant from the point of view of the Czech economy in the 1990's. In England, the original accumulation of capital took decades, and, although the situation is now completely different, we had an incredibly undernourished economy here after 40 years, an economy that has even received a couple of blows from outside--for example, the collapse of traditional markets and the recession in Europe. There is another reason we will not emulate the Asian Tigers: South Korea and Taiwan tightened their belts and created a capital basis to the detriment of the population's standard of living. This cannot be implemented in our country. So, in our country, the 1990's will be a period of forming capitalization. All of this will still lead to many changes in the structure of the economy and to changes in employment. By saying this, I am not imparting pessimism. This is sober and real optimism, which, however, forces me to accept that our enterprises are under capitalized, that it is difficult for them to gain access to finance, and that this is associated with a whole bundle of problems that will begin to be unwrapped gradually. [Paral] In the wake of coupon privatization, a large number of enterprises are in the hands of the major investment funds, and it is not in their interest to increase the enterprise's capital. The fund is interested in having a good enterprise in its portfolio and not in helping an enterprise in difficulty. When an enterprise finds itself in trouble, the fund sells its shares and buys others and does not extricate it from the mess. What are your experiences? [Dlouhy] Naturally, there are a great many problems here. In part, in the actual execution of ownership. There are difficulties in administration, management, supervision of it, in some places outright gold-digging by means of membership on boards, collecting royalties, and so on. You say that in advanced countries the funds try to sell an enterprise in difficulty. In this advanced economy--and the more so in our country--they also try to restructure and revive this enterprise before they sell it. We said that the state will do this only in exceptional cases. The new owners should do this. The funds will be in a situation where they will have good and bad enterprises and where they will inherit large holding companies--for instance, Aero. To sell them, they will have to be restructured. A bad enterprise will be divided. The completely inefficient part will be declared bankrupt, and the remainder will be kept or sold. What is happening is not evidence of a poorly chosen means of privatization. I personally place greater emphasis on the issue of executing ownership rights. It is not that people do not know how to make strategic decisions. The problem is putting such a decision into effect--both from the point of view of the supervisory council and the owner and the board and the director general. This is where I see the weakest element. The issue does not so much involve the managers--we have good ones--but the method of supervising them, encouraging them, and their sometimes unnecessarily high salaries.
