Accompanied by Wu Bangguo, secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, and Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai, Jiang arrived at the home of Liu Tianfu, director of the Shanghai General Factory of Corduroy, at about 9:00 in the morning. He greeted Liu's family and praised Liu's spirit of fighting against difficulties to extricate his factory from the predicament of general debility. He said that he believes the factory will surely get better and better. Liu was former director of the Shanghai No. 17 bleaching and dyeing mill, an advanced and profitable enterprise in Shanghai. But he voluntarily gave up the post to become director of the factory of corduroy, which had experienced general deficits. Although his monthly income has been greatly reduced, Liu has been mobilizing the workers and staff members of the factory of corduroy to turn the factory around. Jiang and his contingent next arrived at the home of Du Yuying, a female weaver of the Shanghai Longtou Co. Ltd. (formerly the Shanghai No. L7 Textile Mill) who has developed an advanced method of looking after the looms and now studies the subject of management at the China textile university. Jiang encouraged Du to persist in studying and set an example for other workers. Afterwards, Jiang called on Zhu Zhihao, chief commander of the construction of both the Nanpu and Yangpu bridges and one of the ten top model workers in Shanghai. The two bridges are among the biggest cable-stayed bridges in the world. Jiang asked about the design and construction of the bridges and encouraged Zhu and other bridge builders to catch up with world levels in construction of bridges. He also had pictures taken with the members of Zhu's three-generation family. Hearing the news that General Secretary Jiang was calling at the workers' living quarters, many residents lined the road or stood on their balconies to applaud and extend regards to Jiang. Smiling, Jiang waved back to the crowds and said to them: "Happy festival."
