The Maastricht Treaty is a "remarkable work," a "perfect machine," but this "grandiose administrative machinery" is lacking a "spiritual, moral or emotional dimension," said Mr. Havel during a speech that was loudly applauded by the members of the European Parliament. "Many people could have the impression that the EU consists of interminable debates on the quantity of carrots that some people are authorized to export to other people, or on the body that sets or checks quotas," said the Czech head of state. To remedy this situation, the EU must now engage in renewed debate on the European identity, he added. He also suggested that the EU draw up a charter clearly defining its major ideas, its meaning, and the values to which it aims to give substance. "If the citizens of Europe understand this is not just a restrictive, anonymous bureaucratic monster that goes so far as to deprive them of their identity, but a new model for the human community, which, on the contrary, considerably broadens their freedom, then the EU will have nothing to fear as regards its future," he said. Mr. Havel also reiterated the Czech Republic's wish to accede to the EU, although he did not set a date for accession, and Europe's interest as a whole in seeing the EU expand by insisting on the interdependence of the various regions of the European continent. European history shows that "calm, peace, and prosperity cannot flourish in one part of Europe, without taking account of what is happening in the other part," he added. "The Cold War era, during which the cohesion imposed in the Soviet bloc nourished the cohesion of the West, is definitely over," and the events in the former Yugoslavia remind us that "disturbances, chaos, and violence are, by nature, infectious and contagious," he continued. He reminded the listeners that the Czech Republic and the EU have been linked since last October by an association agreement.
