Judge Riyad Tali' has issued an arrest warrant against Gh. T., formerly a security official in one of the militias, and two of his assistants, Sayid Sh. and Tony J. The military authorities have also arrested a military man, Shirfan B., who plotted with the above suspects to assassinate President al-Hirawi when he was living in the temporary presidential residency in al-Ramlah al-Bayda' [in West Beirut]. Shirfan, an officer candidate in the Lebanese Army, agreed to work for Gh. T. in return for a sum of money. He constantly submitted reports on the activity of the presidential office, the details of the president's office and bedroom, and the times when he was present in his office. He also gave information on the names of the officers and members of presidential guard. Judicial sources said Shirfan and Tony confessed under interrogation that Tony introduced Shirfan to Gh. T. and conferred with him several times in Burj al-Fidar in Jubayl. GH. T. explained to Shirfan how to place an explosive device in the president's office, either by booby-trapping the telephone or by putting the explosive device in a flower pot. Gh. T. promised Shirfan to give him a sum of money and to secure his travel to the United States.
