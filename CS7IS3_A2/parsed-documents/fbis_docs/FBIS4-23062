Kotlyarov; UDC 621.396.61:621.375.026] [Abstract] The criteria for statistical optimization of the power engineering of the adaptive sections of wideband vacuum-tube oscillators not containing automatic load-matching systems were considered. The operating algorithm of the system considered was geared toward maximum output power and electronic efficiency of the terminal section of the transmitter by establishing the optimum excitation voltage in the vacuum tube's control grid and optimal plate supply voltage at which the oscillator's dynamic range is fully utilized. Working measurements of an actual vacuum tube's electrical operating modes served as the starting data. First a generalized mathematical model of the oscillator stage was developed. The optimal resistance of the vacuum-tube oscillator's load was calculated. The third stage of the statistical analysis consisted of a computer simulation of a vacuum-tube oscillator based on a GU-92B tetrode that was connected in a circuit with a common cathode and operated in a class B mode for a randomly mismatched load. The analysis established that the greater the uncertainty of the impedance of the antenna-feed section of the transmitter, the higher the the energy gain obtained by adapting the oscillator's mode to the load mismatch. This design decision was thus recommended for use when designing items such as wideband shortwave and ultrashortwave radio transmitters for mobile equipment with short antennas where frequency irregularity and time instability of input impedance are both very significant.
