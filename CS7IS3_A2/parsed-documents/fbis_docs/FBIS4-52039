FBIS4-52039 "dreas088_a_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Reaction to Nagano's Remarks on Nanjing Reported Reaction to Nagano's Remarks on Nanjing Reported Nagano Hints at Resignation OW0605102694 Tokyo KYODO in English 1014 GMT 6 May 94 OW0605102694 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Excerpt] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano hinted at his resignation Friday [6 May] over his earlier remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre is a fabrication, saying the remarks were "inappropriate." Nagano told a news conference that he wants to completely recant his denial of the 1937 Nanjing massacre which he had made in Wednesday's edition of the MAINICHI SHIMBUN, saying the slaughter was an "undeniable fact." "My remarks regarding the historical incident (of the Nanjing massacre) which I made the other day were inappropriate, so I would like to withdraw them," Nagano said. Nagano said, "I share exactly the same view with Prime Minister (Tsutomu) Hata, who said in Paris that our country's invasion and colonial rule (of Asian neighbors) inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on many people." "I feel responsibility deeply, so I would like to live up to the decision of Hata who appointed me to this office," he said. Hata, currently on a four-nation European tour, reprimanded Nagano over the phone on Friday for his remarks, government sources said. Nagano told the mass-circulation MAINICHI that "the Nanjing incident was a fabrication," and that "I still think it wrong to define the war as a war of aggression (by Japan)." The sources said Hata was "very concerned" about the Asian reaction to this latest attempt to reinterpret Japan's prewar history. "The aggressive behavior of our nation and colonial domination caused unbearable suffering and sorrow on many people," Hata reportedly told Nagano while outlining his cabinet's position. Supporting former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks that Japan made the invasion toward Asian nations, Nagano said during Friday's news conference, "Japan with its self-righteous attitude invaded (those nations) and gave unbearable pain to (their) people." Nagano said, "each Japanese citizen must recognize these historical incidents and share the resolve not to repeat these things." Nagano, 71, a graduate of the former elite Japanese Military Academy, assumed the post of first lieutenant in the Japanese Imperial Army in 1945 when World War II ended. Nagano, a House of Councillors member of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], is a former chief of staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force. Nagano, saying he had visited Nanjing several times before the end of the World War II, however, said that the number of people who were killed in Nanjing is not certain. "But, there must have been a massacre even if the number of those killed differs according to historians." On the so-called foreign "comfort women" who were forced to provide sex to Japanese soldiers during World War II, Nagano said the government "should deal with the issue sincerely." Beijing and Seoul led Asian nations in condemning Nagano's remarks, with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu calling the remarks a distortion of historical facts. Domestically, the chorus of reprimands continued to build. [passage omitted]
