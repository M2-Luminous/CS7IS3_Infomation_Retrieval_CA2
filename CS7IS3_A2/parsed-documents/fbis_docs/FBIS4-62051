Industrial Lobby Proved To Be Stronger than Agricultural One"] [Text] The presidential elections in the Republic of Komi, which were held 8 May, were won by Yuriy Spiridonov, speaker of the local Supreme Soviet. According to a preliminary tally, Yuriy Spiridonov won 51 percent of the vote. His main rival, Vyacheslav Khudyayev, chairman of the republic's Council of Ministers, garnered 33 percent, the press service of the Komi Supreme Soviet reported. Political figures in Komi pointed out that Vyacheslav Khudyayev's election drive against Yuriy Spiridonov, former first secretary of the CPSU oblast committee, was actively supported by Veniamin Osipov, former oblast party second secretary. It is so "wide a choice between the first and second secretaries" that prompted the local branch of Democratic Russia to distance itself completely from the election campaign, saying that it will back only "a new, democratic leader when he emerges." Komi communists, who have initially also made a point of distancing themselves from the elections, at the eleventh hour announced their support for Vyacheslav Khudyayev. Local observers attribute this change to the fact that Mr. Khudyayev "represents the interests of a significant part of the old party and management elite, and also the directors of the state-owned farms." Among local democrats, talk is under way that Vyacheslav Khudyayev, "who has effectively exercised supreme authority in the republic recently, has so energetically lobbied for the interests of Komi state-owned farm directors that he gave local agricultural chiefs 80 percent out of the centralized loans worth 20 billion rubles received recently virtually for free." Meanwhile, the republic's industrialists, particularly the director of Komineft, the enterprise considered "Komi's main source of money," threw their weight behind Yuriy Spiridonov during the election campaign. Leonid Zilberg, leader of the local Republican Party, said in a conversation with your SEGODNYA correspondent that he welcomes Yuriy Spiridonov's election to the post of president, "because he at least does not hamper very much the emergence of new entrepreneurial structures and attracts foreign investors to the republic thanks to his connections." The leader of the Republicans thinks that "it is precisely thanks to Spiridonov's efforts that today Komi has the highest investment level in comparison with other regions of the Russian Federation." Leonid Zilberg believes, however, that "not only economic, but also ethnic leanings of the contenders had a role to play during the election campaign, because Yuriy Spiridonov is a Russian and Vyacheslav Khudyayev is a Komi." In the opinion of the Republican Party chief, "in the end, Spiridonov won the elections because Russians make up the majority of population in the Republic of Komi." Other party leaders are certain, however, that purely ethnic considerations should not be seen as a "priority" factor for both contenders for the presidency, "because each of them expresses the interests of entirely specific elite groups all the same." It is expected that upon Yuriy Spiridonov's assumption of power his loyal allies -- Anatoliy Karakchiyev, administration chief of the city of Syktyvkar, and Vladimir Torlopov, deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, who are both ethnic Komi -- will have the key roles to play in his future cabinet.
