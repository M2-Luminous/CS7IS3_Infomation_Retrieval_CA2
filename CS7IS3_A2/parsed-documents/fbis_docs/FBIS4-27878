Security Council is moving to impose economic sanctions against the communist country. According to officials of the nation's leading general trading companies, the U.N.'s move is forcing them to refrain from continuing the limited form of cooperation between them and North Korea. A typical form of cooperation now is South Korean firms sending material for light goods, including textiles and toys, to their North Korean partners for processing. The officials said domestic companies which have done business with North Korea in this way will stop trading with the country if the West-led economic sanctions materialize. Samsung Corp., a trading arm of the Samsung Business Group, is expected to abandon a project commissioning its North Korean partner to produce low-end apparel, said Chong Chin-chol, who is responsible for the firm's business projects with the North. "Despite the nuclear issue, we have thus far promoted economic cooperation between North and South Korea. But, in the future, we will respect any decision by the Korean Government concerning economic sanctions against the North," he said. However, Chong declined to comment on whether Samsung Corp. will stop contacting North Korean Government's officials in third nations or not. Through an agent in Beijing, the firm has kept a close communication channel with high-ranking Pyongyang officials. Hyundai Corp., a trading arm of the Hyundai Business Group, is also expected to stop importing $2 million-worth of zinc plates and scrap iron from the North until it completely abandons its nuclear program, a Hyundai official said. Along with the two general trading companies, Daewoo Corp. has already decided not to import steel ores and coals from the reclusive communist nation, said Mun Ki-hwan, a manager of the company. In addition, the trading arm of the Daewoo Business Group will no longer be involved in any processing contract with its North Korean partner for textile production as long as the country tries to go nuclear, Mun said. With the West coming perilously close to the precipice of sanctions against Pyongyang, Lucky-Goldstar International Corp. has decided to reserve projects to commission its North Korean firms to produce apparel and audio speakers, an official said. In 1993, inter-Korea trade fell 6 percent to $200 million from $213 million in 1992 mainly because of Pyongyang's shortage of foreign exchange and the nuclear issue which cooled overall inter-Korea relations. To reserve such indirect trading projects with North Korea will never bring South Korean businesses huge damages, said Kim Yong-sin, a manager of the Inter-Korea Trade Department at the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA). However, Kim expressed worry over the fact that if South Korean businesses stop trading with North Korea because of the West-led sanctions, it'll take a long period of time for them to revive trade relations with the North in the future.
