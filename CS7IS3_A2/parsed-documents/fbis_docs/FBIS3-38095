The point is that this is the wrong way to vote. It would be better to vote on separate chapters, and even better on separate articles. If the voting concerned separate articles, I would approve about 20 of them, the ex-speaker added. Asked why he did not join the statement signed by 40 deputies who refused to participate in the voting, Stanislav Shushkevich responded that he was simply not informed.
