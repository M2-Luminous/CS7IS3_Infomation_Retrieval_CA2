The Constitutional Court also could have demanded that the Duma stick to the rules, but there is no law on the Constitutional Court. Overall, this speaks of the weakness of the president's power. "The government is not against carrying out the amnesty. Indirect proof of this is the way the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] and the pro-government New Regional Policy faction have voted... The government does not have a concrete program and is looking for a scapegoat on whom to dump responsibility for what is happening in the country." Viktor Mironov (deputy chairman of the Duma Security Committee, member of the Russia's Choice faction): "Having accepted the amnesty, the criminals acknowledged their responsibility for the hundreds of people killed... I hope that the president and the enforcement structures will not allow it to come to a civil war... The duty of democratically minded people is to unite around the Russia's Choice party." Lev Ponomarev (cochairman of Democratic Russia movement): "Kazannik betrayed the president, who had appealed to him to hold up the amnesty process." Ivan Fedoseyev (Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Constitutional Committee, Russia faction coordinator, Russian All-Peoples Union cochairman): "I hope that Ruslan Imranovich will have enough wisdom not to exhort people to mass actions today... The legitimacy of both the new Constitution and the State Duma is questionable; however, it is unlikely that the voters would agree with it, and Ruslan Khasbulatov must take this into account. Ivan Shashviashvili (Russia faction): "Ruslan Imranovich should enter the political arena in his old capacity as Russian Federation Supreme Soviet chairman--the only legitimate body of state power despite the October massacre." Vladimir Isakov (Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Constitutional Committee, chairman of the Legislative and Judiciary Reform Committee): "I hope that the released prisoners will have enough political wisdom not to jump into politics in the next few months. This would seriously complicate the situation in the country." Mikhail Astafyev (chairman of the Constitutional Democratic Party): The key figure today is Aleksandr Rutskoy. There are two presidents in Russia today, and only one of them--Rutskoy--is the legitimate one. This seriously complicates the political situation." Ruslan Khasbulatov: "I do not see real politicians in our country, I do not see anyone in the leadership with whom you could reach an agreement and who would then keep their word. Machiavelli is a child compared to them. For me, on the other hand, moral principles in politics are particularly important... Had I not been released by the Duma decision, I would still have been freed--first, because the investigators were not able to find corpus delicti, and second, because of my state of health... An attempt to return to Lefortovo those who have been released from the investigative detention facility under amnesty will only underline the stupidity of the organizers of such actions. In the near future I intend to sort out my papers... I have felt my heart for the first time, how it hurts; therefore, I have to take care of my health right now..." Ilya Konstantinov (National Salvation Front leader): "The former Lefortovo prisoners do not want to see the political struggle in Russia transcend the boundaries of legitimacy, and intend to help stabilize the political situation... Attempts to link the political amnesty with the beginning of a new round of civil war in Russia are a political provocation." Vyacheslav Kostikov: "The act of releasing from Lefortovo the organizers of and participants in the October 1993 events is a blasphemous deed... People who were ready to push Russia into a bloodbath have been set free without a trial... The deputies abused the trust people vested in them and took the side of state villains... Aleksey Kazannik's resignation is the reaction of an extremely noble and decent man who has been put in a difficult legal situation... Until a new general procurator is appointed, the situation will be deadlocked." Gavriil Popov, Russian Democratic Reform Movement chairman): "The president's staff has displayed amazing inaction... The president could have made an anticipatory move on the Duma decision by offering it his own version of amnesty, which would have precisely and clearly specified the terms on which the criminal case is dismissed; one such term could be a ban on participation in political activities for a certain period of time... The course of investigation in the GKChP [State Committee on the State of Emergency] case and the October events has demonstrated the complete helplessness of the law enforcement system; a top to bottom purge of the procuracy is needed." Sergey Shakhray: "The amnesty is in line with the strategic interests of the president and the government... The president loses more politically by keeping his opponents behind bars... At the same time, the result of violating the logic of the national reconciliation plan proposed by the PRES, in which the amnesty is only one element, bundled together with a memorandum of accord and the decision on disbanding the commission on investigation of the October events, will be that those released will again jump into political struggle. Its outcome will depends on random factors... Aleksey Kazannik's resignation may plunge the procuracy into the orbit of political passions." Shmidt Dzyublyayev (general secretary of the Assembly of North Caucasus Democratic Forces): "The economic and political situation makes it incumbent on the president of Russia to impose a state of emergency... The Duma decision is an unprecedented act of absolute disrespect for the law... Sergey Shakhray should share responsibility for this with the communist obscurantists." Yuriy Baturin (the president's national security adviser): "The president of Russian Federation's appeal to the State Duma with the proposal to modify the decree on the amnesty should have cleared the way for the reconciliation process. However, the haste of general procuracy members considerably complicated the situation... This haste was displayed even contrary to the position of the State Duma itself... It is clear that General Procurator Kazannik's own position in this case was duplicitous... I can say that he has deceived us." Ivan Rybkin: "If some people show that they do not have enough brains and compassion not to start a confrontation, the State Duma will see to it that such people are severely punished... Perhaps in the future a memorandum should be adopted, upon concurrence with other branches of authority, on a system of criteria and the mechanism of responsibility of state institutions and politicians for decisions aimed at reaching civic peace, national reconciliation, and consensus." Mikhail Poltoranin: "The president cannot relax the reins of power; otherwise, the chariot of Russian statehood will overturn."
