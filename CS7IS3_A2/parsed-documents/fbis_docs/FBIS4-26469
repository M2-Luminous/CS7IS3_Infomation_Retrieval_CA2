On Monday night equity prices around the world dived on the back of a weakening dollar. But if that bad news was not enough to wreck what was left of Hong Kong's sentiment, then the eventual effects on the territory's economy from the greenback's crash could be worse. Because of the peg, anything that happens to America's dollar also affects Hong Kong's currency. In the short to medium-term it might be of some benefit to foreign companies in Hong Kong worried about the cost of doing business here. If their home currency is European or Japanese then they will get more for their Hong Kong buck than before. But that will soon be overridden by higher prices for things the territory brings in from the outside world--things such as food, cars and steel. And that will lead to inflation. As the cost of imports rises, so the cost is passed on--to consumers who buy imported goods in shops, or to companies who buy equipment or raw materials from overseas. The effects are compounded by the push for higher wages to cope with the higher cost of imports and the cycle then repeats itself. Multi-national companies in Hong Kong will hardly suffer. They have their pick of sources and currencies and are insulated from some of the effects of a falling dollar. It is the individual consumer and smaller companies who are likely to suffer most. Traders and exporters busily turning drums of polymer into Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod's action figures will initially be seduced by the thought of being able to offer lower yen prices to Japanese customers and lower mark prices to European customers. But as the effects of a devaluing dollar are pushed through the system, that feeling will fade. Hong Kong imports huge amounts from Japan $178.03 billion last year and most of that is in consumer goods such as cars. As the price of Japanese goods rises, Hong Kong will likely start to feel the effects both in extra costs and in higher wage demands, as higher import prices convert into wage inflation. The question is: How big an effect and how soon? It is not easy to answer. There are those who will argue that a stronger yen will act only at the margins of the economy. Most imports from Japan are consumer goods and many will be pushed straight out again in the form of reexports or tourist purchases. The second factor to consider with Japan is the scale of Japanese investment in Hong Kong and China. It has not been noted much in Europe or the US yet, but Japan's foreign policy has long shifted from its trading relationship with the West to its relationships in Asia. In the old days, the giant Japanese firms were tumbling over each other to open factories inside Fortress Europe. No longer. And when trade talks broke down a few months ago, the Japanese almost shrugged their shoulders. With the passing of the generation which was old enough to see and understand World War II, Japan is again trying to extend its ties in the region. The bad blood is diminishing and in its place is a hunger for cheap Japanese loans and the friendly hand of a nation willing to take equity stakes in even the most crumbling ruin in China not just because of future potential, but because of the disaster which hangs over the whole region if China's economic reforms spin out of control and end up a failure. Japan's Foreign Ministry is now far more interested in China's continued prosperity and stability that it is in what becomes of the U.S. dollar. If the dollar dives, there is that much less danger of U.S. President Bill Clinton trying to beat the Japanese trade surplus into submission. Meanwhile, Japan gets on with the business at hand--making Asia great. If the money which Japan is presently pulling out of the U.S. dollar finds its way to Hong Kong it will obviously be good news. The cloud on the horizon is in the form of reports from brokers that Japanese clients are going to cash in Hong Kong to insulate themselves from currency loss. Better to think that every dollar the Japanese take out of the U.S. to protect themselves from the fall is a dollar which could find its way back into building up Asia.
