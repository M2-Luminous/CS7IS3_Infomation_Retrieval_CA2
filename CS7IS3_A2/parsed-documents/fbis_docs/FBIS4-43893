"There is confirmation of Italy's production quotas for milk, but we are not satisfied with proposals on milk derivatives, citrus fruit, tobacco, olive oil, beef and rice," said the spokesman. In an interview this morning with the Euronews TV channel, Italy's Agriculture Minister Adriana Poli Bortone said "there is a 50 percent chance that the issue will be brought up at the Corfu European Council summit." Italy has threatened to bring the issue up at the summit should its demands not be met in the Luxembourg marathon. Complicating today's talks, however, is a Greek demand to triple its milk quota to 300,000 tonnes a year. The compromise document approves Italy's request to hike its quota from nine million tonnes to 9.9 million tonnes per year. "We don't want to be perpetually subjected to the blackmail of the milk quotas," Poli Bortone told her colleagues here. "Italy has recognised the mistakes it made on the quotas, and now it does not want to be judged for a sort of original sin," she said. The minister described the situation as "unsustainable" given that Italy is only 60 percent self-sufficient in milk and imports around 9 million metric tons each year. Poli Bortone pointed out that "our requests on future prices and measures to manage markets are all zero-cost," regarding tobacco, rice, olive oil, beef, citrus fruits, and the famous cheeses of the Po valley like parmigiano and grana.
