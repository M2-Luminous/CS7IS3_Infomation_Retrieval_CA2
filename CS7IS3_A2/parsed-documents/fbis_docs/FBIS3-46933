Now, the United States has informally asked the Japanese Government that American-grown rice account for 40-60 percent of rice imported under the minimum access arrangements. This was disclosed on 3 January by a source familiar with Japan-U.S. trade negotiations. The United States, which is trying to increase its exports of rice to Japan, is believed to have made the informal request with the aim of securing a long-term share of the Japanese rice market. The government does not want to adopt a country-by-country quota system for fear of drawing criticism from other rice exporting nations. The United States is expected to press hard for its demand in the future and the Japanese Government is likely to face difficulties in dealing with the U.S. demand. Japan has committed itself to partially opening its rice market. It will have to import about 400,000 tons of rice, or 4 percent of domestic rice consumption, in 1995 and increase imports to about 800,000 tons, or 8 percent of the domestic rice consumption six years later. The Uruguay Round multilateral trade agreement decided to delay the enforcement of tariffication for six years and to adopt a "special exception" under which minimum access would increase. It is said strong pressure from the United States was behind the decision. The U.S. Rice Millers Association (RMA) and American rice exporters point out that "the price of American-grown rice is relatively higher than Thai rice and that American rice may not sell on the Japanese rice market." The prevailing view among the RMA and American rice exporters is that it would be advantageous for American rice exporters to secure an export quota to Japan for six years and use this to increase their share of the market. The acreage of rice paddies in Arkansas and California where medium- and small-grained rice (the Japonika variety) is grown has expanded since Japan decided to partially open its rice market and enthusiasm in the two states for exporting rice to Japan is gradually growing. The request from the U.S. Government is said to be like a country-by-country quota under which each exporting nation is allotted a fixed quantity which Japan will import. The Japanese Government, however, does not like the idea. A source at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said: "We cannot set a country-by-country rice import quota in writing and notify each rice exporting nation of it." The Japanese Government is believed to take such a dim view of the U.S. request after concluding that, "if Japan proposes adopting a country-by-country quota system in multilateral trade negotiations, it could not avoid facing criticism from such major rice exporting nations as Thailand and Australia." Under the current stable food control system, the government is obliged to manage the rice that is imported under the minimum access arrangements. A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said: "We will make a comprehensive decision on which countries Japan should import rice from after examining the use and price of rice and the capabilities of the rice exporting nations involved." Some government officials, however, take the view that given the past history of bilateral trade negotiations, Japan will have no choice but to accept the U.S. demand.
