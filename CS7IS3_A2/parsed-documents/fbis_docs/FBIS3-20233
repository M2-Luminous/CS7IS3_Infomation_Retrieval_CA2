At this meeting, the defense minister disclosed that he will meet with defense manufacturers soon to sensitize them on one issue: "They undoubtedly will have to cut costs." This effort will be organized the General Arms Directorate, whose chief, Henri Conze, in a recent article in LE FIGARO called on manufactureres to achieve a 2-percent productivity increase. You need not be a highly skilled accountant to understand that this 2 percent, when added to the 0.5-percent annual growth rate provided for in the future military programming law which reportedly has been accepted by the Matignon [prime minister's office], will result in a 2.5-percent gain annually . This is the minimum growth rate needed to ensure, in theory, that all major arms programs will continue, although some staggering or downsizing still may be required. According to a reliable source, Leotard will invite some 15 highly placed representatives of the companies involved (Aerospatiale, Dassault, Matra, Giat Industries, and others) to lunch on Thursday to discuss cost cutting. Serge Dassault, who was in the audience together with Aerospatiale chief Louis Gallois and SNPE [National Powders and Explosives Company] chief Emile Blanc, emphasized that his company has been undergoing this kind of exercise for several years. With regard to the 1995-2000 military programming law, Francois Leotard stated that, "at the present time, the opinions of all of the organizations involved have been returned, all the work has been completed, and the results are now being written up." However, its contents will not be disclosed until it has been scrutinized closely by the Elysee [office of the president], probably at the next Defense Council meeting on 6 April, and by the Council of Ministers on 20 or 27 April.
