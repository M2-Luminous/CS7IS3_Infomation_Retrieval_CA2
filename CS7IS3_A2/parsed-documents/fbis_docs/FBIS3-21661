He has ordered the Thai consulate to coordinate things, help find a lawyer, and provide other help. Hong Kong police officials and U.S. DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] officials arrested Major General Thanat Phakpadiphat, who is assigned to the Supreme Command, in Hong Kong on charges of trafficking in heroin. The minister of foreign affairs, who was interviewed by reporters before leaving on a trip to Cambodia on 11 December, said that he has not been contacted by Major General Thanat. If it is found that he actually was involved in illegal activities, resolute action must be taken in accord with the law. As for whether he will be extradited to the United States for trial, that depends on the extradition treaty between the United States and Hong Kong. [passage omitted] In an interview, General Wichit Sukmak, the minister of defense, said that Major General Thanat's arrest by DEA officials in Hong Kong is a personal matter and will not affect the Army's image.
