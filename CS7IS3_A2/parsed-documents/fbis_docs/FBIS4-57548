The minister agreed to answer questions from labor and peasant leaders, journalists, and a number of legislators during a public meeting at the Radio Primero de Marzo auditorium. Podesta admitted that the police shot at shoulder height in Tacuara. He was nevertheless strongly accused and criticized for his performance at the head of the Interior Ministry. He was also criticized for the government's performance. A good portion of the questioning session centered on the violent incidents in Tacuara during the 2 May general strike, and the murder of peasant leader Esteban Balbuena. The program was conducted by journalists Carlos Peralta and Andres Granje. Podesta was calm in answering questions from labor and peasant leaders during the program. At some points, however, he showed signs of being annoyed, particularly when he heard strong accusations against his performance in the case of the death of the peasant in Tacuara. The minister defended the image of the police institution at all times, saying that it was not a criminal organization. Regarding police performance during the peasant demonstration at Tacuara, Podesta said that the police had been instructed to try to reason with the demonstrators as much as possible, adding that no one received orders to shoot at anyone. In the midst of the debate Podesta recognized: "There were police officers, more than one, who shot at shoulder height. We recorded the incidents, and thanks to the videos we can determine who they are. A total of 17 police officers are under arrest at this time." Later the minister recognized that the police had been inefficient in Tacuara, adding, however, that the police officers did not have any ill intentions. Podesta denied that he had received instructions to order the police to be inflexible during the strike, not even from President Wasmosy. Labor leaders Alan Flores and Eduardo Ojeda strongly criticized the performance of Podesta, who said he will not hide from his responsibility in the event and will not resign. "It is not fair to include my resignation among labor's demands," the minister told union leaders. Podesta denied that the killing of peasant leader Estaban Balbuena had any political implications. He added that an in-depth investigation of the case has not produced enough evidence to come to that conclusion. The questioning session reached a climax when Arganaist [from the Luis Maria Argana faction of the Colorado Party] Deputy Walter Bower intervened to characterize Podesta as "an expert in political warfare." The legislator said the questioning session fitted his purposes perfectly, as the minister was able to show his qualities and confuse the people even more. At the end of the program, labor and peasant leaders said they were not satisfied with Podesta's answers. At one point during the questioning session, Podesta denied that peasants were being blamed for wanting to destabilize President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's government. Podesta thus contradicted accusations made by the president, who repeatedly blamed peasants for the alleged campaign to destabilize his government. Labor leaders accused the government of implementing an alleged plan to eliminate labor and peasant leaders, citing the recent assassinations of Esteban Balbuena and Sebastian Larrosa. Podesta categorically denied that the government was planning to eliminate social and labor organization leaders. The secretary of state insisted that the police department was not a criminal organization, adding that the government was working to turn the institution into a healthy organization. "This is what we have. We are working on it," Podesta added. At another point, the minister said that government authorities regret more than anyone else what happened during the 2 May general strike. He said the ministry had ordered an inquiry to find out exactly what happened. The minister also said he trusted that the murders of peasant leaders Esteban Balbuena and Sebastian Larrosa would not go unpunished.
