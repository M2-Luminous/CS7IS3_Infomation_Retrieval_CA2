FR940110-2-00049 FR940110-2-00035 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;94&hyph;000] Southern Natural Gas Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff January 4, 1994. Take notice that on December 30, 1993, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, the tariff sheets listed on appendix A to the filing, to become effective March 1, 1994. Southern states that the tariff sheets reflect an anticipated reduction in the level of firm service from its customer, Atlanta Gas Light Company, and a reduced level of jurisdictional revenues from the level established under the compliance filing in Docket No. RS92&hyph;10. Southern states that it has continued to employ the Straight Fixed Variable method for cost classification, cost allocation and rate design and has utilized the mitigation methods required by the Commission in its Order of September 3, 1993. In order to prevent a significant increase to Southern's remaining firm customers as a result of the reduced firm service entitlements Southern proposes to (1) design IT rates based on a 75% load factor basis, (2) charge separately for injections and withdrawals into the Contract Storage Service (CSS) and the ANR Storage Service, and (3) revise the allocation methodology for the ANR Storage Service to reflect the use of contract demands for allocating costs to this incremental service. Southern requests waiver of the five-month suspension period in order to allow the proposed tariff sheets to become effective March 1, 1994, the date the anticipated reduced service levels will become effective. Southern states that copies of the filing were served upon all of Southern's jurisdictional purchasers, shippers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before January 11, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
