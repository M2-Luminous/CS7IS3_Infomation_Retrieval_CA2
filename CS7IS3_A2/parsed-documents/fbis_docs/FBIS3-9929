According to the Belizean Embassy, the peasants, who have established themselves in the "Chiquibul" national park, have been given 15 days to clear the area with a deadline that expires on 10 March. Guatemalan Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz said Guatemala does not acknowledge the Belizean Government's authority to give alleged "ultimatums" to Guatemalan families living in border areas. Guatemalan Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez asserted that the Army will not tolerate any "meddling" on Belize's part in Guatemala's national sovereignty, much less the "intimidation" of Guatemalan citizens. Enriquez added that the Belizean authorities are "being unreasonable" and that they cannot set deadlines for families to abandon the area in question because Guatemala still disputes ownership of that territory. Belize gained its independence from Great Britain in September 1981, and the administration of deposed Guatemalan President Jorge Serrano (1991-1993) recognized it as a state. However, Guatemala has maintained its claim on the region for over a century and a half. The defense minister said the Army is prepared to support the Guatemalan families living in the "Chiquibul" national park, where they have built their homes. Enriquez dismissed the possibility of clashes with Belizean soldiers.
