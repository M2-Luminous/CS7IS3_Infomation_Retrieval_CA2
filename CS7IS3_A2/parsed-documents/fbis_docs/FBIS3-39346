It said clearly that a continuation of the IRA military campaign was an obstacle to progress in the peace process. The refusal by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to rush into a response to December's Downing Street declaration may smack of pedantry, procrastination and downright deviousness. But if the message that was repeatedly stated at the latest hearing of its "Peace Commission" has found its target, then the wait will have been worth it. The Sinn Fein Peace Commission consists of a series of public hearings in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, in which written and oral submissions on the peace process and the Downing Street declaration are being invited from the public. The first was held in Londonderry two weeks ago. The second was held this weekend in a Dublin hotel and two more are scheduled to be held in the republic before Sinn Fein's annual congress at the end of this month. Somewhat surprisingly, the submissions made in Dublin were neither acrimonious diatribes from opponents, nor eulogies of regurgitated republicanism from sympathisers. For the most part they were carefully argued presentations, coming from people as diverse as Jesuit priests, trade unonists, community associations, civil rights activists, peace groups hostile to Sinn Fein, writers and even musicians. One of the most cogent presentations came from Mr Michael Farrell, a solicitor and civil rights activist who is widely respected in republican and nationalist circles. He started by arguing that the joint declaration and the British government had failed to address nationalist fears adequately. But he went on to say that Sinn Fein had been "unconvincing" in trying to draw a distinction between the joint declaration's guarantee to respect the majority wishes in Northern Ireland -- described by Sinn Fein as the unionist "veto" -- and the Hume-Adams statements which the IRA supports, which speak of the need for unionist consent to any new political settlement. Moreover, continuation of the IRA campaign while clarification of the Downing Street declaration was being sought "is irresponsible and inconsistent with (the IRA's) own support for the Hume-Adams proposals," he said. "Whatever the situation in the past, the means are now in place to allow republicans to secure their objectives by political action. I do not believe the IRA's armed struggle could achieve anything more. Indeed I think it is counterproductive," he said. Most of the 25 submissions carried a similar message. The British government should be pressed to offer guarantees to protect the civil rights and Irish identity of the nationalist minority in Northern Ireland to balance the "fulsome guarantees offered to the unionists." But in spite of this weakness from a nationalist point of view, the Downing Street declaration had opened up new opportunities. Most importantly, a ceasefire should be declared. Mr Michael Nugent of the New Consensus movement, a long-time opponent of the IRA and Sinn Fein, called for the party to "test the bona fides" of the joint declaration and for the IRA to declare "a temporary and indefinite ceasefire." This, he said, "would open up an entirely new situation." The Sinn Fein convener of the Commission said: "We are taking the submissions very seriously indeed."
