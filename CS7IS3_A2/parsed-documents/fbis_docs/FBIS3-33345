He pointed out that this new secretariat will have enough financial resources at its disposal to implement aid programs for the community. Menem made these remarks on 14 February when installing Luis Prol [former under secretary general of the presidency] in office as the new social development secretary. Menem noted that Prol "does not face an easy challenge," but he asserted that he "will not be short of money." [passage omitted] It was unofficially reported that $300 million will be appropriated initially for the new secretariat and "cash in hand" from the other ministries will subsequently be earmarked to reach a total of $900 million. The secretariat will answer directly to the president. Menem ordered that funds from ministries' budget allotments classified as "surplus" be transferred to the new secretariat, which will then earmark them for social programs to be implemented in the forthcoming months. Prol reportedly will be in charge of managing the funds collected from the National Lottery -- some $100 million, which he will be able to use at his discretion. The new secretariat will be in charge of managing social programs undertaken by the government and "monitoring" their progress. Prol will take on the administration of some 60 social plans and programs the federal government had entrusted to five ministries, like intensive training programs (PIT) and the upgrading of squalid rural schools, among others.
