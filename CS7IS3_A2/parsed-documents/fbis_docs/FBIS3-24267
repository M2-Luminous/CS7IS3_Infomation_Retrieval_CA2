Shiryayev, deputy director of the Moscow Government's Department of Finances, by Igor Ostrovskiy; date and place not given: "A War of the Banks or a Victory of Market Thinking?"] [Text] During the past week, the mass information media have actively discussed the decision of Yu. Luzhkov, Moscow's mayor, to transfer the city's budget account to six proxy banks: Menatop, Most-Bank, National Credit, Capital, Tekhnobank, and Orbita. The commercial People's Bank managed the budget money up until now. Some commentators consider the city government's decision a victory for the lobbyists for a (group) of banks that have decided to divide the budget pie. Others see in it a manifestation of market relations in a delicate area like the implementation of the city's budget. V. Shiryayev, deputy director of the Moscow government's Department of Finance, talks about the motives of the Moscow government's financiers. [Shiryayev] We did not start thinking yesterday about the need to improve the settlement system with the city's on-budget organizations. The unpleasant situation with the Bank for Foreign Economic Relations, which delayed a multi-billion payment to the Department of Construction for four days in September, accelerated the decision. Three similar cases are on the accounts of the People's Bank. These were not premeditated delays but breakdowns in the electronic systems of the Central Bank's Inter-Regional Information Center. However, you will agree that this did not make it easier for those who did not receive their wages on time. Based on common sense, we understood that there is no and cannot be any modern bank capable of coping by itself with such a bulky and cumbersome thing as Moscow's budget. I will say for informational purposes that it exceeded three trillion rubles last year. We are not the only ones thinking about how to organize the management of local budgets. Russia's Ministry of Finance, for example, considers it necessary to establish a network of regional treasuries which would assume these functions. The idea of municipal banks is also being heard. Neither the first nor the second suggestion is acceptable to us. Where would we get the billions to support the treasuries? Where would we get the money to form the charter funding of a municipal bank? That is why we selected our own, a Moscow, variant -- to work with six proxy banks. We will receive results without expending a single budget kopek. [Ostrovskiy] Some specialists are saying that you will receive six bank monopolies instead of one and that nothing will really be changed? [Shiryayev] I want to call the specialist's attention to the document adopted by Moscow's government on 22 February. It is called "On Improving the Conditions for Bank Clearing Operations for Accounts Using the City of Moscow's Budget and the On-Budget and Off-Budget Accounts of Municipal Institutions and Organizations." Our vision for the interaction of the city's government with commercial banks is formulated there. We are talking about establishing a powerful information system and common standard documents. We want to achieve the "transparency" of accounts, that is, to obtain access to them at any second and receive complete information about what is being done with budget money. With the help of the proxy banks, we want to construct a settlement vertical line, that is, a system thanks to which each on-budget city organization would receive its upkeep on the precisely defined day. [Ostrovskiy] Are you confident that the banks selected by you will cope with this task? [Shiryayev] We hope so. The experience from our cooperation with Most-Bank, which manages the health accounts, strengthens our hopes. The vertical line, about which I spoke, has worked in two municipal okrugs. There, questions concerning financing do not arise among health care workers. The proxy banks, for example, have suggested adding interest to the daily remainder in the accounts. The money will probably not be very much but we are happy for any additional kopek because of the very acute budgetary shortage. [Ostrovskiy] The People's Bank did not provide you these services? [Shiryayev] At any rate, it did not propose them to us. You will agree that a bank should devise conditions beneficial to such a sizable customer as Moscow's government under market conditions. Concerning the monopoly of six proxy banks over the jurisdiction of the budget accounts, I assure you that the list is not closed. We are prepared to discuss suggestions, including with the People's Bank.
