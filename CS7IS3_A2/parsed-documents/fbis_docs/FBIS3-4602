It was learned that consultations over this matter will be discussed among related ministries soon to settle this matter. A government official said on 27 February: "Considering our relations with Russia and North Korea, the government has not accepted requests to defect from North Korean loggers who escape from logging camps in Siberia. However, since the number of those who want to defect is over 100, this is a matter that can no longer be ignored. A meeting of related ministries will be held and a final decision made on whether to allow the North Korean loggers to defect." This official also revealed: "The government has already held a meeting with the National Unification Board [NUB]; the Foreign, Home Affairs, and Justice Ministries; and the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] to deal with this matter. They agreed to examine the possibility of their defection." An official who participated in this meeting said: "Diplomatic problems with Russia and China could arise if the North Korean loggers are allowed to seek asylum and settle in the ROK. We have, however, generally agreed to allow them to seek asylum from a humanitarian perspective." In the news conference on the first anniversary of his inauguration on 25 February, President Kim Yong-sam said: "The issue of allowing the North Korean loggers in Siberia to defect is a matter that must be examined at the international law level. However, basically, we will deal with this matter from a humanitarian and human rights perspective." An official said: "Director-level officials of the NUB; the Foreign, Home Affairs, and Justice Ministries; and the NSP will hold a meeting to deal with this matter. Before allowing the North Korean loggers to defect, discussions will be held on requesting Russia to issue exit visas and on how to deal with the problems that will arise if they settle in the ROK." In addition to our embassy and consulate general in Russia, the North Korean loggers are seeking asylum at our embassies in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Recently, the Chinese Embassy there has also been flooded with defection requests. It is being pointed out that it is urgent to take measures regarding this matter.
