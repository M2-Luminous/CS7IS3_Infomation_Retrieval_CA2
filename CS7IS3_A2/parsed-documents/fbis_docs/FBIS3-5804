"The last train will definitely leave and if they don't want to join it...," Ranariddh told reporters at the Japan National Press Club. The Cambodian leader said the royal government, whose forces are reportedly readying an assault on the Khmer Rouge's main base at Pailin, "strongly supports" King Sihanouk's cease-fire appeal recently conveyed to both government and Khmer Rouge forces. "We agree to proclaim such a cease-fire," he said, with Co-Premier Hun Sen at his side. "The ball is now in the Khmer Rouge camp." The king, who is undergoing medical treatment for cancer in Beijing, called March 7 for an "immediate ceasefire on all fronts," as continued internecine warfare would spell "the death of Cambodia and our race." Ranariddh said the government wants to "leave the door open...to those moderate elements of the Khmer Rouge to join the national community." Khmer Rouge radio on March 7 reportedly broadcast that Khmer Rouge President Khieu Samphan had sent Sihanouk a letter on March 5 in which he said the guerrilla group would fully agree to a cease-fire on the basis of a proposal put forward by the king on November 21. In the proposal, which would require an amendment of the Cambodian Constitution, the monarch suggested the Khmer Rouge be given a role in the government if they turn over territories under their control and integrate their guerrilla army into the nation's unified armed forces. But Ranariddh said the Khmer Rouge has not responded to the government call for a ceasefire some months back. He said the Khmer Rouge no longer constitute a "military threat" to the government, but merely a source of insecurity. "I think that the Khmer Rouge can definitely not any more prevent Cambodia from going forward," he said. The guerrilla group, which ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1978, still controls an estimated 15 to 20 percent of the country's territory. Ranariddh, who was visiting Japan to attend an international conference on Cambodian reconstruction, said that providing an improved standard of living for the populace will deprive the Khmer Rouge of its support base. "To fight and to win over the Khmer Rouge in a lasting manner, we do not need only arms and weapons. We need more than that -- the development of the country," he said.
