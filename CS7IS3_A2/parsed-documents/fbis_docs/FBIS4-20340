Pushing aside a thick stack of dispatches and telegrams on his desk, General Li engaged enthusiastically in a cordial exchange with the correspondents. Correspondent: A new year has begun; spring has returned. Military training of troops throughout the armed forces in 1994 is about to begin in earnest. We would like to ask Deputy Chief of General Staff Li to discuss how troop training at the basic level can be improved. The General: First, I would like to take this opportunity to extend New Year's greetings via JIEFANGJUN SHENGHUO to comrades throughout the armed forces, particularly to the large numbers of officers and men at the basic level! I want to express warm congratulations and cordial solicitude to the advanced groups and advanced individuals who made a contribution to military training throughout the armed forces during 1993! In talking about military training during 1994, I would first like to review briefly military training throughout the armed forces during 1993. Overall, thanks to the correct leadership of Central Military Affairs Committee and the common efforts of officers and men throughout the armed forces, military training of troops throughout the armed forces scored some very big accomplishments in 1993. Leading cadres in the Central Military Affairs Committee are satisfied with this. These accomplishments were manifested primarily in the following: First, leaders at all levels paid very close attention to military training work. The central role of military training was rather well expressed, and the understanding of the rank and file of officers and men about the position and importance of military training in the new era was clarified and deepened. The sense of urgency became stronger. Second, was attention to changes in objective circumstances, to advances made in modern warfare, and to realities in the building of China's owned armed forces. Major efforts were made in moving ahead with the study of high science and technology, and both training reforms and the study of tactics was intensified, many results obtained therefrom. Third was extensive efforts to produce instructors and outstanding staff officers having the "three skills" and the "four abilities," and to train advanced units. Throughout the armed forces a number of advanced individuals and groups also came to the fore. Fourth was intensification and improvement of ideological and political training in view of the new circumstances and new problems under the socialist market economy. This stirred cadres and men to love the armed forces and cherish their weapons, and to train hard in skills for killing the enemy. Troop training throughout the armed forces was infused with vigor and vitality, a fine momentum of steady development taking place. Correspondents: What are the overall requirements and the guiding thought in military training throughout the armed forces in 1994? The General: We will strive to make 1994 a bumper harvest year for training reforms. We must realize clearly that the international situation remains very serious. The world is still not at peace. The possibility of limited wars and armed clashes cannot be ruled out. Our military training is still a long way from meeting the requirements of modern warfare. Specifically, the characteristics of warfare under high technology conditions that the Gulf War revealed pose many new issues for military training. Therefore, the overall requirements for military training throughout the armed forces are to respond to situations as they develop and meet needs in fighting a high technology war, to discharge the basic functions of good military forces, train soldiers well, be prepared to stand up to foreign aggression, and maintain the stable environment needed for the building of socialism. We must adopt a brand new posture, a spirit of reform, and a tenacious work style to complete military training tasks in 1994. We must increase, across the board, the ability of our armed forces to win limited wars employing modern technology, particularly high technology. As for the guiding ideology, I feel the following five points to be of greatest importance: First is to use as a basic guide Mao Zedong's military thought and Deng Xiaoping's thought about the building of armed forces in the new era. These are the summarization of the experiences of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries in the building of our armed forces during the past several decades. They serve as the theoretical basis for our good performance of all tasks, and they provide fundamental support for maintenance of a correct orientation in military training. Second is the need for thorough implementation of the instructions of Military Affairs Committee Chairman Jiang of "politically qualified, militarily superb, an outstanding work style, strict and impartial discipline, and strong support." This is the general requirement for our good performance of all tasks, and it is also the combat goal of all military training. Third is the need to focus on the winning of limited wars using modern technology, particularly high technology. This is an objective requirement for the development of military combat now and for some time to come, and it is also a basic point for military training. Fourth is the need to make reform the main line in training. This is a basic means for ensuring that military training continues to meet circumstances and steadily moves ahead. It is also a basic force for increasing the pertinence of training for outstanding fulfillment of military training tasks. Fifth is the need to apply training laws and regulations, strictly regulating training according to law. This provides important support for better building of regularized armed forces and improvement of training quality. Correspondent:Deputy Commander Li, you jut referred to the need for all military units to devote major efforts, in accordance with Military Affairs Committee leaders' instructions, to improvement of ability to win limited wars using modern technology, particularly high technology. Applied to the basic level, just what are the main things that must be done? The General: I believe that completion of the new year's military training mission will require that every unit, particularly the rank and file of officers and men at the basic level, show achievements in the following several regards: First is the need to reform training in a positive and innovative way so that military training will be better able to meet the needs of modern warfare. Despite the numerous achievements made during 10 years of training reforms, which have spurred the development of military training, we still must realize that military matters constantly change. Old problems are solved only to have new problems appear. This is a basic law of the development of things. This applies to military training as well, and it requires that advances must be sought in the course of steadily solving new problems. Current events show fundamental changes have taken place in the strategic world situation. Science and technology have developed rapidly, and have been widely applied to the military realm. The weaponry, military thinking, and combat style of military forces of all countries have developed substantially. Consequently, modern warfare has a high technology character, which poses new challenges for military training. Responding to circumstances and meeting challenges requires that officers and men throughout the armed forces focus on the new circumstances and new features of military combat under the new circumstances. They must rouse themselves to vigorous efforts, study assiduously, carry on traditions, dare to innovate, and link training to practice. They must boldly reform the content, the organization, the methods, the techniques, the management, and the support of training. They must find new tactics and new training methods that meet the needs of combat under the conditions of modern technology, particularly high technology. Second, cadres in general, and key cadres in particular, must strive to improve military quality. They must improve the organization of training and ability to lead troops in battle. Basic level military officers and squad leaders are the ones who organize and lead the military training of units at the platoon and squad levels. They are the ones who must carry out instructions from above. Troop training depends on their organization and implementation. The military caliber and the organizational abilities of basic level officers and squad leaders have a direct bearing on the quality of military training. Therefore, major efforts must be put into the improvement of military quality and organization and command skills. I hope that our basic officers and squad leaders will study diligently Mao Zedong military thought and Deng Xiaoping thought for the building of armed forces in the new era. This is the basic way to master the standpoint, the point of view, and the methods of the older generation of revolutionaries in building the armed forces and directing combat to establish a correct combat outlook and methodology. They must strive to study modern science and technology. This is a required course in the study of modern warfare and mastery of modern warfare. Diligent study of modern military thought, combat theory, and command techniques are important ingredients in improving the level of military training and increasing organizational and command skills. Efforts during this year must bring about new changes in cadres in general and key cadres in particular. Third is the need for diligent study of military skills to improve units' basic quality and live warfare capabilities. Superb military skills and specialized skills are the product of scientific training in combination with diligent training. Officers and men throughout the armed forces must employ scientific methods in the training of soldiers. They must put major efforts into activities for the rigorous training of crack troops. New soldiers entering the armed forces in 1994 must be given a good grounding in political ideology, military skills, work style discipline, and physical condition. Old soldiers must receive training that makes them jacks of many trades and masters of one, efforts made to improve their ability to carry out combat tasks. We must continue activities that produce "sharpshooter riflemen, sharpshooter gunners, and skilled technicians," and instructors and staff officer professionals having "four abilities" to provide superb training personnel. We must improve combat logistics training, live ammunition, live explosion, and live input training, and psychological training. Units having requisite conditions must train personnel to swim while carrying weapons and bayonet training. The difficulty and intensity of training must be increased. Bivouac training must be organized in a planned way, training given to provide skill in fighting, eating, living, and hiding while on the move. The nighttime training times and requirements that training plans provide must be followed to provide combat training using nighttime techniques. Combat exercises above the platoon level must be conducted continuously day and night in an effort to improve troops ability to fight under modern technology, particularly high technology, conditions. Fourth is the need to intensify coordinated training for constant improvement of the total warfare capabilities of all service arms and branches of service. Integrated training and combined warfare are important trends in modern warfare, and they are also important tasks in the intensification of reform. All service arms and branches, and all specialties must improve their sense of being part of a whole and their outlook on the overall situation. By training level by level, working in coordination level by level, and shaping a total combat capability level by level, they can first bring about a coordination of forces within their own branches of service and service arms, and then bring about a coordination of all branches of services in all service arms. They must lay a foundation around the combining of forces to learn skills based on tactics. Through sustained efforts, they can raise the combined combat capabilities of China's armed forces to a new level. At the end of the interview, Deputy Chief of General Staff Li asked the correspondents to tell all military commanders the following through JIEFANGJUN SHENGHUO: "The whole year's work depends on a good start in spring." He hopes that units throughout the armed forces will painstakingly plan and carry out training during the coming year in accordance with instructions from the Central Military Affairs Committee and the General General Staff, make full ideological preparations, organizational preparations, teaching preparations, and material preparations to do a good job of training, and ensure that units begin training on time, thereby creating good conditions for satisfactory fulfillment of military training tasks in 1994.
