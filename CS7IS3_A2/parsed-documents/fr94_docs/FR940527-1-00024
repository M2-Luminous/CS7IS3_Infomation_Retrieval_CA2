Synopsis of Notice of Inquiry 1. The Inquiry stesses that a primary goal of the 1992 Cable Act was to promote increased competition in the delivery of cable television services. Section 19(g) of the 1992 Cable Act directed the Commission to annually report to Congress on the status of competition in the market for the delivery of video programming. The first report must be submitted to Congress no later than October 1, 1994. The Commission believes that it must engage in an ongoing process of evaluating the status of competition to cable television in order to meet this annual reporting requirement. 2. The goals of this Inquiry are threefold: (1) To gather information sufficient to prepare a preliminary analysis for Congress of the current state of competition to cable provided by alternative distribution technologies; (2) to collect information on whether and the extent to which the conduct and practices of multichannel video programming vendors and distributors have changed; and (3) to identify the information required to enable the Commission to prepare more comprehensive analyses in our future reports and the appropriate means of obtaining it. 3. The Inquiry asks questions about the suitable means of analyzing the relevant programming and distribution markets. To assist the Commission in conducting its analysis, the Inquiry seeks comment on relevant economic methodologies, including structure-conduct-performance analyses and their complementary antitrust concepts, contestable market theory, and transaction cost economics. 4. The Inquiry also seeks to establish a reference point for future comparisons of the status of the multichannel video programming marketplace by updating the information contained in Appendix G of the Commission's 1990 Cable Report to Congress (``1990 Report'') with respect to horizontal ownership levels and vertical integration. 55 FR 32631 (8/10/90). 5. For this first annual report to Congress, the Commission will undertake a preliminary assessment of the status of competition at the local level in the video programming marketplace. The Inquiry notes that competition to cable television is currently provided to a limited extent by ``wireless cable'' systems, high-power and medium-power direct broadcast satellite (``DBS'') services, direct-to-home satellite services, satellite master antenna television (``SMATV'') systems, telephone technologies (such as video dialtone), cable overbuilds, and over-the-air television broadcasting. 6. The Inquiry notes that there have been various significant technological changes since the 1990 Report. For example, since local telephone exchange carriers are now seen as providing competition to cable, the Inquiry seeks comment on how the Commission should approach and address video dialtone in the context of its report. Also, the Inquiry addresses digital compression, as well as entry into the video programming distribution market by other providers such as electric or other utility companies, and the implications of their entry.
