Mr. Brazauskas' chief aid, Raimundas Rajeckas, claims the discharge is a considerable loss. Mr. Rajeckas, who is also the chief of the president's staff, said Mr. Brazauskas did not consult him before making the decision. Mr. Sadeckas himself declined to comment on the president's move. He only remarked he felt responsible for the events and processes going on in Lithuania. He also asked reporters not to interpret his dismissal as a sensational news. Mr. Sadeckas held various posts at the Interior Ministry until last year. He was relieved of his duties on allegedly direct instructions of the then Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius.
