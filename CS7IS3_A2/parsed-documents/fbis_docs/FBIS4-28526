Security Council resolution calling for sanctions against North Korea can be adopted next week or thereafter. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will discuss the sanctions issue during meetings with U.S. Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff and Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa. Tarnoff and Kakizawa will come to Seoul on Friday and Saturday, respectively. The government's decision was made Friday morning at a meeting to coordinate national unification and security policy held at the South-North dialogue secretariat in Samchong-dong. The meeting was presided over by Vice Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku, who is national unification minister. After the meeting, Yi said through his spokesman Kim Hyong-ki that the government hoped to persuade the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution on sanctions against Pyongyang as soon as possible through consultations with related countries, including the United States. The spokesman said sanctions should be adopted soon as the cooling period for spent fuel rods taken recently from North Korea's 5-megawatt reactor is only three months, disclosing that "the government position is to have the council adopt sanctions next week at the earliest." Yi emphasized the sanctions' ultimate goal is securing the transparency of North Korea's nuclear program, adding the government plans to leave the dialogue channel open at every stage in the course of imposing sanctions against Pyongyang. He said that "dialogue with North Korea is only possible when it is prepared to show sincerity so the international suspicion over its nuclear adventure is eliminated completely," reaffirming that sanctions are inevitable unless Pyongyang changes its attitude. As to the "sincere measures" by North Korea, the spokesman cited as an example the North's acceptance of special inspections of its undeclared nuclear sites and the opening of records on its nuclear reactor.
