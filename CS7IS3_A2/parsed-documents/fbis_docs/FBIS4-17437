The meeting was mostly held behind closed doors. The talks were focused on the Armenian-Azeri conflict over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave and ways for its settlement. According to the Azeri leader, efforts by international organizations, including the United Nations, the CSCE and its Minsk group, failed to produce any positive results. Seeking to end the protracted warfare by any means, the republic accepted Russia's mediatory initiatives. However, all attempts to solve the thorny problem have been in vain so far. The only obvious thing is that the Armenian side is forcing Azerbaijan to agree to its terms, which do not meet the republic's national interests, Aliyev emphasised. The Turkish foreign minister believes that "the world community should at last understand clearly that Azerbaijan is forced to wage war in order to defend its territories." Cetin dismissed the principle of equal responsibility of both conflicting sides for the continued fighting, since "aggression is aimed against Azerbaijan." He pledged that "Turkey would uphold this position at all international forums." The Turkish foreign minister told a news conference after the talks that "Armenia should meet the demands of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and to withdraw its troops from occupied Azeri lands immediately and unconditionally." In case it continues ignoring these demands, the world community should impose sanctions upon the republic, Cetin stressed. As for Turkey, it will not lift the embargo for supplies of foodstuffs and medicines to Armenia until the republic halts the aggression against Azerbaijan. According to the Turkish foreign minister, the current deadlock in the peace process can be broken by convening a session of the Minsk conference. However, this is possible only in case of liberation of Azeri territories. Therefore, Russia, the United States and other Minsk group countries should step up their efforts to create conditions for the session to be convened. Speaking about deployment of peacekeeping troops in the conflict zone, Cetin emphasised that "Turkey strongly believes these can be only international forces, not troops of any definite country." The Turkish foreign minister assessed his short-term visit to the Azeri capital Baku as "very fruitful." According to his Azeri counterpart Hasan Hasanov, this visit testified to Azerbaijan's stable and consistent relations with Turkey, to which the republic gives top priority in its foreign policy.
