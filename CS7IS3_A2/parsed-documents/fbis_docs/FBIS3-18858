The Esko Aho-led Center Party lost the local elections of 1992 and suffered a bitter defeat in the presidential elections. According to a recent poll, the Center Party is supported by only 17.5 percent of the electorate, which is the same level as during the Johannes Virolainen era. The Center Party is also being ravaged by tension within, above all by the presidential candidacies of Keijo Korhonen and Eeva Kuuskoski. Center Party leadership is fully aware of the panic sweeping their party. How could it not be, for the dirty laundry from the presidential election is now starting to be sorted out in various places. Name lists are being collected in Kainuu for the support of Keijo Korhonen, while at the same time, some people are calling for the dismissal of both Korhonen and Kuuskoski from the party. Prime Minister Aho has himself called together strategy meetings of those close to him, at which the focus has been on how to avert a disaster in the parliamentary elections. In 1991 the Center Party achieved an almost dreamlike victory: almost 25 percent of all votes and 15 new seats in the Eduskunta. If its support levels do not start to rise from the present levels, all of these new Eduskunta seats will be lost. The fear of electoral defeat is not unfounded. Having the responsibility of governing during a recession and the monetaristic economic policy are devastating the party. This was apparent already in the local elections when Center Party support dropped over 7 percent from the parliamentary election level. This development was historical, for the number of votes gathered by the party had increased only when compared to the 1950 local elections. Center Party support in opinion polls is now being upheld only by the very core element of the party. Aho has not publicly shown any signs of concern, at least not for the time being. He believes that the Center Party can prevail when it will show that the country's finances were put in order under its leadership. Aho, in fact, awaited the emergence of the first fruits already in the presidential elections and was disappointed when Elizabeth Rehn was not elected president after all. The sentiment was genuine, for he, along with all of the governing parties, clearly supported Rehn so as to shore up support for their governing position. Their support was even more definite than it had been for their own parties' candidates in the first round of the presidential election. The presidential election result was a blow to Aho also for the reason that Martti Ahtisaari of the SDP (Social Democratic Party) was the winner. If the SDP gains a historical victory in next year's election, as the opinion polls seem to indicate, the Center Party will be at the mercy of its old nemesis. The SDP will then determine who they will accept into the cabinet. The very idea of it is like a horrible nightmare in Center Party eyes. Aho need not fear for the sake of his own position yet at the party's convention next summer, even though cabinet member Seppo Kaariainen is giving him Vayrynen-like threatening warnings. Kaariainen's speech about a "rye bread policy" is anything but according to Aho policy. The warnings from this team of two are, however, merely the establishment of a stand at this point, and not an open challenge. Gaining a tolerable defeat in the elections is important for Aho. Otherwise his position will become tenuous in the face of attacks by Vayrynen and Kaariainen. But how can Aho get an honorable result in the parliamentary elections when economic growth will not yet cut into unemployment, and when the taxing of wages remains extremely tight? A favorable balance of trade will not win elections. About the only way available to Aho is to spend a lot of money in the areas where the Center Party has support. As shocking as it may sound, the distribution of money is already happening at full speed. It commenced last week under the prime minister's stewardship in the first budget amendment.
