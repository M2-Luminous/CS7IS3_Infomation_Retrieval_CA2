When Newton demonstrated his experiment to the English queen, she was immediately stunned: Right before her eyes the diamond grew red hot and disappeared. But then at once she ordered that the destructive experiments be stopped. It would seem that today the same sort of destructive experiment is being carried out with one of the largest defense enterprises of the fatherland, the "Almaz" [diamond] plant. No one would deny that military expenditures and the defense industry of Russia must be optimized. Unfortunately, we have always lacked a sense of moderation, especially during the "Cold War." But in the years of perestroyka and the development of democracy, on the contrary we began to "uproot" the defense sector ruthlessly, as we did with the vintners in the course of the anti-alcoholism campaign. Today, conversion here is a drug for populists in a political struggle, rather than a state program to optimize the restructuring of the defense industry with maximal advantage to Russia. It is too bad that to this point only those who decide nothing understand this. And irreversible processes are taking place in this time, doing enormous harm to the country. Indisputably each person who works at "Almaz" is a patriot of this enterprise. But this does not at all mean that only corporate interests impel us. "Almaz," which develops air defense systems, is known throughout the world and is the strongest competitor of an American company of similar profile, Raytheon. For decades there was an unpublicized competition between "Almaz" and "Raytheon," and in recent years a publicized one, in developing air defense systems. "Almaz" has never lagged behind its rival, and to a great has extent surpassed it, as it does today. On 1 May 1960, an American U-2 spy plane piloted by the pilot Powers was shot down by an air defense system which was developed by "Almaz." The missile hit the target at an altitude of more than 20 km, a complete surprise to the American military, who were confident of the impunity of these flights. Just this single successful launch then plunged the air forces of the world into extremely high spending to achieve safe flight altitudes close to the ground. Then, when the Americans deemed themselves invulnerable at extremely low altitudes, a new SAM system from "Almaz" dispelled that confidence. But before that there were long years of other competitions in the air, including combat ones, as in the skies of Vietnam. The then ultra-modern American Phantoms, B-52s and other planes felt themselves practically untouchable, covering the earth of North Vietnam with "carpet" bombing of unheard-of density. The very first day our SAM systems were used there, the American Air Force suffered enormous losses. In the skies of Vietnam a total of several thousand American planes were shot down, and a large portion of them fell to missiles of our system. Then the world understood that SAM systems were one of the necessary components of defense, safeguarding the security of the state. They began to be actively purchased, basically from us and from the U.S. The profit amounted to many billions of dollars. And even without detailed calculations, one can say that the "Almaz" paid back the public funds which were invested in the creation of new systems. Incidentally, people remember that time. The money earned by us in the international market was returned to the country in the form of bananas, oranges, lemons, different foods, and scarce consumer items, accessible to all because of their low prices. And no one could chide "Almaz" that these monies were earned from weapons which brought death and destruction. On the contrary, SAM systems are extremely defensive weapons. These days SAM systems have become a generally accepted means of defense and have begun to be shown at international exhibitions. It has turned out that modern all-altitude multipurpose SAM systems with a long range of action can be developed only by two countries in the world, Russia and the U.S. At international exhibitions at Le Bourget (France), Abu-Dhabi (United Arab Emirates), the Zhukovskiy Aerospace Show (Russia) and others, specialists were able to vividly compare the characteristics of the American Patriot air defense system and our S-300 PMU1 and see that the Russian system surpasses the American both in range of action and in minimal altitude of downed targets. It must be said that here in Russia, too, specialists understand that the S-300 PMU1 system is quite competitive, and that in the current difficult economic situation enormous amounts of money can be earned with it. But what are they doing with "Almaz" today in Russia? Perhaps this is a somewhat subjective opinion, but the impression is that they simply want to destroy us. But you know, "Almaz" is not the property of political figures, but a treasure of the people. The average pay at "Almaz" today is 30 to 40 thousand rubles. There are world-class specialists: Chiefs of scientific departments and sectors, doctors and candidates of science, and leading specialists receive 50 to 70 thousand rubles a month, while experienced engineers with years of work behind them, just as young specialists, receive 20 to 30 thousand rubles. One young cooperative owner, earning a half-million a month serving Russian millionaires, burst out laughing when he heard the pay at "Almaz," and then "wisely" noted that probably we just had a collection of loafers, if that was all they could earn. It would be better if they fixed imported audio and video equipment. . . The worst thing is that the young man did not think this up himself, but was only repeating what some ideologues of market relations are saying, believing the market to be a goal in itself. For now the approach of the state to the fatherland's enterprises, which determines the level of science and technology in the country and the world is surprisingly uniformly destructive: The hammer of high taxes against the forge of miserable wages will leave not a single industrial giant standing. Of course, our state has long been in agony, choking from the shortages of resources. But then, no one besides our leaders is guilty of this. Well fine, one can still understand these difficulties. But when the state itself slows export deliveries of goods permitted for sale, and from what is sold, it gives almost nothing to the enterprises, the impression is that temporary people are making some temporary deals. "Almaz" did not escape this fate either. It received nothing from recent deliveries from a foreign contract, and even worse, further export deliveries are starting to be slowed under various pretexts. But you know, this amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars, which Russia urgently needs. "Almaz" itself is being enveloped quite energetically in a web of commercial and banking structures, which judging by their behavior are not at all concerned with developing the science, technology and industry of the fatherland, but are parasitically interested, for example, in acquiring a prestigious building which 20 minutes' drive from the center of Moscow. Thus "Almaz" finds itself in a trap. The government, using high taxes and pay restrictions, is driving the still-powerful enterprise into the nets of indebtedness set up by commercial structures. And what of the people at "Almaz"? Yes, our unique specialists, by breaking into consumer goods and commercia activity, can more than feed themselves. And some of them are doing this. But overall the collective continues to work on the main programs and to develop new and extremely complex systems, because "Raytheon" is making such systems, because the world will never give them up. Of course we understand that this drama is only for those who worry about the state. You see, if matters go on like this, then in a few years the country will begin to pay hard currency for worse systems (no one will ever sell better ones that those of Russia) from foreign companies. And then many bureaucrats and merchants as middlemen will get those profits which they are promised by the destruction of "Almaz." And since nothing comes from nowhere or goes anywhere, the loser will be our people, who have already expended a lot of manpower and resources on creating high-tech enterprises of the "Almaz" type and, if they are destroyed, will be forced to correct the state's mistakes out of their own pockets. How can we not recall the English queen here?
