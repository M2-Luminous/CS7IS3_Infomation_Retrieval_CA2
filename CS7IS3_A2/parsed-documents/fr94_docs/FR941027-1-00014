FR941027-1-00014 FR941027-1-00004 SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 13 CFR Parts 121 and 124 Small Business Size Regulations; Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Assistance AGENCY: Small Business Administration. ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The Small Business Administration (SBA) extends the comment period on its proposed rule that would amend both eligibility requirements for and contractual assistance provisions within the SBA's section 8(a) program, and that was published in the Federal Register on August 30, 1994, 59 FR 44652. DATES: The date for the receipt of comments pertaining to the proposed rule published at 59 FR 44652 has been extended from September 29, 1994. Comments must now be submitted on or before November 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to Herbert L. Mitchell, Associate Administrator, Office of Minority Enterprise Development, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street, SW, Washington, DC 20416. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Office of Minority Enterprise Development, (202) 205&hyph;6410. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 30, 1994, SBA published a proposed rule to, among other things, (1) make several clarifications of the eligibility requirements for admission to SBA's 8(a) program, the need for which has been identified by SBA through the practical experience gained in operating the program and in defending the agency's actions in 8(a) eligibility appeals brought before SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals, (2) authorize participation by business concerns owned by Community Development Corporations in the 8(a) program in accord with 42 U.S.C. 9815, and (3) make several changes to the 8(a) contractual assistance requirements, including eliminating 8(a) support levels and the concepts of local buy and national buy 8(a) requirements. The rule required that comments concerning its proposed provisions be submitted to SBA for review on or before November 28, 1994. SBA has received a number of comments stating that the 30-day comment period was insufficient to properly address all of the proposal, and requesting that the comment period be extended. In light of the fact that the end of the comment period coincided with the end of the Federal fiscal year, a very busy time for any business concerns contracting with the Federal Government, SBA concurs that an extension of the comment period for this rule is appropriate. Thus, SBA is extending the comment period for an additional 30 days from the date this notice is published in the Federal Register . Dated: October 19, 1994. Philip Lader, Administrator.
