Some Federation Council Members Advocate Territorial Factions; Others, Party Factions"] [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov, elected a Federation Council deputy, termed as utopian the idea of dividing the upper chamber into regional factions. "No strong politician who really represents the interests of local elites -- like myself, for example -- will have a part in any such thing," Mr. Nemtsov assured your SEGODNYA correspondent. According to him, regional leaders, who have but once come up against the problem of sharing out budget funds, would "immediately see the extreme danger and ruinous nature of such a road for the whole of Russia." "We on the contrary are interested in creating conditions where representatives of the regional elites could more easily come to terms and establish links between the regions rather than focus on dividing the pie," he said. Besides, Eduard Rossel's promise to bring together everyone regardless of their "stripes" according to regional interests, in Boris Nemtsov's phrase, "is almost the same as if I would want to make Russian National Unity activists my deputies, or to put representatives of the Communist Party in `top' positions." For the successful work of the Federation Council it would be much more interesting, according to him, to see which of the senators is "red" and which is "white," and "maybe to give that an organizational form." Aleksandr Belyayev, chairman of the disbanded St. Petersburg City Soviet, who has also become a member of the upper chamber, believes that most probably there will be no official division in the Federation Council either on a territorial or party basis. He is convinced that "the entire previous behind-the-scenes horse-trading is not going to played out at all on the Federation Council scene." Interregional associations are being formed even if they are not given official status, and the interests of various regional elites will be composed either outside parliament or in its lobby. Aleksandr Belyayev thinks that understandings reached in such a "natural way" will only be taken note of in the Federation Council proper.
