Kozyrev told the INTERFAX news agency that the Serb attacks on Gorazde "go far beyond reasonable military necessity" and "the international community has the right to end the criminal actions." However, Kozyrev said, "massive NATO air strikes, I think, will lead to an escalation of the conflict." NATO issue an ultimatum in Brussels earlier today, ordering the Serbs to stop offensives against the Muslim enclave of Gorazde and pull their forces three kilometers away from the center of the town by 02:01 local time on Sunday (0001 GMT), or they will face NATO air raids. The NATO also demanded the Serbs to grand access to the United Nations peacekeepers and medical teams to the embattled city of Goradze. Russia had stressed time and again a diplomatic solution to the Bosnian conflicts, complaining that NATO's previous air strikes on the Serbs undermined the peace efforts.
