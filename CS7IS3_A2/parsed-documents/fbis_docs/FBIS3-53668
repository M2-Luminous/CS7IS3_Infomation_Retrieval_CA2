Al-Hudaybi, who appeared moved by the sudden Jordanian decision, told ROSE AL-YUSUF: I was going to visit my physician daughter, who is married to a physician, lives in Jordan, and has Jordanian citizenship. I spoke to her on the telephone and told her: I am coming to visit you. I have been visiting her for the past 20 years. What happened! [Al-Ibrashi] Was there a political, party, Muslim Brotherhood, or other conference or meeting? [Al-Hudaybi] Not at all. This was a family visit unrelated to any other activity. [Al-Ibrashi] Did the Jordanian authorities give you any explanation for preventing you from entering the country? [Al-Hudaybi] I asked them and they told me that you are banned from entering the country. I asked them why. They said: We are security people and carry out instructions. I tried to see the security director. I tried to talk to anyone. But they prevented me and did not want to listen. My daughter was waiting for me at the airport. I tried to see her, but they also prevented me. Al-Hudaybi added: I have not recently said anything at all against Jordan. On the contrary. I have praised the democratic experiment in Jordan in the wake of the recent elections. The Muslim Brotherhood there is recognized and licensed. The party won 18 seats in the recent elections. I was only going to see my daughter. Meanwhile, Jordanian diplomatic sources have told ROSE AL-YUSUF that the Jordanian authorities have adopted new measures regarding the entry of the leaders and members of fundamentalist groups. They said that they have no knowledge or explanation why al-Hudaybi was banned from entering Jordan and whether this ban is part of these measures or there are other reasons. Jordan has recently arrested on arrival 15 Jordanians and Palestinians returning from Afghanistan. Before that, it arrested others and released some of them following the intervention of the Muslim Brotherhood there. Some are still being detained.
