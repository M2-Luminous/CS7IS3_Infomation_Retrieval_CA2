The document, in particular, points out that yet another attempt was made to involve the law enforcement bodies in political battles, Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry in particular. All this may lead to negative consequences. On the strength of the law of Ukraine on militia, the report also says, the militia of our state is a single system of bodies that are part of the structure of the Internal Affairs Ministry of Ukraine and whose activities are subordinated to it. The leading personnel of the interior bodies, excluding rayon and city departments, are appointed by the internal affairs minister of Ukraine personally. Therefore, underlines the Main Public Relations Center, such a personnel reshuffling has exclusively political essence, it does not promote consolidation of lawfulness in the state and leads to confrontation in society. The above decrees by the president of the Crimea Republic on changes in the leadership of the Internal Affairs Ministry of the autonomous republic must be cancelled as such that do not comply with the legislation currently in force in Ukraine.
