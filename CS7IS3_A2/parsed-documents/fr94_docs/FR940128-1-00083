FR940128-1-00083 FR940128-1-00006 Should smoked fish products be required to bear refrigeration statements on their labels, the maximum possible cost to this industry segment would be estimated to be $2.5 million for a label redesign for all products. A label redesign would be likely only in the case of extensive refrigeration instructions. If a simple statement such as ``keep refrigerated'' were to be required, then the cost to the smoked fish industry would be approximately $168,000 because approximately 75 percent of the products currently bear such statements. These estimates are considerably higher than the estimates from data submitted to FDA from seafood plants as discussed above. These differences may be attributable to several factors. For example, the MSSP-based estimates also include estimated costs of compliance by processors with pre-existing sanitation requirements in part 110 and costs of complying with guidelines that are appended to these proposed regulations. Although these costs are not inherent to the operation of a HACCP system, they represent one-third of the total MSSP-based estimates. As indicated earlier in this document, compliance with CGMP's for sanitation has been a continuing problem across the industry. For this reason, FDA is proposing specific sanitation requirements in subpart A of part 123. Moreover, the estimate of costs associated with complying with guidelines in the appendices may be overstated because, in actuality, FDA may find industry practices other than those stated in the guidelines to be acceptable. The guidelines are intended to provide the industry with information on how it could implement HACCP, not how it must do so. Costs to importers and to foreign processors that ship to the United States were also estimated. In the absence of reliable data for estimating costs to foreign processors, FDA estimated the number of plants that export seafood to the United States and based their costs of implementing HACCP on MSSP- generated data on the costs to U.S. plants. It is important to recognize that many of the United States major seafood trading partners are using, or have opted for, HACCP programs. For example, the EC will soon require HACCP or an equivalent system from over 100 nations that export to it. Consequently, with the current trend toward HACCP worldwide, the costs to many foreign processors of implementing HACCP may be incurred regardless of whether FDA issued these proposed regulations. Moreover, in the near future, U.S. importers subject to this proposed rule should have little difficulty finding products produced under HACCP. FDA specifically invites comment on the estimated costs of the proposed regulations to importers and foreign processors, e.g., whether they are high due to the worldwide move toward HACCP or whether they are low due to other factors that have not been considered, and the potential effect on U.S. consumers of requiring that imports be produced under HACCP systems. The PRIA presumes that most of the cost of compliance of the proposed regulations will be passed on to consumers. Estimating the magnitude of these price increases is difficult. U.S. consumers spent about $16.5 billion on domestically produced seafood in 1991 (Ref. 42). If the domestic industry passed on all of the estimated annual costs to consumers, prices for domestically produced seafood would increase by less than 1 percent in the first year and less than one-half of 1 percent in succeeding years. Price changes of such magnitude are unlikely to have a major impact on general seafood purchases. However, some regional price increases may considerably exceed this. In addition, this estimation of change in price does not address potential concentration effects. It is worth noting that the contractor that performed the MSSP study estimated a range of cost increases from negligible to 1.3 percent, depending on the type of product. The effect on prices of imported products is impossible to estimate. While the PRIA uses MSSP data and a number of assumptions to estimate possible costs to foreign processors of complying with the proposed regulations, those costs will be spread among the consumers from all nations to which these processors export. FDA is unable to estimate what percentage of these costs would be passed on to U.S. consumers. On the other side of the ledger, the MSSP-based estimates were not able to include costs associated with some features of the proposed rules because data were lacking. An inventory of these features is provided in the PRIA, and FDA invites comment on possible costs associated with them. They include prevention of cross contamination by the separation of food contact surfaces, storage at 40 â—‹F of cooked, ready-to-eat products and products that are made in whole or in part of scombroid toxin forming species, and the costs of following the approach presented in the guidelines at Appendix B for scombroid toxin forming species.
