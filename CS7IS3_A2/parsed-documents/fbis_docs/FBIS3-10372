He is visiting from the DPRK. Mr. Kim Pyong-sik introduced himself as the chairman of the North Korean Social Democratic Party's Central Committee, although this party in reality depends on the communist Korean Workers' Party supporting Kim Il-song's dictatorship. In fact, the strange visitor has also been one of the DPRK vice presidents since his election to this post on 11 December 1993. During his visit to Lima, Kim Pyong-sik, who arrived with a four-man entourage, met various personalities. His mission in Lima is not exactly known, but it has been leaked that he would afterwards tour Latin America, visiting Ecuador, Uruguay, and eventually Paraguay and Venezuela.
