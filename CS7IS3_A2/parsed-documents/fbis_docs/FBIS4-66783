The truth, however, is that the Indian officials, who were given a dose of the Raphel rhetoric in private, too, have realized that there is no dilution of her views on the Indo-U.S. relations. There are those who say that if Miss Raphel's statements are examples of American muscle-flexing, India can hardly complain that "pressure" was a new factor. While the Bush Administration and some Republic Senators did condemn Pakistan's support to terrorists there was no let-up on the pressure from the Bush Administration on other pending issues whether it was signing of the NPT or the rocket deal with Russia. The difference now is the accent on human rights which is being described as a personal goal for the U.S. President, Mr Bill Clinton, and it is applicable for all countries. China has been able to withstand pressures of losing out on the most-favoured nation status. This is more because of pressures from the U.S. business community which is worried about a losing market. India has not attracted that kind of investment so far. The Americans have a reason to believe that pressure has worked on Pakistan. Internally it is being admitted in Pakistan that whatever they may say in public both the Nawaz Sharif and the Benazir Governments are prepared to give guarantees of "capping" the nuclear programme. That America expects India to follow suit is obvious. Mandarins in South Block, at least those having a wrong notion of how to keep the "flag flying," have tended to react more to statements in public but have on the other hand kept quiet during private discussions where the "squeeze" is put on. The growing impression in the United States, according to observers, is that India is keeping its domestic compulsions in mind a factor that has been overstressed in talks with the U.S. officials. At the same time the United States is gaining the impression that the "pressure" is working. An evidence of it is India agreeing to bilateral talks with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue. While one official cannot make or mar the relationship between the two countries Miss Raphel is being singled out for special mention because she is the only U.S. official publicly stating the U.S. policy as it stands today and being well qualified to do so. But even Miss Raphel and others concerned with the South Asian affairs would have been impressed by the way India was making sure that Miss Raphel was not "slighted" during her brief tour. If Miss Raphel has left with the impression that the Rao Government was more than eager to extend a warm welcome there is a good reason for it. It was the Prime Minister's Office which was arranging various meetings. Meetings with senior officials in charge of anti-insurgency operations in Kashmir and Punjab; with Mr S.B. Chavan and Mr Rajesh Pilot, besides the Foreign Secretary and the Joint Secretary were those that were officially arranged. The suggestion that Washington was not averse to a Rao visit appears to have been timed during Miss Raphel's visit. One view is that the timing of the offer is the State Department's way of showing that Miss Raphel does have the clout despite her "junior" status. The implied message: She is not a loose cannon. Several weeks ago after an exchange of rhetoric, it was being speculated that Mr Narasimha Rao would not be able to visit the United States. Now his visit is a virtual certainty although it is not expected to initiate any change in the U.S. position. In fact the invitation itself suggests further discussions on the NPT.
