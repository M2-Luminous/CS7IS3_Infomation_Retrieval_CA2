The present government has laid out a three-stage and three-principle policy represented by the following steps toward reunification: reconciliation and cooperation, alliance, and reunification. Are these two conceptions different? [Yi Hong-ku] The Korean common race proposal and the reunification method based on the three-stage and three-principle policy are same in nature. President Kim Yong-sam's mentioned the phrase "within the frame of the Korean common race" while announcing the reunification method in July 1993. As hinted by this, the government's reunification policy includes three separate steps to achieve the Korean common race. In other words, the three steps are virtually included in the Korean common race and the government's reunification policy has made this clearer. Accordingly, in spite of four years before I returned to the office of the unification minister, I can invariably push ahead with the reunification policy since it has not been changed at all. [Pak] It sounds as if there has been no big change in the government's policy on North Korea. The new government attempted a fresh approach toward relations with North Korea. The opinions, however, have been divided into conservative and radical views as the nuclear issue was aggravated. How will you, as the minister of the National Unification Board, overcome this problem? [Yi] There are two important things to think about. First, there were such big incidents as the collapse of the Soviet Union and the unification of Germany. They were not usual incidents. They mean the end of the age of ideology and doctrine that lasted for 100 years. As a result, we came to have the imminent task of solving the problem of the Korean peninsula, an outsider from the post-cold war stream of the world history, in a peaceful way, not by war. In light of this point, we must, as soon as possible, free ourselves from the old dogmatic ideas not only in relations with North Korea, but also with the entire society. Unfortunately, however, some of our younger generation, who are expected to be the most advanced, are still obsessed by the dogmatic ideology that prevailed in the early 20th century. However, the lack of any definite plan in freeing oneself from dogmatism may result in a vacuum. Accordingly, civilian-led education on details of reunification is keenly required for creating a ripened civic sense in preparation for reunification. Right after the World War II, the German Government also set aside a large budget for the people's political education programs to raise the people as mature civilians. [Pak] Some people feel the government needs to adjust its North Korean policy after reevaluating the policy of linking South- North economic cooperation with the nuclear issue as no progress is being made in South-North relations because of the nuclear issue. [Yi] I believe that the government's position is very reasonable. The problem is an order of priority. The government believes that there is nothing more important than the North Korean nuclear issue in present North-South relations. In other words, the government gives the highest priority to resolving the nuclear issue in its North Korean policy. This is because the nuclear issue is a matter of the nation's existence, not a matter of ideology. I do not mean, however, that the government will dogmatically interpret the meaning of the "settlement of the nuclear issue." It is not the position of the government to indefinitely delay the settlement of many North-South issues, including North- South economic cooperation, until the complete settlement of the nuclear issue. Nuclear transparency is a key factor in resolving the nuclear issue. We can say that in conformity with developments, the government has formulated a stage-by-stage plan to deal with North Korea, including North-South economic cooperation, on the assumption that the way to resolving the nuclear issue can be discovered in several months, instead of several years. [Pak] It must be sure that Pyongyang's goal is to improve relations with Washington. People say that many problems -- including the nuclear issue and the easing of tensions on the Korean peninsula -- can be simultaneously solved only if the United States improves relations with North Korea. What do you say about this? [Yi] The government has already formulated its policy based on such a direction. A few weeks ago, our government even withdrew its policy on the exchange of North-South special envoys. Because there has been no progress in North Korean-U.S. talks as a result of our government's call for the exchange of special envoys, we could not but make a bold decision to withdraw it. This was not even thinkable in the past. Without the people's cooperation and their consciousness as citizens, this cannot be possible, either. However, the problem is North Korea's attitude. The U.S. Government is well aware that North Korea wants to establish diplomatic relations, as well as to gain economic support from the United States. However, Pyongyang has not yet decided on its position on abandoning its nuclear development -- which it uses as a card for establishing diplomatic relations with the United States. Finally, we can say the settlement of all the problems -- North- South dialogue, U.S.-North Korean relations, and North Korean- International Atomic Energy Agency relations -- depends on North Korea's choice. The government's basic North Korean policy should be formulated in a direction in which it can be profitable to North Korea in the trends of world history. [Pak] Some people think eliminating North Korea's distrust of the external world could be one of the means to change North Korea. [Yi] North Korea's adjustment to the post-cold war era does not mean it has to become like South Korea. It will be rather closer to China. If North Korea wants to readjust using the Chinese model, we will directly and indirectly help make the changes in a way that will not disgrace or burden North Korea. [Pak] Regarding the repatriation of Yi In-mo after much dispute, although a survey by the National Unification Research Institute shows 79.2 percent of the people support the decision, some people think it was a mistake as North-South relations fell into a stalemate. North Korea has recently demanded the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan. What is the government's position on this? [Yi] The issue of unconverted long-term prisoners should be considered from various angles, not separately. Our people repatriated Yi In-mo on a humanitarian basis. However, North Korea took him to every corner of the country and held people's rallies. That is not a humanitarian but political act under the excuse of humanity. Furthermore, we also have 400 people who have been abducted to the North, including the 12 crew of the fishing boat Tongjin-ho, which was kidnapped in 1987. As mentioned a few days ago by Kang Yong-hun, president of the South Korean Red Cross, our position is to make a package discussion covering all the pending humanitarian issues of the North and the South irrespective of the format, be it Red Cross talks or other talks. [Pak] North Korea recently proposed to the United States to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement. How would the government react to this? [Yi] It contains a more strategical meaning aimed at blurring the focus of the nuclear issue. We look forward to responsible acts by North Korea. We will adhere to the policy of resolving this issue through direct negotiations between the parties concerned in the South and the North. Article 5 of the basic agreement between the South and the North stipulates that mutual efforts will be exerted to transform the armistice situation to a peaceful one, and that the current Armistice Agreement will be abided by until the advent of a peaceful situation. [Pak] I understand that the government's decision to accept North Korean loggers is noteworthy because it was based on a policy to separately handle the regime and the people. Would the principle of differentiating the North Korean people from the regime be applied continuously in the future? [Yi] Basically, North-South issues have a contradicting dual composition of a confrontation system and the efforts to resolve the confrontation through dialogue. The loggers issue is an example. Therefore, the government plans to prudently solve the problem taking both the humanitarian aspect and North-South relations into consideration. It is true that this may sound like a contradiction. I think politics is virtually to efficiently and reasonably lead such a contradictory situation.
