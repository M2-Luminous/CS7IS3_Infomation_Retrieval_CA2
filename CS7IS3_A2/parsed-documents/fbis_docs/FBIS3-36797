This was stated yesterday by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel during a dinner in honor of Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev, who is paying an official visit to Ankara. The Turkish leader noted that sooner or later, the Armenians would be forced to leave occupied Azerbaijani territory. Turkey and Azerbaijan, Demirel said, have decided to strengthen bilateral cooperation not just at the interstate level, but also in international organizations like the United Nations, the CSCE, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and regional economic groupings. The Turkish Republic will continue to assist Azerbaijan and support its "integration" with the international community. The talks in Ankara, the Turkish president stressed, have been held in a candid atmosphere. "There are no problems in our bilateral relations," he said. In his turn, Aliyev said that he was "determined" to preserve Azerbaijan's independence and to liberate territory under Armenian occupation. The young Azerbaijani Republic needs Turkish help. "We are two states," he said, "but one nation." The same day, the Azerbaijani president held talks with the Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Aliyev is reported to have said that he might agree to the presence, under CSCE auspices, of Russian and foreign forces in the republic. He gave it to be understood that the question of building a pipeline to carry Azerbaijani oil across Turkish territory to the Mediterranean "will be decided in the near future." A number of bilateral agreements on development of economic cooperation are expected to be signed today.
