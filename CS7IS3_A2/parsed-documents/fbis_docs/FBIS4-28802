He indicated that he would continue to persist in persuading North Korea to agree to hold dialogue with the international community. [Begin Hata recording] With regard to the withdrawal from IAEA, it is indeed unfortunate. However, this still does not mean withdrawal from the nuclear NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. In the circumstances, we still hold hopes that they [the North Koreans] will open their doors to the international community as soon as possible to eliminate suspicions about their development of nuclear weapons. [end recording] Hata thus indicated his intention to persist in persuading North Korea to engage in dialogue with the international community.
