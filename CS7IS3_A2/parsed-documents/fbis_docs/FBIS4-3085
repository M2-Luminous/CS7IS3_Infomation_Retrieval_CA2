But many inefficient enterprises have been forced out of operation by the heat of market competition, according to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC). By the end of 1993, the total number of domestic enterprises had reached 7.3 million, up by 25.2 per cent from the previous year. It's purely the survival of the fittest. Some 341,000 firms went under last year, an increase of 32.2 percent over 1992, a SAIC report says. Undoubtedly, the strong economy has formed the fundamental impetus for the growing number of new domestic enterprises. The SAIC's drive to simplify startup procedures for new firms, launched at the end of 1990, has also contributed to the increase, said Liu Junchen, in charge of enterprise registration under the SAIC. To date, all provincial-level local branches of the administration have been authorized to register local enterprises. However, those involving the pillar industries or concerning the nation's long-term interests such as military, cigarette production and transportation, still must wait for green lights from SAIC to open their own businesses, Liu added. The increase of new firms in 1993, whether State-owned or privately-funded, is also eye-catching. An astonishing 113.3 per cent increase over the previous year created 552,000 new companies. Economic reform in the past decade led to a flexible system for free flowing property rights. This is vital to break through the rigid criteria defining enterprises according to their ownership. That is to say, State-owned, collective-run, or privately-funded ones, Liu said. The central government has started about 100 large and medium- sized State enterprises as pilots for their shareholding reforms. At the same time, local Governments selected pilot projects in their own areas. State, collective and individual businesses enjoy the same rights if they hold the same number of shares in the pilot firm. In line with this trend, experts say it is better to use the term "State economy" rather than State-owned enterprises, leaving market forces to determine the fate of State or privately-funded businesses. Recently, private businesses experienced marked growth. Furthermore, the recent National People's Congress session has also underlined the importance of a buoyant private sector. Traditionally, the country carried out a pyramidal approval system for registering enterprises with the State Council and NPC at the top. Under the rigid rubber-stamp system, it was very hard to open a new firm. And even when government finally approved a business, many found it difficult to survive, let alone make a profit, because they could not get their products to market quick enough. When this happened, it was the responsibility of the government to make up the economic losses. Fortunately, it realized the problem and decentralized power for registering enterprises to local branches. With the simplified procedure, it is much easier to access the market economy. This will lift the economy in the long run, said Liu. Many firms are borrowing money when they apply for registration to look like "fat cat." Ironically, once they finish registration, the enterprises immediately return the money they have borrowed, leaving a nearly empty bank account to run the business. To reverse the situation, the SAIC decided to set up a nationwide supervision system to carry out random checks on firms' registered capital to guarantee the money is being used in the operation of the firms, the SAIC official said. Liu said the market system had played an important role through wielding its "invisible hand," causing many firms to go belly up last year. Since all enterprises are equal in market competition, only fit firms can survive. Without financial support, many unprofitable State enterprises find it difficult to make ends meet. And those who failed to transfer their management mechanism in time have to face the music--bankruptcy or be taken-over by a more efficient business. Both the government and enterprises in red usually choose the latter, said Liu, as it is easier to continue using facilities of merged firms and to settle down employees of the once money-loosing industries. As the central government took measures last year to safeguard sustained, healthy and speedy economic growth, many financial businesses with poor management were ordered to close. With the intensified anti-corruption campaign, many enterprises run by the government were ferreted out and ordered to stop their operation. To ensure a healthy real estate market, the central government checked businesses within the sector and closed those deemed to be substandard. Futures markets are another important aspect that the central government decided to reign in. To achieve its goal, the central government campaigned at the end of last year to get businesses involved in futures markets for reregistration. Those who failed to observe the rules were ordered to stop operation. Recently, the government announced that no new businesses on the futures market would be registered this year, so as to focus their work on rectifying the order of the present futures market.
