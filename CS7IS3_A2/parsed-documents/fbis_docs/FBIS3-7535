Currently the quotas imposed under the MFA are managed by exporting countries so that any financial gains -- what economists call "quota rent"-- are retained in the exporting countries. In Thailand, the Commerce Ministry is responsible for allocating textile export quotas, and some of these are traded among Thai exporters. According to experts who have examined the US proposal to open bids for allocating textile quotas to importers, only exporting countries are eligible to sell quota rights. That would violate both MFA and GATT rules. Washington announced the bidding in order to compensate for the US$13.9 billion loss of revenue expected in the next five years resulting from tariff cuts under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the cuts would benefit Americans since they would reduce prices. The government's income would rise $3 for each dollar lost from tariff cuts. In another development, the Thai Commercial Counsellor in Washington said that the US Senate had enacted the Fair Trade in Financial Services bill, which will increase US leaders' authority in trade negotiations on financial market access for commercial banks, insurance firms and other financial institutions. The act allows the US Treasury to list countries that refuse to open financial markets to American companies.
