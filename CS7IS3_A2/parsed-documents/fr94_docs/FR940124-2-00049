FR940124-2-00049 FR940124-2-00040 4. Applicants assert that the mortality risk charge of 0.30% for the enhanced death benefit is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by Security Life under the Contracts. In arriving at this determination, Security Life conducted a large number of trials at different issue ages to determine the expected cost of the enhanced death benefit. First, hypothetical asset returns were projected using generally accepted actuarial simulation methods. For each asset return pattern generated, hypothetical accumulated values were calculated by applying the projected asset returns to the initial value in a hypothetical account. Each accumulated value so calculated was then compared to the amount of the enhanced death benefit payable in the event of the hypothetical Owner's death during the year in question. By analyzing the results of a statistically valid number of such simulations, Security Life was able to determine actuarially the level cost of providing the enhanced death benefit. Based on this analysis, Security Life determined that the mortality risk charge of 0.30% was a reasonable charge for providing the enhanced death benefit. Security Life undertakes to maintain at its home office a memorandum, available to the Commission and its staff upon request, setting forth in detail the methodology used in determining that the risk charge of 0.30% for the enhanced death benefit is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by Security Life under the Contracts. 5. The surrender charge may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. In that event, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the surrender charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Security Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Account and its Owners. Security Life undertakes to maintain at its home office, and make available upon request to the Commission and its staff, a memorandum setting out the basis for such conclusion. 6. Security Life also represents that the Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund which undertakes, in the event it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated and approved by a board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons'' of such fund within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Act. Applicants' Conclusion Applicants submit that, for all of the reasons stated herein, the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the Act meet the standards set out in Section 6(c) of the Act. Applicants assert that the exemptions requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
