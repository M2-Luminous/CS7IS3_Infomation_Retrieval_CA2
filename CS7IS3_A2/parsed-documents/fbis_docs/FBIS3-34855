The committee is led by Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and minister of higher education, and Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO's Political Department. The meetings were attended by committee members of the Jordanian and Palestinians sides. The meetings will discuss various issues regarding economics, security, and development, as well as the issues tackled by the multilateral talks. Following the first session of higher Jordanian-Palestinian joint political committee meetings, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of information and minister of state for cabinet affairs, and Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, PLO Executive Committee member and head of the Information Department, held a joint news conference. Dr. al-'Anani said: [Begin al-'Anani recording] Today's meeting was very fruitful and beneficial. Agreement was reached on several issues. First of all, we discussed the mechanism of coordination, and our evaluation of the coordination that has been conducted so far. We decided to adopt policies that provide a clear mechanism for this coordination, based on clear timetables, specific committees, and fixed dates of meetings so we can coordinate our positions from now on, especially because the negotiations process and the peace process have begun to move from the negotiations halls to practical implementation on the ground. This affects the interest of the Jordanian and Palestinian peoples on the two banks. Likewise, we discussed the basic issues that are of an urgent and current nature. We know that Palestinian-Israeli economic talks will begin in Paris. Therefore, we appreciate the understanding of the brothers on the Palestinian side for the need for coordination with us, particularly in the field of trade cooperation and trade exchange. At present, this point has special importance. We discussed the stage of what are called security arrangements and borders. We agreed to activate the committee assigned with this subject and to exchange expertise and information in this field. We also agreed to coordinate the traffic of passengers on both sides, and to make sure that the opening of the bridges after the implementation of self-rule will be in the interests of the people, in term of their movement and their return to their land -- not to empty the land but to entrench the people there. As for the two other issues, which are the refugees and Jerusalem, we agreed to form two committees, a specialized committee for each subject, in order to agree on the frameworks within which we should deal with these two basic and sensitive topics. You know, for the Palestinian side, these two subjects are delayed until the negotiations on the final stage, but we can coordinate our positions now on negotiations concerning these subjects in a manner that secures for the Palestinian people, and the Arab people in general, their rights in their land in Palestine and Jerusalem, and the same applies to the basic rights of the refugees. [end recording] For his part, 'Abd-Rabbuh Said: [Begin 'Abd-Rabbuh recording] The meeting discussed almost all issues on the agenda in the areas that Dr. Jawad al-'Anani mentioned. I believe this meeting was practical, and allows us to go ahead with substantial steps, whether in bilateral Jordanian- Palestinian coordination or in supporting the position of the two parties within the framework of the negotiations process. There are issues that are still under discussion, such as the evacuees. Also under discussion is the idea of forming a quadruple committee, preceded by a Jordanian-Egyptian-Palestinian meeting to coordinate stands between these parties. This subject is of primary concern and is among the issues that are supposed to be settled during the transitional stage. [end recording]
