These special characteristics of opium poppies match those of the northwestern region in general and Lai Chau in particular. Because of this, poppies are grown here in rather large quantities. Based on a survey conducted in 1990, in Lai Chau Province there were 2,378 hectares planted in opium poppies. The Hmong have a tradition of planting opium poppies in the northwestern region. The poppy growing areas in Lai Chau include Tua Chua and Sin Ho districts and the highlands areas of Phong Tho, Dien Bien, and Muong Te districts. As one of the places were opium is produced, this area has become a land of addicts. A 1990 survey conducted by the Lai Chau Labor, War Invalids, and Social Welfare Service showed that there were 13,000 addicts in the province, which is 2.85 percent of the province's total population. Nguyen Duc Thien, the director of the provincial Drug Prevention and Control Center, said that the number of addicts in 1993 was higher than in 1990. Most of the opium addicts in Lai Chau are Hmongs and Thais, but recently, more and more youths in the towns and cities have started using opium. He added that some border defense troops who go on patrols through the poppy fields make cigarettes using raw opium, and from long use they have become addicted to opium. In many highland Hmong villages, such tasks as tending the fields, obtaining firewood and water, and so on are done by women. The men stay at home smoking opium all day. In Lai Chau City, there are 13 homeless Hmong families who must live in rock caves. Because of their opium habit, they had to sell their homes. Each day, they go and cut firewood and then bring it back to the city to sell it to obtain money to buy rice and opium. At the provincial Drug Prevention and Control Center, which is located in Dien Bien Phu City, we met many people who had voluntarily come here for drug rehabilitation. Mr. N.V.K. had sold all his possessions, and Giang A Tong, who is from Pu Nhi Village in Dien Bien District, has been an addict for 38 years. He no longer looks like a man. Although he does not speak the Vietnamese language very well, Lo A Po, who is 64 years old and who has been using opium since 1962, said that "at first, I used opium when I was ill, but now it uses me." However, among the addicts in Lai Chau, we did not see anyone who injects opium. There are 13,000 addicts, but the province has just one drug prevention and control and drug rehabilitation center with 10 beds. It treats only those who come here voluntarily. At present, the center has very few materials and very little equipment. Although it was just established on 29 June 1993 and actually went into operation in September 1993, the center has already helped 40 people kick their drug habit. In 1990, the province prohibited the cultivation, storage, and sale of opium, but by the beginning of 1993, only 571 hectares of opium poppies had been destroyed. The strange thing about opium is that while it does not require much labor to grow poppies, they bring high economic results. In a good season, one hectare of poppies can produce about 4 kg of opium. In March 1994, a kg of opium was selling for 800,000 dong. At the same time, to earn 3.2 million dong, you would have to grow two hectares of corn with yields of two tons per hectare. In Lai Chau, there are villages in Dien Bien District where 90 percent of the households have Min motorcycles, and on their own they have built roads connecting the villages. They have been able to do this thanks to opium. Realizing the dangers of opium, many villages have voluntarily destroyed the poppies, but finding a suitable replacement crop is a problem for the various echelon and various sector cadres in Lai Chau. Tuan Giao District has replaced poppies with cardamom. But it takes seven years before the cardamom plants can be harvested, which means seven years of living in poverty. Sin Ho District has planted and harvested wheat, but it does not have any processing installations. And even if the wheat can be processed, it is difficult to find markets, because it is difficult for domestic flour to compete with flour from Germany, France, and China. Sung Chiu Thenh, the vice chairman of Dien Bien District, said that his district is planning to bring in and raise deer. He believes that it is possible to raise deer, but from where will the capital be obtained in view of the fact that a deer costs 20 million dong. Giang A Tong said that in recent years, opium harvests have been bad because of the unfavorable weather. In 1994, from Tet until the middle of the 2d lunar month, it rained only twice. But poppies require heavy rains. Regardless of where the opium came from, public security officials in Son La Province seized more than 200 kg of opium concealed in a vehicle in which the director of the Lai Chau Education Service was riding. A provincial cadre responded by saying that that opium had been brought in from Laos. Dien Bien District alone shares a 170-km border with Laos. Relations between the peoples of our two countries have always been very close, and people frequently cross the border to visit each other. Opium traffickers have made use of this to smuggle opium into Lai Chau. They usually hire local people to carry the opium using jungle routes that few people know about. The opium is then stored in one place until customers from the lowlands come to get it. Can't something be done to stop this? Interdiction is only at the level of.... In 1993, the government allotted Lai Chau 2.1 billion dong to eradicate the poppy plants and curtail the use of opium. It is hoped that Lai Chau will overcome the difficulties in order to completely eradicate opium poppies. If Lai Chau and the northwest can eradicate opium poppies and stop the smuggling of opium, this will certainly reduce the number of addicts in the lowland provinces.
