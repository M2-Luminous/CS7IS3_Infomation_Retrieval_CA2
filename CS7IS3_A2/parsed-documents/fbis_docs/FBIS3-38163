Cetin said a "joint delegation" will go to Serdest [as received] village, in Iran, where allegedly civilians were hit. He was speaking to an A.A. reporter in Davos where he was attending the World Economic Forum meetings. He said he held two telephone conversations with his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati on Saturday on the issue, adding he has reassured the latter that the strike was not directed against Iranian territory. "According to Turkish military officials no harm should have been done in the region, but necessary action will be taken if it is determined by the committee that nine were killed and 19 wounded," he said. He said Iran has not asked for any compensation, but if there is such a case of civilians killed, Iran should be compensated.
