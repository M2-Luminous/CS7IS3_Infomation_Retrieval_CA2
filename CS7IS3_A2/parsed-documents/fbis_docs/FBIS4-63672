Only a Stony Road Glimmers in the Haze....'"] [Text] For Yuriy Meshkov, this date was probably a holiday. He laughed and joked a lot. Answering a question as to what he will do if official Kiev adopts a decision to introduce Ukrainian presidential rule in the Crimea, Meshkov said: "A wise man acts only one way. A stupid person can make a choice." Meshkov held out hopes -- referring to a recent visit to the Crimea by acting Prime Minister Zvyahilskyy -- that Ukraine has many sane people and it is up to them to define Crimean-Ukrainian relations. As to the recent and unexpected statement by Leonid Kravchuk, who stated his personal opinion that the Crimean Tatars, like other peoples, have the right to self-determination and the establishment of their own state, Meshkov said that his position on this issue is different: "Of course, the full volume of human rights should be observed. The other issue is that of "satisfying one's ambitions." With regard to the issue of Crimean Tatars (and the 50th anniversary of their deportation from the Crimea, the date being marked these days), Meshkov took into consideration the presence of foreign journalists and delivered an eloquent speech devoted to the tragedy of the deported peoples and the fault of all those (he mentioned the Crimea, Ukraine, Russia, and Uzbekistan), who did not take the pain of these peoples for their own tragedy. Later, Meshkov recalled the phrase: "The bell tolls for you." The president said that not all debts had been paid and he focused on the issue of the quota of Crimean Tatars among the Crimean Supreme Soviet deputies: "I am still of the opinion that political rights are not connected with national traits." The president also spoke about his constant desire to keep his promise and crush the Mafia. However, he made allusions to something that no one could understand. To avoid any unnecessary reproaches for imprecision, I am going to cite Meshkov: "As to the defeat of the Mafia, it was supposed that the Ministry of Internal Affairs, along with the internal affairs minister, fully meet the existing demands on them. However, this is not true. You were present when the BBC queried the internal affairs minister on 5 September. In his interview, he declassified the operation which could cost the lives of his colleagues, my life, and the lives of the members of my family. The internal affairs minister declassified this operation. Later, he declared that he will not perform his duties because he has a president with such and such decrees. Therefore, we did not do much, however, we planned more. However, this subject is still pressing and the interested circles know that this issue will be radically resolved." This speech resulted in more questions than proposals. What did former minister A. Plyuta declassify? What has Meshkov's life -- who marked his first 100 days in office -- to do with the 5 September interview? Does Meshkov mean his order regarding the arrest of 100-150 men who were allegedly Mafia members? However, the evidence of their conniving with the Mafia had to be searched for during the court proceedings which were supported by a storm of applause. What hampers the new internal minister in his fight against criminal groups which are operating quite openly? Finally, does Meshkov know who is among his entourage? If he does, with what Mafia is he going to combat? At the end of his crime-oriented monologue, we understood: It is not, while it is [as published]. What Meshkov did not mention was even more interesting. There were plans for a trade agreement with Russia to become the triumph of Meshkov's first 100 days because we see no other results at all. However, he kept silent on this subject. Probably, the reason was that S. Shakhray, Russia's representative, who, along with Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Saburov signed this agreement, resigned from his post the same day (he did not know that Yeltsin had already dismissed him) and held a news conference. Meshkov also declared, in fact, avoiding straightforward statements, that the Crimea had to conduct a step-by-step demilitarization; that the National Guard of the Republic of Crimea -- which a new legislature plans to organize -- would not be a military unit but a department for maintaining public order; that an extravagant idea of moving the Crimean capital from Simferopol to Sevastopol was caused by circumstances; that the deputies' impatience to show the government what is what will not result in a confrontation between the president and the legislature; and that Kiev's plausible attempts to repeal the autonomy cannot be conducted "immediately." The day when a representative of the Ukrainian president was nominated to the Crimea, was, in Meshkov's words, the most depressing day in his 100 day presidential career. He made assurances that the happiest day is still awaiting him. In compliance with a request to cite some poetry to demonstrate his current emotional state, he cited Lermontov's poetry: "Only a stony road glimmers in the haze...." Then he thought for a while and added: "And I am walking alone." This, in my mind, corresponds to the truth.
