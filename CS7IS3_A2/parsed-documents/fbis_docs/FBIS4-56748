Reporter Ruben Pino will give us further details on this. [Begin Pino recording] The plan of action and the Barbados Declaration were finally approved today after an extensive workday of this First Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, during which the floor was given to the 13 speakers who were unable to speak during the previous session. Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, who yesterday afternoon presided over the final part of that top-level meeting, also joined the roundtable meeting of chiefs of states and of governments, who held a meeting behind closed doors as of 1130 this morning. During the final day of sessions in the (Cherbun) Center, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro met with Lloyd Erskine Sandiford, President of the Global Conference and Prime Minister of Barbados. Sandiford said his country is continuously working for everything related to the Caribbean and outside the region, seeking Cuba's full integration into the American system in an effort to overcome the current differences. The Barbadian prime minister added that Cuba as a Caribbean nation plays an important role in the development of the region and of the hemisphere. Likewise, the Cuban president said he was impressed by the independent position the Carribean region adopted throughout its history concerning Cuba, and expressed interest in tightening relations within the context and objectives of the Association of the Caribbean States. Fidel Castro also stressed the delegates' contribution to the debate, adding that Cuba will work for the implementation of all the decisions adopted by the conference in its plan of action. Late this afternoon, Fidel Castro also held a meeting with approximately 100 representatives of nongovernmental organizations [NGO's] who participated in the Conference of Small Island Developing States. During this meeting, (Jian Frenz), coordinator of nongovernmental organizations from the Caribbean, briefed the Cuban president about the resolutions adopted by the participants of that forum in support of the Cuban people's right to their development, and against the U.S. blockade. In this exchange of ideas, the commander in chief expressed his recognition of the growing power of the NGO's and the important contribution they have made in creating an awareness of the need to take care of the environment, an awareness he did not perceive among politicians during the Rio de Janeiro summit. Fidel Castro also expressed thanks for the solidarity and support for the Cuban people, and underscored the contribution of the government representatives during the forum paralleling the global conference. He added that the influence of good ideas can be felt everywhere, and also within the NGO's. You are leaving us a valuable experience and for this reason, the feelings of dignity, independence, and honor are present in each of you, and they are part of the great battle you are waging.
