Cartoons depicting the "Jewish Devil," with the slogan of revenge, "Haibar, Haibar, Ya Yehudim, the army of Muhammad shall return," have been back in the daily papers of Egypt for the last few weeks, after being missing for a long time. "Thank God, our list is still long," Yitzhak Rabin says proudly in one Egyptian cartoon, holding up a list that says: "the Dir Yasin massacre, the Sabra and Shatila massacre, the Cave of Makhpela massacre." "I cannot get my hands clean, even though I washed them both before the massacre and after it," Rabin complains in another cartoon in the opposition weekly AL-WAFD, where the picture shows his hands dripping with Palestinian blood. And in another place, the leader of the Serbs, the murderers of the Bosnian Muslims, asks a Jewish figure (according to the anti-Semitic stereotype) to come and help him. "But if you do come, do not blow up our bank or our stores," he warns, with blood dripping from his hands and the hands of the character he is talking to. These dozens of cartoons are testimony to the fact that the short spring in the attitude of the Egyptian press, especially the establishment press, but also the opposition, toward Israel--a spring that began with the achievement of the Oslo agreement and reached its height with the signing of the Cairo agreement a month ago--has come to an abrupt end. If for the six months that have passed since the agreement was signed in Washington, the cartoons in the Egyptian newspapers concentrated on the slaughter of the Muslims in Bosnia and on the internal terror in Egypt itself, now the papers are being flooded with articles of incitement and protest against Israel, the same kind that were published at the height of the intifadah and after the war in Lebanon. Some of the newspapers do distinguish between the settlers and their politics and the Israeli Government and its indirect responsibility for the slaughter in Hebron, but they are few and far between. Most of the media blame Israel for the massacre, and imply that the government is in partnership with the settlers, and sympathizes with them. They make no distinction between the murderer from Hebron and the settlers as a whole. All the settlers are depicted as murderers of Arabs. "The hands of Israel are filthy with blood, even if she does try to deny her responsibility (for the slaughter)," wrote the official paper AL-AKHBAR on 27 February. "The crime in Hebron reveals clearly the racist tendencies and terrorist character of the Jewish settlers, who believe that the blood of Muslims is worth nothing. The Israeli army also did its own part to maximize the number of deaths. "The massacre is solely the responsibility of the Israeli Government," concluded AL-AHRAM of the same day, "and this time it is impossible to claim that a crazy man carried out the crime on his own accord. There are precedents for this claim, the burning of the Al Aksa mosque, and also the murder of the Palestinian workers, where the Israeli authorities claimed that the murderer was a crazed youth. "The Israeli occupation forces poured oil on the flames the day the massacre was carried out, by shelling another mosque in occupied Jerusalem with TNT shells" destroying the mosque and a building nearby, broadcast the government radio station Savat al-Arab. It is true that in a phone call to Mubarak, Rabin expressed his sorrow over the ugly incident and the Israeli Government's and people's condemnation of the criminal act, but expressing sorrow is not enough to bind the wounds to Arab feelings." From the way the Egyptian radio station expresses itself, it is possible to draw conclusions about the purpose of the restraint the Egyptian authorities have shown toward the electronic media, and the restraint these media have shown in this matter. These anti-Israel expressions stand out all the more because so many articles have been appearing since the agreement in Washington, even in the leftist newspapers, calling for normalization of relations with Israel. This seems to have been part of a government-backed information campaign. Now it appears that the Egyptian Government is knowingly allowing the wave of criticism to sweep over the newspapers in order to give the anger and pressure that have been building up since the massacre in many circles a way to be vented. The Egyptian Government knows that the only person who can turn the anti-Israeli trend around is Yasir 'Araf'at, who by renewing negotiations with Israel can calm the winds and give renewed legitimacy to relations with her. Because of this, he is the most courted man in Cairo these days. Last week he met, under government auspices, with top people in the regime, the press, and the Egyptian intelligencia--those same journalists and intellectuals who had attacked him for his support of Saddam Husayn--and explained how important the peace negotiations with Israel were, in spite of or perhaps because of the massacre in Hebron, and his words were headlined in the newspapers of Egypt.
