FBIS4-51755 "dreas085_m_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 Thailand Official Expects Continued `Watchlist' Status Official Expects Continued `Watchlist' Status BK0305041594 Bangkok THE NATION in English 3 May 94 p A3 BK0305041594 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said yesterday the U.S. trade watchdog is expected to keep Thailand on its watchlist after the annual revision of the list is announced today. Churin said he was not optimistic that the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) would remove Thailand from all watchlist categories, because "the U.S. is likely to wait until the Thai parliament passes the third reading of the amended Copyright Bill." In response to an earlier report that the USTR had already removed Thailand from its priority watchlist (PWL) and moved it to the normal watchlist classification, Churin said the announcement had not been made. An economic officer at the U.S. Embassy also confirmed that the USTR had yet to release an official statement. "I have not received any report from Washington," he said. The officer, however, noted that the USTR was at any moment expected to announce a revision of the countries on its trade watchlist. Thailand last year was removed from the most serious classification, the priority foreign country (PFC) status, to the lesser PWL after Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon assured the USTR that the Thai government would introduce a new copyright law soon. The new copyrights bill has yet to come into force, pending its third reading in Parliament.
