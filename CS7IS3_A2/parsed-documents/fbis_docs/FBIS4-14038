What enhances these circles' optimism is well known: That is the presence of a single world camp whose plans will not be blocked, not even by the closest allies, particularly Israel. The positions assumed recently by some Israeli officials, who accept withdrawal from Golan and the suspension of settlement building, support the beliefs of these circles, who understand the American policy to a certain extent. If the course of negotiations leads to such results, how will Hizballah deal with this reality? Will it give up its resistance role or will it be the difficult figure in the equation? Political sources close to Hizballah say that the party's leadership is well aware of what is happening in the region and that it reads events and developments carefully and thoroughly. Hence, the sources say, it will not let the party pay the price or be the victim of the settlement. Therefore, the inner political line of Hizballah leadership has started to focus on how to cope with peace with Israel through political and social methods, particularly since the party believes that coping with normalization is its responsibility. The party is thus turning its battle with Israel from military resistance to fierce political resistance, for which all its energies and institutions have been mobilized. The party believes that peace with Israel is more dangerous than war, the sources add. The same sources affirm that Hizballah leadership is totally aware that the regional settlement will not be halted by Iran, which is up to its ears in foreign debts exceeding $50 billions and which is in a political position similar to that of other Third World states as a result of domestic and surrounding political conditions. Other sources note in this context that the Hizballah leadership has launched contacts with state officials with a view to expanding the ways to cope with the Israeli peace and its impact on Lebanese society. The features of the approaching stage in the region have become clear to the party's leadership. Thus, it has started to reconsider its military structure and to organize it and monitor it carefully to avoid any individual fault or emotional outburst leading to a clash with the Lebanese Army, which will not let any incident or violation occur in the future. The Hizballah leadership understands that the government's acknowledgement of the resistance's reality at present can never be allowed in the next stage, when the Lebanese Army takes charge of security for the south, both its land and people. These sources add that the measures the Lebanese Army adopted recently have put all the parties involved, particularly Hizballah, face to face with the reality that once the army "takes action," it will not "leave" the land it set foot on. Moreover, the Army will not tolerate any disruption so long as its organs are capable of "reaching" all the parties to correct them. In this, the Army will pursue methods that safeguard the state's interests and will avoid claiming victims among the party that fails to understand that it does not bargain for the land it deploys on or share it with others. Any leniency in this is tantamount to going back to the stage in which the state collapsed. This reading of reality might turn the party with all its energies toward coping with peace, the sources say. They affirm that the party leadership is aware of fears from clashes within the party or between it and other parties in al-Biqa' in the same way it is aware of the impact peace will have on the region.
