FR940224-2-00035 FR940224-2-00017 [Docket No. CP91&hyph;2243&hyph;002 et al.] Distrigas of Massachusetts Corporation, et al. Natural Gas Certificate Filings February 15, 1994. Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. Distrigas of Massachusetts Corporation Docket No. CP91&hyph;2243&hyph;002 Take notice that on February 8, 1994, Distrigas of Massachusetts (DOMAC) with an office at 200 State Street, Boston Massachusetts 02109, filed in Docket No. CP91&hyph;2243&hyph;002 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act and part 157 of the Commission's regulations an application for an amendment to the certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Commission in this Docket on December 3, 1991 ( Distrigas of Massachusetts Corporation , 57 FERC ¶ 61,295, 1991; clarified 58 FERC ¶ 61,297 (March 18, 1992)). The December 3 Certificate authorized DOMAC to install additional vaporization capacity and appurtenant facilities at DOMAC's liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Everett, Massachusetts. That Certificate, as clarified, required DOMAC to complete construction of the authorized facilities by March 18, 1994. Because of intervening developments and changes in DOMAC's original market projections, installation of the certificated facilities by the March 18, 1994, in-service date is no longer warranted by current market demand. Accordingly, given the substantial lead times needed to complete design and to obtain needed equipment, DOMAC requests that the December 3 Certificate be amended to remove the in-service date. In place of a specific in-service date, DOMAC requests that the certificate require DOMAC to file with the Commission by March 31, 1995, final design specifications and evidence that final equipment orders have been placed. Timing of completion of the certificated facilities will thus depend on the completion and delivery of the required equipment and will not require further intervention by the Commission to precisely tailor the certificate to the delivery dates for that equipment. Comment date: March 8, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 2. Williams Natural Gas Company Docket No. CP94&hyph;196&hyph;000 Take notice that on January 24, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG), Post Office Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for an order permitting the abandonment of certain of its gathering system facilities by conveyance to Williams Gas Processing - Mid-Continent Region Company (WGP-MCR), all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. WNG will convey approximately 88 miles of predominantly small diameter pipeline, 38,286 horsepower of compression, two drip control plants and various appurtenant facilities, all used to gather gas from approximately 700 wells in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. WNG will sell the facilities to WGP-MCR at the net book value at the time of conveyance. Comment date: March 8, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 3. Williams Natural Gas Company Docket No. CP94&hyph;221&hyph;000 Take notice that on February 9, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG) P.O. Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;221&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing WNG to replace approximately 20 feet of 20-inch transition pipeline and, upon replacement, to hydrotest and increase the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) of the Blackwell, Oklahoma to Hesston, Kansas segment of WNG's system, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, WNG states that in order to increase the MAOP of the Blackwell to Hesston portion of its pipeline system approximately 20 feet of 20-inch pipeline, in five four-foot sections, must be replaced. WNG states that the pipe replacement and subsequent uprating will give WNG the capability to transport increased volumes of gas to the Wichita market center. WNG further states that the increased MAOP will also enhance service reliability and flexibility by increasing WNG's ability to shift demand volumes between the north and south portions of its pipeline system. WNG states that the proposed replacement and uprating will cost approximately $222,000, which will be paid from funds on hand. Comment date: March 8, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.
