Yakovlev and V. Gorobets; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] [Yakovlev] Russian-Latvian talks, overshadowed by the illegal arrest of two Russian generals, began this morning and carried on late into the evening. The Latvian delegation agreed to Russia's proposed date for the withdrawal of troops -- 31 August this year. The only fundamental issue on which it has hitherto not been possible to agree is the Skrunda missile attack early-warning station. It is necessary to define the status of this strategic installation, needed to ensure Russia's national security, and establish the possibility of international supervision, something on which the Latvian side is insisting. The opinion is being aired that the station might operate as a civil installation. Military experts believe that the Skrunda radar does not represent an environmental danger nor does it pose a threat as a target on Latvian territory. Agreement is being hampered by the impossibility of putting up a similar structure on Russian territory in a short period and the internal situation in Latvia, which dictates that politicians should seek the immediate withdrawal of all troops and the elimination of Russian installations on its territory.
