The agency said the immigrants have invaded Yola, capital of Adamawa state following the devaluation, which was accompanied by the pegging of the Nigerian currency at 22 naira to the dollar. The Nigerian government decision to peg the currency against the dollar, announced at the same time as the 1994 budget, enhanced the value of the naira against the CFA franc, said NAN. Before the government decision, 1,000 CFA francs could buy 140 naira on the black market. Now they could only buy 65 naira. NAN said the immigrants were mostly from neighbouring Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Mali, and mainly old men with wives and children. It gave no figure for how many people were involved. The head of immigration in the state, Aliyu Abdullahi, told NAN that some of the aliens were also from Algeria and war-afflicted Sudan. NAN said the male immigrants had sought employment in low-paid work such as the construction industry, or as gatemen, nightwatchmen. Women are trying to work as hairdressers.
