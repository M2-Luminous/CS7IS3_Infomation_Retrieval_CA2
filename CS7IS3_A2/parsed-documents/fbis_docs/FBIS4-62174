The general rejected accusations by Dniester Bank Chairman Vyacheslav Zagryadskiy, quoted by local media, that the field bank of the Russian Army allegedly bought 39 billion of Dniester roubles (interim currency made from old Soviet banknotes by sticking a special stamp with a portrait of Russian Field-Marshal Aleksandr Suvorov). The Army was buying Dniester roubles in order to undermine the economy, the banker claimed. "There is not a single Dniester rouble in the money-box of the Army field bank", the general told ITAR-TASS today adding that the economic catastrophe of the region had been caused by its "incompetent and thieving leadership". This is not the first time that Lebed accused Dniester leaders of financial embezzlements and corruption.
