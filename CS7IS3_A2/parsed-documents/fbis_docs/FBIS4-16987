Rutskoy's Suit Against IZVESTIYA"] [Text] The capital's Tverskoy Intermunicipal People's Court has considered the latest defamation suit brought by former Vice President A. Rutskoy against IZVESTIYA. This time it was Aleksey Chelnokov's article "Young Nazi Drinks Toast and Reads `Mein Kampf'" (IZVESTIYA, 15 January 1994) that was selected as the cause of the suit -- specifically the following fragment: "By his `presidential' edict Rutskoy made a Russian National Unity subunit equivalent to a military organization. The Barkashov people gained the right to bear arms -- within the Khasbulatov citadel, of course." The plaintiff was seeking 100 million rubles [R] for this "dishonor" and the moral damage done to him. He himself preferred not to attend the hearing, predicting which questions he would have to answer. In particular, the respondents were interested in whether he seriously considered himself Russian president and, correspondingly, commander in chief, during those tragic days, and whether he deliberately violated the Russian Federation laws "On Weapons," "On Defense," "On the Military Draft and Military Service," and "On the Status of Servicemen" in randomly issuing weapons to people with very dubious political beliefs and by no means irreproachable moral qualities. By failing to appear, A. Rutskoy also avoided having to answer the question of whether he had invited Barkashov's followers to provide his own security -- which A. Barkashov himself recently revealed in an interview with SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA. The respondent A. Chelnokov submitted photographs to the court clearly recording the Barkashov followers with their assault rifles and stylized swastikas on their sleeves. This could not have happened without the clearly expressed consent of A. Rutskoy. The court was also presented with his "edicts": on his own accession as acting president, on the appointment of the "defense minister," and so forth. The very fact that these so-called documents were published meant that their author assumed full responsibility for the possible consequences of the uncontrolled distribution of weapons -- consequences which were soon to be felt.... Consequently, talk of some kind of defamation, much less of R100-million damages is just more blasphemy. Carefully weighing all the circumstances and the case file considered during the hearing, Judge Olga Sergeyeva threw out A. Rutskoy's suit.
