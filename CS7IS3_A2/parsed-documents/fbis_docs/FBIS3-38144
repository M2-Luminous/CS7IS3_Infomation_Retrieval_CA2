However, the Center Party is even more unlikely than the Conservatives to give its voters any kind of recommendation as to how to cast their ballots. There are over a million votes to be gotten from those who backed [defeated] Center Party candidate Paavo Vayrynen and Conservative Party candidate Raimo Ilaskivi. Forces working for Social Democratic Party's Martti Ahtisaari went immediately into action on Monday [17 January] to ward off the threatening danger. SDP [Social Democratic Party] Member of Parliament Kari Rajamaki declared Rehn the candidate of far-right capitalist circles and reminded that she is a minister in a government carrying out "an unjust social and economic policy." Similar expressions were heard in the stance taken by the governing council of the National Labor Confederation's Construction Workers Union. It believed a Rehn victory would amount to a power-of-attorney letter for the present government's economic policies, while Ahtisaari represents the welfare state and common responsibility. The union board has a Leftist Alliance leadership that is known to have been favorable to Ahtisaari all along. Rehn Spirit in Center Party The Center Party leadership will weigh its stance regarding the second round in a party council meeting on Thursday. The council is not expected to throw its support to another candidate for the second round. "This is hardly necessary," stated Center Party Secretary Erja Tikka. According to Tikka, the overwhelming majority of Center Party voters are going to back Rehn without any prodding. Center Party Chairman and [Prime Minister] Esko Aho, while following election returns on Sunday, let it be understood that he is going to vote for Rehn. That party's provincial press also began immediately on Monday marshaling forces behind Rehn's candidacy. If all of those who voted for Vayrynen decided to support Rehn in the second round, she would get a good 6O,OOO votes. The Center Party does not intend to punish editor Keijo Korhonen nor Member of Parliament Eeva Kuuskoski for splitting the party vote. It is only hoped in the leadership that Korhonen and Kuuskoski will consider how they behaved. Both Korhonen and Kuuskoski stated on Sunday that they do not intend "to bequeath" their votes to anybody. Conservatives Also Unlikely To Adopt a Position Conservative Party Chairman Pertti Salolainen stated that most Conservatives will support Rehn in the second round. The Conservatives' Party Governing Board will discuss the campaign situation on Wednesday, but according to Party Secretary Pekka Kivela, it is unlikely to take a stand on a candidate. On the other hand, it was not denied that a stand would be taken. On Monday Salolainen stressed that discussion on this issue had not yet started. The reluctance to take a stand as a party is explained among themselves by the fact that the party has favored direct elections for the presidency. Conservative candidate Raimo Ilaskivi garnered almost one-half million votes in the first round. Haavisto Going To Vote for Ahtisaari The governing board of the Greens discussed its choice for president on Saturday in Helsinki. Party Chairman Pekka Haavisto predicted that the board will not make a clear choice between Ahtisaari and Rehn. It is to be expected that a list of both candidates' pluses and minuses regarding most important issues for the Greens will be drawn up. According to Haavisto, this is going to be decided because Rehn and Ahtisaari are tied in attracting Green votes. Haavisto says he is going to vote for Ahtisaari. In his opinion Rehn's stock is continually on the rise with Greens. Left Alliance Behind Ahtisaari The Left Alliance is preparing to work behind the scenes with its own defeated candidate Claes Andersson and Ahtisaari supporters who differ with him on European Union [EU] membership. Party Secretary Matti Viialainen on Monday outlined a position according to which the party is in support of Ahtisaari. This would not be a vote recommendation, but in it the party would express its view that Ahtisaari is the candidate who would most creatively and decisively manage Finland's foreign policy. The party board will decide the issue on Wednesday, and Viialainen assumed that coming to a decision will be difficult. However, making the decision less onerous than it would otherwise be is that both candidates are in agreement on Europe policy. The EU question divides the Left Alliance, and it was felt in advance that the party would have a hard time taking a position if one candidate had been a Social Democrat and another an opponent of EU. Christian Party Supporters Have Problem With EU In the Christian League, the pro-Europe stands of Ahtisaari and Rehn are causing an opposite phenomenon than that in the Left Alliance. According to the view of Party Secretary Jouko Jaaskelainen, the party is going to have a hard time taking a position precisely because neither candidate's opinion on the European Union corresponds to the view held by the Christian League or its [defeated] candidate Toimi Kankanniemi. The Christian League governing board will discuss the election today, but according to Jaaskelainen, it is not going to give any recommendations. If any recommendations come, they will be given by individual political figures, he stated. Rural Party Won't Bequeath Sulo Aittoniemi's Votes Rural Party [SMP] Secretary Timo Soini said that his party is not going to make any definite vote recommendations. He suspects, however, that some party leaders are going to state their choice in advance. The SMP will discuss possibly taking a position at a governing board meeting on 26 January. Soini also believes that among SMP voters Rehn has strong support--mentioning veterans and active military personnel. Soini also believes that the hardships of Rehn's personal history will sound a note in SMP ranks.
