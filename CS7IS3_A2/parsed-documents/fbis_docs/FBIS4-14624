If this idea does not meet with extensive support within the CIS, Russia and Kazakhstan could form this union, he said during a meeting with Moscow State University teaching staff and students during his official visit to Russia. The Eurasian Union must be based, according to Nursultan Nazarbayev, on totally different principles from the CIS. They must be founded on the formation of national bodies with a view to coordinating economic, defense, and foreign policy. A Council of Eurasian Union Heads of State and Government must be set up to discuss strategic issues. The next step would be direct elections to a common parliament to coordinate the legislative activity of countries within the Eurasian Union. The creation of a real military complex necessitates the founding of a council of defense ministers, while the coordination of actions in the world arena necessitates the formation of a council of foreign ministers. A standing interstate executive secretariat must also be created for the Eurasian Union, whose membership would be appointed by the heads of state, comprising representatives of all the union's countries. This executive committee should have observer status at the United Nations and the CSCE. According to Nursultan Nazarbayev, the creation of a Eurasian Union entails the introduction of a common identity card or citizenship for all countries in the union, mandatory formulation of coordinated economic reform programs, and the adoption of a supranational currency. The Kazakhstani president went on to develop his idea by drawing attention to the need for a single information office for the executive secretariat. "Information must not be unfriendly; an agreement must be signed within the Eurasian Union to this effect," he stressed. A council for education, culture, and science must also be set up in order to shape a coordinated educational policy and defend and implement the rights of national minorities. Membership of the Eurasian Union, Nursultan Nazarbayev continued, should not hamper bilateral relations with third countries. The union's basic principle is "equality, respect for the sovereignty and independence of states, the rights of the individual, and the individuality of every state." Everyone who shares these principles can be members of the Eurasian Union, the Kazakhstani leader said. Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized that there is no question in this case of reviving the old Soviet Union and forming an empire. There is no need to be afraid of the word "union," he said; there is after all the European Union, for instance. "We are all equal and my current visit to Russia marks recognition of that equality," the president indicated. Today the Kazakhstani president laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Kremlin Wall.
