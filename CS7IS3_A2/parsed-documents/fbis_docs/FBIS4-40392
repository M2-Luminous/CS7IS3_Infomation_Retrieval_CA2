In Blagoveshchensk he visited a shipbuilding plant where seiners for Far East fishermen are assembled and difficult orders connected with the defense industry are carried out. The president met with workers in the workshops and expressed interest in the course of economic reform at the major enterprise involved in conversion. Boris Yeltsin also visited one of the leading enterprises in the Amur region -- the multi-sector "Partizan" joint stock company. This enterprise alone produces more soybeans, for example, than the whole of the neighboring Khabarovsk Kray. A detailed conversation about the fuller use of the Amur region's potential took place at the oblast administration. There the president briefly shared his impressions from meetings with Amur inhabitants and stressed that the people's mood struck him favorably: They are not hiding the difficulties, but, he noted, they are not panicking. Boris Yeltsin spoke critically about local trade, noting the small range of output in the stores. It was noted at the conference that a beginning has been made on the formation of a market infrastructure in Amur Oblast. However, parasitical attitudes and contempt for the laws of a market economy at the primary level, in the enterprises, is one reason for the economic crisis and the fall in the volume of production. Apart from the crisis factors common to the whole country, there are also purely regional factors. The cost of output is high because of transportation expenditure and the disparity between the price of industrial and agricultural output, as a result of which 100,000 tonnes of soybeans, produced last year, are left unclaimed in storehouses. The biggest problem of all is the lack of a base for processing agricultural raw materials. To overcome it, Amur Oblast needs to construct a major plant for processing soybeans; after all, the Amur region provides something in the order of 70 percent of Russia's soybeans. Right away, turning to A. Shokhin, the president gave the government instructions to work on this question and provide the necessary federal assistance. Similar instructions were given to develop a free trade and economic zone in the Blagoveshchensk area. The task was set of bringing the oblast's mineral and raw material resources more quickly and fully into economic circulation; their overall value is assessed at $360 billion. There is a possibility of increasing the volume of gold extraction by a factor of 1.4-1.7 in the next five years. The overwhelming proportion of known reserves and predicted resources are concentrated in developed areas, so that growth can be achieved without using up big allocations. In the evening of 15 June B. Yeltsin left Blagoveshchensk for Kyzyl.
