Artuza Delgado said this at the end of a meeting with Pompeyo Marquez, special minister for border affairs, whom he briefed on the prevailing situation in the border area and the operations being conducted there by the National Guard. Artuza Delgado pointed out that the National Guard is aware that drug traffickers have set up cocaine processing laboratories and have planted cocaine fields in Colombian territory near the Venezuelan Amazonian area. He explained that the existence of these cocaine fields also draws guerrillas closer since they are in charge of protecting production of the drug. Artuza Delgado termed this situation "very serious." Later, referring to the resources the National Guard needs for border operations, he added that the National Guard is aware of the country's fiscal situation and that is why it has changed its conduct. According to Artuza, the National Guard will have to learn to manage the resources assigned for border operations more efficiently.
