Einseln referred to a confidential letter by Kristian Garancis, aid of Leonid Apananski, to GHQ [general headquarters] chief Colonel Sirel. Apananski mediated the weapons deal with Israel and the letter mentioned a joint project launched by Prime Minister Mart Laar and Israeli General Dan Shomron. General Einseln pointed out in a letter to Prime Minister Laar that defence projects should be coordinated with the military leadership and required about Apananski's powers to deal with defence issues. Laar assured the general that no cooperation projects had been signed and referred to defence and interior ministers as better acquainted with the subject. Government advisor Jaan Tross denied the existence of any cooperation plan. General Einseln also criticised the inefficiency of the Defence Ministry and the frequent replacement of ministers. "I have been in office less than 13 months and this is the fourth minister already," he pointed out.
