President Boris Yeltsin is continuously maintaining personal contacts with the leadership of those countries, with which Moscow has contractual relations and with which agreements have been signed on a top level. The Visegrad group is of much interest for Russia, Kozyrev continued. "We have tremendous respect for those countries and are building relations with them on the principles of equality." In his opinion, speculations on some "new Brezhnev doctrines" and the allegedly inequitable relations between Russia and those countries are absolutely groundless. According to Kozyrev, the time has come to "check watches" with all the countries of the Visegrad group early this year in order "to advance jointly, in harmony, towards complete mutual understanding." "We are going to discuss in Prague some international problems, primarily the situation in Bosnia, and to analyse matters dealing with bilateral contacts in a broader context. I believe we have traditionally durable relations and good prospects for the future," Kozyrev said. In his opinion, it is necessary to discuss in a frank, calm and unbiased way how we should build our relations in the future and develop partnership. We should discuss problems of building a new greater Europe. There are no ready formulae for it. According to Kozyrev, the participation in the Partnership for Peace programme is one of the ways and the joining of NATO is another. All countries, including Czechia, are resolving this problem by themselves. We are interested in finding most effective, balanced solutions concerning ways of developing partnership. But we should not regard NATO as the only way. We have the Visegrad group, we have other CSCE institutions, he continued. In the opinion of the Russian foreign minister, we should not contrast all those ways with each other, but on the contrary, to use them all. "We are not linking our actions in the settlement of the Bosnian conflict with the NATO ultimatum. Actually we believe it does not have much to do with us. What is really important today is that it should not be an obstacle, that the 'war parties,' -- the Serb, Croatian and Muslim extremists interested in the escalation of hostilities -- should not take advantage of it. The most important thing is that no one should try to disrupt with the help of provocations the positive process that has been started thanks to the initiative of President Boris Yeltsin. The initiative of the Russian side was approved by the president three weeks ago. It is aimed, in the first place, at creating security zones, primarily around Sarajevo. "Now this initiative has been given a clear and vivid shape," Kozyrev said. In his opinion, there is a possibility today to get back from unilateral steps to joint actions of the whole of the world community. The Russian president is maintaining direct contacts with leaders of many countries, especially with Chancellor Helmut Kohl (they had a telephone conversation on Friday). Contacts are also being maintained on the level of foreign ministers with the "European union three," the United States, Britain and France. Kozyrev believes that the G7 countries should be invited to take part in that process. "The problem today is to take advantage of the opportunities, created by the initiative of the Russian president and a positive response to it of the Serb side, and not to allow various provocations to disrupt the process. We should strengthen it with the help of far-reaching agreements both on Sarajevo and on Bosnia in general," Kozyrev stressed.
