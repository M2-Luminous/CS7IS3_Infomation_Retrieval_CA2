In a statement on Sunday, Mr Mufamadi said every possible step had to be taken by both the state and civil society to avoid a repetition of the destructive cycle of violence experienced before the elections. "Now that South Africa has a democratically elected and representative government, absolutely no reason whatsoever exists for the kind of political violence which has ravaged our country in the past. "This madness must stop. It cannot be allowed to destroy or blight the future of our people," he said. Mr Mufamadi added that the Ministry of Safety and Security and the South African Police service were engaged in an intensive analysis of the current situation in order to develop a comprehensive strategy to prevent South Africa from falling victim to another destructive cycle of violence.
