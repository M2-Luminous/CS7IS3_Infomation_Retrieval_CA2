We thank you for the appreciation you expressed for the achievements of this country, which is striving to regain its health and sovereignty. This country will always remember your support for progress in the march to liberation, reconstruction, and peace. [passage omitted] You are witnessing this country's determination to rebuild itself, despite the inherited burdens and the stormy political changes taking place around us and in the world. Convey to your countries and peoples that Lebanon has overcome the inherited ordeal, and is moving toward the future with self-confidence and faith in its rights. The most significant achievements of the peace process were the triumph of the will of the Lebanese people in the struggle for coexistence, the development of a plan for salvation, and the return to a normal life. You have witnessed the unity of the comprehensive and firm national position in the face of the shocks to which we were subjected this year, beginning with our collective rejection of the Palestinian deportees, our unity in one rank in repulsing the Israeli aggression against the south and western al-Biqa' last July, and ending with [words indistinct] recommendation issued by the UN General Assembly last month regarding UN Security Council Resolution 425. These shocks, which came [words indistinct] were dwarfed by the will of the Lebanese. They confirmed that Lebanon has become stronger than all the storms, and that it deserves the backing of your countries to regain its rights. [passage indistinct] We have participated in the Madrid Conference within the framework of the implementation of Resolution 425 to achieve just and comprehensive peace and not any partial or unjust peace. The assurances contained in all the letters we received from the U.S. Administration since 1991 leave no doubt that efforts will be made to implement this resolution. We participated out of solidarity with our Arab brothers in the Madrid Conference, which also involved the implementation of the other UN resolutions, particularly resolutions 242 and 338. We are interested in the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace. Whoever talks about a comprehensive and just peace means peace in the whole area, and not a separate peace, but how meaningful peace would be if it is achieved with Lebanon and Syria. We extend our thanks to the UN forces--commanders, officers, and soldiers--and to their countries. The sacrifices they are making to safeguard Lebanese legitimacy in the south in implementation of the provisions of Resolution 425 deserve our thanks and gratitude. Your Excellencies, the most precious treasure which the Lebanese possess is the will to constantly move forward. We have three priorities today: Reinforcing national reconciliation, launching socioeconomic reconstruction, and strengthening Lebanon's position in the area and the world. What we have accomplished in a short period confirms that Lebanon is a living country. We have moved from an economic crisis, social division, and political and military conflict to the people rallying around the state and the success of the state and personal initiative in checking economic deterioration. A big improvement has been achieved in the balance of payments this year. We were also able to absorb the deficit in the balance of trade, and saw an increase in bank deposits and an increase in the development rate to about seven percent. Despite the burdens, Lebanon has not defaulted on payment of its foreign debts. In this regard, we extend our thanks to the World Bank, to the countries that granted us long-term loans, and to the Arab funds which provided assistance to projects in Lebanon. [passage omitted] Your excellencies, less than two months ago our country celebrated the 50th anniversary of its national independence, looking to the year 1994 with much hope for positive accomplishments. During this year we will complete the building of the state, launch the workshop of reconstruction in Beirut and the regions; and we anticipate decisive progress in the efforts for comprehensive and just peace. What reinforces our confidence is the positive international response to our efforts, led by the decision of His Holiness Pope John Paul II to visit Lebanon in response to invitations by all Lebanese officials as a confirmation of the unity of our country and reconciliation of its people. Your excellencies, a country that offers coexistence as a model to the world and carries the banner of democracy, freedom, development, and reconstruction is a country that deserves peace. Long live peace, long live Lebanon.
