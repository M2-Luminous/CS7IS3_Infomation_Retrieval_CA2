However, he said, there would have to be a "harmony of opinion," between the deputies' groups of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the Slovak National Party (SNS), the Democratic Left Party (SDL) and other deputies. The HZDS preferred a June date for elections, Gasparovic (HZDS) said on Slovak radio, because this was what citizens wanted, and this was shown among other things by the organizing of the petition drive. Gasparovic said that today's report from the President's Office that the president would not be calling a referendum due to alleged inadequacies in the petition sheets was a "hard blow" for the citizen. However, he indicated that a certain "new step" would be decided on today still, but did not give further details. SDL chairman Peter Weiss confirmed that his party was attempting to reach an election date by a constitutional law, but said he understood a referendum as "insurance," to make sure that elections were not forgotten about. He added that the SDL considered a September date as best. The KDH would vote on Thursday for the shortening of the electoral term, and gave precedence to a date at the end of September and the beginning of October, KDH chairman Jan Carnogursky said. The deputies' group of the Alternative of Political Realism (defectors from the HZDS) favor the same date, spokesman Vladimir Bajan said. It was unacceptable for the new Slovak government to function only for two months, Bajan said, and thus the group rejected a June date. Deputies from the National Democratic deputies' group will vote for a September, or perhaps an October date, their chairman Ludovit Cernak said. Their belief was "the later the better," Cernak said, so that the political practices of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar could be fully unveiled and so that he would no longer be an "idol" by the election time. Deputy Pal Csaky said that for the Hungarian minority Egyutteles- Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) coalition a September date was acceptable. Given that two camps were forming, of which one supported a June date and the other a September one, he did not think the law would be passed. Csaky said he considered the idea of making President Michal Kovac call a referendum by parliamentary decree to be unhappy, because if a referendum was called, and then both parliamentary and community elections were held, people would be fed up of voting this year.
