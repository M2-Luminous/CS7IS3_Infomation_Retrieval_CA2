The results of the survey show those who thought current Japan-U.S. relations as "going well" plunged to 20 percent from 37 percent only two months ago. Those who thought the relations are "not going well" rose sharply to 64 percent from 42 percent, thus giving the worst evaluation on the relations since 1982 when the first such survey was conducted. Views on the future of the Japan-U.S. relations have also become more pessimistic. Only 16 percent of the pollees said they thought the relations would "go in a favorable direction," and this percentage is way below the 26 percent in the previous poll which was also the highest in the history of this survey. On the other hand, views given on the position of the Japanese Government which rejected the U.S. demands at the summit, broke down to 20 percent saying "it was only natural," 57 percent saying "it was unavoidable," and 12 percent saying "it was well done." After the new economic consultations broke down, the United States stepped up its offensive against Japan, for instance, by charging that Japan's cellular phone market is closed. As if reacting to such a U.S. move, those who thought "the current Japan-U.S. relations to not be going well" far surpassed the previous highest rate of 47 percent shown at the time of the survey in December 1992, thus suggesting that the public views the situation as serious. The percentage of those who gave positve views on the relations as "going well" dropped substantially, in particular among people over 50. Broken down by occupation, more white collar workers and those in the farming, forestry and fisheries industries were found to be departing from their earlier positive views. Broken down by political party background, those who have turned pessimstic were conspicuous among supporters of the Liberal Democratic Party, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Democratic Socialist Party and Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger Party]. On the outlook for future Japan-U.S. relations, 23 percent said they thought relations will "head in a bad direction, and 51 percent said they thought "there will be no change." This 23 percent predicting a" bad direction" is comparable to the record worst 24 percent shown in the December 1992 survey which was conducted shortly after Bill Clinton was elected President. More older people and men thought the Japanese Government's position at the new economic consultations was "natural" than did younger people and women. Twenty-five percent of male respondents against 16 percent of female respondents said they agreed with the government's position.
