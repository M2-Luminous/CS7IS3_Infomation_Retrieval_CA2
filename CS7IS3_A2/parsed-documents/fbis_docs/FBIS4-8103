The demonstration was called by opposition parties, the conservative Popular Party and the extreme right-wing Slovene National Party, which accuse President Milan Kucan and Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek of following communist policies. Many Slovenians are also angry at the dismissal two weeks ago of the country's independence hero and Social Democratic leader Janez Jansa from the post of defence minister by the coalition government. Jansa addressed the crowds saying he would soon return to power, calling on all opposition groups to support him. The only government representative to take the stand was Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle, who was booed by the protestors when he called for a "fight against corruption, but only through democratic and legal means." The demonstrators later dispersed peacefully.
