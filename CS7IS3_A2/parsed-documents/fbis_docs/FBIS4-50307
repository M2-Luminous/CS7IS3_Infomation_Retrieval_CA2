"Neither the U.S. nor any other state regards Tibet as a sovereign nation. The U.S. does not recognize a Tibetan government-in-exile," said a statement issued by the office of U.S. State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry. The statement was released following the recent adoption of "The Foreign Relations Authorization Act" by the U.S. Congress. The statement also said that the United States will continue to follow a "one-China" policy. On the issue of U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, the statement said, "we continue to honor our commitment to the August 17, 1982 Communique with respect to arms sales to Taiwan and regard it as one of the three pillars supporting our bilateral relationship. Nothing in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act will interfere with our continuing to honor this commitment." "The United States remains fully committed to the Three Joint Communiques between the P.R.C. (People's Republic of China) and the U.S. as the framework of our China policy. Nothing in the foreign relations authorization act changes this," the statement added.
