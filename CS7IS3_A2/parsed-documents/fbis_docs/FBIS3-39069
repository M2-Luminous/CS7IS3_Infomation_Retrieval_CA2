Both the U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry and his French counterpart Francois Leotard have warned there will be no extension to the 10-day deadline set by the alliance for the withdrawal of heavy guns. The NATO spokesman was reacting to reports from the Bosnian capital that the United Nations Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) was bending to conditions put by the Bosnian Serb military on how to place their artillery under UN control. "For us, control means that these weapons are sequestered (by UNPROFOR) so they cannot be used," the NATO spokesman said. Last Wednesday NATO issued a 10-day ultimatum for the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons at least 20 kilometres (12.5 miles) from the outskirts of the Bosnian capital, or place them under UN control. The ultimatum expires at 2400 GMT on Sunday night. If it is not met, NATO has said it will launch air strikes against the heavy weapons emplacements. The NATO spokesman said there would be no extension of the deadline. But the Bosnian Serb chief of staff, Manojlo Milovanovic, said at the weekend that Bosnian Moslem troops would have to be placed under UN control as a condition for handing over control of the Serb heavy weaponry. In apparent defiance of the NATO ultimatum, he said his forces intended to keep their weapons in place, but under UN surveillance and only if the Moslem infantry was also put under UN control. On Sunday, the British deputy commander of UNPROFOR forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lieutenant-Colonel Simon Shadbolt, said the concept of "control" did not mean the Bosnian Serbs would have to move their weapons. "There are different ways of controlling things than to physically put them inside barbed wire," he said. But the NATO spokesman said Shadbolt's interpretation was too loose and that simple monitoring of the weapons was not good enough "because this has never stopped the weapons being used." He added that NATO had its own air surveillance intelligence about the artillery emplacements. "We have our own means of checking up," the spokesman said. A British official said there were cautious grounds for optimism despite the slow pace of the weapons hand-over, because the ceasefire around Sarajevo was holding. "So far so good, but we haven't got very far yet," he said.
