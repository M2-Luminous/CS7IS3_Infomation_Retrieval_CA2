FBIS3-30037 "dreas037__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-037-A Document Type:Daily Report 24 February 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. Firms Seek Support for New Networks OW2402020894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2402020894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] U.S. information and communications companies have advanced a request that "the Japanese Government financially support private firms in the project to establish next-generation communications networks (new communications networks that will use fiber optics) in Japan." They have made the request because, if the government participates in the project, it will become easier for them to obtain "guarantees" for orders for necessary equipment to be used in the project. The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry [PTM] and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) have differing views about the project. The PTM has asserted that "the government should financially support private firms in the project," while NTT has said, "the project should be carried out solely by private firms." It is possible the requests from U.S. firms, which "reinforce" PTM's assertion, will turn into a demand that the government guarantee a certain level of foreign capital inflow into the project, thus leading to trade friction. The U.S. firms' intentions were disclosed by John Stern [name as published] during a recent interview with NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN. Mr. Stern (representative and director of the Japan office for U.S. electronics companies) represents U.S. information and communications companies in Japan. During the interview, Mr. Stern said: "If private companies (such as NTT) take total charge of the project, most orders for necessary equipment will probably be given to Japanese businesses." He added: "If the Japanese Government participates in the project, U.S. firms will be able to ask Tokyo to secure the procurement of U.S. products (through such things as Japan-U.S. trade talks)." The project, which is characterized by the PTM and NTT as "an important task directed toward the 21st century," is aimed at setting up fiber optics communications networks, which are capable of sending and receiving voice information and distinct moving images, in households and offices all over Japan. The project will become the social capital that supports multimedia businesses. It is expected that about 30 to 50 trillion yen will be invested in the project by the year 2010. The Telecommunications Council (an advisory body to the posts and telecommunications minister), which is studying measures to establish the new networks, plans to propose that "private firms should be basically in charge of the project and the government should financially support them in setting up networks in depopulated areas, where communications business will not be worth much." The council is to include the proposal in its report to be submitted to the posts and telecommunications minister in May. The PTM's "idea of the government supporting private firms" is also backed by some new common carriers which want to prevent NTT from enhancing its superiority in communications business. On the other hand, NTT, which opposes government participation in the project, and the Finance Ministry, which hopes to cut financial expenditures, are supporting the idea of "establishing the networks through private firms." Thus, it is likely that arguments over the project will continue even after the Telecommunications Council submits its report. During unofficial talks with NTT in January, the U.S. Trade Representative demanded foreign participation in the project. In reply, NTT reportedly simply said: "As in the past, we will procure equipment through necessary procedures which are fair to both domestic and foreign companies." It is believed that U.S. companies are backing the idea of "the government supporting private firms" with the hope of obtaining a surer "guarantee for foreign participation in the project."
