Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman in Krajina said on Tuesday [24 May]. Speaking at a regular news conference of military, police and civilian UNPROFOR officials in sector south of the U.N.-protected area of Krajina, a spokesman said that UNPROFOR central commissions had given a positive assessment at their latest meeting of the implementation of the Zagreb agreement on the cessation of hostilities signed by Krajina and Croatia. They agreed that the next phase of talks about economic and humanitarian issues could begin now. The republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed by the local Serbs in their ancestral lands within former Croatia in 1991, in response to the republic's violent secession from the former Yugoslav federation and violations of the local Serbs' rights. Krajina has been a U.N.-protected area since 1992 and 14,000 peacekeepers are deployed there. Krajina and Croatia started the negotiating process in March 1994, with U.S. and Russian mediation, and agreed on a ceasefire and separation of the two armies along the 1,000-km long lines of separation, currently controlled by UNPROFOR. The spokesman said that a meeting between Krajina President Milan Martic and UNPROFOR Chief of Civil Affairs in sector South Enrique Aguilar on Monday [23 May] had focused on the assessment of the situation ahead of the beginning of negotiations about economic issues, which the spokesman described as having been somewhat postponed by the Croatian Government. The meeting also dealt with the venue of the talks, the spokesman said, but refused to disclose further details. He only said that Geneva and some other places outside Croatia were discussed and added that Krajina representatives would receive a letter with the time and place proposed for the talks. The U.N. secretary-general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi told Martic in a telephone conversation on Monday that he was interested in the resumption of the talks, but that he did not intend to accept Martic's proposal to be the chief mediator in the future talks, because talks about economic issues were within the jurisdiction of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, the spokesman said. Colonel Bill Morton, deputy UNPROFOR commander of Sector South, said that UNPROFOR's observation posts had been placed in the area of disengagement but that none of them had been placed in its final position. The corrections will be made only after the mine fields have been cleared, he said. Col. Morton said that the lines of disengagement on Mt. Velebit were difficult to control because of the rugged terrain. Smaller units of both sides have been sighted in the area of disengagement in the region, he said, and they seem to be observing each other. The deputy chief of UNPROFOR civilian police has announced that new police substations would be opened in this sector within eight days, and added that the civilian police has established a fixed way of operation within the area of disengagement and that serb and Croat police units have begun to patrol the area as well.
