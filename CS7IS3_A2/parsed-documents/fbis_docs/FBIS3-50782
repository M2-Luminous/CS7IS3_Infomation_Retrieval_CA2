In a 20-page item entitled "Living for the Country or Dying for Freedom," the guerrillas, who have been clashing with the Army in the southern State of Chiapas for the past six days, announced that "we have started the armed struggle" in order to accomplish "jobs, land, housing, food, health, education, independence, liberty, democracy, justice, and peace." The bulletin also repeats the demands they announced on 1 January when they launched their military activities, and guidelines are relayed "to EZLN leaders and officers." These guidelines include a "war tax bill" which will be levied "on all business establishments and property owners" in the regions where they operate. The publication describes the regulations that will be implemented in the communities they "liberate" and includes the democratic election of authorities, prices and salary control, release of all prisoners -- excluding those charged with murder, rape, and drug trafficking -- the protection of abandoned children and senior citizens, and foreign companies will now have to pay their workers the same salary paid in their respective countries of origin. The two-colored publication displays excellent type quality and carries at its top a photograph of Emiliano Zapata, the revolutionary leader who was one of the leaders who unleashed the 1910 Mexican Revolution. The publication also exhibits the photographs of some Zapatist members during training sessions in jungle regions. "The people struggling against the oppressor government and the great national and foreign exploiters" will be entitled to bear arms for their defense and by obligation "respond to the call for help made by those authorities democratically elected," the EZLN announces in its publication. The Zapatists also propose that all public officials will be subject to audits aimed at detecting embezzlements, peasants' debts will not be recognized, and private property hoarding and production means [as received] will not be allowed. The publication establishes the EZLN general headquarters in the Lacandona jungle region where clashes are currently taking place. Lacandona is located in the southern State of Chiapas bordering Guatemala.
