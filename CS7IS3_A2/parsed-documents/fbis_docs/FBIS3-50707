It Is as If History Had Stopped Here'" -- first two paragraphs are L'UNITA introduction] [Text] San Cristobal. When Rigoberta Menchu succeeded in escaping from Guatemala, shocked by the extermination of her family, Bishop of San Cristobal Samuel Ruiz Garcia took her under his care. Don Samuel not only helped Rigoberta reacquire her psychological integrity. For over 30 years now he has been fighting against the injustices that oppress the heart of Mexico. Now he has written to the Vatican asking for explanations regarding the accusations that have been made against him: He wants clarifications concerning the charges, which according to him are generic, making reference to an excessive partiality toward the poor as well as mistakes in doctrine and reduced pastoral activity. It is the prelate himself that is making the criticisms made by the nuncio in Mexico, Girolamo Prigione, in "indirect" relation to the coming presidential elections in Mexico and the privatization of land following the approval of the treaty on free trade (NAFTA). That is what the bishop states in an article that will be published in the next issue of the monthly NARCOMAFIE, which has provided a leak on the text. Don Samuel is small, dresses in white, and has an energetic and cordial appearance. He wears a small amber cross around his neck -- amber is one of the few riches in this extremely poor Chiapas. While I talk to him, I cannot help thinking that it is fossilized resin, the tear of a tree that has been fossilized for years. [L'UNITA] San Cristobal de las Casas is a town that was famous for its tranquillity. It has suddenly turned from being a faraway suburb to the center of the "global village" thanks to the work of the Zapatist army. What is your point of view about what is happening? [Ruiz Garcia] I will tell you what our position is. And this is our, not my position because it represents the opinion of all three bishops of the State of Chiapas. We have three dioceses here: Tapachula, Tuxtla Gutierrez which is the capital of the State, and San Cristobal de las Casas, which is the oldest of the three. Looking at the present and future, we bishops from Chiapas have issued a first notice to our followers in the three dioceses in which we show our concern over the recent events. We regret the line of action chosen by the Zapatist army and consider it to be the result of the anguish and suffering of the Indians of this region and we understand their pain and frustration. We can understand that what they did in their anguish appeared to be the only way out of a situation that has been going on for centuries. Over the past 500 years these native populations have come to occupy the lowest ranks of our society. Their situation has always been misunderstood or denied. On the other hand we consider that there are objectively other paths that have still not been attempted and understand that psychologically the Indians cannot see any other way out. And this has led them to declare war against the Mexican Army. [L'UNITA] Don Samuel, the international press has suddenly realized that you are the object of an attempt to remove you from your seat. In reality, this attempt began in October, but the news was not made known in Italy. It is also true that until a few days ago Chiapas was not in the news... [Ruiz Garcia] I can understand that the Vatican covered this news up, but here in Mexico it was reported in all the press with a wealth of detail. However, let us return to the current situation: We bishops in Chiapas have made a second joint communication in which we offer ourselves as mediators between the two conflicting parties in order to initiate peace talks. Of course we are waiting for the two sides to approve this mediation. Yesterday evening (Monday 3 January -- L'UNITA Editor's Note) I met with the other two bishops to establish how we would act in our commitment to serve. We are aware of the role that the Church can play in starting talks and we have urged for the approval of the two parties. [L'UNITA] Was the response a positive one? [Ruiz Garcia] We have already received the government's assent but we have not received a response from the guerrillas. This does not mean that they are refusing our offer but simply that we have no channel to communicate with them. The only ones that can help us establish contacts are the mass media. [L'UNITA] Today San Cristobal is well and truly under siege. The main square and therefore the cathedral and the seat of the bishopric are heavily garrisoned by soldiers. Don't you feel encircled? [Ruiz Garcia] In reality, the whole center is militarized. I myself can enter and leave whenever I choose. All that happened is that I once had to drive down the wrong side of the street to park my car. [L'UNITA] It appears that you do not have fewer enemies than your great predecessor. The same malicious rumors, which originated most probably with the Chiapas landowners, are trying to present you as the fomenter of this new guerrilla warfare. What is your reply? [Ruiz Garcia] Just this morning I received a publication via fax from Berkeley in the United States which carries an interview with the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] members. Here any tie or relationship with the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas is decidedly denied, though his work in support of the human rights of the Indians in his diocese is recognized. And the mud slung on him by the local authorities is denounced. The Zapatists have said: "The bishop is not giving us weapons but at least he is not doing any injustice." When people began speculating about guerrillas from Guatemala taking part, the Zapatists stated: "We are all Mexicans." [L'UNITA] More should be said about the situation that has caused these events... [Ruiz Garcia] All the people that travel to this area are certainly very surprised. Here we are living in a kind of time warp, as if time has stopped. And we can see this primarily by seeing how the native communities live. It is a truly depressing situation, the Indians have always been considered the dregs of this society. One cannot avoid asking oneself what has happened, what caused this situation. Above all, why there has never been a substantial change, what has the Church been doing all this time, and what official measures were really taken to put a stop to this situation?
