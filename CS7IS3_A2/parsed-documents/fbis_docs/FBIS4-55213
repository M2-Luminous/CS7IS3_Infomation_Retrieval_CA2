Asked about a statement of the spokesman of the Greek Government, Venizellos, that the relations between Greece and Albania have a tendency of a new tension, as well as about an interview of President Berisha with the Greek TV channel "Antena 1," the president said that personally, he is determined to work not to increase but to ease tension in the relations between Albania and Greece, believing that this is in the interest of Albania, the Albanians, Greeks, Greece and other peoples and countries of the region. The future of the Albanian-Greek relations, he said, will be determined mainly by the tendency which will predominate in Greece. "If Greece complies with the European policy, Maastricht and CSCE principles, I am sure that the relations between Albania and Greece in a near future, if not today, will be friendly. There are many prerogatives testifying that they can be friendly. But if another tendency predominates in Greece of which many Greeks are proud, I would say, the Byzantine tendency, or the tendency which identifies the state with the church, in this case we would have to do with a difficult future in the relations between Albania and Greece." Mr. Berisha admitted he was amazed by yesterday's declarations of the Greek Government regarding the statement of the Albanian Foreign Ministry, which allegedly was irritating, because it mentioned the Cam problem. "The Democratic Party and its government have raised this problem since it took over and will continue to tackle it. It is an undeniable problem. The Greek Government, too, has made a step forward and we have hailed it, because it has acknowledged the question of ownership. Therefore, I don't see any irritating element," Mr. Berisha said. Regarding the meeting of the foreign ministers of the two countries in Zurich, Mr. Berisha said that although the results were minimal, the meeting was positive because the two parties showed a clear will for positive results. They were open and sincere in tackling all problems. "In my interview with 'Antena 1,' I mentioned the Protocol of Florence, which is a protocol of the big powers' border commission, which has designated the frontier between Albania and Greece. No Greek Government has so far approved and ratified this protocol. Then, the question rises: In this context, what is the value of several repeated declarations by the Greek Government according to which Greece has no territorial claims at a time when senior representatives of this government include south Albania in the military schemes for the defence of Greece, consider south Albania as a Greek unliberated territory or 'Northern Epirus?' In this case it seems we have to do with a clear claim whose essence is precisely the non signing of the Florence Protocol. Therefore, we have insisted and will still insist on the signing of this protocol. "I believe all the Albanians know a special merit of the current Greek Government, which several years ago lifted the law of war with Albania, a very absurd law, which penalized all the relations between the two countries. It would also be in its honour and merit to ratify the Florence Protocol," President Berisha said. As regards the problem of the radio stations, Mr. Berisha reiterated his demand in the interview with "Antena 1" to interrupt transmission via Konica and Corfu radio stations which every day call on the Greek minority to join an armed uprising and topple the regime or make annexionist calls. On this occasion, Mr. Berisha congratulated the minority, who turn a deaf ear to these warmongering calls. "These calls," he said, "have minimal or no effect at all among the minority. Greece is a democratic country and let the human rights institutions and organisations, which are aware of the problem, evaluate its democracy. But it is common knowledge that the UN charter and other international documents prohibit neighbouring countries to launch propaganda against one another. Imagine for a moment as if all in Europe, in which powerful minority factors are intertwined, to try to solve the minority question through calls for war, annexations or secessions. So, I do not think my declarations in the interview with 'Antena 1,' received by Deutsche Welle, to be really so irritating," Mr. Berisha said adding that he has demanded and demands from the Greek Government a realistic policy to succeed in a good neighbourliness. Asked about the incident in Kukes and assessment of the strikers' demands, President Berisha said that the group of the villagers removed because of the dam in 1978 "deserves a special and differentiated attention, like all the forgotten groups which deserve priority," Mr. Berisha said, considering a part of the demands of the Kukes' strikers as right, rational and which need solution. "But, there are demands which are absolutely unacceptable, because they penalize all the society. If a certain small group forwards demands which in some way are a punishment for the majority, this is and will always be unacceptable. A government can never be democratic when it resigns itself to absurd demands by a minority," Mr. Berisha stressed. Concerning the problem of price rise in electric energy and of taxes, which have given rise to discussions, Mr. Berisha said that with the latest price fluctuation the Albanian Government completed one of the most difficult, most important aspects of the reform, the prices reform. "This is, certainly, the most painful side of the reform, but it is absolutely indispensable," President Berisha said stressing that absolutely all the payed energy is compensated. "In case we kept the price inherited from the past, we would practically preserve the socialist sector in energy, the sector of failure. "Consequently, no investor would be interested in investing in the Albanians energy, which certainly makes up the major source and possibility of Albania to develop, integrate into the countries around, and to export to these countries," Mr. Berisha said, also mentioning the compensation for heating in the next winter, because the heating problem was not envisaged in the compensation package carried out by the government a month ago. Regarding taxes, Mr. Berisha said that the taxes practised by the Albanian Government are completely acceptable and that can be coped with. He said there had been and is no state without taxes. The policy of taxes, seen through red glasses, seems an exploiting policy. The last regime had the severest taxes that any other regime in Albania had ever known. But, being hypocrite, the last regime had found the formula that 'we are a country without taxes,'" President Berisha said adding that 72 per cent of the Albanians favour the market economy although knowing that they will pay taxes. "The gathering of taxes and their presentation before the parliament is the transparent procedure which shows to the citizen that it is not him that is dependent on the state, but it is the state that is dependent on him." Regarding this problem, President Berisha said that the tax system to be applied next year is simpler and has to do with the value added tax, which is a Pan-European tax. Responding to a question about the state secret and the forgiveness of several reporters punished for this problem, Mr. Berisha said that there is no secret for reporters. I have said and say this again. It would be regretful to think that the state is governed through instructions by the head of state. The state is governed by laws. My views are one thing and the law is another. I can have my own view but the law is a law and should be implemented, because the implementation of laws is an indispensable condition for the state functioning. "For me, the defence of freedom of the speech and its development, such as the defence of law and its consolidation, is and will remain a constant objective," Mr. Berisha said. To the question by the Deutsche Welle reporter on the results of Berisha-Kinkel meeting and Albanian refugees in Germany, Mr. Berisha responded that in these talks the Albanian party raised the problem of the Albanian refugees stressing that their staying and special treatment in Germany is a great direct economic assistance Germany renders to Albania. "We understand that Germany has a very great number of refugees from the world over, but I think that at least from Europe the Albanians are more in trouble because there are less chances for employment and they all maintain one or two families in Albania. "Certainly, I must say that the German state has maintained a tolerant stance towards the Albanian refugees, and we are grateful for this. But, we as a state, we want this tolerance to continue," President Berisha said. To the question asking whether there was hesitation on the part of the police regarding the gathering of the Orthodox believers on the Easter day, Mr. Berisha responded: "I am amazed of the fact that they have asked permission from the police to organise the religious gathering. There is no need to ask permission from the police for religious ceremonies. There was a misunderstanding between an officer of the police and a representative of the church because the latter asked the guarantee of two processions. I think that this problem, which also became an intergovernmental problem, was very banal because the church's senior representative might very well address to the Foreign Ministry before the Greek Foreign Ministry interfered in the internal affairs of the Albanian state and the Albanian Autocephalous Church. Processions and religious ceremonies have never been prohibited in Albania. To my opinion, both the incident and the interference were totally unjustifiable," Mr. Berisha said. Responding to a question by reporter Jupe about early elections, President Berisha said that it is a permanent demand by honoured forces of the opposition. He said that early elections are held in the event of a crisis in the country. "But, can one speak of a crisis in a country which ensures the highest economic growth in Europe, and this is done not on the basis of the five year plans, but in freedom. Can one speak of a crisis in a country with the parliament having an extraordinary high efficiency in laws? Can one speak of crisis with 70 per cent of Albanians considering the governing of the country as right? Here we only have to do with a crisis of posts, but I cannot say that there will be early elections for a crisis of posts. Elections are held when the country needs them. Therefore, I say that 1996 will surely be the year of general elections in Albania," Mr. Berisha said. To the question regarding vouchers, the president responded that several patterns of their use in different countries are being studied and this will be completely a transparent procedure the parliament will decide upon or which will be discussed in a round table party talks. Mr. Berisha said that forgotten and unfavoured groups, that is former owners, the persecuted and unsheltered should be favoured, whereas the others will subject to the same chance. Asked about the extreme right, which is now appearing on the Albanian political scene, President Berisha said that personally he favours no extreme, either right or left. Regarding the non approval of the Right Party by the Justice Ministry, as this party demands the return of the landlords, President Berisha said that they cannot be an illegitimate movement for this fact only. He expressed his personal view that free voting will resolve their future. To a question about the Nano question, the president said that as regards this question one can refer to the Albanian justice. "There has been much clamour and politicisation about this question, but I tell those gentlemen who have raised that clamour that there is nothing political in it, it is a corruption affair, which is as much political for the Albanian former government members, who were involved in this affair, as it is for several Italian ministers under investigation, former Socialist Party and Christian Democratic Party leaders." Asked about the clamour raised to shatter the three party coalition, Mr. Berisha said that the coalition had been and remains a serious achievement of the democratic forces, that this coalition yielded its fruits with the March 22 victory, and that the coalition has produced extraordinary impressive results over the last two year governing. "One cannot be unsatisfied with the coalition or co- governing, at a time when inflation, which was 400 percent, has dropped to 30 percent within two years." Citing the achievements of this co-governing, Mr. Berisha said that Albania, the poorest country in Europe, is now leading the economic growth. Among other achievements he cited those in the sector of privatization, the granting of dwelling houses or their selling at symbolic prices. "But, are there problems? I am head of state and there may be many articles of the Albanian legislation, which I wished to be different, however I must say that there is a consensus everywhere. Hence, the law on education is drafted by a social-democrat, or a group headed by a social-democrat," said President Berisha regarding the three-party coalition. As regards the statement of the English minister, Hogg, that according to the British Government, Kosova is part of Serbia, and the prejudice to be made to this problem on the eve of the Geneva meeting, President Berisha said that "Minister Hogg expresses himself in favour of an autonomy like that of 1974. But I must say that it was not Britain that proclaimed the Republic of Kosova. I consider his visit to Kosova as a very important step. It has been one of the most significant events in the problem of crisis. President Rugova has welcomed the initiative of Minister Hogg as well as Belgrade's request for dialogue, in case they seriously comply with the procedure of solving the problem in the presence of a third party. No party has the right to refuse the third party, because alienation is great, something that cannot be denied. The third party both mediates and helps them. It would be very important that the coming Geneva meeting, alongside the Bosnia problem, also discusses and decides upon Kosova. Regarding the indifference and procrastination of the work by the local administration and especially by the tribunals, the president said that there is no doubt that consolidation and perfection of the state administration will be a constant preoccupation and he fully agreed that there is unjustifiable inactivity and procrastination. Regarding the performance in tribunals, Mr. Berisha expressed his belief that procedures are more delayed than in other countries. But, he said, it is important that efforts are being made that the judicial power be an independent system and most significant for a rule of law. Regarding the relations of the Albanian state with Italy, President Berisha said that they are relations with a clear perspective, because they are friendly relations. They are developing and will develop further. "Italy is a country which has rendered a great assistance to Albania during a very delicate period and, actually, it is the major investor in Albania. Cooperation with this developed country is of special interest for Albania," President Berisha said.
