No, I Do Not Think So"] [Excerpts] [Zelenayova] It is often said, in connection with the Slovak political scene, that the problem is not so much the differences between the programs of the political entities as the incompatibility between their leaders. You have managed to overcome this obstacle with regard to Peter Weiss. Do you think this is also possible with regard to Vladimir Meciar? [Carnogursky] I will begin with the past. I got to know Vladimir Meciar in 1990, when he was Slovak interior minister and I was federal deputy prime minister. We got on quite well, and some SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA readers may recollect that two or three weeks before his first recall, in April 1991, Meciar said in SMENA that, of all of the deputy prime ministers in his government at that time, he got on best with me. When he was recalled, I extended the benefits arising from his office twofold. He was given a state apartment on Fr. Kral Street in Bratislava. However, after his recall, Meciar started to call for a general strike and, at Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] meetings, he began to say that the Carnogursky family was enriching itself. In July 1992, Meciar sent us back into the past, and, even before this, in the fall of 1990, despite the coalition agreements with the then Public Against Violence [VPN] Movement, he forced our interior minister, Anton Andras, from the government. He persuaded the VPN to drive out the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] from the government and tried to govern as a minority. And so on and so on. The problem with Meciar is that he does not stick to agreements, and, therefore, it is impossible to reach a reliable agreement with him on anything. That is the difference between him and Peter Weiss. If Vladimir Meciar were capable of guaranteeing that he would stick to the agreements he makes with other people, of course, it would be possible, as you say, to overcome the obstacle with regard to him, too. I am afraid that, for personal reasons, Meciar is incapable of this. [Zelenayova] In politics, you can never say that something is impossible. [Carnogursky] I am not stating this categorically, after all; it is just highly probable. [Zelenayova] Part of Slovak society, at home and abroad, has grave reservations about you. You yourself, however, have been the cause of this--for example, by the statement: "I always put on the mask I need to put on," which can be interpreted in various ways. Your hesitation in issues concerning the independent Slovak state, the assessment of the recent past, and the approach to Andrej Hlinka is known. People abroad, in particular, or, rather, Slovaks abroad, find very hard to bear your assessment of the effect of the 250,000 Czechs in Slovakia after 1918 and your statement that "the fact that the Czechs had to leave Slovakia in the years 1938-39 is a black mark on Slovak history." They even consider this to be an indelible black mark on your character. Have you not contemplated leaving politics? [Carnogursky] You have taken the quotation about the masks out of context, but let us deal with the statement about the Czechs. I used it as a rejoinder to a televised address by former Czech Prime Minister Petr Pithart, who expressed his regret about the Czechoslovakism that had manifested itself during the First Republic. With regard to the evacuation of the Czechs in the years 1938-39, it would perhaps be possible to cite various extenuating circumstances, consisting, for example, of the fact that, following the birth of the Czechoslovak Republic, the Czechs filled posts in Slovakia that, in fact, morally, politically, and socially belonged to Slovaks. The problem is that they were evacuated at a time when their country was under the immediate threat of occupation by the German Army, so Slovakia should have demonstrated its solidarity with the Czech lands. [passage omitted] Quite simply, Slovakia should not have done this at a time when the Czech lands were being occupied by the German Army. We have to realize that an arrogant attitude toward our neighbors does not strengthen Slovakia's defensive capability and does not serve its interests; it simply harms us. [Zelenayova] Do you not even think it is necessary to defend ourselves against the arrogance of neighbors? [Carnogursky] Defend ourselves yes, but expressing regret about something that we have done, something that has caused pain to others, is always a virtue. [Zelenayova] I will return to my question. Have you not ever contemplated leaving politics? [Carnogursky] I have not. [Zelenayova] Judging by the public opinion polls and the envisaged preelection groupings of the left, the right, and the parties around the HZDS, what kind of development would you forecast after the elections? [Carnogursky] Four months before the elections, I can only say that an HZDS election victory, one that would bring the HZDS to power, would place Slovakia in the kind of isolation it would be difficult to get out of. [Zelenayova] Why do you think this? [Carnogursky] Because of the HZDS's incompetent past and present policy and Meciar's tainted reputation, especially abroad. [Zelenayova] Some correspondents depict the HZDS victory in 1992 as an apocalypse. However, the HZDS victory in 1992 heralded the nationalist orientation and led to the creation of the independent Slovak state. It could be said, then, that they are accusing the HZDS of breaking up the Federation. Do you also view the movement like this? [Carnogursky] The HZDS victory in 1992 merely signaled a change of course in the nationalist issue, the speeding up of certain development in the sense that Slovak independence was achieved outside the framework of European integration. There is a difference. [Zelenayova] Nevertheless, all of the European states that felt they had to become independent were established at this time. [Carnogursky] Yes, you are right, but they are also experiencing the appropriate difficulties, which would not have happened if they had broken away within the process of European integration. [passage omitted] [Zelenayova] The right has not yet reached an agreement on a joint course of action before the elections. The KDH is pushing its proposal for an open list of candidates. The Democratic Party [DS] and the Party of Entrepreneurs and Businessmen are, alternatively, pushing for an open coalition. Why is it unacceptable for the KDH to go into the elections along with the other nonleftist parties? [Carnogursky] You mean in the form of a coalition bloc? [Zelenayova] Yes. [Carnogursky] According to the election law, an election bloc means an increase in the percentage of votes required for entry into parliament; however, merging parties at the level of a bloc has, until now, always meant a reduction in the preferential percentage compared with the original situation. For example, according to the public opinion polls, the DS had 2 percent, although each of the parties that had merged within it had, on their own, 2 and more percent. This certainly concerns the Democratic Union [DU] and, according to the May public opinion polls, which were conducted by the radio and also canvassed support for the election blocs, all of them, with the exception of the left--that is, the so-called national bloc and the so-called right-wing bloc--had less support than the total support for the parties participating independently. Therefore, I think our offer is simply better and, finally, that the issue also involves the fact that Slovakia needs clearly crystallized parties. At the moment, this applies to only the Party of the Democratic Left and the KDH. [Zelenayova] Despite the fact that you are not a party? [Carnogursky] We call ourselves a movement, but we are in fact a party. We cannot help it if other parties and movements have not yet crystallized themselves into any clear, shall we say, liberal form. [passage omitted] [Zelenayova] A year ago, you said in reply to my question of why the KDH was seeking allies among the representatives of the Hungarian minority that you were holding talks with those with whom there are the most serious problems. We know, however, that, apart from ourselves, virtually no one in Europe admits that he has minority problems, although the minorities in Slovakia reap the benefit of above-standard rights. Do you not think that we ourselves are cultivating the minority problem and are doing so by our boundless accommodating attitude toward the Hungarian minority's political elite? [Carnogursky] I have already responded to the first part of your question--we profess the values of Christianity, nation, and Europe. Two of these fundamental values also unite us with the Hungarians. These two values, at least, act as a bridge between the KDH and Hungarian politicians. Minority problems in Europe have led and are leading to tension and even wars. As I see the situation in Slovakia, whether on the basis of studying history or from my knowledge of the present, Slovakia need not fear Hungarian assimilation as long as it manages to preserve its political independence. We have the forces to do this. We can negotiate with the Hungarians on everything else, and, of course, we can also meet them halfway on the principle of mutuality, with the status of the Slovak minority in Hungary. [Zelenayova] Or on reciprocity? [Carnogursky] We can also call it that. [passage omitted] [Zelenayova] The Sudeten German issue is important not only for the Czech Republic. It is an element of Europe's postwar arrangement, and opening it up may trigger a whole avalanche of problems. What is your view of this conflict? What do you think of it from the point of view of Slovak interests? [Carnogursky] Fortunately, this issue is not a serious Slovak problem. The Germans living in Slovakia are called Carpathian Germans, and they also have a separate association from the Sudeten Germans in Germany. It is also fortunate for Slovakia that, after the war, there was no violence against Germans on its territory. This happened only during the uprising and after the end of the war, when a group of Carpathian Germans was returning from Germany to Slovakia and a large number of them were murdered at the station in Prerov. (SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA has written about this tragedy--Editor.) This very much facilitates our current dialogue with the Germans and, in general, seeking and maintaining our place in Europe. I am digressing a little; for me, this is also proof of how it is desirable not to be arrogant toward minorities. In addition, the Germans in Slovakia have never formed a strong minority. Slovakia should not interfere in the dispute between the Czechs and the Sudeten Germans. I think that the Czechs are pursuing the wrong policy in that, at the moment, they are trying to disengage themselves from their eastern neighbors, from their eastern connection--from the Visegrad Four.
