The introduction of price reform measures has been proceeding in a basically smooth manner, but the increase in the general price level is still much higher than the target. State set prices have risen in a planned way; state-guided prices have risen slightly amid general stability; and market-regulated prices have risen rather substantially. In terms of the general trend, changes in the price level have a sector-based character. Final consumption has risen amid general stability; increases in prices for production materials have an obvious character of being caused by the adjustment of industrial structure and product structure, and are in line with the trend of market demands; and the continued large increases in prices for services and labor service have objective causes. The rate of increase in the general retail price level was high at the beginning of the year, and has risen recently, thereby demonstrating a trend to increase on a monthly basis. The Current Price Situation 1. Extensive price decontrol was carried out in 1992, and since the beginning of this year, plan-governed prices for things such as grain, coal, petroleum, and steel have been further decontrolled, while rates for railway freight transport have been raised. Under the State Council's unified plan, prices for most centrally distributed coal were decontrolled at the beginning of the year; prices for most steel and iron products have been decontrolled; on 1 April 30 million metric tons of plan-governed parity-priced crude oil was transferred to use for extraplan sales; the grain, chemical fertilizer, cotton, wood pulp, raw materials for detergent imported with centrally held foreign exchange under plans have changed into agent-set prices, with prices regulated by the market; prices for things such as natural gas, metal alloy products, cement, and communication exchange equipments have been decontrolled; and the fee standards for some centrally managed services have been decontrolled. Since 1 July, the per metric ton/km rate for railway freight transport has been 1.5 fen higher, representing an increase of approximately 40 percent. In the first half of the year, prices for a small number of commodities involving scarce resources and a small number of monopoly prices were adjusted. Prices for centrally distributed timber produced by state-owned forest zones were raised; burning and transport additions to the electricity price were increased; ceilings were imposed on prices for chemical fertilizer, farm-use pesticides, and farm-use films; protective minimum prices were used for grain ordered by the state and for grain to be stored for special purposes, and so on. After prices for grain were decontrolled in some regions last year, this year such provinces and autonomous regions as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Jilin, and Xinjiang and such cities as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Zhengzhou, and Kunming have also decontrolled grain prices. As marked by Beijing Municipality's decontrolling sales prices for grain on 10 May, the work of gradually decontrolling sales prices for grain nationwide, which had started in the second half of 1992, was completed. Under the influence of the state's price reform measures, governments of some regions have also further decontrolled tertiary industry prices, raised housing rents and fares for urban public transport, and raised or decontrolled prices for fuels for civilian use. After the adoption of those measures, the consumer goods market has experienced some partial fluctuations and there have been sporadic occurrences of panic buying, but there has been no large overall impact on market prices. 2. The increase in the general price level is rather substantial, and prices for production materials and rates for services have risen too rapidly; increases in market-regulated prices are an important factor shaping changes in the general price level. In the months of January-August of this year, the nationwide general index of retail prices rose by 8.5 percent, 8.7 percent, 9.1 percent, 10.9 percent, 12.5 percent, 13.9 percent, 14.9 percent, and 15.1 percent respectively over the same periods last year, constituting an average increase of 11.8 percent for the months of January-August; the rates of increase in retail prices in 35 large and medium cities were 12.5 percent, 12.6 percent, 14.2 percent, 13.9 percent, 16.5 percent, 19 percent, 20.8 percent, and 19.9 percent respectively. The nationwide rate of increase in employee cost-of-living prices was 13.4 percent for the same period. As compared with the same period last year, in January-August changes in prices for consumer goods, in terms of the average monthly situation, were basically normal, except for the 26.2 percent increase in grain prices, 11.3 percent increase in nonstaple food prices, 40 percent increase in fuel prices, and 29 percent increase in prices for building materials. Prices for industrial consumer goods were basically stable, with some increases and decreases. In this respect, apparel prices increased by 5 percent; prices for daily-use goods increased by 5.8 percent; and prices for entertainment goods and mechanical and electrical products declined by 1.8 percent. After May, because of the rise in the retail sales tax, prices for most industrial consumer goods increased. For a time the swap-market exchange rate was one dollar to 10.8 yuan, representing an increase of approximately 70 percent over the beginning of the year. Because of this development, prices for imported industrial consumer goods increased substantially, and the gold jewelry price increased by approximately 40 percent, reaching 140 yuan per gram. Prices for agricultural products have begun to rise again. Prices for some oils have increased while prices for some others are stable; the price of rice began rising in early April, but the price of wheat has remained weak. Prices for coarse cereals have risen rather substantially; in mid-July the price of corn was for a time higher than that of wheat on the grain wholesale market in Zhengzhou. Rates for paid services have continued to rise rapidly. As compared with the same period last year, the increase in January-August was 28.2 percent. Increases in 35 large and medium cities were even larger. Nanjing saw an increase of 92 percent in June. Prices for production materials have increased on a widespread basis. According to the results of the relevant agencies' monitoring of market prices for 37 major production materials in 35 large and medium cities, if January this year is considered the base period, the average rates of increase for the months of February-September were respectively 6.8 percent, 15 percent, 22.4 percent, 27.6 percent, 33.6 percent, 36.2 percent, 36 percent, and 35.6 percent and the monthly chain-increase rates were respectively 6.8 percent, 6.0 percent, 5.3 percent, 4.2 percent, 4.1 percent, 2.2 percent, -0.5 percent, and -1.1 percent. As compared with January, 11-20 July, when the highest rate of increase occurred, saw a 420 percent increase in the price of heavy oil, a 11 percent increase in the price of coal, a 120 percent increase in the price of pig iron, a 21 percent increase in the price of 10 mm steel plates, a 35 percent increase in the price of 1 mm cold-rolled steel sheets, a 34 percent increase in the price of cement, a 79 percent increase in the price of raw pine timber, increases of 3.6-5.8 percent in the prices of nonferrous metals, a 45 percent increase in the price of soda ash, a 8.5 percent increase in prices for raw materials for plastics, and a 13 percent increase in the price of gasoline. Since August, prices for most production materials have been getting stable. By the end of September the per metric ton producer price for some construction-use steel products had fallen by approximately 1,000 yuan, resulting in a price of around 3,000 yuan per ton and the February 1994 futures price of steels had fallen to 2,800 yuan per ton. Stocks of agricultural production materials have increased. Chemical fertilizer and farm-use films are selling slowly, but prices have not declined because of increases in prices for raw materials; some chemical fertilizer plants have begun to suspend production. The price of farm-use diesel fuel is high because it has been difficult to deliver plan-governed supplies. In January-August, nationwide prices for agricultural production materials were up by 13.5 percent over the same period last year. The rates of increase in the regional general price levels have been gradually getting closer to one another, and the differences in the rate of increase between the urban and rural areas and between the coastal and hinterland regions caused by the differences in the time of price reform are being reduced. For January-August the general retail price levels for the urban and rural areas nationwide rose by 14.5 percent and 12.7 percent respectively, with the increase for the urban areas being slightly larger than for the rural areas. This year the general retail price level has risen substantially, and the main reason is that there have been substantial cost-push increases in market-regulated prices. According to estimates, the general retail price level has risen by 11.8 percent. In this respect, state-set prices rose by approximately 19 percent; state-guided prices rose by approximately 1.5 percent; and market-regulated prices rose by approximately 11 percent. The impact of increases in market-regulated prices on prices is approximately 3 percentage points greater than envisioned in the plans made at the beginning of the year. [passage omitted]
