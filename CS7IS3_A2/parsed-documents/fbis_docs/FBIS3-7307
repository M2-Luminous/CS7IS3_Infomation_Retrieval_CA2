"If the (opposition) Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) persistently refuses to open (Diet) deliberations, there would be only two options -- whether only the ruling parties deliberate as an extraordinary measure or Hosokawa takes responsibility (for the delay)," Makoto Tanabe said in an address in Tokyo. The LDP has refused for more than two weeks to start deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget, already two months behind schedule, until Hosokawa gives a full accounting of a 100 million yen loan he received from the scandal-ridden Sagawa Kyubin trucking business group. In past Diet sessions, Hosokawa has repeatedly said he took the loan to help finance repairs on his residence in Kumamoto Prefecture and later repaid it to Sagawa Kyubin's network of trucking and parcel-delivery companies. Tanabe also said Hosokawa should not dissolve the House of Representatives. He said he should not call an election under the current system. The Diet recently passed a package on changing the election system, but the bills have not yet taken effect.
