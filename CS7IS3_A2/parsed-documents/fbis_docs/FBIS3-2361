This stationary-orbit meteorological satellite, developed by the Chinese Research Institute of Space Technology, will be used primarily to collect information for the preparation of visible-light and infrared-light cloud charts and water distribution maps; to collect and transmit observation data compiled by meteorological, maritime, and hydrological departments; to disseminate extended digital cloud charts, low-resolution cloud charts, and weather maps for use by ground stations at home and abroad; and to provide observation data for use in satellite engineering and space environmental science research. Compared to the two "Fengyun-1" satellites launched in 1988 and 1990, the new-generation meteorological satellite "Fengyun-2" reportedly represents a breakthrough in terms of technical performance, scope of application, and service life. The satellite employs a number of advanced technologies, such as scanning radiometry, slender-body control technology, and apogee engine separation, marking the first time such technologies have been used domestically, and signalling a new stage in our country's space technology.
