This is part of the water diversion project to quench the thirst of industries and agriculture in this water short province. According to the decision by the State Council, pending the water diversion project from Chang Jiang, an estimated 500 million cubic meters of Yellow River water would be diverted to Hebei for the next 15 years. To date, the project has progressed smoothly. More than 100 million cu m of water have been diverted from the Yellow River into the cities of Cangzhou and Hengshui on the vast "North China" plain. The water diversion project was proposed jointly by the Ministry of Water Resources of China and the provincial governments of Hebei and Shandong. Seriously suffering from water shortages, most of the farmland on the plain averages an output of only slightly more than 1,500 kg of wheat per ha. Moreover, the over-exploitation of groundwater resources has lowered the water quality and has seriously hindered the development of both industry and agriculture. Ye Liansong, governor of hebei, pointed out that the water diversion project from the Yellow River to Hebei could yet not solve the problem thoroughly, as the rate of flow of the Yellow River has decreased year-by-year. He said that the only way to supply enough water for arid Hebei is to divert water from the lower reaches of the Chang Jiang River.
