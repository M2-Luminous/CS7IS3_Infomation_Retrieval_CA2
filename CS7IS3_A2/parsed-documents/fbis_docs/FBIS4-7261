From all accounts, the aging political leader caught Paul Keating in full flight when they met on Tuesday in Ho Chi Minh city. As many a Canberra minister and bureaucrat knows, Keating fired up, arguing about an issue he has strong views about, is an awesomely persuasive and believable figure. With Do Muoi, it was Keating's fast-developing ideas about the future of the West Pacific region which made the Prime Minister passionate. There is a veneer of poverty and deprivation in Vietnam caused by decades of war. But Vietnamese society is highly intellectual and sophisticated, and as one Australian official observed, you don't get to be General-Secretary of the ruling party in Vietnam without having considerable intelligence. You also don't get to be party leader in a one-party State that has been through the cathartic experiences of Vietnam, without substantial political steel and authority. Keating can be a diffident and socially awkward person, but engages quickly with anyone who brings power and intellect to their arguments and it was this meeting of minds which caused seasoned foreign affairs officials from both sides - to claim they had never seen anything like it. According to witnesses, Do Muoi soon realised he was dealing with a very unorthodox political leader and, dropping the usual protocol-driven rules which suffocate so many government-to-government meetings in Asia, engaged Keating in a blunt and frank 90-minute discussion. From all accounts it was an extraordinary meeting -- the young assertive Western leader of a multi-party developed capitalist State, describing a contemporary economic and strategic vision for the region; the 77-year-old communist chief sharing the wisdom and lessons of decades of political struggle and war. The meeting was extended as Do Muoi and Keating spoke on topics as diverse as the need to reform the United Nations, the necessity for a strong US presence in the region to placate historical tensions, Cambodia, APEC and the advantages of privatised infrastructure development. Despite his anger with the media over his self-inflicted brewing domestic controversy surrounding the acknowledgement of Australia's war effort in Vietnam, Keating was elated with the meeting and the genuine understandings that emerged. In the past 12 months Keating has met all the major Asian region leaders at least once -- and in several cases a number of times - as part of what is undoubtedly now his major policy and intellectual obsession: Australia's engagement with Asia. Adopting the highly personal style that worked so successfully with Do Muoi, Keating has embarked on a mission to develop a series of significant diplomatic relationships with the influential leaders of the region. In Bangkok he had a not-dissimilar meeting with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and several key Thai ministers, with Chuan inviting Keating to talk to him whenever he wanted to raise any issues. Thailand and Vietnam are the two most influential countries in Indochina and Keating gave an insight to his thinking and regional policy strategy when on Tuesday he said he wanted to emulate with them the type of relationship he had been able to develop with Indonesia over the past two years. Keating's successful personal courting of Indonesia's President Suharto -- together with the strong links foreign ministers Gareth Evans and Ali Alatas have developed -- has changed the entire atmospherics of Australia's previously fractious relationship with the archipelago. Early on, Keating recognised the political and strategic weight of Indonesia in the region and consciously sought to build a strong personal relationship with Suharto, even using a meeting with US President Bill Clinton to impress on Clinton Suharto's influence. Similarly he sees Thailand and Vietnam as the two other key major players in Southeast Asia and with his unique, high-energy diplomatic style, he used his trips to the region to focus on the key leaders in both countries -- which, unlike Indonesia, are not concentrated on one man. While issues such as Mabo, the republic and the long-term unemployed remain of strong interest, it is clear that building a complex and highly integrated relationship with the Western Pacific region to ensure Australia's rightful place in the region is now Keating's major intellectual obsession. And just as he made economic reform Canberra's preoccupation of the 1980s, Keating is making the development of economic and strategic links with Asia the government's major focus of the l990s. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke also sought to build personal relationships --but they were mostly with the US and China -- especially understandable in a decade where superpower rivalry still permeated foreign policy thinking. And while Keating is bringing enormous attention to the region, it was Hawke who laid the groundwork through his interest in China and initiation of APEC and the Garnaut report on North-East Asia. But Keating's huge policy strength is his ability to place issues in a co-ordinated framework. It is why neo-classical economics appealed to him so much and it is why he is now so preoccupied by the challenge of foreign policy -- integrating the often contradictory political, economic, strategic and social elements into a cohesive strategy for the region. And just as he was self-taught in economics, Keating is using his intense focus on the region to build from the ground up his understanding of the area and its often complex histories and rivalries. Less than a year ago when visiting Korea, he was almost surprised to be getting questions on strategic issues and his response reflected his lack of exposure to these concerns. Ten months later and Keating was this week lecturing the Vietnamese on why the challenge was to keep the US economically engaged in the region so as to keep its strategic focus on -- and with it, stability in -- the Western Pacific zone. The key element of Keating's new regionalism is the development of a broadbased relationship with the region as possible through strong personal links with the leaders, backed by ministerial councils and visits and highly active diplomatic support. It is unashamedly targeted at building Australia's trade and investment prospects, with the main targets those countries considered to have the most medium-to long-term economic upside such as Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia where growth is likely to be strongest. This also reflects a strategic view that these countries, via their population size and profile, are likely to be the significant military powers. At the same time more aid money is being used to profile Australian proficiency and to give better leverage on human rights, such as was the case in Vietnam. But while human rights abuses and labour infringements are complained about, they are pushed as part of a broader package of what the diplomats call "constructive engagement"-- which avoids the difficulties the US is facing now over the granting of trade concessions in return for improvements in human rights. Nor does Keating allow himself to get fussed if he is dealing with a one-party autocracy -- "you deal with them as they come," he said during his Indo-China visit. This pragmatism and balance gives the policy a robustness which to date appears to be doing the trick. Fortunately Keating is blessed with a foreign policy bureaucracy that as long ago as when Bill Hayden was Foreign Minister decided to cross the line and support Vietnam and has built an enviable reputation for activism and professionalism in the region. However, Keating's style is not to adopt the official brief as if he is a lawyer for the bureaucratic establishment. When discussing issues with officials ahead of events on the most recent trip, he constantly asked questions, testing his hypothesis in a socratic style of analysis. Which means that the final position is intimately Keating's, a position which one senior official this week described as having "deep roots". It is this intensity of his purpose and the passion of Keating's mission to build Australia into the commercial and political forums and structures of the region, which makes it plain silly to characterise his "new regionalism" as just another leader getting his kicks from playing international statesman. Indeed, the aim is to develop a situation whereby so familiar are the relations at both leader, ministerial and official level that visits can be classed as working visits, with far less formality, such as occurred with Suharto when Keating returned from CHOGM [Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting] in spring last year. All he has to do is keep his ever-acerbic tongue under control.
