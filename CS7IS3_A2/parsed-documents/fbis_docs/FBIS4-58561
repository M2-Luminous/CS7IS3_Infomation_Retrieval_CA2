He added: But in essence, the agreement is considered to be positive. For the first time since the signing of the Washington agreement last September, a timetable has been agreed for implementation. The agreement also allows the emergence of limited authority in the Palestinian areas. In a telephone interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from Tunis, Nawfal summed up the points in the agreement as follows: "In addition to the timetable, the most important achievement was the participation of international forces from six states which are providing aid, for the first time linking Gaza and Jericho with Hebron. The agreement also met Israel's maximum security demands and maximum Palestinian economic demands, in addition to a reasonable level of national sovereignty symbols such as travel documents, an international dialing code, and an independent postal system and stamps." Sources in Amman and Tunis say that the timetable for the entry of the Palestinian police forces into the areas of limited autonomy is as follows: "An advance Palestinian exploration and initial arrangements unit consisting of 22-28 Palestinian officers will set up a liaison office with Israeli officers to make preparations to receive the first police force units next Thursday or Friday. It will be followed three days later by a force consisting of 100 officers and policemen. On 22 May, the date set for the completion of the two-week Israeli withdrawal, a force consisting of 6,000 policemen and their families will begin to arrive in Gaza and Jericho, to be followed one week later by 1,000 policemen and their families in addition to 400 technicians and administrative officials to make the necessary arrangements for receiving the Palestian leadership headed by Yasir 'Arafat, who will return as PLO chairman and not in any other capacity, according to the agreement." As regards prisoners and detainees, the agreement stipulates that "1,000 Palestinian detainees will be released the day the agreement is signed, 4 May, and 500 detainees a day later. After the completion of the withdrawal of the Israeli Army, 2,000 prisoners serving long sentences, from all Palestinian organizations, will be released. More negotiations will begin 13 July for the gradual release of the remaining detainees, starting with the release of 2,000 detainees. [no closing quotation mark] According to Palestinian sources, the agreement stipulates that the detainees who belong to Palestinian opposition factions should give a written undertaking not to carry out "military" operations against the settlements or inside Israel, and to support the new Palestinian authority and respect the laws within its boundaries. On the economic front, the Palestinian sources said that the most important Israeli concession was exemption from tax and customs duties for the list of commodities submitted by the Palestinians and linked to the infrastructure. That list is subject to the requirements and assessments of the Palestinian authority on a free import basis. Another point is related to Palestinian employment and regulations organizing that inside Israel. The agreement stipulates that the Palestinian authority will supervise the employment regulations in agreement with the Israeli Government. Another point is the acceptance of the shekel as a main currency, not the official currency, in circulation in the autonomy area. As regards the area identified as the gray area in the agreement maps, namely the al-Mawasi agricultural area on the Gaza coast, it has been reduced from the 57 square kilometers requested by the Israelis to 36 square kilometers. The two sides agreed on a compromise solution on the question of "judicial jurisdiction." It was agreed that Israelis and foreign tourists who commit violations in the security area adjacent to the Israeli settlements would be tried in Israeli courts, and that the Palestinian judicial authorities would be kept informed of the investigations; whereas Israelis and tourists who commit violations in the autonomy region would be tried by Palestinian courts. As regards the disputed issues which have been referred to the 4 May meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 'Arafat in Cairo, they are related to the Israeli crossing points on the King Husayn Bridge, Palestinian currency, and territorial waters. Negotiations between the two sides will continue in Cairo until the day after tomorrow, when a preparatory meeting will be held between Rabin and 'Arafat to pave the way for the signing the following day, in the hope that the obstacles and disputed details will have been resolved by then. The Palestinian sources added that the agreement, which runs to 85 pages, also stipulates that the Palestine National Council will hold an emergency meeting in the limited autonomy region in which the Palestinian national charter will be openly revoked.
