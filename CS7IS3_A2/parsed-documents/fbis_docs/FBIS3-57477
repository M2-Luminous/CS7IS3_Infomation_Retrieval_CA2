"Its agenda was so crammed that the foreign ministers of the two countries had to prolong the talk for almost one hour," said Galina Sidorova, political adviser of the Russian foreign minister. The ministers stressed that "a progressive and constant exchange of views and visits at summit and high levels would be continued between the two countries. A visit of PRC chairman Jiang Zemin to Moscow is being planned. It will apparently take place in the third quarter of the year. In preparation for a new Russo-Chinese summit, Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin will visit Beijing and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will pay a visit to Moscow. In the course of the negotiations, Sidorova noted, the sides have discussed various aspects of economic and military-technical cooperation between the two countries. Kozyrev stressed Russia's readiness to go over to large-scale ventures while simultaneously continuing the policy of expanding traditional forms of economic relations. For instance, Russia is expected to take part in the construction of the huge "three gorges" hydropower complex in China. The sides also discussed the possibility of Russia helping China to reconstruct many enterprises, which were built with Soviet aid. The ministers noted the progress made during the talks on the mutual reduction of armed forces and confidence-building measures on the border between the two countries. These talks will be continued to try to conclude a corresponding agreement already this year, Sidorova said. The sides announced their readiness to continue negotiations on border problems. The joint delegation of Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to these talks will be led by Aleksandr Panov, the new Russian deputy foreign minister. During the discussion of problems linked with the demarcation of the border between the two countries, the ministers pointed to the possibility of joint economic activity in the border districts, including the disputed areas. The sides want a status quo to be observed on the border after its demarcation. Mutual interest in developing constructive cooperation in the military-technical sphere was expressed in the course of the talks. Kozyrev said that it should be promoted with due account of mutual interests and the observance of corresponding international commitments. Sidorova noted that the idea of promoting constructive partnership with China, expressed by the Russian minister, "Does not mean that we are allies with China in the direct sense of the term. It implies Moscow's readiness to promote very close interaction with Beijing in matters of mutual concern". Moreover, Russia and China, as two great powers, proceed from the understanding that they have both national and huge common interests of regional and global character. In reply to a request of his Chinese counterpart, Kozyrev shared his view with him on the current political situation in Russia, laying stress on the immutability of its foreign policy which "remains presidential".
