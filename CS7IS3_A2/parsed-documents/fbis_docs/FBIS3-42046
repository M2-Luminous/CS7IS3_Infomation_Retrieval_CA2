The North Korean nuclear problem is not only the most sensitive issue related to Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) but the most delicate issue politically also, the French daily LIBERATION quoted him as saying. If IAEA inspection is always blocked, like in North Korea, the problem is very serious, he said. North Korea allowed the IAEA to inspect its seven declared nuclear facilities in January last year for the last time before it announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in March. The IAEA is demanding from North Korea the same inspections of its seven declared nuclear facilities as conducted last year, and is discussing inspection of two additional nuclear facilities. The IAEA is also demanding periodic inspections, Blix said. It is certain that North Korea did not declare some plutonium although it declared that nuclear facilities in Yongbyon produced a minimal amount of plutonium, he said. Inspections of the two undeclared nuclear facilities are to confirm if they produced plutonium, but the IAEA is still not sure if it can find how much plutonium was produced from the North Korean nuclear sites. On the question of whether the IAEA can guarantee that North Korea is not pushing ahead with military nuclear programs after the inspection conditions are met, he said that there are always uncertainties. Even if the IAEA does inspect the nuclear reactors in Yongbyon, it cannot rule out the existence of secret nuclear facilities, he said. He said that the monitoring equipment in North Korean nuclear facilities has not been operating for several months because film and batteries ran out and did not rule out the possibility that North Korea extracted nuclear material from the reactors. North Korea has not allowed the IAEA inspection team to exchange films and batteries of the monitoring equipment since last August.
