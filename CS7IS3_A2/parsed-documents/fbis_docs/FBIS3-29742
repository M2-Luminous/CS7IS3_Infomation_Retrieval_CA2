However, during the final phase of the negotiations, there were three chances for reaching an agreement. The United States once showed its intention to give up the demand for Japan's commitment on numerical targets for market liberalization. Also, the nation expressed great expectations for Japan's tax cut policy pledged by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. While the talks have failed due to mutual misunderstanding and distrust resulting from a lack of communications, a review of these points may provide some clue for "reconciliation" in the future. First Chance -- Compromise Plan Shown by U.S.; Dispatch of Special Envoy Went Wrong Commenting on one of the reasons for the breakup of the framework talks and the Washington summit, a White House official said: "The bilateral discord at the final stage of the negotiations started when special envoy Kiuchi visited Washington." According to U.S. officials, Kiuchi met with U.S. President Bill Clinton to pave the way for Foreign Minister Hata's U.S. visit on 9 February. However, he "just conveyed the prime minister's desire for settling the negotiations without any proposals." In explaining this, Japanese officials said "the prime minister's purpose was to sound out the true intention of the United States." But the envoy could not do so because U.S. officials were displeased with the lack of new proposals. Sudden Proposal from U.S. On the afternoon of 8 February, or immediately after the envoy's visit, U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor conveyed his decision to discontinue vice ministerial and working-level framework negotiations in Washington. His high-handed attitude intensified the sense of distrust among Japanese negotiators, and this became an obstacle to mutual concessions. The U.S. negotiators had a wrong impression, too. When Foreign Minister Hata told U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale that he wants to "sincerely settle" the negotiations, the United States had too much expectation for "Japan's new proposals on tax cut and numerical target." In fact, Deputy Assistant to the U.S. President Bowman Cutter (of the National Economic Council) showed a concession plan on the objective criteria issue to Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura. According to him, the United States was ready to make concessions on the following points: 1) it will be acceptable if the criteria for government procurement can measure the trend of import growth of the past; 2) no objective criteria is necessary on the insurance negotiation; and 3) it will be acceptable if criteria for assessing auto parts imports can measure the trend of import growth of the past. He also proposed an extension of the framework talks by a month. The proposals made at the initiative of the White House looked acceptable to Japan. However, Japanese negotiators could not accept the offer since they did not believe it, which was too far from the USTR's position. The first round of the Hata-Kantor negotiations started on the morning of 10 February, but U.S. negotiators were disappointed that he had no proposal to break the deadlock over the bilateral talks. Following this, President Clinton had a meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC), and declared "no empty agreement is needed." After this, the USTR's Office became even more difficult to deal with. Second Chance -- No Commitment on Tax Cut Yet, the tough attitude of USTR Kantor was not very obvious when Hata met him on the evening of 10 February. U.S. officials said, at that time, the United States was still thinking of a concession on the objective criteria issue if Japan shows a clear decision on an income tax cut. However, the United States could not show its concession plan since Hata did not say "the tax cut will be continued after 1994" in meetings with Vice President Al Gore and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Japan thus missed its second chance. Hata and Kantor met again at 0100 local time on 11 February, and the USTR's Office finally showed its own opinion. U.S. negotiators again demanded "future-oriented" criteria, and it was impossible for Japan to accept it. The ministerial talks broke down when Foreign Minister Hata finally decided to reject the U.S. demand. Last Chance -- Hosokawa Did Not Clarify Commitments The last chance was the Hosokawa-Clinton talks on 11 February. White House officials let the President bring "concession plans on the objective criteria issue and on extension of the talks" in expectation for "Hosokawa's definite pledge on the tax cut and objective criteria issues." Yet, Hosokawa made no commitments during the summit talks. While Clinton did not pick on Hosokawa in consideration for "the prime minister's efforts on the tax cut issue," he had to get rid of the U.S. concession plan. After the talks, a senior White House official said "the President was somewhat disappointed with what the prime minister said." Taking this into account, it is obvious that the breakdown of the bilateral talks was because both Japan and the United States could not catch signs for concessions because of lack of mutual understanding. Due to bureaucratic sectionalism [nawabari ishiki] in both Japan and the United States, officials of different ministries and agencies placed different importance on the issues of tax reduction and the objective criteria. Because of this, they failed to realize points at issue during discussions. It appears the failure in the bilateral talks indicates the need for overcoming bureaucratic barriers to settle negotiations both on micro and macroeconomic issues.
