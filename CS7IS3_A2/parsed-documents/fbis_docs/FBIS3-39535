"There is absolutely no change in our position. We will hold no official talks with the observer, as we believe that the EU's involvement in the Cyprus problem is uncalled-for and completely counterproductive," Foreign Ministry acting spokesman Ferhat Ataman told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS. Ataman's denial of any change in the Turkish position followed the arrival of Serge Abou, the EU-appointed observer to Ankara in the delegation of Leon Brittan, the EU Commission, came as part of the delegation and not as an observer. "His duty as observer has not yet started," diplomatic sources said. "Ankara has made it clear that the observer would not be welcome in Turkey." The European Union, giving in to Greece's insistence on the appointment of an observer, has tried to appease Turkey by appointing a "middle-ranking Eurocrat" rather than a "star" like Leo Tindemans, the former Belgian foreign minister. Then the Union announced that the "observer" would only report developments and progress on the Cyprus question, rather than take part in the negotiations. But these moves failed to calm Ankara which firmly believes that Greece, a direct party to the conflict, would at the same time become "the prosecutor, the judge and the accused" if the EU became involved in the conflict. Ankara's dilemma, however, lay in the fact that Serge Abou, handpicked by the Commission with the hope of appeasing Turkey, is decidedly pro-Turkish and regarded in Ankara as "a friend and ally." Given these facts, it would have been awkward for Ankara to reject the EU's "subtle diplomacy" of bringing in "Abou as part of the delegation, particularly when he did not use the title of `Cyprus observer.'" "(But) the identity and the inclinations of the observer are irrelevant. We reject the principle of the decision," a Turkish official said. The same official stressed that Abou had come as part of the customs union delegation, rather than with the title of EU observer, and that his duty had not officially started yet. But the question of Cyprus was discussed during the official talks. "I am pleased to note that Turkey supports the confidence-building measures," Brittan announced in a joint press conference with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin.
