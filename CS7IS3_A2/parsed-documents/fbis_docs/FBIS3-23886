And 4 months after the October events in Moscow he continues to believe that "you cannot build a just society on an unjust action." What is the basis of the obstinacy of the republic, which did not hold a referendum on the draft Russian Constitution on 12 December? Is it remoteness from Moscow or the natural obstinacy of the Khakass Shtygashev (on principle he refused to participate in the elections to the RF Federal Assembly)? [Pachegina] Vladimir Nikolayevich, your name, along with the name of the president of Kalmykiya, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, has been among those which are considered untrustworthy for some time. Do you somehow sense a special attitude on Moscow's part toward the republic and toward you in particular? [Shtygashev] Do you know the nasty way all this is being handled now? In medieval times the battle was a forthright one, but today the tactics have changed; aloud they say that yes, the republic must be supported, but when credits are distributed and in tax policy, in particular deductions into the federal budget, it turns out that the people are being "punished." We are opposing the discriminatory measures to the extent we can by adopting decisions that contradict them in our government, but the "law of the telephone" remains an all-powerful means for influencing the unruly. Blackmail is used. Soon after the October events, a representative of the supreme power visited the republic and made us understand that the republic could only benefit from showing loyalty, although we understand very well that we will not be given anything more than is proper. I feel uncomfortable in Moscow; although I do not hear any direct attacks against me, I sense the hostility with every cell of my body. There are now two feelings fighting within me: on the one hand to leave and abandon everything so that at least in my republic there is no antipathy toward me, and on the other, I always remember that there is nowhere for me to go from here, I will be buried in this land. Can I leave the people at this time? [Pachegina] I suspect that your impressions as an eyewitness of the October Moscow events were unlikely to have been solicited. [Shtygashev] Yes, I would like to share them. Even now I consider Ruslan Khasbulatov a great patriot of Russia. Especially since the president and Chernomyrdin are now saying that Khasbulatov fought for 2 years. Now they are even assuring Clinton that they intend to build a socially oriented economy. But back then, Khasbulatov, not any kind of prophet but simply knowing the sentiments of the country's people well, expressed their interests. It is painful for me to remember October. Even now I insist that the future cannot be built on an unjust action. And the edict and all the events which followed it, including the elections to the Council of the Federation, are all illegal and unconstitutional. And let them prove to me that the revolution being conducted by Yeltsin is justified and that the reforms are unrealizable without these upheavals. I have made up my mind, but people, well they are different, and each one has to make up his mind for himself. At the meeting of the Council of the Federation, I asked Ilyumzhinov: so you are going to vote for Shumeyko? And he gestured helplessly and said: they promised to reconstruct the airport in Elista. That's your answer. [Pachegina] Vladimir Nikolayevich, how did it come to be that you were on the side of the defenders of the White House but ended up outside its walls? [Shtygashev] I had already left for the Siberian conference, and when I returned to Moscow the "assault" was underway. But on the 4th [October] I was a witness to the disgraceful vote in the government. Even now I am ashamed to remember it. Chernomyrdin proposed to all the representatives of the republics to adopt some kind of resolution on the "communist-fascist forces which had ensconced themselves in the White House" there. Forty people raised their hands. Chernomyrdin asked, anyone opposed perhaps? I was the first to stand up. About 40 people supported me. The others sat there and put their heads in their hands, and some closed their eyes. Perhaps they were ashamed or perhaps they were cowards. It was a nightmare. I became a parliamentarian that way. At the Constitutional Court, 60-70 people gathered in Zorkin's office. Some little priest from Aleksiy ran in. I said to him: Are you going with us to stop the blood? He said: Yes, yes, of course. I removed the small white silk blind from the window of the Constitutional Court. Only eight of these representatives of the republics went. Ilyumzhinov's Lincoln and a Volvo started to the White House. All the cordons, including the third one, under the bridge, galloped by, and our motorcade was at a firing position. There was filthy language--I never heard such a thing. We were ordered, the soldiers told us, to maintain heavy fire, and you, get over there, to the wall. [Pachegina] Excuse me, but was there return fire from the White House? [Shtygashev] There was no return fire, everything was quiet from that side. Listen further. The commandant of this sector allowed Aushev and Ilyumzhinov into the White House. After holding me at gunpoint for 20 minutes, they allowed me to go to the foot of a stairway where a field hospital had been set up. I managed to get close to our cars. Then Aushev and Ilyumzhinov came out of the White House with a white flag. And at that moment OMON [Special Militia Detachment] withdrew its cordon and the whole crowd of 300 people raced toward us. They fired pistols point-blank and tried to tip over the cars. Ilyumzhinov was still arguing when the guard took him and literally threw him into the car. The Kalmyk fellows threw Aushev and me in there too at one stroke. People were firing at us and throwing rails and stones. We finally escaped. The Lincoln, of course, is a powerful car and held out. [Pachegina] Vladimir Nikolayevich, the government which adopted that resolution remains almost the same. [Shtygashev] I consider myself a member of the Russian intelligentsia, and I cannot reconcile myself to the idea that not one of them refused to participate in the shameful business and not one of them repented. [Pachegina] Apparently, then, you do not believe in the viability of the Council of the Federation or the State Duma? [Shtygashev] There is an auction going on in the Council of the Federation. I do not think that such methods can be used to achieve consensus. Although I believe that the Council of the Federation can play a positive role in pacifying the country. But in the State Duma the viewpoints of politicians who have assembled there are in such opposition that counting on consensus is altogether naive. The only thing that can save us is a unified surge of emotion in the name of Russia, but once again the make-up of these organs eliminates any illusions. [Pachegina] Well, is there anyone in Moscow to whom you would entrust the helm of the Russian state? [Shtygashev] The only person is perhaps Yuriy Skokov. A statesman. And absolutely decent. [Pachegina] Vladimir Nikolayevich, your obstinacy did not come out of nowhere. You must have very strong support to allow yourself to dare to oppose Moscow. [Shtygashev] You know, without false modesty I can say that if I ran for the Federal Assembly of Russia, I think I would do well. I am doing everything that I can in my post, and I am not ashamed to look into the eyes of the people of Khakassiya. Moreover, I really do have strong support, as you said. The republic is sixth in the Federation in terms of production of output. We are fully self-supporting in agricultural products. So the economic slump has had a very negligible effect on the republic. Fortunately, we do not have interethnic conflicts. Our indicators on privatization of enterprises and the housing fund are almost the highest in the country, although I am called a conservative.
