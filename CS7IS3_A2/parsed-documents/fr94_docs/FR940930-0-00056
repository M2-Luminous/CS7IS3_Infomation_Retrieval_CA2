FR940930-0-00056 FR940930-0-00009 VIII. Environmental Impact The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. IX. Economic Impact FDA has examined the impacts of the interim rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The agency believes that this interim rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the interim rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact of a rule on small entities. Because a request for an alternative requirement is a voluntary action by the applicant and the amended definitions limit the current applicability of these requirements, the agency certifies that the interim rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required. X.

Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act, and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, 21 CFR part 900 is amended as follows: PART 900_MAMMOGRAPHY 1.

Diagnostic mammography is also called problem-solving mammography or consultative mammography. This definition excludes mammography performed during invasive interventions for localization or biopsy procedures. The definition further excludes mammography performed as part of a scientific study to evaluate an experimental mammography device conducted in accordance with FDA's investigational device exemption regulations in part 812 of this chapter. (s) Screening mammography means mammography performed on an asymptomatic patient to detect the presence of breast cancer at an early stage. This definition excludes mammography performed as part of a scientific study to evaluate an experimental mammography device conducted in accordance with FDA's investigational device exemption regulations in part 812 of this chapter. 3.
