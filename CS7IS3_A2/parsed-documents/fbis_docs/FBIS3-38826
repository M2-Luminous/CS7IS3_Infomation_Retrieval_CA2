However, the Bosnian Serbs have not been given an ultimatum. After last Saturday's [5 February] shelling of Sarajevo's market place and the death of 68 people, the European Union has unanimously threatened the Serbs although the action taken by the 12 Community countries will have to be expressed in concrete terms by the 16 NATO members due to meet this week. Over to our correspondent in Brussels, Nacho Hernandez. [Hernandez] Good evening. The European Union has set an aim: The siege of the Bosnian capital has to be lifted immediately. First Sarajevo. NATO's council has been urgently convened. It has to study the military aspects of this operation, as requested by the UN secretary general. The press release says that the necessary measures will be taken to lift the siege, including air strikes in close coordination with the UN secretary general. In short, this is a threat of the European Union directed at the Serbs, a threat due to be spelled out over the next few hours by NATO, as Foreign Minister Javier Solana underlined. [Begin Solana recording] Today it is a political document. After the Atlantic alliance meeting there will be a more specific decision, and later it will be submitted to the UN secretary general who has the ultimate responsibility for setting the mechanism in motion. [end recording] [Hernandez] Despite this declaration there are still countries among the 12 who are against using force, such as Greece. Now it is up to the alliance to study the plans and then it will be UN secretary general Butrus-Ghali, who will take the decision to start the bombardments in order to end the siege of Sarajevo.
