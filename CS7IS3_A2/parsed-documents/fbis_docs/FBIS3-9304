The parliament adopted the draft resolution on submitting the accession application with 233 votes in favor, zero votes against, and three abstentions. It is possible that Hungary will submit its application to join the European Union as early as next Thursday, and Poland will probably do this at the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Ministry's state secretary said. Janos Martonyi was speaking to the MTI correspondent in Warsaw. He said that the main objective of his visit to Poland was to coordinate policy on European integration. The state secretary observed that like the Hungarians, Polish foreign policy regards cooperation between the Visegrad countries to be important.
