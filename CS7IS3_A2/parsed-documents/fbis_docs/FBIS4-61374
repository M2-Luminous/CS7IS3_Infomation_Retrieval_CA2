You will understand if you saw it. There are several factors, which explain the Karabakh phenomenon. First, is that we know what are we struggling for. We have no space to retreat, we haven't got another land. Every citizen of Karabakh understands he will have no home and no family tomorrow, if he be pusillanimous. And we are withstanding Azeris, who are forcefully brought to the front from Baku, Sumgait, Kirovabad. Personally, they do not need Karabakh at all, and thus they are looking for a convenient moment to desert. Therefore, you shouldn't ascribe our success to the support of Armenia. -- [PRAVDA] Where do you get the weaponry from? -- [Gukasyan] We are very thankful to Azerbaijan for a "regular supply" of weaponry. 80 percent of arms we use are trophies. We buy the rest. I won't specify where and who from do we buy it though. -- [PRAVDA] Arkadiy, the officials in Moscow accept you, though the RMK is not officially recognized by Russia... -- [Gukasyan] Let me avoid this question. If I tell you why they accept me, they will stop doing so. -- [PRAVDA] Direct Azeri-Karabakh negotiations have started in Moscow last autumn. What happened to this? -- [Gukasyan] Yes, I have had dialogues with the Deputy Chairman of the Azeri Supreme Council A. Dzhalilov. Unfortunately, direct negotiations stopped, after Aliyev was officially elected as the President of Azerbaijan. -- [PRAVDA] You just returned from the CSCE negotiations in Prague. Did you acknowledge any progress? -- [Gukasyan] To say frankly, there was only insignificant success. We negotiated the measures of mutual trust before a cease fire. -- [PRAVDA] What about the cease fire itself? It was stipulated by the negotiations between the four sides, carried out in February in Russian Defense Ministry. Even the concrete date of March 1 has been mentioned... -- [Gukasyan] The agreements were not implemented. First of all, because Azerbaijan wouldn't accept the Russian project on stationing peace-keeping forces into a disengagement zone. -- [PRAVDA] Suppose, Azerbaijan accepts this plan. Are you ready to leave the occupied territories outside Mountainous Karabakh in this case? -- [Gukasyan] We have no claims for Azeri lands. But we won't leave the occupied positions until irreversibility of the peace process is proved. We must make sure we won't be blocked again and the communications will open. Our principles are: no cease fire without placement of independent observers; no withdrawal of troops without stationing the peace-keeping forces. -- [PRAVDA] Is the Republic of Mountainous Karabakh a democratic country? -- [Gukasyan] We have all attributes of power. We have a Supreme Council, which was elected by people, we are preparing a project of the constitution. But as long as the war continues, all control is concentrated in the State Department of Defense, similarly as it was in USSR during the World War II... We even have collective and state farms in Karabakh. We believe, these forms are optimal now. -- [PRAVDA] What's your currency? -- [Gukasyan] We are open to all currencies: rubles, drams, dollars... We even don't mind against Azeri manats. -- [PRAVDA] Do you still have non-Armenian population in Karabakh? -- [Gukasyan] Yes, we have Russians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Jews -- some 7-8 thousands altogether. We should though consider the fact that many Russians departed, when part of Karabakh was controlled by Azerbaijan. -- [PRAVDA] What do you think about the national-liberation movement of Abkhaz people? -- [Gukasyan] You may consider this as a joke or seriously, but I had an original thought once: why not create a CUS -- a Commonwealth of Unrecognized States. Indeed, we have a common goal on the large scale: to live so that countries, which are willing to contain us by force, are unable to dictate their will to us. Surely, we sympathize for Abkhazia, Dniestr, Crimea, and we have corresponding contacts. We may commence a mutual offensive on the diplomatic front, if needed. -- [PRAVDA] Do you see the future of Karabakh within Armenia? -- [Gukasyan] I percept Karabakh as an independent country. But I do not exclude the possibility that Karabakh may become a part of Armenia.
