FR940216-0-00143 FR940216-0-00010 3. Types of Data a. Introduction. As discussed in the July 9, 1991 proposal, EPA is concerned that use of the statutory baseline parameters in lieu of determining an individual baseline could have severe competitive effects. At the same time, EPA realizes that there likely will be insufficient directly measured 1990 fuel parameter data available from which to determine representative individual baseline parameters. Thus, in order to make the best use of available data in developing representative individual baselines, EPA is specifying the types of data and calculations that may be used in the baseline determination. In the proposals, three methods (Methods 1, 2 and 3) were described for refiners to use to determine their baseline parameter values. Method 1-type data consists of a refiner's measured fuel parameter value and volume records of its 1990 gasoline. As discussed in the RIA, Method 1-type data can be from 1990 production or 1990 shipments as long as no data is double counted and all available production and shipment data are used in the baseline determination. Method 2-type data consists of a refiner's 1990 gasoline blendstock composition data and 1990 gasoline and blendstock production records. Method 3-type data consists of a refiner's post-1990 blendstock composition data and 1990 gasoline and blendstock production records. For both Methods 2 and 3, these provisions apply to those blendstocks used in the production of gasoline within the refinery. Under certain circumstances, Method 3-type data may consist of post-1990 gasoline composition data as well. No major comments were received negating the appropriateness of utilizing these three methods or data types. A few minor comments were submitted which are addressed in the RIA. Several commenters did request that EPA allow combinations of Methods 1, 2 and 3-type data to be used in baseline determination, in order to improve the use of available data and thus develop more accurate and representative 1990 individual baselines. EPA agrees that a more representative baseline will result if a combination of higher and lower levels of data is used rather than excluding the better data (i.e., Method 1) due to it being inadequate by itself. EPA had proposed that the different types of data must be used in a hierarchical order, i.e., Method 1-type data has to be used first, and if insufficient Method 1-type data was available for a given fuel parameter, Method 2-type data would be used, etc. EPA is modifying the proposals to allow baseline parameter values to be determined using a combination of the methods, or data types, if necessary, although the same hierarchy must be maintained. Thus, insufficient Method 1-type data may be supplemented with Method 2-type data and, if data were still lacking, the available Method 1 and 2-type data would be supplemented with Method 3-type data. b. Inclusion of gasoline blendstock. Although not specified in the proposals, EPA is requiring that gasoline blendstock which becomes gasoline (per 40 CFR 80.2(c)) solely upon the addition of a specific type and amount of oxygenate, be included in the baseline determination. Unless evidence is provided which indicates that such blendstock was blended with oxygenate other than ethanol or less than 10.0 volume percent ethanol, or was not further modified downstream, the refiner shall assume that said blendstocks were blended with ten (10.0) volume percent ethanol. This requirement provides some assurance that baseline emissions are not artificially low due to selective inclusion or exclusion of such blendstock. Requiring that the blendstock be assumed to have been blended with a specific amount of ethanol (unless otherwise shown) will result in a more stringent baseline than if the blendstock were assumed blended with a lower volume of ethanol, a different oxygenate or not further modified. Hence, the burden of proof of actual disposition of such product is on the refiner.
