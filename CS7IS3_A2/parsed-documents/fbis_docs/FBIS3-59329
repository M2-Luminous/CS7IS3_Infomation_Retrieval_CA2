There is a proper set of procedure to follow, and there are strict rules and requirements at every step. For this reason, ZHONGGUO JINGJI TIZHI GAIGE sent a reporter to interview Sun Xiaoliang, general manager of China Enterprise Shareholding System Consulting Company. He explained the method and procedure for converting enterprises into shareholding companies in simple layman's terms based on his own practical experience and according to current laws and regulations. His approach not only complies with government policies but is also workable. It is hoped that this article can be of help to those who want to restructure their enterprises according to the shareholding system and those who are interested in the subject. In a recent interview, Sun Xiaoliang, general manager of China Enterprise Shareholding System Consulting Company, talked about his own ideas and suggestions on how to convert state-owned enterprises into listed shareholding companies. Sun said, since Comrade Xiaoping's Southern tour speech, comrades from many localities, departments, and enterprises have gone to his firm asking how they could restructure state-run enterprises into listed shareholding companies. He said, since the founding of the China Consulting Company, more than a dozen enterprises have sought its services. Among them were companies that intended to list their securities in the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges, and there were also companies that wanted to be listed in Beijing's two corporate shares circulation systems. Based on these practical experiences and in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations, to convert a state-run enterprise into a listed company, essentially, one must follow five major steps: One, the enterprise must submit an application and get permission to set up a shareholding system experimental point. In this step, the enterprise must consider four things: First, what form of shareholding system should it choose? Second, what are the expected benefits? Third, what are the anticipated problems? Fourth, what are the possible risks? There are two choices under the shareholding system--limited liability companies and corporations. When choosing the corporate format, one must decide whether to raise capital privately or go public, and in the former case, one must also decide whether to list the securities in the corporate share circulation system. Which format best suits the company will depend on what is practical and realistic. One must start out from practicality and consider the possible benefits as well as the risks. The risks referred to here may come from three areas: 1) Investment risks. Some enterprises do well and others do not; stock prices go up and down, and therefore, when buying stocks, some people make money, others lose money. This kind of risk is borne mostly by the investors. 2) Listing risks. Some listed companies are successful; others fail. Listed companies must be prepared to take the risk of failing in the market. 3) Risk of market collapse. This is an inevitable result of the stock market's bubble economy. When stock prices soar as a result of speculation, it is like a bubble that must eventually burst. Stock market disaster can cause serious social problems, and one must be prepared to take such risks. When the government department considers approving an application to set up an experimental point, it must consider at least five things: 1) Does the application meet the state's industrial policy requirements? Enterprises that meet the state's industrial policy requirements have a better chance of being approved. 2) Is the applicant enterprise in a business approved by the state to implement the shareholding system? For example, enterprises in the banking industry and those in businesses pertaining to state secrets are not permitted to go public and implement the shareholding system. 3) Are the applicant enterprise's construction projects part of a state plan? 4) Is the enterprise qualified to and capable of making its own management decisions? For example, if many of the enterprise's products are under mandatory state plans or are required to accept unified state-set prices, its chances of getting approval are slim. 5) Can its stock generate a rate of return comparable to other stocks? Stocks yielding too low a rate of return will not qualify. Sun Xiaoliang pointed out that, for now, after this first step is approved, the enterprise must still get a stock issuing quota which the state allocates to individual provinces (municipalities). This is necessary at this stage so that the state can control the number of stocks being listed. Two, the enterprise must formulate and seek approval for an overall program to convert to the shareholding system. The overall program for conversion must clearly explain five points: 1) The purpose of converting to the shareholding system. That is, what kinds of enterprise development problems can converting to the shareholding system solve? Such problems must be real, and the explanation must be convincing enough to move "God"--so convincing that the department in charge feels obliged to give its approval. 2) The feasibility of converting to the shareholding system. There are two important points: Will there be an attractive profit to investment ratio to give the investors a convincing return on their investments? Will the state get even more taxes and dividends from the enterprise after it converts to the shareholding system? 3) Plans for restructuring the assets. The key lies in reducing related transactions, increasing the profit rate, and getting rid of assets which should not be brought into the shareholding company. 4) Plans for issuing shares, including the total amount of capital stock, equity structure, method of issuance, and listing location and so on. 5) It must get instructions on specific issues, such as who represents the state's equity rights, how to deal with the enterprise's share of mandatory plans, how to coordinate government-controlled prices, how to adjust its tax rates, and so on. There are more than a dozen questions, and since situations vary among different enterprises, there are different ways to deal with them accordingly. Sun Xiaoliang said that this step is the most troublesome and most complicated. To successfully get through this phase, he suggested paying attention to the following 12 points: 1) Reexamine the enterprise's development program. The capital-raising scope should be based on need, and the enterprise should formulate its development plan based on the best rate of return on capital and make that the basis for determining the number of shares to be issued. 2) Sort out and define the property rights. This step is even more complicated for enterprises in the ownership-by-the-whole-people system. 3) Examine its major contracts and credits and debts. 4) Examine plans for implementing the restructuring of company assets. 5) Readjust the previous year's profit to investment ratio and next year's profit to share capital ratio using the accounting system of a shareholding company. 6) Study ways to handle the state's mandatory plan and state-set prices. 7) Study the feasibility and method of adjusting the enterprise tax policy. 8) Study its land-use rights and method of using that as an input under the shareholding system. 9) Study ways to resolve the issue of paying for the on-leave and retired workers' living expenses. 10) Clarify the state's representation with respect to equity rights. 11) Study ways to take responsibility for the profits and losses with regard to non-productive assets. 12) Study and designate a promoter and sign a promoter's agreement. Sun believes that the above tasks are very specific and very practical, but if they are done properly, the conversion plan should be quite simple. Step three is for the enterprise to apply for and receive permission to form a shareholding company. There are eight pieces of documents to be submitted when applying to form a listed company: 1) Application to form a shareholding company. 2) The promoter's agreement. 3) The feasibility report. 4) A draft of the company charter. 5) The property appraisal report. 6) The asset verification report. 7) The prospectus. 8) The industry management department's review. Before submitting the application form, the enterprise should do two things: First, convene a promoter's meeting and submit an incorporation resolution. Second, choose the law firm, accounting firm, property appraiser, and stock underwriter. After making the selections and commencing work, each can then do its part to prepare the documents accordingly. Step four is to propose and obtain permission to issue shares after its application to incorporate has been approved. When applying for permission to issue stocks, 12 pieces of documents are required. They are to be prepared by the lawyer, accountant, appraiser, and the stock underwriter, respectively. For example, the prospectus should be prepared by the underwriter; the accounting report should be prepared by the accountant, and the property appraisal should be prepared by the appraiser. The enterprise must facilitate their work and regularly check their progress. In addition, it should set an agenda for listing the securities. This should be coordinated by the underwriter who should set the daily work schedule and completion time and hold meetings to coordinate all tasks. Step five is for the enterprise to seek permission to list its securities at the exchange. The enterprise should apply for listing at the stock exchange of its choice (currently, the choice is between Shanghai and Shenzhen). After applying for and receiving permission from the stock exchange, it may proceed to issue shares. When all shares are successfully issued and the share capital collected in full, it can then convene a shareholder's meeting to set up the company. It must register with the local industry and business management department within the stipulated time. At that point, the conversion of the state-run enterprise into a listed company is complete. Sun Xiaoliang warns all entrepreneurs that the reorganization of enterprises under the shareholding system is a very complicated and stringent process. In the above-described five steps, it is easy to discern that if an enterprise wants to reap the benefits of a listed company, it must pay a price. Recently nine large state-run enterprises began making preparations to list their securities in Hong Kong and had to go through a very stringent auditing process and disclose every aspect of their businesses. The procedure was so complicated and the requirements so stringent that many were shocked. Thus, any enterprise thinking about listing its securities in the market should be mentally prepared.
