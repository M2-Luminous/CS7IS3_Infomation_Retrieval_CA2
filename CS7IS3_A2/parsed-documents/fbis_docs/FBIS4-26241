Due to their height and magnitude, the flood waters exceeded the flood control project's capability to withstand the resulting strain, and Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, and Changsha suffered serious losses. According to yesterday's statistics, embankments collapsed in 66 places along the Xiang Jiang, submerging approximately 450,000 mu of land. Flood waters broke through the western embankment of the Xiang Jiang in Changsha at 1100 yesterday, creating a 50-meter hole and submerging seven villages, 300,000 mu of land, and some universities and colleges in Yuelu Township, causing at least 100 million yuan in direct economic losses. The whereabouts of some people remain unknown. After the disaster occurred, party, government, and Army leaders at all levels went to the front lines of the flood-fighting effort and organized and guided flood fighting and relief work. The province has sent more than 100,000 cadres and 2 million people to fight the floods. Yesterday afternoon, the provincial flood control headquarters once again created an emergency plan to utilize every available means to meet the flood peak head-on. Troops stationed in Hunan have dispatched personnel from four battalions to Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, and Changsha to do relief work and move people stranded by the floods to secure areas. Armed police and public security police officers and men are using all their strength to plunge into the work of fighting the floods and distributing relief. The provincial party committee and government urged the broad masses of cadres and people in the Xiang Jiang basin and Army personnel and civilians across the province to put the general interest ahead of everything else, fight in unity, and strive to overcome the catastrophic flooding of the Xiang Jiang. The low-lying areas along the banks of the Xiang Jiang, which cannot fight the floods, must try their best to relocate people and ensure their safety.
