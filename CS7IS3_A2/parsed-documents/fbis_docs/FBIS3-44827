There was little fluctuation in prices and transactions were small. Experts say suppliers and buyers are becoming more prudent and adopting a wait-and-see attitude to the market. However, they said the cautious response at least helped diminish decision-makers' worries about big ups and downs in exchange rates after unification. And although the swap markets are to be gradually phased out with the establishment of the inter-bank exchange market, their prices are still important references for the central bank to set basic exchange rates. In addition, since foreign exchange trading between banks and enterprises is just beginning, the swap markets are now the main regulators of money supply between banks. The only traders on the markets now are specialized banks and some non-banking financial institutions. This is because businesses which used to trade on the market have had to withdraw. The U.S. dollar opened at 8.7 yuan on Monday at the Beijing Foreign Exchange Swap market and closed at 8.7060 yuan on Thursday [6 January]. The week's lowest price for U.S. dollars was 8.61 yuan in Henan Foreign Exchange Swap Market on Monday and the highest was 8.725 yuan on Friday in Tianjin. The Hong Kong dollar opened 1.125 yuan in Hainan and 1.118 yuan in Shenzhen on Monday and closed 1.125 and 1.121 yuan respectively on Friday.
