Copies of the letter was released today by the Presidential Palace and was said to be delivered by former President Corazon Aquino who is visiting Seoul as guest of honor of a forum sponsored by the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the Asia-Pacific Region. "The relationship between China and the United States is important for the security of our region and that the current difficulties besetting that relationship should be resolved with the long-term interest of the region in mind," Ramos said in the letter. He did not elaborate how the Philippines and South Korea could help ease the difficulties between China and U.S., mainly disagreement on human rights and trade issues. Ramos also sought Kim's views, saying he would be grateful for the South Korean president's support on this matter. The two presidents met twice since they assumed offices, one in Seoul last May during Ramos' state visit to South Korea, the other in Seattle last November when both attended the informal meeting of leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC). "We learned that much could be achieved for our region through frank and informal exchanges of views and opinions," Ramos said.
