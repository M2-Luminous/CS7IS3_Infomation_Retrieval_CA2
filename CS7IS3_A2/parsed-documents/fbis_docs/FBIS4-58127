U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his delegation left Damascus last night following a two-day visit to the Syrian Arab Republic. Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', senior Foreign Ministry officials, the Syrian ambassador in Washington, and the American ambassador in Damascus saw him off at Damascus International airport. Speaking to reporters prior to his departure, Mr. Christopher described his talks with President Hafiz al-Asad as extremely serious and substantial. He said that, in his opinion, there is much to do and substantive talks to be held. A great deal of work and effort are awaiting us in the future, he said. Mr. Christopher said he relayed some ideas to Damascus and took others from it. He told reporters he was going to Israel to meet with Yitzhaq Rabin and then on to Cairo. He said that at present he has no plans to return to Damascus and added that his country will play a more effective role to help the parties. He said he discussed the subject of bilateral relations with Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and that he will resume talks with him if Mr. al- Shar' visits Washington. Replying to a reporter's question, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said Syria does not accept phased peace with Israel and insists on complete withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories as a condition for the establishment of peace in the region. He added that there has been no change whatsoever in the Syrian position on the peace process. Al-Shar' said President Hafiz al-Asad asked several substantive questions which the Israeli side has to answer. Asked about the idea of Majdal Shams first, the foreign minister said Syria's position is that the Golan should be restored in full.
