FR940204-1-00019 FR940204-1-00002 Under proposed §630.4(a)(5) and (6), the Funding Corporation would be responsible for supplying copies of the report to selling group dealers for distribution to investors and potential investors in FCS debt obligations and also for making the report available for public inspection. The FCA does not intend to impose a complex delivery system for the report to investors analogous to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Rather, the proposed regulations recognize that the Funding Corporation and other System institutions currently use the Information Statement to provide information to the public in connection with the sale of FCS debt securities. The FCA believes that the information contained in the report is useful to investors and seeks to ensure that the report is reasonably available to them through selling group dealers and the Funding Corporation and otherwise to the public upon request. Under proposed §630.4(a)(7), the Funding Corporation would be required to notify the FCA immediately when the Funding Corporation believes that it will be unable to publish and file the report within the regulatory deadline because of the failure of one or more banks to comply with their responsibilities prescribed in proposed §630.4(c). This provision is designed to allow the FCA, if necessary, to enforce the requirement that the banks provide the information needed by the Funding Corporation to prepare the report to investors in a timely fashion. 3 3 No provision is made for notice as a result of failure of the Financial Assistance Corporation to comply with proposed §630.5(b) because the board of the Funding Corporation is statutorily designated as the board of the Financial Assistance Corporation. The board is responsible for providing information about the Financial Assistance Corporation needed by the Funding Corporation to prepare the report to investors in a timely manner. Pursuant to proposed §630.4(a)(8), the Funding Corporation must prepare a statement to briefly explain the respective responsibilities of the disclosure entities in Systemwide financial reporting and state that the Funding Corporation has policies and procedures in place to ensure, to the best of the knowledge and belief of its management and board, that the information contained in the report is true, accurate, and complete. The statement must be signed by the Funding Corporation's chief executive officer and chairman of the board. This obligation acknowledges the Funding Corporation's shared accountability with the banks for the reports as well as its lead role among the disclosure entities for preparation of the report. For the purpose of preparing the report, if the Funding Corporation needs specific information contained in the Report of Examination of a bank or an association, proposed §630.4(a)(9) would authorize the Funding Corporation to request such information from the Chief Examiner of the FCA. 2. Responsibilities of the Financial Assistance Corporation Proposed §630.4(b) sets forth the obligation of the Financial Assistance Corporation to provide the Funding Corporation with the information it requires to prepare the Systemwide combined financial statements. As noted, because the board of the Funding Corporation is the board of the Financial Assistance Corporation and has the capacity to control financial reporting of both entities, it is unnecessary to specify the Financial Assistance Corporation's responsibilities for reporting to the Funding Corporation in the proposed regulations.
