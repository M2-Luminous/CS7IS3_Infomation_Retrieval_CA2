FBIS4-68625 "jpusr052___94039" FBIS-USR-94-052 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 18 May 1994 UKRAINE ECONOMIC AFFAIRS Presidential Edict on Continued Use of Nuclear Power Presidential Edict on Continued Use of Nuclear Power Criticized 944K1161A Moscow ROSSIYA in Russian No 14, 13-19 Apr 94 p 2 944K1161A Moscow ROSSIYA Russian CSO [Report by Vladimir Kolinko: "Kravchuk Gives Up the Missiles, but Chernobyl Is Still Usable"] [Text] Kiev--Although one of the latest presidential acts was not completely odious, it has prompted a response in the form of a collective letter from three ministers, as well as a "roundtable" of 19 state, public, and political organizations in Ukraine. The act in question is the Ukrainian president's edict "On Immediate Measures Aimed at Development of Nuclear Power Generation and Building a Nuclear Fuel Cycle in Ukraine." The edict outlines the way of accelerated development of nuclear industry and of Ukraine building its own nuclear fuel cycle, from the production of uranium ore to the processing of nuclear waste. The Ukrainian Government is instructed to put on line over the next two years four power generators at Ukrainian nuclear stations, including the damaged No. 2 generator at the Chernobyl AES [Nuclear Electric Power Station]. In the opinion of jurists, the edict contains several serious "flops." First, it assigns administrative oversight of the nuclear industry to the Goskomatom [State Atomic Energy Committee of Ukraine], including such a sensitive part of it as radioactive waste disposal. This is in fundamental contradiction to the principle of state regulation of safety and administration of nuclear industry, which separates the competence with respect to exploitation of nuclear facilities and radioactive waste disposal. Second, the edict envisages creating a medical-hygienic administration in the Goskomatom system, which is a violation of Ukraine's health care legislation. Third, keeping the text of this edict secret from the Ukrainian population is in violation of Articles 9-11 of the Ukrainian Law on Environmental Protection. In addition to legal shortcomings, the edict also presents a number of logical puzzles. For instance, it is difficult to reconcile the decision on export of electric power, which is a part of the decree, with statements about catastrophic shortage of power in Ukraine. Especially considering that it is because of the alleged shortage of electric power that the development of the nuclear industry is being considered in the first place... The "roundtable" participants (among whom, in addition to the "greens," were representatives of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, the leadership of the National Commission for Protecting the Population From Radiation, the Ukrainian Peace Council, and the All-Ukraine Human Rights Committee, and others) demanded Leonid Kravchuk repeal the edict. An identical appeal came from the ministers of health protection and environmental protection, and the minister for protection of the population from the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, as well as the chairman of Ukrainian State Atomic Industry Oversight. By the way, a few days ago IAEA General Director Hans Blix [name as transliterated] informed Leonid Kravchuk of the conclusion reached by experts of this international organization: They concluded that Chernobyl AES does not meet international safety norms.
