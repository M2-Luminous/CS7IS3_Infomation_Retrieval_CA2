Taiwan University political science professor Chao Yung-mao has spent close to 10 years studying the phenomenon of criminal-influenced politics and its relationship to local and regional political factions. In a special interview granted this newspaper, he analyzed the situation by pointing out that the Yun-lin case is a symptom of Taiwan's regional politics "festering" at the core and that it is entering a criminal democracy period in which "local government is dominated by criminal politics" with all the trappings of an "Asian Sicily"; we should therefore consider this a wake-up call and treat the situation seriously. The following is the gist of Professor Chao Yung-mao's interview. Judging from the data available to me, Taiwan today carries on a close relationship with criminal politics, most directly through members of a legislative assembly who came out of criminal politics and make up as much as 50 percent of its membership. This type of environment is very frightening because the linkage between criminal forces and local politics is extremely close which enables them to "divide the spoils on the spot" whether over the budget, administration or letting of municipal contracts, and this will impact on the quality and allocation of public services in local government. As for the Yun-lin County incident, one can analyze it from three different perspectives to gain some understanding of the background and origin of criminal political influences: First, criminal politics thrive on receiving and granting of favors and settling disputes among enterprises and over spheres of influence controlled by the criminal forces themselves. Second, criminal politics have grown and evolved over time from the "societal model" in the 1950-60s, when they depended on blackmail, extortion, taking a cut on gambling winnings and operating prostitution and gambling activities to maintain their existence, to gradually changing to the "economic model" in the 1970s when Taiwan became developed economically and democratized politically and the new environment required the protection of politicians in power, and in this period the criminal enterprises began to restructure and became regional or publicly owned enterprises. Under these circumstances, the relationship between criminal forces and local political factions grew even closer and produced the situation in which the former would throw their support to certain factions or choose sides. At the same time, favors and grievances which one political faction may have vis-a-vis another would affect the interests of the criminal forces, so when such conflicts occurred, the criminal forces behind the various factions would come out to settle the disputes in behalf of their sponsors, and the atmosphere would become especially charged when elections are involved, and this threatens the fairness and safety of the electoral process itself. Third, the actual battleground of criminal forces is the elections not of the county magistrates, but the next generation of county assemblymen; therefore, the situation we see today is only the first shot leading to the next battle, for the criminal forces are now only getting the candidates of their factions ready for the next election. Analyzed from the above-mentioned second and third factors, local politics and criminal politics are already intimately intertwined. If local political power comes from the county assemblymen, village chiefs and township mayors who all owed their political start to criminal forces, it would be difficult to say that criminal politics would not continue to develop and extend its reach to the provincial assemblymen and people's representatives in the national legislature, and this will certainly interfere with the goal of achieving honest government in national political development. If criminal forces and politics were too closely tied together, it would lead to even more severe "political struggle," particularly after criminal politics has monopolized local political power for a long period of time; this would compound the difficulties for any party in power to undertake any local political reforms.
