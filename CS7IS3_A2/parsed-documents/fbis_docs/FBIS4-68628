The credit was to play a stabilizing role (to be turned over once for carrying out mutual settlements), and to be returned to the National Bank of Ukraine by 27 February. In any case, this is what Viktor Yushchenko planned... Viktor Yushchenko said in February that the problem of mutual indebtedness among Ukrainian enterprises was having a paralyzing effect on the economy in general. Thus, it was decided to put 10 trillion karbovantsi into circulation for stabilization. In the plan of the National Bank of Ukraine's leadership, the credit did not have any inflationary character; but it seems that Yushchenko's fears that the money could be used for other purposes have been been realized. The National Bank of Ukraine has not made public the data on the movement of the money from the stabilization credit, but during March and April the Bank was constantly getting indications, the basic content of which led to reminders that the credit had to be returned on time. Among the actions which the National Bank conducted with this goal have been: control over the deposit accounts of the debtors. The credit provided by the Bank can (and must) be redeemed with funds which the debtors have in another bank; the establishment of priorities for the banks in carrying out settlements, in this order: settlements for energy, payment of wages, execution of the instructions of state taxation inspections concerning the assessment of payments not made on time, and the financial sanctions for this. The National Bank is now preparing changes in the order of the formation of reserve requirements for commercial banks.
