Commodity (including precious metal) or Equity Derivative Contracts (1) Commodity or equity linked swaps. (2) Commodity or equity linked options purchased. (3) Forward commodity or equity linked contracts. (4) Any other instrument that gives rise to similar credit risks. Exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen calendar days or less and derivative contracts traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin may be excluded from the risk-based ratio calculation. Over-the-counter options purchased, however, are included and treated in the same way as other derivative contracts. * * * * * 3. In Appendix A to part 325, section II.E.1., as that section was proposed to be revised at 59 FR 37726, July 25, 1994, is revised to read as follows: II. *␣*␣* E. *␣*␣* 1. Credit Equivalent Amounts for Derivative Contracts. The credit equivalent amount of a derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract in accordance with section II.E.3. of this appendix A is equal to the sum of (i) the current exposure (which is equal to the mark-to-market value, 41 if positive, and is sometimes referred to as the replacement cost) of the contract and (ii) an estimate of the potential future credit exposure over the remaining life of the contract. 41 Mark-to-market values are measured in dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies specified in the contract and should reflect changes in both underlying rates, prices and indices, and counterparty credit quality. The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, then the current exposure is equal to that mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative, then the current exposure is zero. The potential future credit exposure of a contract, including contracts with negative mark-to-market values, is estimated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by one of the following credit conversion factors, as appropriate: Conversion Factor Matrix A [Numbers in percent] 1Residual maturity 1Interest rate 1Exchange rate and gold 1Equity B 1Precious metals, except gold 1Other commodities Less than one year 0.0 1.0 6.0 7.0 12.0 One to five years 0.5 5.0 8.0 7.0 12.0 Five years or more 1.5 7.5 10.0 8.0 15.0 A For contracts with multiple exchanges of principal, the factors are to be multiplied by the number of remaining payments in the contract. B For contracts that reset to zero value following a payment, the remaining maturity is set equal to the time until the next payment. No potential future exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based upon two floating rate indices (so called floating/floating or basis swaps); the credit exposure on these contracts is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market values. 4.
