FBIS4-66500 "jpnea020___94007" JPRS-NEA-94-020 JPRS Near East & South Asia 29 March 1994 NEAR EAST ALGERIA New New Combined Offensive: Commander `Dismissed' 94AF0166C Algiers LIBERTE in French 29 Mar 94 p 2 94AF0166C Algiers LIBERTE French CSO [Article by D.A.: "Combined Forces in Action"] [Text] An offensive by the combined forces of the security services--chiefly the Army--is now being visibly confirmed in the field. Just about everywhere, but especially in the zones most affected by terrorism (Batna, Lakhdaria, Jijel, Bel Abbes, Blida, Constantine, and so on), those forces are currently applying very strong pressure. According to our sources, that pressure is making itself clearly felt in the pockets of terrorism thanks to a general redeployment using every means including aviation, helicopters, and semiheavy weapons. In recent days, for example, a large contingent of ANP [People's National Army] special forces occupied the Aures Mountains, where they wiped out a great many escapees from Lambese. Those same special forces have energetically gotten the situation under control over vast areas, particularly around Ksar El Boukhari, Medea, Ain Defla, Chlef, and Blida, which have literally been gone over with a fine-tooth comb. It should be pointed out that the Army's special forces consist of paratroops from the Biskra Airborne School. They are seasoned elite troops, one battalion of which can easily rival the equivalent of 10 conventional armed battalions. The same sources say that the merciless counteroffensive being conducted by the combined forces actually began the very next day after the march on 22 March. But the permanent presence of the state and the organization in stages of general offensives in the field are in fact the result of decisions made at meetings by the Army High Command several weeks ago, as reported by our newspaper around the end of Ramadan. What seems completely new in the antiterrorist struggle is the fact that now, as our sources point out, the security forces are using proven methods for dismantling armed groups. It will be noted, for example, that false roadblocks have been taken by surprise and their perpetrators killed thanks to infiltration by the security services, whose members mix with the public as ordinary bus passengers. Tracking down terrorists has become a matter of seconds, so to speak, for the ANP special forces in simultaneous action with the police and the Gendarmerie. General Betchine's recent appointment as minister-adviser to the office of the president means, naturally, that Betchine is responsible in particular for coordination of the security services at the highest level in that simultaneous action. Especially since Gen. Betchine has had a long career in the ANP and, before that, in the ALN [National Liberation Army]. Besides being perfectly aware of what is going on, he is also known as a hard-liner and an intransigent nationalist who was unhesitatingly among the few key figures to tell Chadli Bendjedid directly that he should not legalize the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]. In what is apparently a new direction being taken in antiterrorist action, this regaining of control over the security situation also relies on active participation by the public. Feeling concerned, citizens have recently stepped in by reporting the exact layout of the land and of hiding places known to them as places where terrorists could be taking refuge. Significant results have thus been achieved in this antiterrorist struggle, both in the bush and in the cities, and it seems that the official figures on the casualties suffered by terrorism are far from reflecting reality. Apparently they reflect partial counts, with the correct figures being considerably higher. The fact remains that this operation to regain control has given rise to news reports of all kinds. In Mitidja, for example, on the day after the "curfew" imposed by the terrorists, there was a persistent rumor to the effect that the commander of the 1st Military Region had been dismissed because a garrison city (29 barracks) like Blida had inexplicably fallen into the hands of the terrorists. That report has been neither denied nor confirmed, although it now seems certain that Blida and its region are completely under control from the security standpoint. In other words, communication is still not the government's strong point.
