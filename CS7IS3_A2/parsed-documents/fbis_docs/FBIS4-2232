Shakhray, 38, who was named deputy minister in charge of federal regional issues in 1991, was removed from the post and given his present portfolio when Russian cabinet was reshuffled in 1994. The Party of Russian Unity and Harmony (PRUH) formed by Shakhray participated in Russian parliamentary elections last December and found its way to State Duma, the lower house. Observers think that the PRUH faction in Duma, a mild democrat group led by Shakhray, played a key role when the State Duma passed amnesty in February this year. The presidential press office announced that the presidential decree also stipulates that the number of deputy prime ministers be increased from three, decided in January when the cabinet was reshuffled, to six, including one first deputy prime minister. Meanwhile, Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shokhin, the minister of economy, has recently been promoted to be deputy prime minister.
