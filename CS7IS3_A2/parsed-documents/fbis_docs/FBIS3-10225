[Sanin] Good morning, Dario. [Arizmendi] What is the government's position on the results of President Cesar Gaviria's trip to Japan? The president is on his way back to Colombia. [Sanin] The trip was a complete success in every aspect. He was successful when he appeared before businessmen to seek investments and economic support, when he appeared at universities and parliament, during his meeting with the emperor and Japanese prime minister. He was successful in all the meetings he held. He secured financial support for Cusiana, (Diarari), and Calima III, for all the projects for which he requested financial support. The trip produced wonderful results. [Arizmendi] The president has asked Japan to back Colombia's bid to become an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] member. This membership is theoretically impossible until 1996. How important is it for Colombia to form part of that organization? [Sanin] It would mean our full incorporation into the Pacific region. We already belong to (Pibec) [not further identified]. This is the product of a big effort by this government. This has meant the arrival of the private sector into Pacific forums. We will be received in Malaysia in March as a full-rights associate member of (TOP), the Economic Council for the Pacific, where the private sector, the government, and the academy [not further identified] have working groups and form associations to strengthen ties among Pacific countries. Private businessmen will be able to establish links with 30,000 enterprises and will be able to trade, look for investments, and exchange technological experiences. We [words indistinct] but crowned our efforts with success. This has been, perhaps, one of our foreign policy's best accomplishments. The next step by APEC will be to link all the Pacific countries, including the United States and Canada. APEC aims to associate with the academic, political, and private points of view, all the countries of America and the Asian Pacific, the entire Pacific. We are working in that direction. We are participating in the forums in which we must participate. We are getting ready. I think the president's visit to Japan was of definite importance for our entrance into the grand Pacific project, because we were able to demonstrate our interest on that. I think we are embarking on a road toward the future, because progress in the financial and service sectors, in technology, in all the most important sector, including the academic sector, is taking place in the Pacific. [Arizmendi] A former Venezuelan foreign minister has again launched verbal attacks against Colombia in recent hours. Now he has called for solidarity from certain neighboring countries to demand that Colombia change its position. The Colombian Foreign Ministry has maintained relative silence on the declarations by Ochoa Antich. Will it maintain this silence, or will it be necessary to respond more strongly to Ochoa? [Sanin] Former Foreign Minister Ochoa Antich is a Venezuelan [words indistinct] Colombia had very close relations with him. When he was foreign minister we obviously had to respond to his statements. We agreed at that time with many of his statements and did not agree with certain others. When this happened, we had to express our opinion, but Ochoa is now a politician, a columnist. His opinions are not official; thus it would be unwise for me to exchange opinions with him every time he, as a politician, issues his own opinions, because then we would be acting also as politicians, and we would then face very difficult relations with a country, Venezuela, with which we want to maintain the best relations possible. [Arizmendi] Nonetheless, he charged that through you Colombia has apparently offered to support and vote for Dr. Burelli Rivas so he could aspire to the post of OAS secretary general. What is the truth of this charge? [Sanin] I believe, first, we should not have described that as a charge. We have seen countries such as Argentina change positions once President Gaviria's candidacy was presented. Argentina now fully supports Colombia, and that is the Latin American position. The idea is to have a leader, a great spokesman at the OAS, the most important organization of the hemisphere. In the case you mentioned, however, Colombia never made a commitment. We held a meeting on that day in which President Ramon J. Velasquez presented Venezuela's hopes that we support the current Venezuelan foreign minister. We praised his personality and work; he had been a very good ambassador to Colombia. Perhaps this was mistaken for support. I think this is a problem of interpretation, and we cannot continue to dwell on this or turn it into a diplomatic problem or conflict. Actually, there was no commitment. We have not written any letter supporting the Venezuelan candidacy. We respect it. He is a highly qualified and experienced person, but we did not commit ourselves. I think this is a problem of misinterpretation. [Arizmendi] A problem has come up recently at the OAS in light of the various candidacies that are being discussed. Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus Quesada, who is another strong candidate to become the OAS secretary general, has affirmed to the media he has at least 22 votes. Caracol has asked questions among diplomatic sources, and it has been able to determine that Colombia has from eight to nine votes and that Niehaus has 15 written votes. At least 18 votes are needed for election. What are the possibilities today of President Cesar Gaviria's hopes for OAS secretary general? [Sanin] When the president told Colombians and the international public he accepted the nomination made by the heads of state for the post of OAS secretary general, he said according to consultations we had made, including via the Colombian Foreign Ministry, he had solid support; that is the impression I have. I think we have the necessary and sufficient votes so that as of 7 August, the president of the Republic will become the OAS secretary general. [Arizmendi] As of the first round? [Sanin] I think so; that is for what I am hoping, and I am working on that. I think that will be the case. According to what I have been told, that is the way it will be. Even though Foreign Minister Niehaus has given those figures.... [pauses] Not so long ago, he was giving other figures. First he mentioned 22 votes, and it seems he will have less and less as the days go by. I do not want to talk about figures or numbers of votes. We are hoping President Gaviria's nomination will be the candidacy of unity and that it will express the spirit of Latin America. Let's hope it will be the result of a consensus, although it is very difficult, because candidate Niehaus, as you said, has been working on this for two and a half years. He has some votes but not the votes he claims to have. Are you sure of the number of votes he claims to have at this time? [Arizmendi] Yes. [Sanin] The votes you claim President Gaviria has are very far from reality. [Arizmendi] What figures do you have? [Sanin] The truth is the president has sufficient support for becoming OAS secretary general. [Arizmendi] In this first round? [Sanin] In this first round. Those are our hopes. [Arizmendi] That means he has at least 18 to 19 guaranteed votes? [Sanin] [giggling] Yes sir. [Arizmendi] We know Foreign Minister Niehaus has 15 written votes; in other words, that would mean 34 votes. Is that correct? [giggles] [Sanin] I do not want to count votes; actually, we are talking about hemispheric integration, a fluid dialogue, support for democracy, and a defense of democracy via cooperation and a permanent dialogue. Actually, we are not counting votes. We are voicing a message of solidarity, of integration, and of cooperation, which are what our hemisphere needs. [Arizmendi] Inasmuch as you have mentioned integration, cooperation [words indistinct], and the fact we want good relations with Venezuela, things do not seem that easy, not only due to this case of the OAS secretary general but also what concerns Venezuela's internal economic policy. The private sector is very much concerned over how this will affect business, for example, if there is a devaluation of the bolivar. There is also a concern over the future of the Group of Three, [words indistinct] economic integration after what President Caldera has done. [Sanin] I want to tell you in these days I have stayed in Colombia I have been speaking with Colombian entrepreneurs, with exporters, with many politicians who are interested in this subject. I have had a very fluid dialogue with the Venezuelan foreign minister, as well as in Mexico when we attended an OAS cooperation meeting. Yesterday, we had a very lengthy telephone conversation. He told me the following, and this is something the Venezuelan president had already told me: First of all, there will not be a massive devaluation in Venezuela. He told me we could rest assured in this regard. Second, he said there will not be an exchange crisis. Third, they support integration, are committed to this; they want to work for integration and defend it, just as we do. The Venezuelan president was one of the builders of the Andean Pact, and he strongly believes in it. Thus, they continue with the idea of defending integration at all costs. They had to take certain very strong measures to defend the financial sector. The foreign minister told me all banks will open as of Friday. I believe one bank had been closed. Measures were adopted so that this financial crisis would not harm the depositors so much. They are adopting strong measures, attacking a crisis with solutions. I feel integration is irreversible. Obviously, the macroeconomic measures will have to be consulted more, and sometimes there will be people who favor the exports from one or another country, but I have the impression we are not going to have any big problems for the time being. This is what the foreign minister told me, and these are the guarantees he gave me. [Arizmendi] There is a scandal in the United States with Maria del Rosario Casas, our former cultural attache at the Colombian Embassy in Mexico. You requested from Gabriel Silva Lujan, the Colombian ambassador to Washington, that he formally request an explanation from the State Department regarding the entire case. Have you received a reply? [Sanin] Yes, because.... [pauses] I cannot understand how a friendly nation such as the United States can hire a Colombian diplomatic official for intelligence work. I find that unacceptable under any point of view. I spoke to our ambassador to the White House yesterday and asked him what news he had on the issue. He explained to me the case is before the courts, and while it is in the judiciary stage we will not have an answer. I will keep the public informed of the case, because, as I said before, I cannot understand this affair. [Arizmendi] Could we be on the verge of a formal protest note to the U.S. Government over the CIA hiring an attache--an official from our embassy--as a spy at its service? [Sanin] I prefer not to speak of that. The only thing I must state strongly is that I fully disagree with any country using the services of a diplomatic official who is obligated by ethics and the law to defend the interests of his or her country in functions that are totally different from serving the fatherland. [Arizmendi] We thank you very much for making these statements to "Caracol's 0600-0900" newscast. To conclude, we have another question. You are constantly being mentioned as a running mate for any of the two presidential candidates--the conservative Andres Pastrana or the liberal Ernesto Samper Pizano--for vice president of the Republic. Are you restricted by the law or by a resolution of the State Council? [Sanin] I have not had time to see whether I am qualified; nonetheless, you give me good news when you say I might be a running mate for any of the two candidates, because all I want is to serve Colombians, regardless of political parties.... [Arizmendi, interrupting] Which one would you prefer? [Sanin] No, I am not going to get involved in political affairs. I am very happy serving Colombia's interests, representing Colombia. For the time being, I am not going to get involved in politics. [Arizmendi] Not for the time being, but how about in the future? Would you like that someday? [Sanin] One cannot commit oneself to the future, because each day brings something new. I always uphold that. Forgive me for repeating this. I am a person of faith, and I think God points out the paths He wants us to follow. I do not put conditions on my life. One thing I will tell you: My policy is to serve Colombia, to interpret an international policy, that of President Gaviria and of the country, of the new Constitution. I feel very happy as foreign minister, and I am not thinking of anything different for the time being.
