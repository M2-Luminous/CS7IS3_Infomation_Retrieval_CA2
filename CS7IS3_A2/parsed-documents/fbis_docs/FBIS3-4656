This is a grave military provocation inciting North-South confrontation and bringing the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch of strain. It is an unpardonable criminal act against the dialogue partner. South Korean people and students are now staging fierce demonstrations urging a stop to the introduction of the Patriot missiles and "Team Spirit" joint military exercises. Even the opposition Democratic Party expresses strong opposition to this. The anti-war, anti-nuke movement in South Korea is a very just struggle based on the patriotic stand to achieve peace on the Korean peninsula, and, accordingly, it can never be a target of suppression. The Kim Yong-sam group, however, is brutally suppressing the just anti-war, anti-nuke struggle of the South Korean people. This eloquently proves that the puppet clique is desperately trying to light the train of another war against the DPRK by introducing U.S. destruction weapons into South Korea at whatever cost. The traitor Kim Yong-sam must not run amok, clearly mindful that to crack down upon the just patriotic struggle of the people at the point of bayonet and rush headlong along the road of division and confrontation will eventually precipitate his own destruction.
