The entire huge network of influence, established when the USSR was one of the world superpowers, continues to undoubtedly collapse, little by little. The 19 years of boycott harmed the postwar atmosphere and only nourished the Cold War, contradicting the destiny of the countries that, ultimately, live to coexist and not to nourish the causes of misunderstandings. Almost two decades after the day the United States withdrew from Vietnam, with the misfortune of 58,000 deaths (compared to 1.3 million Vietnamese in the north) and trauma that still prevails, the united Vietnam still continues to be one of the poorest countries in the world, while around it noncommunist countries in Southeastern Asia are experiencing almost sustained development. The commercial rapprochement between the United States and Vietnam represents a major historic step toward their reconciliation. Talks the past few years have always been filled with passion. War veterans groups were the first to repudiate Clinton's initiative due to doubts still surrounding the fate of servicemen missing in action (the MIA's). According to the war veterans, there are still 2,200 U.S. soldiers missing in war whose fate, according to them, the Vietnamese Government has done nothing to clarify. The discord will continue to exist but efforts for an understanding have been strengthened. Since late 1986, when the Vietnamese government renewed its leadership, retiring old war heroes -- favorite disciples of Uncle Ho, Secretary General Nguyen Van Linh has made self-criticisms: "The leadership's task today has changed. The style is also changing," he said as he proposed changes that entailed dismantling the centralized bureaucracy, "based on state subsidies that only brought suffering to the people." It was quite common to find youths in Vietnam, thousands of them -- mathematicians, computer experts, engineers or specialized workers -- in other brother socialist countries who, having returned, could not find a job or were being employed to do simple jobs. Moreover, the economic crisis, also aggravated by the war against the Khmer Rouge, forced thousands of Vietnamese to seek work abroad. The rice planted in the Mekong River is not enough to supply the entire south. Vietnam survived thanks to the constant aid granted by communist countries, until the Soviet empire collapsed. Early last year the government launched a campaign against corruption, excessive red tape, the theft of government assets, ineptitude, and the lack of democracy. Since then the Vietnamese leadership has been seeking to adopt market economy principles without giving up its single party system. The U.S. embargo gradually was being lifted as envoys have held talks with Vietnamese leaders since the Bush administration. It is a good thing that President Clinton, who during his youth protested against the Vietnamese war and did not enlist to participate in it, has taken the decisive step to lift the resentment that has existed since 1975.
