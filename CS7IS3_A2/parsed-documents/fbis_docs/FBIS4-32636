He has not had it for some time now. We were told this today exclusively for Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina by one top-level official in the presidential palace in Zagreb, who wished to remain anonymous. We can only say that he is a very well-known and respected politician in Zagreb, even though he is perhaps not the most popular one. Even the Serbs from the so-called Krajina have repudiated Abdic, although just a year ago -- when he proclaimed autonomy -- they signed an agreement on military aid. However, according to the information in Zagreb, now they send him almost no aid, or so little that he can do nothing with it against the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, that is, its 5th Corps, our source claims. The doors to Zagreb have been closed to Abdic since the Washington Agreement. Our source says: The autonomy proclaimed in principle in western Bosnia is nearing its end. Abdic danced his dance of death around Kladusa and Bihac for only one summer. According to the information on the successes of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps, all of western Bosnia will soon be under the Sarajevo authority, says our reliable source from the presidential palace in Zagreb. If they knew who he was, both Fikret Abdic and President Tudjman would probably get headaches.
