Were it not for a rusting sculpture of the Greek letter psi surrounded by spheres in elliptic orbits -- symbolizing atomic physics -- one could drive straight past the gate of the Rossendorf research site near Dresden without even noticing it. Nevertheless, with close to 2,000 employees, the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] Central Institute of Nuclear Research used to be the largest Academy of Sciences facility, indeed the largest research institute in the whole of the east. Even today, the site, with its barbed wire fence and drab buildings, hardly beckons invitingly to visitors. Perhaps it is not meant to, for radioactive waste from the research reactor, which has now been shut down, has been dumped in the Rossendorf woods. "Things were easier in GDR days," says Gudrun Zwicker, formerly a physicist in Rossendorf and now consultant to the scientific director, Wolf Haefele. "In those days the waste went to Morsleben." This permanent store has now been closed. The nuclear laboratory had to be sealed up overnight after unification. Many employees with the requisite know-how have been dismissed, says Zwicker. A reprocessing company now looks after radioactive waste disposal. It was founded in 1992 and employs a staff of 130. The waste problem is "highly complex and technically difficult," says Haefele, who was previously the director of the Juelich Nuclear Research Center. The disposal work will keep the company busy for 15 to 20 years, he believes. Problems Specific to the East The five Rossendorf Research Center institutes that are currently operative came into being two years ago, some of them growing out of the sectors positively assessed by the Science Council. In the same way that the Karlsruhe and Juelich nuclear research centers are looking around for new tasks, whether in brain or environmental research, a new profile is also being sought in Rossendorf. Problems specific to the east compound the problems also experienced in the west in such attempts to steer a cumbersome "research tanker" onto a new course. Unlike Karlsruhe and Juelich, Rossendorf is not a major research facility, but what is known as a Blue List institute, which is consequently only 50-percent -- and not 90-percent -- financed by the Federal Government. The Land of Saxony foots the other half of the bill. Apart from the new institute directors, some of whom come from the west, almost all the 450 permanent employees were inherited from GDR days. Their average age is very high, and as a result many of them are finding it difficult to adjust to the changeover. To add to the problems, there is considerable feeling of insecurity among the researchers. Indeed, it is not yet known whether all the institutes can actually carry on in their current form. For example, the Institute of Nuclear and Hadron Physics is the only one of its kind left in eastern Europe. However, competition in this field of research, which is nevertheless slowly becoming extinct, is considerable in the West. So is the institute still needed? It also has the problem that its director designate has backed out. There is thus also some doubt as to whether the planned electron accelerator will be built. If it is not, it is unlikely that there will be a major facility in Rossendorf in the foreseeable future, as the research reactor, a neutron source previously used for materials research and for the production of isotopes for medical applications, has been shut down, contrary to the Science Council's recommendations. The federal research minister in office at the time was unwilling to spend the 60 million German marks that it would have cost to bring the reactor, which had been renovated immediately prior to the German unification, up to "western standards." Anxieties About the Future The Institute of Safety Research, too, has grounds for anxiety as to its future. It has to date been working on Soviet-type reactors, but since the Greifswald pile was shut down, there have been none left in the Federal Republic. The Science Council met last week to discuss the future of Rossendorf and will pronounce judgment in mid- May. The prospects look better for the Institute of Ion Beam Physics and Materials Research, where the focus is on electrically charged atom beam applications in surface treatment and materials research, things it was doing, at least in part, before the unification. "At that time, our scientists were competitive," says director Wolfhard Moeller, "although much of the apparatus was hopelessly obsolete." This situation has changed since then, the laboratories now boasting several ultramodern ion accelerators and the institute being the biggest of its kind in Europe. The researchers there use a method, developed back in GDR days, of extraordinary interest to art historians, as they use proton beams to study works of art. The charged nuclear components penetrate the layers close to the surface, and the radiation emitted (X-ray waves, or protons themselves) makes it possible to identify the chemical elements contained in the colors used in a painting, for instance. The applications for this noninvasive test procedure are self-evident: If the yellow, for example, is not a lead and tin mixture but a chrome mix not available in the middle ages, whereas the painting is attributed to that period, it could be a fake. The institute is also engaged in work on miniature sensors. Sophisticated instruments have usually been needed to date to detect certain pollutants in the environment, especially when they occur in minute quantities. The intention is therefore to build sensitive sensors that can be produced cheaply and on an industrial scale for deployment on numerous sites. The individual components required are already available: special semiconductor devices known as ion- sensitive field-effect transistors measure concentrations of substances in, for instance, a water sample. Liquids are fed through by micropumps and valves. Measuring Ion Levels in the Blood The time has now come to combine these components on a small silicon wafer, thus creating a complete, autonomous measuring system capable of handling small samples. A system of this type could also be of interest to the medical profession, for measuring ion levels in the blood, for instance. The Rossendorf researchers have now succeeded in building a pump that is incorporated into the silicon wafer. It measures one centimeter square and can flush one microliter of liquid per hour through a fine pore. The scientists hope to present a complete measuring system within the next few months. Another institute in Rossendorf, the Radiation Chemistry Institute, is endeavoring to assist Wismut GmbH with reclamation work on the former uranium mine. "About 250,000 tonnes of uranium ore have been mined in Saxony and Thuringia since 1945. The earth was completely raped by pumping acids in," says Heino Nitsche, director of the institute. Gigantic contaminated areas, shafts, and slagheaps are the result. Controversy as To Correct Reclamation Method The experts are still arguing over the best way to clean the area up. In any case, however, the salvage work will cost a great deal of money. "So it is worthwhile getting the basic principles straight to start with," says Nitsche. In other words, how does radioactivity spread in the air and soil, how do the rock and water strata interact with one another, and what by-products are formed when uranium decomposes? "There are already models that describe the spread of radioactive substances, for example," says Nitsche. All they need to obtain accurate forecasts is precise input data, and this is where the scientist comes in.
