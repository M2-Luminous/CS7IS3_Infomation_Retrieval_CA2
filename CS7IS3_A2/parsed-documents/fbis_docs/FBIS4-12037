Could you tell us about his opinion? [Al-Hasan] After the massacre that Israel committed at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron during the month of Ramadan, His Majesty King Husayn made several contacts about this subject with his brother Arab leaders in Morocco, Syria, Egypt, and with President Yasir 'Arafat. He also contacted U.S. President Bill Clinton to keep the resolution intact and to avoid any abstention or veto against this resolution. The resolution was indeed passed with a U.S. abstention on two paragraphs in the preamble related to the occupied Arab territories and Jerusalem. Thanks to the efforts made by his majesty and the Jordanian Government in this regard, we believe that the resolution contained a series of positive points that satisfied the demands of the Palestinian side, particularly with respect to the protection of the Palestinian people, the disarming of the settlers, and providing international protection in the occupied territories. It is true that the matter needs to be followed up. We believe that the implementation of this resolution requires Arab and international efforts to enforce the executive measures contained in this resolution, which includes a paragraph urging the UN secretary general to follow up the matter and calling upon the cosponsors of the peace process to implement the measures contained in the resolution. [Hijazi] Do you believe that the recent Israeli arbitrary practices are harmful to the Gaza-Jericho agreement signed between the PLO and Israel? And could this agreement be implemented on schedule on 13 April? [Al-Hasan] First of all, we in Jordan condemn any terrorist or arbitrary practices by Israel, because this does not serve the peace process. As for the Gaza-Jericho agreement, our position is clear. Although we were not a party to this agreement and had no prior knowledge of it, Jordan backed this agreement, in support of the Palestinian brothers, out of a desire to highlight the Palestinian identity, and out of respect for the independent Palestinian decision as well as of the historic responsibility undertaken by the PLO, in its capacity as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Our backing for this agreement constitutes a real contribution to giving impetus to the peace process. We have always said that the Palestinian track is the core of the peace process. Despite the fact that we had almost reached an agreement with the Israeli side, we preferred to wait until the Palestinian brothers managed to make progress along their own track. When the Palestinian and Israeli sides reached an agreement and the PLO and Israel mutually recognized each other and the Declaration of Principles was concluded on 13 September 1993 in Washington, the next day we endorsed the agenda [of talks with Israel]; that is, on 14 September. [Hijazi] So do you expect that this initial stage will be implemented on 13 April despite the Israeli practices? [Al-Hasan] We hope that Israel will refrain from undertaking such practices to make room for peace. We hope that the brother Palestinians will accomplish their goal; namely, to find a solution acceptable to them. Then, we will have done our duty of respecting the Palestinian decision and will, as reflected by their legitimate leadership.
