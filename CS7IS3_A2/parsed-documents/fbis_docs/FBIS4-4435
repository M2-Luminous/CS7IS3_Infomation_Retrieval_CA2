The Burmese Government said both sides had a frank and cordial exchange of views, explained their own positions, and discussed their differences of opinion. This is the second round of cease-fire talks; the first was held last December. According to Rangoon public opinion, the Burmese military leaders did not expect to reach a cease-fire agreement at the present talks. The next round of talks are scheduled to be held in Moulmein before the end of next month, but the Mon group does not seem too eager about the talks. According to sources among the ethnic groups at the Thai-Burmese border, the talks ended when it became clear that Burmese Government troops will not be withdrawn from Mon-controlled areas -- a matter the Mon group has been pursuing since the end of the first round of talks with the Burmese Government last year. According to Burmese and Mon sources, the main topic of discussion was border demarcation. It seems the Mons have exaggerated the region they claim to control. The Burmese military government delegates -- although not objecting outright -- say the cease-fire implementation should be based on the areas presently controlled by both sides, a stance they have maintained all along. The cease-fire agreement will officially recognize the end of military operations; troop withdrawal should not interfere with it. The government side pointed out that the withdrawal of troops will be the last thing discussed. Five senior Mon officials from the New Mon State Party [NMSP] arrived in Bangkok from Moulmein yesterday and had dinner with the Burmese military attache last night. According to Mon sources, the parties will meet again in (?Ranong) on the Thai-Burmese border in a few days to discuss the outcome of the Moulmein talks and draw up future programs, with more talks expected in the near future. Burmese Government officials have always accepted that it was never easy to hold talks with internal ethnic rebel organizations. Discussions were held on many occasions for more than a year before the cease-fire agreement was signed with the Kachins. The NMSP does not expect the cease-fire talks to take that long, but both sides agree that more talks are needed before the cease-fire agreement is signed. According to responsible Burmese Government personnel, the second round of peace talks with the Karenni National Development Party is scheduled to be held soon in Loikaw, capital of Karenni State. The first round of talks was held in January. Another Karenni group, the Karenni National People's Liberation Front, announced they had agreed on a regional cease-fire in February, but responsible Burmese Government officials claim the Karenni group has not yet made any such arrangements.
