FBIS4-57822 "drlat101_b_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-101 Daily Report 24 May 1994 Dominican Republic Haiti FRAPH Urges Mobilization To Oppose U.S. FRAPH Urges Mobilization To Oppose U.S. FL2405163194 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 24 May 94 FL2405163194 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Text] On 23 May, Haiti's main neo-Duvalierist group Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, FRAPH, called on its militants to mobilize and oppose by arms any attempted U.S. invasion of Haiti. Emmanuel Constant, secretary general of this party, said during a news conference that in case of a U.S. invasion, FRAPH would automatically become the Haitian People's Armed Revolutionary Front [Front Revolutionnaire Arme du Peuple Haitien]. Condemning any and all invasion plans, Constant explained that FRAPH militants would fight invaders with machetes, sticks, and stones [if need be]. Claiming to draw its inspiration from the center-right but not from the extreme-right, which is made up of rich and heartless people, Constant asked the government of Provisional President Emile Jonassaint -- which is not recognized by the international community -- to practice true, non-demagogic social justice. Constant also pointed out that UN Security Council Resolution No. 917, which imposes a total embargo on the country, calls for the resignation of Police chief Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Michel Francois, while the Governors Island agreement and the parliamentary plan for solving the crisis provided only for his transfer within the Army. Let us listen to Emmanuel Constant. [Begin Constant recording] In spite of the gestures of good will made by all sectors in Haiti, including the political, people's, military, civilian, professional, and private sectors -- and the parliamentarians surpassed themselves -- the cartel made up of Aristide, Barnes, Casimir, and the Black Caucus wants to keep killing people by imposing a genocidal embargo on Haiti as of 21 May. The government of the president of the Republic, attorney Emile Jonassaint, must be able to restore order and discipline immediately so that social justice can reign in Haiti. His ministers -- regardless of whether or not they have experience -- should immediately effect administrative and judicial reforms and set up an emergency program aimed at helping the population, in view of this genocidal Resolution No. 917 of the UN Security Council. [end recording] But this is not all. FRAPH's organization secretary made proposals to the Haitian Army. Let us listen. [Begin Constant recording] FRAPH wishes the Haitian Armed Forces not to receive any foreign or local mediators, because the Army is a branch of the executive and cannot negotiate with itself. FRAPH wishes the military to work toward the professionalization of the Army and the improvement of the working and living conditions of Haitian soldiers, and to withdraw completely from this negotiation dossier.
