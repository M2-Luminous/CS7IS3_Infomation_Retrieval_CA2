I believe that this is an explosion of their indignation against traitor Kim Yong-sam, the worst betrayer of the nation, who is flagrantly running amok to pursue confrontation and war maneuvers. Therefore, I would like to talk about the maneuvers of traitor Kim Yong-sam who pursues confrontation and war by running counter to the national demand for reunification. [Kim Myong] Speaking of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, originally, he was the most heinous anti-reunification element and separatist who used to make absurd remarks that there will be neither freedom nor prosperity if this country is reunified, and that it will be more painful to live in the state of reunification without freedom nor prosperity than to live in the state of division. Such attitude of the traitor Kim Yong-sam clique's shows that he is more persistently clinging to the skirt of outside forces and is running amok to pursue the criminal North-South confrontation and the Northward invasion maneuvers. Such act would put the previous warmongers to shame. [No] As is known, last year we proposed a 10-point program for a great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the fatherland and urged the South Korean rulers to suspend their confrontation and war maneuvers and to return to the road of the national reconciliation and unity and the national independence. However, they refused our friendly proposal and walked the road against us. In order words, the traitor Kim Yong-sam clique has viciously inspired a spirit of confrontation between the fellow countrymen by saying at every opportunity in a so-called meeting of the Army commanders or in his New Year's address that South Korea must be ready for an emergency situation. Some time ago, they kicked up another provocative commotion at a meeting of the so- called Emergency Planning Committee, talking about the resumption of a posture to prepare for an emergency situation. [Kim] You are right. We cannot forgive him today because of the fact that the Kim Yong-sam clique is attempting to carry out the so-called international cooperation system and international sanctions in order to crush [apsal] our Republic by relying on the might of outside forces. Some time ago, he announced that he would make efforts to improve relations with the North based on view of the fact that it is the same nation, but he behaved himself disgracefully by begging the United States to exercise a powerful influence against us and to carry out the international cooperation system with South Korea, while even providing South Korean rice markets to the United States. He even visited the United States for this. [No] You are right. The Kim Yong-sam clique has made warmanic and absurd remarks by saying that he is ready to take military countermeasures [kunsajok taeung] against us under the pretext of the nuclear issue. He does everything to inspire the spirit of the North-South confrontation and has created the spirit of northward invasion by touring the puppet military units. [Kim] You are right. The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique has not only pursued the North-South confrontation but has also been frantic to bring the flame of war to the heads of our nation. The Kim Yong- sam clique, who responded to our proposal for exchange of special envoys of the top authorities of the two sides by resuming the Team Spirit joint military exercise with outside forces, has conducted a great number of aggressive war exercises up to date. According to a military source, a few days ago, the Kim Yong-sam puppets conducted war exercises in the areas of Kyonggi Province and South Korea's Kangwon Province -- areas near the Demilitarized Zone -- by firing guns against us. The Kim Yong-sam puppets, who are running amok to the spirit of war, have designed plots to conduct another large-scale war exercise in collusion with outside forces if they fail to conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise. Also, they have maneuvered to introduce Patriot missiles to South Korea. [No] The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique has viciously committed a grave military provocation in the Demilitarized Zone. In fact, their new war provocation plots have been formidable. Because of the confrontation and war maneuvers by the Kim Yong-sam puppets in South Korea, all dialogues between the North and South have broken. Also, big obstacles are being created in the future road of the national reunification with each passing day. The Kim Yong-sam puppets infringe upon even the basic and democratic rights of the South Korean people. On 1 February, they indiscriminately cracked down with their rifles, knives, and tear gas, the struggle of farmers, youths, and students who rose up to wage demonstrations against the opening of the agricultural market. They arrested approximately 400 farmers, youths, and students there. Even now, they are putting the whole area of South Korea into a warlike atmosphere of terror. [Kim] You are right. The Kim Yong-sam clique is the worst traitor of the nation, as well as the vicious fascist warmonger. The fact that the South Korean people from all walks of life are fighting against the Kim Yong-sam clique under the slogan "Let Us Overthrow the Civilian Government" is very just. Therefore, the Kim Yong-sam clique must receive national punishment. He is running amok to pursue the North-South confrontation and the war plot for the northward invasion under the cloak of a civilian government. I can say that this is to extend his dirty life even one more day by persistently relying on outside forces. However, this is a miscalculation. As shown by history, confrontation and war maneuvers are the shameful road to destruction. The Kim Yong-sam clique must be aware of the masses' aspiration and historical lessons and act with discretion. [No] Army officers and soldiers in South Korea will clearly see the last days of the Kim Yong-sam clique, who is hastily running amok to the road of destruction, while standing on the side of the masses and making efforts for the national harmony and unity. [Kim] You are right.
