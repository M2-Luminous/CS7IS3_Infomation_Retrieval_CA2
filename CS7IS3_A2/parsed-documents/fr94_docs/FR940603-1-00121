The Owner and the Administrator shall have the right to inspect all payrolls, invoices of materials, and other data and records of the Bidder and of any subcontractor, relevant to the construction of the Project. The Bidder shall provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests. The Bidder shall have an authorized agent accompany the Engineer when final inspection is made and, if requested by the owner, when any other inspection is made. d. In the event that the Owner, or the Administrator, shall determine that the construction contains or may contain numerous defects, it shall be the duty of the Bidder and the Bidder's Surety or Sureties, if any, to have an inspection made by an engineer approved by the Owner and the Administrator for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent and location of such defects. e. The Engineer may recommend to the Owner that the Bidder suspend the work wholly or in part for such period or periods as the Engineer may deem necessary due to unsuitable weather or such other conditions as are considered unfavorable for the satisfactory prosecution of the work or because of the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions of the Contract: Provided, however, that the Bidder shall not suspend work pursuant to this provision without written authority from the Owner so to do. The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number of days of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Bidder with the consent of the Owner, the Bidder before resuming work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours notice thereof in writing. Section 7. Defective Materials and Workmanship. a. The acceptance of any materials, equipment (except owner-furnished materials) or any workmanship by the Owner or the Engineer shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof if such materials, equipment, or workmanship shall be found to be defective after delivery or installation, and any such materials, equipment or workmanship found defective before final acceptance of the construction shall be replaced or remedied, as the case may be, by and at the expense of the Bidder. Any such condemned material or equipment shall be immediately removed from the site of the Project by the Bidder at the Bidder's expense. The Bidder shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long as any defective materials, equipment or workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the Bidder shall have had notice, shall not have been replaced or remedied, as the case may be. b. Notwithstanding any certificate which may have been given by the Owner or the Engineer, if any materials, equipment (except owner-furnished materials) or any workmanship which does not comply with the requirements of this Contract shall be discovered within one (1) year after Completion of Construction of the Project, the Bidder shall replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy any such defective workmanship within thirty (30) days after notice in writing of the existence thereof shall have been given by the Owner. If the Bidder shall be called upon to replace any defective materials or equipment or to remedy defective workmanship as herein provided, the Owner, if so requested by the Bidder shall deenergize that portion of the Project involved in such work. In the event of failure by the Bidder so to do, the Owner may replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy such defective workmanship, as the case maybe, and in such event the Bidder shall pay to the Owner the cost and expense thereof. ARTICLE III_PAYMENTS AND RELEASE OF LIENS Section 1. Payments to Bidder. a. Within the first fifteen (15) days of each calendar month, the Owner shall make partial payment to the Bidder for construction accomplished during the preceding calendar month on the basis of completed Construction Units furnished and certified to by the Bidder, recommended by the Engineer, and approved by the Owner solely for the purposes of payment: Provided, however, that such approval shall not be deemed approval of the workmanship or materials. Only ninety percent (90%) of each such estimate approved during the construction of the Project shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder prior to Completion of the Project: Provided, however, that at any time after work, which, in the sole determination of the Engineer, amounts to fifty percent (50%) of the maximum Contract price has been completed, the Owner may elect, in lieu of paying ninety percent (90%) of each such subsequent estimate, to pay each such subsequent estimate in full. Upon completion by the Bidder of the construction of the Project, the Engineer will prepare an inventory of the Project showing the total number and character of Construction Units and, after checking such inventory with the Bidder, will certify it to the Owner together with a certificate of the total cost of the construction performed. Upon the approval of such certificates by the Owner and the Administrator, the Owner shall make payment to the Bidder of all amounts to which the Bidder shall be entitled thereunder which shall not have been paid, provided, however, that such final payment shall be made not later than ninety (90) days after the date of Completion of Construction of the Project as specified in the Certificate of Completion, unless withheld because of the fault of the Bidder.
