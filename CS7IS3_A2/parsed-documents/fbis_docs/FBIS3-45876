Meeting with Ninagawa Chikayoshi, the outgoing general manager of the BMCC yesterday, Chen said that the expansion of the joint venture reflects the friendship between the two countries. Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing, praised the general manager for his contribution to the venture's development. The company, with a total investment of 500 million yuan, went into operation in July 1989. It has so far produced 7.42 million color cathode ray tubes, and earned 4.52 billion yuan from sales with a net income of 1.03 billion yuan. Chinese Premier Li Peng inspected the venture twice soon after it went into operation and encouraged it to become a top enterprise. The BMCC plans to turn out 2.84 million color tubes this year, and its sales income is expected to exceed 2.2 billion yuan, up 560,000 and 700 million yuan from the 1993 figures, respectively. The company will also improve its second assembly line to produce 170,000 high-clarity tubes by the end of the year.
