The talks were deadlocked when Ankara decided that the Tehran regime's demands for the handing over of Ocalan to Turkish officials would create a very serious situation for Turkey. The talks between the two countries began after Turkey established where Osman Ocalan lived in Iran. Ankara contacted the Iranian officials to have Ocalan returned to Turkey after the Turkish officials established where he lived in Tehran and Qom. The Tehran regime seemed willing during the initial stages of the talks, which were also attended by Syrian officials from time to time, to agree to return Ocalan to Turkey. However, Iran later put forward excessive demands. The Iranian officials first asked that all Iranian citizens in Turkey who opposed the Tehran regime be returned to Iran and prevented from using Turkey's territory for their activities. But that was not all. The Iranian officials also asked that Mustafa Hejri, secretary general of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan in Iran, be returned to that country. Ankara officially informed Tehran that Hejri does not live in Turkey. It was ascertained during the talks that the Tehran regime planned to execute their opponents without a trial as soon as they were returned. The matter was assessed in several meetings in Ankara and the view that the executions, which would take place at gallows set up in the streets of Tehran, would create a very strong reaction in Western countries, including the United States, and cause Turkey to be blamed gained weight. It was also stressed that the PKK may take such events as an opportunity to launch a campaign against Turkey, in which it would accuse the Turkish Government of "returning innocent civilians to be executed in Iran." In view of all that, the Turkish officials have decided to suspend their talks with the Iranian officials "for the time being." However, regardless of the deadlock, Turkey has not abandoned its demand for the return of Ocalan, who is suffering from a serious kidney trouble.
