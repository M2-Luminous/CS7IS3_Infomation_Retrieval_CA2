FBIS3-32386 "drlat025_c_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 MEXICO Defense Secretariat Denies Air Force Bombed in Chiapas PA0402141194 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2105 GMT 2 Feb 94 PA0402141194 Mexico City NOTIMEX Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Mexico City, 2 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Military authorities have said there were no "bombings" in the confrontation with the armed group in the Mexican southeastern state of Chiapas, and they rejected media reports alluding to such alleged actions. The National Defense Secretariat stated: "The reported `bombings' never took place, and the proof of this is that there is not any evidence of such actions" in the conflict area. The Secretariat pointed out that the effects of aerial bombs cannot be hidden because of the degree of destruction they would cause on any type of terrain, "particularly in populated areas." Military authorities assigned to the conflict zone have taken journalists to places where, according to media reports, the Air Force had "bombed the civilian population," and the journalists were able to confirm that nothing of that sort had occurred. In a communique, the Secretariat discussed the actions conducted by the Air Force during the confrontation with the armed group. All military actions were suspended entirely on 12 January following the cease-fire ordered by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The Secretariat indicated that the Air Force's planes and helicopters carried out reconnaissance and meteorological flights, transportation of personnel, and shipment of provisions to soldiers and civilians, in addition to rescue and evacuation operations in isolated areas. The Secretariat also noted that the Air Force provided "direct support to soldiers in unpopulated areas by opening machine-gun fire and by firing rockets in efforts to combat pincer and ambush operations" set up by the armed group against military personnel. Military authorities indicated that by reiterating these statements issued on 11 January, they seek to reject any references to presumed "bombings" and "heavy activity by military airplanes." The communique stated that: "With these statements, the National Defense Secretariat rejects categorically and strongly the occurrence of any `bombings' in the Chiapas conflict, attacks in populated areas or attempts to damage personal property." The situation in the conflict area has become relatively calm and favorable because a direct dialogue appears "imminent" between Chiapas Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis and the so-called Zapatist National Liberation Army, which began the conflict on 1 January.
