Now is not the time to point out and assign blame for the mistakes which, to a great extend, caused the current development in the issue. Anyway, it has been stressed many times in this column that all our political parties, either in the government or opposition, are equally responsible for the current situation. Recalling the handling of the Skopje issue is particularly harmful today. First, because it keeps the Skopje issue on the level of unproductive and disorienting disputes among the political parties. Second, because the next phase of the issue is the most critical one since it will definitely lead to a certain "solution" to the issue. Consequently, this phase calls for a new national policy that will be free of past mistakes. In order to correctly draw this new Greek policy, it is necessary to examine the current development from Skopje's point of view. The leaders of the little state may, at this time, feel the satisfaction of a victory. But what is this victory composed of? It means recognition by the international community as a state entity, but with a temporary name. As a result, the name chosen by Skopje is still negotiable. Of course this rarely happens in world history, but it is not the first time. Therefore, Skopje's leaders should know that their victory in the battle for the name, which they fought for three years, is not at all final. However, beyond this battle, which continues, Skopje has to fight the real war of its survival as a state entity. This war is not won by capitalizing on some international coincidences, or by capitalizing on occasional diplomatic expediencies. In order to support and reinforce the little state's atrophic capabilities, there must be permanent and stable props in the nearby geopolitical area to safeguard its territorial integrity, overcome the congenital hazards born of its racial diversity and create a basic, political, economic and social structure that will allow its survival. Mr. Gligorov and those around him know well that only Greece, in the Balkans, can offer this substantial--not typical--"certificate of existence" to Skopje. If they have not understood this reality, all the worse for them. Based on these facts, our country, too, should decide its future moves. It has nothing to loose by returning to the dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations, after Skopje accepts the conditions for "restoration of confidence" set by the international community. So, let discussion for the overall solution of the issue, including the issue of Skopje's name, take place at the United Nations. Following de jure recognition of its permanent name, Skopje should make sure to secure what has been mentioned above and overcome the conditions that make its de facto existence uncertain and temporary.
