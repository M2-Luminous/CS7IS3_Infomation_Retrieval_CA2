In a statement to the media, Vincent underscored that "Poland is an important and prospective partner" for the North Atlantic Treaty. According to him, the issue of Partnership for Peace, which was discussed during his meeting with the defense minister, is neither a substitute issue nor an attempt to avoid a direct response to the issue of Poland's membership in NATO. In response to the question of whether NATO can make technical data and information concerning air defense systems available to Poland, Vincent said that all these issues are on the list of priorities for implementation within the framework of closer cooperation and bringing Poland closer to NATO. "We want to understand each other better at the military level; we want to create operational effectiveness for cooperation," the field marshal added. The aforementioned air defense systems are very important for Poland's security, but they are very expensive. Kolodziejczyk said that Vincent "is encouraging us to work extensively on a review document, which we should start negotiating in Brussels soon," to conclude a bilateral agreement between Poland and NATO and to join the Partnership for Peace program. According to Kolodziejczyk, bilateral cooperation between Poland and the members of NATO is a "good start for the implementation of the initiative."
