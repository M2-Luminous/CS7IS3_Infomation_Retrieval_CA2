In a letter obtained Saturday [16 April] by KYODO NEWS SERVICE, the Red Army members remarked, "As a neighboring nation, Japan should not be conspiring with the United States but making efforts for dialogue and peace (with North Korea)." The letter indicated that a declaration with the same content was sent to an influential member of the government's ruling coalition. The U.S., along with Seoul and Tokyo, has been urging Pyongyang to comply with international nuclear safeguards accords and permit inspections of its nuclear facilities suspected of being part of an arms development program. The U.S. has lobbied for a U.N. resolution calling for North Korea's compliance with the inspections, but at China's urging last month, the U.N. Security Council adopted a nonbinding presidential statement asking Pyongyang to be more open with its program. With discussion about possibly imposing economic sanctions on North Korea under way in the United Nations, Japanese national security authorities suggested the letter was part of a propaganda campaign against Japan in connection with last Friday's 82nd birthday of North Korean leader Kim Il-song. In 1970, nine Japan Red Army members commandeered a JAL Boeing 727, known as "Yodo," to Pyongyang. One of the hijackers has since died in North Korea and another was arrested in 1988 while trying to return to Japan.
