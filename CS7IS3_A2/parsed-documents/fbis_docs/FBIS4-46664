Fugarov; UDC 528:629.783] [Abstract] The passive spacecraft (PSC) Etalon-1 and Etalon-2 were launched into a high circular orbit in 1989 for geodetic and geophysical research. Immediately after the launch Glavkosmos began measurements of the laser ranges to the PSC. The observation network consisted of Ternopol and Yevpatoriya in the west and Maydanak, in the high mountains, in the east. Observations were made only at nighttime in the entire part of the visible arc each 30 minutes. During 1989-1990 ten foreign stations were incorporated into the network (all but one in the northern hemisphere). In the preliminary processing stage corrections were introduced into the measurements to take atmospheric refraction into account without the humidity component and reduction to the center of mass. The accuracy of laser measurements of range by Glavkosmos instruments is 25 cm, but by foreign stations it is a few centimeters. The principal perturbations for the Etalon orbits were gravitational attraction of the Earth, Moon, Sun, planets and radiation pressure. But accuracy requirements dictated allowance for the influence of solar system planets, higher order geopotential harmonics and solar radiation in the shaded sectors of the orbit and radiation reflected from the Earth. Table 1 gives the results of processing of PSC observations. The consistent parameters of the constructed model of motion made it possible to decrease the errors in predicting the parameters of motion of the Etalon PSC by a factor of 1 1/2-2. This model affords a possibility for evaluating different effects such as the influence of solar radiation pressure in shaded sectors of the orbit with allowance for refraction and absorption by the Earth's atmosphere and the influence of radiation reflected from the Earth, taking into account the seasonal-latitudinal change in albedo and other small perturbations.
