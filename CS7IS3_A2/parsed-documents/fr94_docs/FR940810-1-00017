FR940810-1-00017 FR940810-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 685 [Docket No. 940711&hyph;4211; I.D. 050294C] RIN 0648 AF77 Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region; Vessel Monitoring System AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS issues a proposed rule that would implement an experimental vessel monitoring system (VMS) program in the pelagic longline fishery around Hawaii. Under this program, vessels operating in this fishery would have to carry vessel monitoring equipment owned and operated by NMFS. The equipment provides immediate vessel identification and location, and would be used by NMFS and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to facilitate enforcement of regulations that prohibit fishing in closed areas. This experimental program would operate for 3 years or less, during which time the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and NMFS would conduct reviews of the performance and cost effectiveness of the program and make recommendations regarding the future use of VMSs in this and other fisheries. DATES: Comments must be received by September 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the proposed rule should be sent to Rodney R. McInnis, Acting Director, Southwest Region, NMFS, 501 West Ocean Boulevard, Suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Svein Fougner at (310) 980&hyph;4034 or Mr. Eugene F. Proulx at (310) 980&hyph;4049. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Amendment 3 (56 FR 52214, October 18, 1991) to the Fishery Management Plan for the Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region (FMP) created a protected species zone of 50 nautical miles (am) around the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), which is closed to pelagic longline fishing. This action was taken to protect endangered Hawaiian monk seals from longline fishing activity. Amendment 4 (56 FR 51849, October 16, 1991) to the FMP established an administrative procedure to govern the Council's review of VMS technology and possible adoption of VMS requirements for the fishery. This action was taken to develop an effective way of monitoring longline fishing vessels without placing excessive restrictions on fishermen. Amendment 5 (57 FR 7661, March 4, 1992) to the FMP created closed areas to pelagic longline fishing around the main Hawaiian Islands to prevent gear conflicts between pelagic longline and small-boat fishermen. The closed areas are generally within 75 nm of the Islands of Kauai, Niihau, and Oahu, and within 50 nm of the Islands of Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, and Hawaii and vary in size on a seasonal basis. Further adjustments may be made through an administrative procedure that includes an opportunity for public comment. Because the longline fleet has been growing rapidly, Amendment 7 (59 FR 26979, May 25, 1994) established a limited entry program for the Hawaii longline fishery for pelagic species in order to prevent adverse impacts on pelagic resources, protected species such as the Hawaiian monk seal and sea turtles, and other fishing vessels. Patrolling area closures is an expensive and difficult task for NMFS enforcement agents and the USCG. The distances that have to be covered are large, and there is minimal logistic support for patrol aircraft or patrol vessels in the NWHI. Given these enforcement difficulties, NMFS and the USCG have explored alternative methods of monitoring closed areas. One promising alternative is the use of a VMS. A VMS consists of equipment placed aboard a vessel that is capable of transmitting to NMFS and the USCG the identity and location of that vessel. By monitoring these transmissions, illegal fishing by the vessels in closed areas might be detected immediately without using patrol aircraft and vessels. In addition to compliance monitoring, a VMS offers several other potential uses. First, a VMS would enhance at-sea safety by allowing NMFS and the USCG to locate vessels immediately in the event of distress situations. Second, available computer attachments would enable users to either receive or transmit information such as news and weather broadcasts, or personal communications. Finally, in this fishery, consistent with an incidental take statement issued in conjunction with a Biological Opinion dated June 10, 1993, information collected could be used to verify the accuracy of logbook reports, thereby aiding in the conservation of protected species such as threatened and endangered sea turtles. In 1991, the Council, NMFS, and the USCG coordinated a demonstration of several automated vessel monitoring technologies to confirm whether remote communication links would be reliable in the Western Pacific. The purpose of the demonstration was to review the available vessel monitoring technologies for routine enforcement operations and to assist the Council in deciding how VMS could be used for enforcement. This effort helped the Council develop minimum performance criteria to be used for designing a fleet-wide VMS. Each technology that was examined represented a different approach to providing vessel position information.
