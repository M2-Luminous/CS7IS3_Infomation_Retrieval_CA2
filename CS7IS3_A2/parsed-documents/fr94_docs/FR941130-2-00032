FR941130-2-00032 FR941130-2-00018 [Docket No. RP95&hyph;51&hyph;000] Overthrust Pipeline Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff November 23, 1994. Take notice that on November 21, 1994, Overthrust Pipeline Company, tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1&hyph;A, First Revised Sheet No. 69 and Second Revised Sheet No. 70, to be effective December 1, 1994. Overthrust states that Commission acceptance of the proposed tariff sheets will enable it to resolve customer concerns by conforming crediting for volumetric releases with crediting for reservation-charge capacity releases. Questar seeks Commission waiver of 18 CFR 154.22 so that the proposed tariff revision may become effective December 1, 1994. Questar explains that the requested effective date will allow sufficient time for implementation prior to the January 15, 1995, billings, thereby enabling Overthrust to serve its customers more effectively and efficiently. Overthrust states further that this filing was served upon its customers and the Wyoming Public Service Commission. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC, 20426, in accordance with Rules 385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before December 1, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
