In a broadcast monitored in Tokyo by the SHIN-A NEWS AGENCY, O said North Korea took the "defensive measure of pulling out of the IAEA and will never again permit inspections" because of the agency's "arrogant and insolent" demands for nuclear checks. The broadcast comes as IAEA officials are pointing out that despite North Korea's announcement Monday that it was pulling out of the agency, it is still subject to nuclear inspections by the IAEA under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. O's speech was made at a welcome reception for a Vietnamese military delegation visiting Pyongyang, led by Defense Minister Gen. Doan Khue, SHIN-A reported.
