FBIS4-21879 "jptot015__l94044" JPRS-TOT-94-015-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 6 April 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS PFLP Reacts To Report on Habash Bringing Guns Into Jordan PFLP Reacts To Report on Habash Bringing Guns Into Jordan JN0604154594 Amman AL-BILAD in Arabic 6 Apr 94 p 7 JN0604154594 Amman AL-BILAD Arabic BFN [Text] We have received the following letter from 'Abd-al- Rahim Malluh, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], reacting to a news report published under the headline "Weapons Seized in Habash's Car." The text of the letter follows: Mr. Ra'id Salihah, Editor of AL-BILAD newspaper, Greetings: Issue Number 61, dated 9 March, 1994, of AL-BILAD published the following in the center of the front page, under the headline "Weapons Seized in Habash's Car:" "The Jordanian version says that during Habash's recent visit to Jordan, his car was searched and found to contain miscellaneous weapons and silencers. Meanwhile, security agencies have begun stepping up surveillance at Jordan's border points to thwart any gun-smuggling attempts, especially after the two movie theater bombings." [see item JN0803210694 in 15 March Terrorism Report] This report carried by your newspaper is baseless and only seeks to discredit comrade Secretary General George Habash. Such rumors are calculated to harm Palestinian-Jordanian relations and to resurrect the events of the past [the September, 1970 clashes that pitted Palestinian guerrillas against the Jordanian military]. [passage omitted] The charge that George Habash sought to smuggle weapons is absolutely baseless, and state agencies in Jordan can confirm this. Dr. Habash is a sufficiently credible and self-respecting person not to abuse the special privileges offered him by the state authorities during his visits to compromise the country's security and stability. We cannot make sense out of the connection you made between the fabricated report and the movie theater bombings and the subsequent measures taken by the Jordanian authorities unless the aim is to discredit the PFLP, and George Habash in particular, and the factions of the Palestinian revolution in general. We have consistently come out against any actions designed to undermine Jordan's security, including the barbaric bombings of the movie houses. For the record, on his last visit here on 23 February, 1994, Dr. Habash was not subjected to any searches at the border, and was treated with all the respect due a national patriot.
