On February 9, the NATO council threatened to launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs unless they withdrew their heavy artillery 20 kilometres from the centre of Sarajevo within ten days. The unprovoked ultimatum is based on two false premises, the first being that the Bosnian Serbs are responsible for the massacre in Sarajevo on February 5 and the second that the Bosnian Serb Army is keeping Sarajevo under siege, the RSK ministry said in the note, which also includes a declaration of the RSK Parliament on solidarity with the Serbs in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina adopted on Saturday. All well-meaning people have realised that only the Moslem authorities in that part of the city could have caused the explosion, the note says. "The untruth that Sarajevo is under a Serb seige has been fostered over the past two years by the Western media and it now seems beyond question. The truth, however, is different because the city is actually divided on Serb and Moslem parts which are both contiguous to their respective states," the RSK Foreign Ministry said in the note. The RSK authorities and Army see NATO's ultimatum as a hostile act also against the RSK, which is ready to help the Bosnian Serb Republic in its defence from a possible aggression, it said. The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in the Serb-populated areas within the administrative borders of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and the attempt to downgrade the status of the Serbs from that of the constituent people to that of an ethnic minority. In March 1992, the RSK territory was proclaimed a United Nations Protected Area (UNPA).
