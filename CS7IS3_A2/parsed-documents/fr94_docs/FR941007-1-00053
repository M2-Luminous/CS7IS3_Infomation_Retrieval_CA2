FR941007-1-00053 FR941007-1-00009 The December proposal would have made a distinction between the ability of an institution to claim credit under the lending test for indirect loans by its subsidiaries and funded non-chartered affiliates and its ability to claim credit for indirect loans made by other lenders. An institution would have been able to claim credit for lending by its subsidiaries or non-chartered affiliates if the institution either invested in the entity or made a loan to it. For third party lenders, however, the institution would have been required to make an investment in the entity (as opposed to making a loan to the entity) in order to claim credit under the lending test for the third party loans. The purpose of this distinction was to recognize the unique relationship between an institution and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and to give institutions and their parent corporations greater flexibility to structure their lending as they saw fit. While the foregoing factors would have served as the basis for a rating under the lending test, the December proposal would have allowed the agencies to adjust an institution's assessment upward, and, in exceptional cases, downward. Upward adjustment might have been warranted if the institution made, for example, a substantial amount of loans requiring innovative underwriting or loans for which there was special need, such as loans for multifamily housing construction and rehabilitation, loans for start-up or very small businesses, loans to community development organizations or facilities, or loans to very low-income individuals and geographies. An institution's assessment also could have been increased if it operated a ``second look'' program to reevaluate loan applications that, based on an initial review, the institution had planned to deny. On the other hand, a downward adjustment could have been warranted if, for example, the quantitative measures inaccurately portrayed the institution's actual lending to low- or moderate-income geographies or individuals. Commenters from both the banking industry and the public believed the lending test contained in the December proposal was too narrow in its focus. In particular, some believed the test gave insufficient emphasis to community development lending and innovative underwriting. Other commenters noted that the proposed lending test placed undue emphasis on the location of the borrower rather than on the borrower's individual characteristics ( e.g., income). Some commenters believed the December proposal would have given institutions a greater incentive to make loans to high-income borrowers located in low-income geographies than to make loans to low-income borrowers located in high-income geographies. In response to commenters who believed the December proposal underemphasized the importance of community development lending, the revised proposal would treat such lending as a principal component of an institution's lending performance, not merely an adjustment factor. The revised proposal also defines community development loans. Such loans are loans (including lines of credit, commitments and letters of credit) that address affordable housing or other community economic development needs not being met by the private market, provided such loans (1) Principally benefit low- or moderate-income individuals, businesses or small farms with annual revenues less than or equal to $1 million, or businesses or farms that qualify as small businesses under a Small Business Administration program; (2) have not been reported or collected by the bank or one of its affiliates as home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, or consumer loans for CRA purposes, unless the loans are for multifamily dwellings (as defined in the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) (12 U.S.C. 2801 et seq. ) regulations); and (3) except in the case of a wholesale or limited purpose bank, benefit the bank's service area(s) or a broader statewide or regional area that includes the bank's service area(s). This definition clarifies that community development loans deserving of favorable consideration are those that fill a void left by the ordinary operation of the private market. In addition, it is designed to prevent double-counting of all loans except for multifamily housing loans, which the agencies believe should be considered both in the distribution analyses of an institution's home mortgage lending and for evaluation of its community development lending in order to properly evaluate the value of the loans for CRA purposes. Finally, the definition also provides that an institution will get favorable consideration for a community development loan if it is in the institution's service area or is in a broader region that includes the institution's service area. This broader geographic scope would recognize the nature of some lending programs and consortia that produce these loans. An institution would be evaluated based on the number, amount, complexity, and innovativeness of its community development loans. 1 1 Examples of community development loans identified by the agencies include, but are not limited to, loans to: borrowers in support of affordable housing rehabilitation and contruction, including construction and permanent financing of multifamily rental property serving low- and moderate-income persons; not-for-profit organizations serving primarily low- and moderate-income housing or other community economic development needs; borrowers in support of community facilities in low- and moderate-income areas or that primarily benefit low- and moderate-income individuals; and financial intermediaries including, but not limited to, Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Community Development Corporations (CDCs), minority- and women-owned financial institutions, and low-income or community development credit unions that primarily lend or facilitate lending in low- and moderate-income areas or to low- and moderate-income individuals in order to promote affordable housing and/or community economic development.
