Mr. Abou also noted that such an agreement would create the correct impetus, as he put it, toward achieving an overall Cyprus solution. In a statement after his meeting with Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis this morning, Mr. Abou described the contacts he had with President Glavkos Kliridhis and Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, as very important in view of the report on the Cyprus issue he will prepare for the EU's Council of Ministers. Responding to a question on the CBM's compatibility with EU norms, Mr. Abou said that the United Nations has assured him that there is no problem. Nevertheless, he added there is no easy answer to this issue. Answering another question on Turkey's stance, he noted that during his recent visit to that country he received assurances that Turkey desires a Cyprus solution.
