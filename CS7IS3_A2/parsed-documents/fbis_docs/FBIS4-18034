This was reported in an interview with Interfax by the chairman of the committee Aleksandr Piskunov. He also heads a working group for the classified part of the government-made draft of the federal budget which includes defense spending. Piskunov said the need for addressing the president was prompted by the conclusions drawn by his group and by the Wednesday meeting with representatives of the leading munitions company Barrikady from Volgograd. According to Piskunov, the working group compared government estimates concerning the defense budget for 1994 with actual spending during the first quarter. It discovered that during the first three months of the year the debt of the Defense Ministry to the defense industry increased from 2.1 to 4.7 trillion rubles. Proceeding from this it is suggested spending 55 trillion rubles on defence in 1994. In this case, Piskunov said, it would be possible to support the presidential proposal on spending ten percent of the defense budget on research and testing. Overall investments in the defence industry would then go up from 20.7 to 28 percent of the general volume of defense spending, which would be a return to the 1992 situation. At the same time the working group invited the Defense Ministry to take emergency steps to stabilize the situation in the armed forces. According to Piskunov, this could be achieved through minimizing defense spending this year through stopping the contract system for privates and retired officers and changing the whole system of military training proceeding from actual needs. Besides, combat units should be fully staffed and their combat capability should be guaranteed by taking the remaining units into reserves or disbanding them.
