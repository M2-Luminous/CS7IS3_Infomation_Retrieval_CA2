This Agreement applies only once to each resettler. The Signatories consider any coercion of persons to resettle intolerable. Article 2 The terms used in this Agreement have the following meanings: a) a "resettler" is a person who voluntarily leaves the state of his permanent residence and moves to a permanent place of residence on the territory of a different state; b) "members of the resettler's family" are the wife (or husband), parents, and underage children as well as other relatives or disabled dependents who live with the resettler and keep a common household with him; c) the "state of exit" is the former state of permanent residence; d) the "state of entry" is the new state of permanent residence. Article 3 This Agreement does not apply to the following: a) refugees; b) migrant workers; c) persons convicted of committing a crime who have served the time; d) persons whose departure will damage the security of the state of exit, until the circumstances preventing the departure cease to be in effect; e) persons whose departure has been postponed until they fulfill property obligations to state, cooperative, public, or other organizations or institutions or private persons; f) persons temporarily on the state's territory in connection with studies or private or business trips; g) military personnel who are on active military duty and members of their families. Article 4 Permission to resettle is granted to resettlers by the state of exit in accordance with international law norms and its own laws. Article 5 On their territories, the Signatories provide protection of resettlers and members of their families from any actions in the form of violence, threat, or intimidation or other actions based on gender, race, nationality, language, religion or beliefs, political or other views, ethnic or social origin, or economic, property, or family status either on behalf of state officials or on behalf of private persons, groups, public associations, or other organizations. Article 6 The Signatories' migration services offer the resettlers and their families the following essential information: a) the content of this Agreement; b) their rights and obligations in the state of entry; c) conditions of job placement and the possibility of receiving education, vocational training, retraining, and vocational guidance, as well as other conditions of residing in the state of entry (natural-climatic, housing and domestic, sociocultural, and other conditions). Article 7 Resettlers and members of their families have the following rights: a) to take out all personal property which they personally own that is declared before they leave the state of exit, with consideration of the restrictions applicable to removing cultural treasures which the laws of the state of exit recognize as national treasures; b) to sell or in some other way dispose of property which they personally own and take out of the state of exit or bring into the state of entry the monetary capital received following the announced procedure in any currency and in an unrestricted amount; c) to transfer monetary deposits and assets placed in banking institutions of the state of exit to banking institutions of the state of entry; d) to leave personal property, real estate, monetary deposits, and assets belonging to them with the rights of ownership on the territory of the state of exit and execute the right of possession, use, and disposal. The state of exit assumes the expenditures for transferring monetary deposits and assets through banking institutions authorized to do so. Personal property and real estate may not be alienated by the authorities of the state of exit on the basis of the fact that the owner of it is a person who permanently resides outside the state's borders and is not a citizen of the state of exit. Article 8 The Signatories grant the right of ownership of this property to resettlers who are members of housing, housing construction, dacha, or garage construction cooperatives, orchard and garden partnerships, or other cooperatives who have made their full share contribution for the apartment, dacha, garden shed, garage, or other premises or structure offered to them to use. In the event the house, dacha, garden shed, or other structure is sold or transferred to another physical or legal person, the right to use the land parcel passes completely to the new owner. Resettlers are granted the right to pay the share contribution for property offered for use ahead of time and perfect their right of ownership of this property. Article 9 In relation to state, municipal, or departmental housing, the state of exit grants the resettlers and members of their families the right to make deals with physical and legal persons to use the housing occupied by the resettlers. Capital obtained as a result of the deal is the property of the resettler. The resettlers realize the possession, use, and disposal of property under their ownership in full. Civil law disputes regarding property located on the territory of the state of exit between resettlers and members of their families, on the one hand, and concerned persons, on the other, are resolved in a legal proceeding on the territory of the state of exit and in accordance with its laws and this Agreement. The competent organs of the state of entry consider the decisions of the courts of the state of exit on these disputes to have gone into legal effect, including for the purpose of execution on the territory of the state of entry. Article 10 The Signatories ensure that resettlers and members of their families are exempted from restrictions on the import and export of their personal property (with the exception of objects which are prohibited from being exported by the law of the state of exit and objects prohibited from being imported by the law of the state of entry), customs duties, taxes, and charges related to this. Monetary capital removed and monetary deposits and assets transferred are exempted from charges and duties, with the exception of those which represent payment for transfer services. Article 11 The state of exit does not prevent resettlers and members of their families from selling or in any other form disposing of housing or other property which they own. The state of entry provides assistance to resettlers and members of their families in setting themselves up to live in the new place of residence. The Signatories do not prevent the exchange of housing between resettlers done in accordance with procedures established by the laws of each state. Article 12 The state of entry may set a yearly resettlement quota by which resettlers and members of their families are given permission to move to this state. The sizes of the quotas are determined by the state of entry independently. The Signatories recognize the right of persons to independently resettle on the territory of one of the states without obtaining permission to move. The provisions of this Agreement do not apply to persons who resettle independently. Article 13 The Signatories entrust coordination of work to resettle persons and monitoring of compliance with this Agreement to the following bodies: the Russian Signatory charges the Federal Migration Service of Russia with doing so; the Kyrgyz Signatory charges the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Labor and Social Protection with doing so. Article 14 The Signatories may open a migration service office in the Russian Federation or the Kyrgyz Republic, as is appropriate.

Article 15 The procedure for resettlers and members of their families to realize rights to social security is regulated by individual agreements. Article 16 In the event the laws of the Russian Federation or the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic envision regulations other than those contained in this Agreement, the norms of this Agreement apply.
