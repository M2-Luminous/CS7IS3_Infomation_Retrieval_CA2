The SAAF member was detained on Tuesday in terms of the military discipline code. He was giving his "full co-operation" in the investigation, a statement said. An SAAF spokesman would not be drawn on suggestions that at least three SAAF members could soon be detained after the theft of what the SAAF called "about 50 light weapons". Police spokesman Evan Johnson said on Wednesday a "large amount" of weapons seemed at this stage to be missing. The exact figure was still being determined through stock checks. All possible motives were being investigated and it was not clear if the thest had a political connotation, Capt Johnson said. A reward of up to R100,000 [rand] had been posted for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. The African National Congress has expressed concern at the regularity of raids on SADF [South African Defense Force] arms depositories, especially in the light of the fact that South African Communist Party General Secretary Chris Hani was assassinated with a weapon stolen from the SADF.
