In particular, he took part in a conference of chairmen of rayon, oblast, and local councils, and between entrepreneurs and businessmen. In his speech Leonid Kravchuk called the local council elections of 26 June an attempt by Ukraine's Supreme Council to put into practice a federative form of territorial state system without having elaborated the necessary legislative base, which could lead to an ungoverned society. Together with Valeriy Shmarov, Ukraine's vice-prime minister, and Yevhen Sukhin, president of the "Ukranaftohaz" [Ukrainian oil and gas] joint-stock holding company, the president of Ukraine also attended the unveiling of a monument to Mykhaylo Hrushevskyy, first president of Ukraine. Later Leonid Kravchuk took part in the traditional Zankivchanski evenings at Lvov's Mariya Zankovetska state academic theater, where he held an improvised press conference. Leonid Kravchuk expressed himself in favor of a presidential-parliamentary republic and in favor of the election of executive, but not representative power. Leonid Kravchuk also noted that, notwithstanding world experience, he would not be influencing the general state process until his probable election. The president noted that in the last few years there had been changes for the better in Ukraine's economy: In the metallurgical industry more had been done in four years than had been done in the 15 years up to 1990, the reconstruction of the oil industry is under way, Ukraine is developing its medical industry, and so on. Describing relations with Russia, he observed that the accusation of Ukraine in isolation from Russia are groundless, because in the time since the independence of both states approximately 70 agreements and documents have been signed, including economic ones too. Namely, Ukraine was the initiator of free trade with Russia. Replying to a question from a UNIAN correspondent about whether Ukraine would agree to concessions to Crimea, Leonid Kravchuk observed that there would not be a single concession regarding Ukraine's territorial integrity and that Crimea would remain a constituent part of Ukraine.
