As a result, the Supreme Council is legally qualified to pass a decision, if 224 deputies are present at the session, rather than 226 as was the case previously. Then ...[pauses] but more than half its constitutional list, which is 226. [sentence as heard] A decision is now passed by a majority of 169 out of the number of people's deputies whose powers are recognized. It was 170 earlier. As for amendments to the Constitution, there remains the same norm as before, which is 300. Decisions on the inclusion of issues on the agenda are passed by a majority of one third of the number of people's deputies, which now is 112. So these norms have been slightly reduced.
