Shelling and small arms fire have not ceased. Christophe Boisbouvier has just phoned General Dallaire, commander of the UN Mission in Rwanda: [Begin recording] [Dallaire] There has been a partial offensive by the RPF in the southeast sector of the town. [Boisbouvier] Have RPF rebels entered the town center? [Dallaire] If you mean the presidential district, no, not as far as I know. I was there part of the day today, and there was no fighting. [Boisbouvier] Do you believe that the rebels will be able to seize the town center and the presidential district? [Dallaire] The RPF continues its operations; it has received reinforcements. What are its aims? Is it to seize this sector? Is it to isolate it? It depends on the resources it managed to get in order to seize the most secure sector of the town. [Boisbouvier] Do you believe that the Rwandan Armed Forces have enough men and artillery to resist for several days? [Dallaire] After seeing the number of men and their preparedness, I believe that they seem very resolute to defend their positions. [Boisbouvier] Are those refugees now in the Hotel des Milles Collines and in the Amahoro stadium being threatened? [Dallaire] The evacuation of those refugees [words indistinct] in the current situation any movement of people would certainly not be a plausible option. Where they are now, they are at least with us. Those staying at the Milles Collines, if they are still there, are with gendarmes and soldiers as well as with UN observers. [end recording]
