Since 1979, when Shenzhen was authorized to become a city, the investment in capital construction has hit 40.6 billion yuan. As a result, the urban area has expanded to 75 square km and thousands of modern buildings have sprung up in the urban area. It is reported that a dozen small residential areas, including the Yuanling, Huangmugang, Buxin, and Binsha residential areas, have been set up in turn, with the per-capita living space reaching 12 square meters. In 1992, residential units measuring a total of 7.5991 million square meters were built in Shenzhen. Li pointed out: Shenzhen reformed the land management system as early as 1987, and took the lead in introducing the state land- leasing system with compensation and tenure, and in freeing the land market. The reforms were affirmed by the central authorities and praised by people at home and abroad. Li maintained that the property development in Shenzhen is relatively normal. The State Council recently sent an inspection group to Shenzhen to find out about the property development and the group did not make any criticism, she said. At the seminar, Li also touched on the value-added land tax, a matter of great public concern. All contracts signed before promulgation of the regulations on the value-added land tax will be implemented according to the original ordinances, she said, adding that the Shenzhen City Government, following the promulgation of state regulations on the value-added land tax, will formulate detailed rules and regulations for its implementation in accordance with state regulations and Shenzhen's actual conditions.
