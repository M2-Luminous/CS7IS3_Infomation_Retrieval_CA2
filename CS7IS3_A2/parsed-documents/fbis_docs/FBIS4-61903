No precise agreements were reached at yesterday's meeting. On Tuesday the sides mainly debated the introduction of peacekeeping forces to the conflict zone. They talked about the option of deploying peacekeeping forces along the confrontation line between the armed formations of the warring sides, situated on the Inguri River. In particular, they discussed how far the troops should be withdrawn from the river in order to create a buffer zone, where peacekeeping forces could then be deployed.
