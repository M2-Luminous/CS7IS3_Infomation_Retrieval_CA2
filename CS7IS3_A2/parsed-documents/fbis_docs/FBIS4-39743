The fourth anniversary since the day that the declaration on the state sovereignty of the Russian Federation was adopted on 12 June, 1990, confirms that the Russian Federation, in acquiring its independence, has been preserved as an integral state and is continuing to grow stronger." This was the stand expressed by Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian President's administration, on the eve of the state holiday. Filatov attributes great significance in the strengthening of the Federation to the working out of a new regional policy, which still has not been reinforced by the constitutions of the Russian republics, by the regulations of the krays and oblasts, and by the law on local administration, which the State Duma is scheduled to adopt in June. According to Filatov, the efforts of the state legal administration and the directorate for work with the territories under the Russian president, as well as of the Ministry for Nationalities and Regional Policy Affairs, will be aimed at equipping the subjects of the Federation with their own legislation. In Filatov's opinion, adopting the bilateral treaty between Russia and Tatarstan -- a document that became the prologue to establishing new relations between the center and the subjects of the Federation -- was an important landmark in strengthening the Russian Federation. Similar agreements will be signed in the near future with Kabardino-Balkaria, Bashkortostan, and Kaliningrad Oblast, and in the future with all subjects of the Federation. Filatov said that it was the purpose of state policy to achieve a "wealthy and uniform standard of living for all the citizens of Russia," which is only attainable in conditions where there is accord in society. To implement the treaty on public accord, to which 854 state, political, and public figures put their signatures to last month, a decree from Boris Yeltsin on the transformation of the public chamber supervised by the Russian president into a conciliatory coordinating body is expected in the near future.
