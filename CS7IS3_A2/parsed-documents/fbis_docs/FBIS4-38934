The press conference completed Klepsch's official three-day visit to Lithuania. Klepsch said the time is right for Lithuania and the EU to make "resolute decisions" on associate membership. In his words, Lithuania's economic progress gives hope that nothing will hinder the process. The European Parliament president once again emphasized that he is pleased with the successful implementation of the troop withdrawal agreement between Lithuania and Russia. This proves, he said, that Lithuania has the ability "to combine common interests" and can become a peace mediator in the Baltic Sea region. Such a role is also predetermined by Lithuania's geographical location, he said. Klepsch expressed hope that the Lithuanian-Russian agreement on the most favored nation trade status will soon come into effect. He also praised the Lithuanian municipal elections law, which was adopted Tuesday. Klepsch said the law meets Western requirements. Commenting on his visit to Lithuania, Klepsch said he obtained much information about different political forces, discussed Lithuania's relations with the European Parliament and cooperation between the three Baltic states.
