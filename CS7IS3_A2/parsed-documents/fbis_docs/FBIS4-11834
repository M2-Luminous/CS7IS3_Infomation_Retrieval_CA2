Engineer Hamid 'Atwah, director of the fair authority, said Israel will not participate in the fair through its own pavilion or through the U.S. pavilion. Israel has not participated in the fair since 1986, following the attack that the "Egypt's Revolution" organization launched on the Israeli pavilion in 1985. Two weeks ago AL-'ARABI quoted diplomatic sources, as well as fair sources, as saying that the government was inclined to allow Israel to participate in the fair by allocating space for it in the U.S. pavilion.
