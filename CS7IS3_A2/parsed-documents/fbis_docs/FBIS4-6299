This was disclosed on 18 April by a diplomatic source familiar with Japan-U.S. relations. According to the diplomatic source, Vice President Gore stressed to Foreign Minister Hata: "North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons is a graver issue for Japanese security than for the United States." During his talks with Foreign Minister Hata, Vice President Gore also said that if North Korea refuses to accept further inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United States may impose its own sanctions against North Korea; he asked for Japan's aggressive cooperation with the U.S. sanctions. In response, the foreign minister promised to study if Japan should cooperate with sanctions. However, the foreign minister refrained from giving an immediate answer, and explained Japan's political situation by saying: "North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons is high on the agenda of consultations among the ruling coalition parties as regards the basic policies of the new government." At an 18 April meeting of representatives of the ruling coalition parties to discuss the basic policies of a new government, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] demanded a change in the basic policy of dealing with North Korea's suspected nuclear development on the basis of the U.S. request. The basic policy, the contents of which were changed at Shinseito's request, says: "Japan will act in accordance with UN policy." Says a concerned official in Tokyo, Shinseito is believed to have demanded a change in the basic policy after concluding Japan would be helpless when it needs to cooperate with the United States in enforcing the sanctions.
