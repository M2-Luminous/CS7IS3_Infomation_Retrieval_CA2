FBIS3-7607 "dreas061_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-061 Document Type:Daily Report 29 Mar 1994 North Korea DFRF Letter Calls for Kim Yong-sam Ouster SK2903140794 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0800 GMT 29 Mar 94 SK2903140794 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0800 GMT 29 Mar 94 Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Text] The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland [DFRF] issued the following letter of appeal [hosomun] to the compatriots in South Korea and overseas in connection with the grave situation [omjunghan chongse] created on the Korean peninsula because of the war maneuvers of the United States and the South Korean authorities. The letter of appeal to the compatriots in South Korea and overseas: The compatriot brethren in South Korea and overseas: An unpredictable extremely grave war phase [yechukhalsu omnun kukhi omjunghan chonjaeng kungmyon] is created on the Korean Peninsula now. The danger of war on the Korean Peninsula is approaching the nation nearer and nearer as a reality rather than an assumption [kajong]. In connection with this grave situation, we send this letter of appeal to you, the South Korean people of various strata and the compatriots overseas. The urgent situation on the Korean peninsula, which the world's good people are watching with deep worries, is not caused because our people in the North and the South wanted it nor because our fellow countrymen themselves caused it. It is forced upon intentionally by the flunkyist nation-selling forces in South Korea which turned away from the nation, and by outside forces. Our people in the North and the South want independent and peaceful reunification of the country, but the flunkeyist nation-selling forces in South Korea are scheming for reunification by northward invasion. Our compatriots at home and abroad look forward to peace in the country, but the bellicose forces in South Korea seek confrontation and war. For the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula, national alliance [minjok kongjo cheje] is necessary, but the South Korean authorities attempt international alliance [kukje kongjo cheje]. For peace in the country, there should not be the danger of war, but the South Korean authorities attempt to resume the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise. For the reunification of the country, national unity is essential, but they are begging for sanctions [chejae] against fellow countrymen. The South Korean authorities not only unilaterally broke down the hard-won working delegates' contact by abusing the issue of the North-South exchange of special envoys to obstruct the DPRK-U.S. talks, which can fundamentally resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, but are openly agitating war, bringing Patriot missiles into South Korea under this pretext, and even disclosing a new plan for war of northward invasion called New Operations Plan 5027 which they have already worked out. They even issued a special alert order to the South Korean Army. With such violent war remarks as punishment and an opportunity for reunification, they are massively assembling troops and equipment along the Military Demarcation Line, thus not hesitating military provocation against us. These ominous military moves [simsangchiannun kunsajok umjigimun] are now bringing the situation in our country to the very dangerous brink of war. It is clear to anyone that in our country, where the two sides are acutely [paengpaenghage] confronting each other along the Military Demarcation Line, any accidental event can cause full-scale military conflicts [kuoddon ubalchogin sagoeuihaesodo chonmyonjogin kunsajok chungdori ironalsuitta]. If a fuse to nuclear war is ignited on the Korean peninsula, our fatherland will be turned into a wasteland, and our nation, which has a 5,000-year history, will suffer an irrevocable catastrophe. How can any patriotic Korean turn a blind eye to a reality in which such a national tragedy is enforced? Genuine patriotism for our nation is manifested in preventing the incoming danger of war and defending peace in the country. It is time all Korean people who love the country, irrespective of whether they live in the North, the South, or abroad, join hands and rise up to remove the danger of war, which is caused by the toadyist and treacherous forces in South Korea, and open a blue sky of peace on the Korean peninsula. Brothers and sisters in the North and South and abroad: War is not a fate that our nation has no choice but to suffer. The danger of war which looms now on the Korean peninsula is a byproduct of the policy of relying on outside forces, a policy espoused by the South Korean authorities who cannot defend independence, the nation's lifeline. Our national history has given us a lesson that whenever power is made sport of [nongnak] by men of noble birth who lack independence, the territory will turn into an arena of competition among outside forces, and the fellow countrymen will suffer the tragic fate of national ruin. The current authorities in South Korea are dishonest political dealers [chongchi kansangbae] who most heavily rely on outside forces and are the most toadyist and treacherous, among all rulers in South Korea. How can we come to terms with [tahyop] toadyist and treacherous forces, who follow outside forces, even when we know relying on outside forces would bring war? And, how can we turn a blind eye to a rule and intervention by outside forces even when we know that would bring the nation to a nuclear catastrophe? Coming to terms and turning a blind eye will lead the nation to self-destruction. People from all parties, factions, and walks of life in South Korea and overseas compatriots: You must remove national betrayers who pursue the policy of relying on outside forces and resolutely wage the struggle to defend national independence! You must also resolutely part with the toadyist and treacherous regime and boldly join in the struggle to remove this regime! If you do not join in the struggle today, this will help the toadyist and treacherous forces find ways for their existence, and, then, a fuse to war will be ignited in this land. It will be too late to regret it and useless to lament it then. The struggle to remove the toadyist and treacherous forces in South Korea is a patriotic road toward rescuing the country from a disaster and keeping the fellow countrymen alive and the road of sacred struggle to achieve peace in the country and hasten the country's peaceful reunification. People from all parties, factions, and walks of life in South Korea: You must vigorously rise up and fight to remove the Kim Yong-sam treacherous regime and build an independence, democratic regime on its grave! If the danger of war is to be prevented, the reckless war maneuvers by the United States and South Korean warmongers must be checked and frustrated [choji patan]. The Team Spirit war exercise cannot be peaceful, and the introduction of Patriot missiles is not intended for peace. And, the movement of the U.S. military warships to the South Korean waters will surely threaten peace, and the reckless military actions taken under a special alert order will surely destroy [pagoe] peace. All South Korean people and overseas compatriots: You must raise your voices of denunciation everywhere and raise the flames of resistance to oppose the resumption of the Team Spirit joint military exercise, reject the introduction of Patriot missiles, and check and frustrate the deployment of U.S. warships to the South Korean waters and all other commotions for military provocations! Officers and men of the South Korean Armed Forces: You must resolutely reject the criminal orders of the warmongers who force you to become mercenaries [yongbyong] of outside forces and inflict a catastrophe of nuclear war on your fathers and mothers, wives and children, and brothers and sisters and your fellow countrymen, and aim your guns at the aggressors and treacherous forces! It is time the South Korean people free themselves from rule and intervention by outside forces. The real danger of war was caused by rule and intervention by the United States, and the endless continuation of national division was caused by it. There is no war only when there is no aggressor in the country, and there is no nuclear war only when there are no nuclear weapons. All South Korean people: You must vigorously wage the struggle to defend national dignity and independence and remove the U.S. forces and nuclear weapons from South Korea by displaying the proud wisdom and courage of a nation with the 5,000-year history! You must wage an anti-U.S., antiwar, and antinuclear struggle to free yourselves from a rule and intervention by the United States, check and frustrate the maneuvers by the South Korean rulers to develop nuclear weapons, and turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free peace zone! Great unity of the entire nation leads to peace in the country and the fatherland's reunification. Today, when the fiery clouds of war are coming in every moment, all fellow countrymen in the North and South and abroad, transcending differences in ideas, ideology, and systems, must unite and unite among themselves. Only the strength of unity can prevent war, defend peace, and rescue the nation from a disaster. The 10-point program of great unity of the entire nation for the fatherland's reunification is a banner of patriotism that prevents war and calls our fellow countrymen to peace and unity and a torch of patriotism that enables our fellow countrymen to cultivate their destinies on their own. Let us all consider the 10-point program of great unity of the entire nation to be a common guideline for the nation, unite with each other as one nation, first of all, and join in the struggle to prevent the danger of nuclear war hovering over the head of the nation and open a road toward peace in the country and its peaceful reunification! All parties, factions, and people from all walks of life in the North and South and abroad: Let us achieve the consensus of will and unite their strengths to make joint efforts time and again for the sake of great national unity, the most sacred patriotism! Our people in the northern half of the Republic will always firmly stand by the South Korean people who are fighting to prevent the danger of war, which looms in the face of the nation, and defend peace in the country.
