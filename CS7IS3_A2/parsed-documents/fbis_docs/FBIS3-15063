However we have not yet received any news about the start of this trial. [Omelchenko] In my opinion, the passions raging around intelligence activities have a whiff of dirty tricks about them, because the intelligence service in all countries, at any time, is as it were an early warning system warning regarding conflicts, the various unpleasant things that menace the state. And in this case, in the Ames case, don't you think, Tatyana Viktorevna, that this is more a matter not of professional problems, but of political ambitions and political problems, even far-fetched ones? [Samolis] If this problem is raised on this level of high politics, then it is not raised by intelligence officers, because in any country professionals understand one another. And in general I think that in today's civilized world, conducting intelligence activity against one another is absolutely no impediment to maintaining friendly and even ally-style relations. [Omelchenko] All that fuss surrounding the Ames affair and the stirring up of the public makes one form the impression that here, on the one hand, the CIA is in trouble in general; on the other hand, perhaps some kind of influential forces want to suggest to Clinton that he should alter relations with Russia, perhaps to have some kind of pause in our relations. [Samolis] I would not argue with you. In any case, the Russian intelligence service is interested in continuing cooperation with the U.S. intelligence service. It will strive for that. [Omelchenko] In what fields? [Samolis] We have many common problems in this far from simple and rather dangerous world. First and foremost, it is in such fields as the problems of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the fight against international crime, against drug trafficking, against terrorism, and the exchange of information on the development of the situation in crisis spots. That is enough for today. Tomorrow perhaps there will be some new problems in the solution of which we may need one another. [Omelchenko] Tatyana Viktorevna, after the mutual expulsions of Morris and Lysenko, if there is a further escalation in such actions, how will the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service react? [Samolis] First and foremost, we would not like this to happen, of course. We think that common sense should prevail, but if it becomes an issue like you have mentioned, then the measures will probably be mutual ones, but it will not be the intelligence service that will take them, but the country's highest political leadership.
