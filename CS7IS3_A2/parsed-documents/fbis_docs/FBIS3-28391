Pham Van Quang, 52, was convicted by the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court of having "deliberately engaged in a subversive act in a public place," the Saigon Giai Phong (Liberated Saigon) daily said. The court said that on December 16, 1992, when the city was hosting its first international marathon, Quang drove to crowded Me Linh square, in front of the Saigon Floating Hotel, where the marathon's media center was located. Climbing onto the hood of his car, he waved the flag of the ousted Saigon regime and fired 19 shots to attract attention, the court account said. It added that he pulled the pin of a hand grenade to scare away security officers. At the time, witnesses said the man was wearing the brown robes of the historically anti-communist Hoa Hao Buddhist sect. They did not report hearing any shots or seeing a grenade.
