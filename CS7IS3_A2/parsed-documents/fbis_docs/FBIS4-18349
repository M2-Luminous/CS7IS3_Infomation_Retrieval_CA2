The ship Adventstar, of Greek ownership, has been detained in Burgas for the past 14 months because Bulgarian authorities suspected it of transporting merchandise to Serbia in violation of the embargo. The company that owns the ship demanded that the cargo, which is valued at approximately $3 million, not be unloaded. The Bulgarian Supreme Court then issued a warrant preventing the ship from being unloaded. However, the issue was later discussed in the Regional Court, which ordered the unloading of the cargo. There are concerns that implementation of this decision would endanger the ship's cargo. Efforts are being made on many levels to avoid such a step and to obtain a permit allowing the ship to sail. According to regulations, when a ship is detained because of suspicions that it is violating the embargo against Serbia, it should be released when nothing is proven within a reasonable amount of time.
