Viktorie Hradska, director general of the consortium, said this in an interview for CTK yesterday. She believes that the statement that Defense Minister Baudys has no intention of dealing with the RDP Group is "rather exaggerated." Disputes that have arisen between the consortium and the Army, if any, should not be generalized, according to Hradska. Baudys says in his statement that he has no intention of negotiating with the RDP the deliveries of military material to meet the needs of the Czech Army. The reason is the fact that the minister wants to directly address the manufacturers when making purchases. According to what he said, the Army does not need a mediator when concluding contracts. Hradska is convinced that the existence of an organization of the RDP type, which would provide an umbrella for the given sphere of industry, is necessary. According to her, such company allows a rational arrangement and mutual interlinking of the production programs of the consortium members as regards research, development, and strategic planning, which would be too expensive for a single company. The RDP also should provide some guarantee that some of the Czech companies will not be swallowed by foreign industry, the director believes.
