The minister said that 1994 will be "a very good year" in macroeconomic terms, and that inflation will be "below 5 percent." Cavallo said that next year's great challenge will be the construction of new factories "to expand productive activities in the interior of the country, permit investments, and allow the creation of job opportunities and goods and services demanded by the people." Cavallo reiterated that in order to achieve these objectives it is necessary to reach an agreement with the provinces -- through the fiscal pact -- in order to reduce taxes on productive activities and so reduce costs. The minister said that the program will be complemented by "strong investments by the private sector and the provinces in roads, telecommunications, energy, railroads, and ports." Cavallo said that increases in exports should be derived not from the fluctuations in international prices, but from the "increase in exportable volume." The minister forecast "an important increase in the export of hydrocarbons -- oil and gas -- as well as in agricultural products." Cavallo said that in 1993 the export of industrial manufactured products increased by 22 percent with respect to 1992. The minister said that of the $1 billion 1993 increase in imports over 1992, "$900 million were the result of importation of capital goods." Cavallo made these statements in an interview published by the magazine NOTICIAS. The minister said that in 1993 "consumption increased by 4 percent while the gross domestic product increased by 6 percent, which means that national savings have also increased." The minister said that "all investments will be financed by our internal savings" by the year 2000. "This does not mean we will reject foreign capital, but I hope by then local companies will be investing outside of the country." Regarding the 1994 fiscal account, Cavallo said: "It has been demonstrated to the IMF, and to all those who had doubts about the current Argentine Government economic policies, that we can lower tax rates, or eliminate them, and still increase our tax collections through the legalization of the country's economy." Cavallo stressed that economists who predicted that the government would not be able to fulfill the year's fiscal goals were wrong, and will this year be wrong again. The minister added that the government will continue to improve on the tax administration system, will increase its austerity in the area of spending, and will intensify the fight on corruption using the criteria of equality and efficiency in the use of resources. Cavallo pointed out that Santiago del Estero proved that "those who wanted to get votes with demagoguery and by squandering local resources will think twice before doing it again." "You can also win elections with austerity," Cavallo said, adding that "we must terminate the payment of exorbitant salaries and state purchases from contractors."
