A major question arises here: How will this law apply to wages and the like? AKHIR SA'AH has interviewed Muhammad Fathi 'Abd-al-Baqi, first undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance and Tax Authority chairman, and addressed to him this and other important questions: What are taxable revenues? What are the exemptions listed by the law? What about pensions? The interview has asked these and numerous other questions. To start, Fathi 'Abd-al-Baqi pointed out that the unified tax law will be implemented as of January 1994. This law was issued to amend some provisions of income tax law No. 157 of 1981. With the promulgation of the unified tax law, the general income tax, with all its pros and cons, has been abolished. Moreover, the unified tax has alleviated the tax burden for employees. An employee with a gross income from his job amounting to 800 pounds monthly will not be subject to any tax, meaning that nearly 9,600 pounds will not be taxable. Moreover, pensioners will not be subject to the tax. 'Abd-al-Baqi also pointed out that the executive regulations will be issued within three months as of the date of publication of the law in the Official Gazette. [Mustafa] How will the income tax on salaries and the like be calculated under the unified tax law? ['Abd-al-Baqi] The Tax Authority has issued circular No. 1 of 1994 on the provisions governing salaries and the like in law No. 187 of 1993, which amends some provisions of the income tax law promulgated by law No. 157 of 1981. The circular states that the provisions of this law shall apply to salaries and the like as of 1 January 1994. As for applying provisions of the law, this law has maintained all the objective and executive regulations and procedures enacted in the income tax law promulgated by law No. 157 of 1981 on salaries and the like, adding to them the following: - Law No. 187 of 1993 treats non-shareholder members and chairmen of the executive boards of the public business sector companies the same as members and chairman of executive boards of public sector companies, subjecting the salaries and bonuses they receive to the provisions governing salaries and the like in accordance with paragraph 4 of article 49. Meanwhile, the law treats shareholder chairmen and members the same as chairmen and members of executive boards of private sector joint-stock companies, subjecting their salaries, bonuses, and the like to the provisions of the "movable capital revenues" in accordance with the stipulation of paragraph 11 of article 6. The law also subjects salaries and the like collected by commissioned executive board chairmen and members to the provisions governing "salaries and the like," up to 5,000 pounds and in accordance with the conditions and rules established in paragraph 5 of article 49. Any sum in excess of 5,000 pounds will be subjected to the tax on the movable capital revenues. - It has included in the tax vessel any hazardous work allowance exceeding 480 pounds, not 240 pounds, and any representation allowance exceeding 2,500 pounds, not 3,000 pounds. - The law releases completely the exemption established for the wages of daily workers, provided that they are not employed permanently and that they have no source of income other than their daily wages. - It establishes for wage earners and the like a personal exemption of 2,000 pounds annually, plus the 10-percent deduction established for earning the income. - It establishes a new exemption for free or reduced-price tickets given by transportation companies, whether airlines or maritime companies, [to their workers]. - The law exempts wage earners from submitting the annual tax statement stipulated in article 91 for wages and the like. It also exempts them from listing such salaries and the like in the said statement, even if they have other income elements, such as commercial and industrial activity revenues and real estate wealth revenues. - It raises the exemption limit established by law No. 157 of 1981 for family burdens, increasing it as follows in accordance with article 88: 1. A total of 1,440 pounds annually for a single taxpayer. 2. A total of 1,680 pounds annually for a married person who supports no children or an unmarried person who supports one or more children. 3. A total of 1,920 pounds annually for a married person supporting one or more children. New Provisions The law has also added the following provisions: - It has raised the maximum age of a dependent son or daughter to 28 years, if the dependent is a student in any educational phase, regardless of whether university education or otherwise. - It considers either parent a dependent if the taxpayer is actually their sole supporter. The law has also made the following taxable: - Sums paid to foreign experts employed for no more than 183 days annually, regardless of whether consecutive or interspersed days. - Sums collected by taxable employees from parties other than their original employers, as stipulated in article 52. In both cases, the tax applies to these sums without any deduction, whether for living or family burdens. The tax rate will be 20 percent for any sums up to 50,000 pounds and 32 percent for any sums in excess of 50,000. Taxable Revenues [Mustafa] What revenues are taxable? ['Abd-al-Baqi] Article 49 of the law defines them clearly. The tax applies to the following revenues: - Salaries and the like, wages, bonuses, and lifelong revenues, excluding insurance dues, which are paid to any person, regardless of whether living in Egypt or abroad, by the Egyptian Government, by local government units, by public authorities and other public persons, and by funds governed by law No. 54 of 1975, issuing the private insurance funds law, and by law No. 64 of 1980 concerning alternative private social security funds. - Salaries and the like, wages, bonuses, and lifelong revenues, "excluding pensions," paid by private companies, establishments, and organizations and by educational institutes and individuals to any person living in Egypt and to any person living abroad for services rendered in Egypt. - Salaries and bonuses of chairmen and members of public sector companies' executive boards. - Salaries and bonuses of non-shareholder chairmen and members of executive boards of public business sector companies. - Sums collected for administrative work by: A.

B. Directors of private sector joint-stock companies whose contribution to the company capital doesn't exceed the limit required by the law for executive board membership. Under all circumstances, it is conditional that no more than four persons defined by name in each company shall benefit from this provision, and only within the limits of 5,000 pounds annually per person, regardless of whether the sum is a fixed sum, a percentage of the net profit, or something else. Settlement of Taxes Due (Fathi 'Abd-al-Baqi added) as for the revenues included in the tax vessel, they are defined by the following articles: Article 50. Revenues included in the tax vessel shall be determined for every part of the year in which any taxable revenue is obtained according to the duration of this part and on the basis of the monthly revenue, after it is converted into annual revenue. In case change occurs in the taxable revenue, the calculation of this revenue shall be amended as of the date of the change on the basis of the new revenue, after it is converted into annual revenue. As for accrued salaries and the like, wages, and bonuses that are paid in a lump sum in a certain year, the accrued sum shall be divided over the accrual years, the revenues included in the tax vessel shall be recalculated for each year, and taxes due shall be settled on this basis. Article 51. Excluding the stipulation of paragraph 8 of article 6 of this law, taxable revenues shall be determined in the manner shown below on the basis of the total salaries, wages, recompense, bonuses, allowances, lifelong revenues--excluding pensions--and cash and in-kind benefits obtained by the taxpayer: First, the tax shall not apply to the representation allowance or entertainment allowance unless it exceeds 2,500 pounds annually, provided that the allowance doesn't exceed the original salary, recompense, or wages and that no exemptions established in accordance with special laws are violated. Second, the tax shall not apply to sums collected by workers as production incentives, provided that the incentives are within the limits of 100 percent the original salary, recompense, or wages and that they don't exceed 3,000 pounds annually.

Sums paid by private sector establishments governed by the provisions of this law to increase production or to enhance their service level, provided that they are paid in accordance with regulations issued on a decree by the minister of finance, after consultation with the minister of manpower. Fourth, the tax shall not apply to cash or in-kind housing allowance obtained by foreign experts who are taxable in accordance with the rate established in article 90 of this law and by Egyptians who work in land reclamation and development projects and in mining projects and who are subject to the aforementioned tax rate. Fifth, sums collected by representatives of the regional offices of foreign companies and establishments in Egypt shall not be taxable, except for the equivalent of their activity in Egypt. In all cases, the total sum of the hazardous work, representation, and entertainment allowances and production incentives exempted from the tax in accordance with the aforementioned paragraphs of this article may not exceed 4,000 pounds annually. Article 52. The tax shall apply to sums paid to foreign experts, regardless of the agency or authority employing them to perform services under its control, provided that they are not employed for more than 183 consecutive or interspersed days annually.

These sums shall be taxable without any reduction for living or family burdens. In all cases, the tax shall be withheld and then remitted to the tax commission concerned within the first 15 days of each month in accordance with the conditions and procedures determined by the executive regulations.

['Abd-al-Baqi] Tax exemptions are determined by the law and they are explicitly stated in the following articles: Article 54. The following shall be exempted from the tax: A. Social security subscriptions and savings installments deducted in accordance with the social security laws, in accordance with alternative systems, or in accordance with government pension and savings laws. B. Workers' subscriptions to private insurance funds established in accordance with the provisions of law No. 54 of 1975. C. Life and health insurance installments paid by the taxpayer for himself and for his wife and underage children. For cases B and C, it is conditional that the total deducted by the taxpayer may not exceed 15 percent of the net income or 1,000 pounds, whichever is the lesser of the two. The same installments and subscriptions may not be deducted from other revenues listed in article 5 of this law. D. Lifelong incomes paid by insurance companies for insurance policies of a duration of no less than 10 years. Article 55. Ten percent of the total taxable income, plus a sum of 2,000 pounds, shall be deducted for income-earning expense, after subtracting the subscriptions and sums listed in paragraphs A, B, and C of article 54 of this law and before subtracting the deduction established for family burdens in accordance with article 88 of this law.

The above is in addition to the exemption established for family burdens by articles 88 and 89 of this law. Requirements for Statement Submission [Mustafa] What are the tax rates? Are wage earners required to submit the annual unified tax statement? What about appeal and contestation procedures? ['Abd-al-Baqi] Regarding salaries and similar revenues listed in section three of this book, the tax rate applying to them will be 20 percent for sums up to 50,000 pounds and 32 percent for sums in excess of 50,000 pounds.

"This party shall be required to send this application, coupled with its response, to the tax commission concerned within 30 days as of the date on which the application is submitted. "The commission shall examine the application.
