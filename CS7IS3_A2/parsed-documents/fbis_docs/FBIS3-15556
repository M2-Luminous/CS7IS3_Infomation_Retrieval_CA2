Six Members of Ukrainian Air Force Military Council Have Come Out Against the President's Edict"] [Text] Kiev -- Something unprecedented has occurred in the Ukrainian Army. President Leonid Kravchuk issued an edict appointing Lieutenant General Volodymyr Antonets commander of the Air Force. As soon as this became known, all six members of the Air Force Military Council (with the exception, naturally, of Antonets himself) signed the Military Council's decision on their collective resignation. What, then, is the essence of the generals' "conspiracy"? In the past, at the instigation of former Ukrainian Defense Minister Konstantin Morozov, Gen. Antonets was appointed by the president as commander of the Air Defense Troops, whose creation by means of merging Air Defense and the Air Force he himself had initiated. This led not only to the formation of a new staff structure with 250 generals and colonels but also to... the further breakdown of the Air Defense and the Air Force. This was precisely why Leonid Kravchuk was forced to repeal his edict creating the Air Defense Troops. Antonets became commander of the Air Force. But why are the generals categorically opposed to Volodymyr Antonets? There are several reasons. One of them is that it was with the support of Antonets that a right-wing organization, which is essentially a political party -- the Ukrainian Officers Union -- was active in the Air Force. With his assistance members of the UNSO [Ukrainian People's Self-Defense] organization wounded in Georgia were treated in military hospitals. Generals V. Vasilyev and G. Kolodiy, who fought in Afghanistan and have rich experience in troop control, have declared their reluctance, so the newspaper KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI writes, to serve under the command of someone who does not have the necessary knowledge to lead the Air Force and whose main character trait is arrogance.
