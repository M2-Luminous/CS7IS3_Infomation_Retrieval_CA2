In various mainland provinces, rural laborers have began to move back to their home villages like an ebbing tide in order to hold family reunions. In this period, such means of transportation as trains and buses are getting extremely crowded, and this has become a special scene at the turn of the year. It is expected that before and after the Spring Festival, over 10 million migrant workers will travel. Why is there such a special phenomenon? Individual income in the countryside is low, and young peasants always try to seek jobs and earn a bit more money as long as there are opportunities to enter the city. After the beginning of reform and opening up in the Chinese mainland, the southeast coastal provinces and areas got rich first, and the people's living standards became much higher. This stimulated the people in the interior provinces and regions. As the popular saying goes, "water flows downward and people hope to move upward." This is an inevitable phenomenon. In the final analysis, the movement of rural laborers arose because there was a labor surplus in the rural areas. At present, the rural working population in the Chinese mainland is about 450 million people, accounting for 74 percent of the country's total labor resources. However, there is only some 1.4 billion mu of farmland, which requires only 200 million laborers. Fortunately, the township and town enterprises arising in recent years have absorbed 110 million working people, thus substantially reducing the surplus labor force in the countryside. However, the surplus labor force in the countryside still stands at about 130 million. Peasants now spend three months on farming, one month on celebrating the new year holidays, and eight months on doing nothing. Such a description is quite true. Because there is too little land to support too many people, the peasants' income remains very low. Going out to seek jobs has become the main means of living for young peasants. The emergence of the migrant laborer tides should be regarded as an inevitable phenomenon, but this also exposes the people's difficulties in seeking jobs and many problems in the field of labor management. Reportedly, a crowd of peasants recently gathered around Beijing's Chongwen Men, and there appeared a "labor market" where employers might select workers. However, many laborers from the countryside failed to find a job after waiting there for over two weeks or even one month. First, they were not well-informed, as they came from the countryside; second, they were not skilled workers and could not compete with other people in seeking jobs. As a result, they wasted time and money traveling back and forth, and also suffered psychological pain. Similar phenomena also exist in the "labor markets" of Shanghai and Guangzhou. So far, the authorities have not included migrant laborers in the scope of labor registration and distribution. This should not be regarded as an accidental oversight. Migrant rural laborers also cause serious problems to transportation. Because of the large scale of population movement and the limited number of destinations, tremendous pressure is caused for the transport industry, which has long been the bottleneck of the economy. The movement of rural laborers also causes difficulties to urban management, public order and security, and public health. In fact, migrant laborers are from the countryside, but they work all year round in cities and only return home for a number of days around the Chinese New Year. Some of them even bring their whole families to the city and do not return to the countryside for many consecutive years. Gradually, the migrant laborers have formed a unique community, and these people also have their special social status. Some sociologists point out that migrant laborers are not rural people in real terms, nor urban people in real terms. They are living in a "marginal" condition. They are living in cities, but they are not accepted by cities and do not achieve the social status of urban residents. When the economy cools down, they are the first to be forced to leave the cities and return to the countryside. However, they are no longer accustomed to rural work. According to statistics in some cities, over half of criminal cases in cities are related to migrant laborers from the countryside. Maybe this is because they are not accepted and admitted by cities, and their livelihood has no guarantee. Some cities tell all institutions not to hire new laborers from other provinces, and reject migrant laborers. The correctness of such a practice is open to question. It seems that in order to reduce the negative effects of the movement of over 10 million rural laborers, the authorities must formulate corresponding control and guidance measures. For example, the urban household registration system should be reformed; institutions for providing consulting and guiding services to migrant laborers from the countryside should be set up; and people living in difficult conditions should be helped to return home; and opportunities should be given to educated and skilled laborers from the countryside. All these points are worth considering.
