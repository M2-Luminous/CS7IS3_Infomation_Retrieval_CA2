FMLN leader Leonel Gonzalez [Salvador Sanchez Ceren] listed four issues that are still pending: public security, land transfer, the program to return former guerrillas to civilian life, and compliance with the Truth Commission recommendations. [Begin Gonzalez recording] In terms of the public security issue, according to the program to disband the National Police, there should also be a program to reduce the size of the organization. This program has been suspended, and, therefore, the peace plan is not being complied with. Their idea is to leave about 3,000 national policemen working until October and later recruit them for the National Civilian Police [PNC]. This will mark another failure to comply with the agreements. As for the PNC deployment, according to the agreements, this process should end in September at the latest, but the government wants to postpone it until December. A postponement would be another failure to comply with the peace agreements. Yet another example of noncompliance is the distortion of the PNC. We have pointed out this problem since 1993, but it has not been corrected. Its civilian nature is not being respected. In addition, there is no training to ensure that new agents respect life and human rights. Many PNC agents who are linked to the [word indistinct] are resorting to the traditional methods employed by the repressive corps. As for land transfer, 70 percent of the land has not been transferred. In other words, about 20,000 people are facing uncertainty because land has not been transferred to them. As for the program to return former guerrillas to civilian life, the most worrisome aspect is that former fighters who already have land have not yet received loans. The time to sow is close at hand, and our companeros are not yet sure whether they will receive the necessary loans to farm the land. [end recording] The FMLN accused the government of hindering the advancement of the pending agreements and noted that there is a new timetable proposed by Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] that the government has ignored. Leonel Gonzalez believes the government wants to continue ignoring the agreements to punish former fighters, dodge its responsibility, and merge the National Police with the PNC.
