FBIS4-37932 "drnes123_l_94006" FBIS-NES-94-123 Daily Report 26 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Hebron Mayor Accepts Finding Hebron Mayor Accepts Finding TA2606111394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 1000 GMT 26 Jun 94 TA2606111394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Telephone interview with Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah by Jack Katzenell; place not given -- live] [Text] [Katzenell] Let, me ask you this: In view of the basic and fundamental conclusions of the Shamgar commission that Goldstein acted alone, they have recommended that new arrangements for prayers be introduced at the Cave of the Patriarchs, and no more weapons are to be carried in the area by soldiers as well, is there any reason why you should not accept this report? [Al-Natshah] I said that the report must contain more vital things, that it did not show that the presence of the settlers during the past has created the atmosphere which helped Goldstein to commit the crime. The harassment of the settlers to the Muslim prayers, and the complaints of a lot of the people to the police, was not treated in the proper way and was neglected. The Shamgar did not say about this. [Katzenell] Mr. al-Natshah, surely this is not the mandate of the Shamgar commission? It was set up in order to investigate the massacre of Muslim worshipers in the cave. This may be true what you are saying about the background to the tension, but it was not required, this is not what it was asked to do. [Al-Natshah] Excuse me, but who committed the crime? It is not the soldiers, it is the settlers, so you must look at the atmosphere which was created in the mosque, that this settler has committed a crime. [Katzenell] Mr. al-Natshah, then basically, you do not accept the conclusion that Barukh Goldstein acted alone? [Al-Natshah] No, I accept that he did it alone, but I said that the atmosphere which was created by his colleagues, the settlers, has helped in that he committed the crime. [Katzenell] And you do not believe that his action was in fact detached from the atmosphere? [Al-Natshah] The function was alone, that is okay, but the atmosphere which was created by the other settlers, I mean the harassment which occurred days before, has helped him in committing his crime.
