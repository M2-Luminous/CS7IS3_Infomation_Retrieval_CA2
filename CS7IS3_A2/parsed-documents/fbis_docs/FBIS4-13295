FBIS4-13295 "drnes075_n_94001" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 LEBANON Minister on Cabinet Decision To Sever Ties With Iraq Minister on Cabinet Decision To Sever Ties With Iraq NC1804200594 Beirut Radio Lebanon in Arabic 1900 GMT 18 Apr 94 NC1804200594 Beirut Radio Lebanon Arabic BFN [News conference by Information Minister Michel Samahah with unidentified correspondents at the Presidential Palace in B'abda on 19 Apr--recorded] [Text] [Samahah] At the invitation of his excellency the president of the Republic, after his agreement with the prime minister, the Council of Ministers held an extraordinary meeting in the Presidential Palace in B'abda this evening. The Council of Ministers was informed in detail of the circumstances surrounding the assassination of Shaykh Talib Suhayl in his home. There was an appropriate investigation into the crime, evidence was found, and testimony was taken. As shown in the minutes of the meeting between the Iraqi charge d'affaires, at his request, with defendants Khalid 'Ulwan Khalaf and Muhammad Faris Kadhim in the presence of the Beirut police commander and his two aides, the two defendants confessed that they committed the crime on orders faxed to them from Baghdad. Both of them are active employees of the Iraqi Intelligence Directorate. Despite hearing the two defendants' confession that they had carried out the crime on the orders of their leaders in Baghdad, the Foreign Ministry was notified by the Iraqi charge d'affaires that his government objects to lifting the immunity of these two employees. In view of his insistence on not handing over the third and fourth defendants, who both work for the embassy's intelligence service; to avoid the occurrence of such crimes on our territories; and out of concern for insuring the safety of Lebanese citizens and all those residing in Lebanon, after due deliberation the Lebanese Government regrets that this approach was taken toward Lebanon now that it has restored peace and security. Some parties--including regrettably, an Arab state like Iraq--insist on violating all the established rules and norms by treating Lebanon as though it was an arena for foreign intelligence entities. This violates the Vienna agreement, which obliges diplomats to respect the laws of the countries where they are accredited. Therefore, the Lebanese Government has made the following decisions: 1. To sever diplomatic ties with the Iraqi state and to order the Foreign Ministry to request the Iraqi charge d'affaires and embassy staff to depart this country within 72 hours; and to reiterate the Lebanese Government's demand to hand over all the persons wanted in connection with this crime; 2. To ask the justice minister to emphasize the need for the competent judicial authorities to follow up on the investigations and expose whoever is connected to this crime and the activity of this apparatus, be they Lebanese or any other nationality. 3. Lebanon, which values the fraternal relations with the brotherly Iraqi people, rejects any tampering with its sovereignty, security and stability, and any violation of diplomatic norms. The Lebanese Government will inform Arab and international quarters of its decisions in this regard. The cabinet also discussed the rising tension in the south as a result of the repeated Israeli aggression against the defenseless residents of the southern cities and villages. His excellency the prime minister reviewed the recent developments and the contacts in this regard in a bid to deter Israel's aggression. The Cabinet reiterated its full support for the southerners and the need to provide all the necessary requirements for their steadfastness in the face of this aggression, stressing that all facilities will be made available to them to enhance their steadfastness and help them remain there. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Samahah] It is premature to answer this question. However, it is clear from the statement that there are some people residing in Lebanon who have committed a crime on Lebanese territory. A certain state, by issuing certain orders, has carried out aggression against Lebanon. [Correspondent] What about the Lebanese community in Iraq following the severing of ties? [Samahah] The status of the Lebanese community in Iraq should be that of a community living in a country that is supposed to respect international law and treat those living on its territory in accordance with international law and all international agreements. [Correspondent] Does the Lebanese Government intend to [words indistinct]? [Samahah] You can find the answer to this question in our statement. We are still calling for the third and fourth defendants to be handed over to Lebanese judicial authorities. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] affect the joint interests of the two countries? [Samahah] Following the aggression that has taken place, I believe that the matter has gone beyond concern over the joint interests and become a flagrant and direct aggression against Lebanon. [Correspondent] How would you describe the situation following the attacks on Sidon, the recent escalation, and the U.S. message that Lebanon has received? Do you expect an escalation? [Samahah] Whenever an Israeli Government faces an internal political problem or whenever world public opinion or the world's decisionmaking centers tend to sympathize with Arab rights, particularly Lebanon's, to regain their territories, the situation in the south becomes tense and Israel constantly escalates its aggression from the its occupied area in the south against the people, land, and property in the liberated territory. [Correspondent] Is it true that there was a U.S. warning of a possible Israeli attack against the south? [Samahah] The United States tried to explain what is happening in the south and to calm the situation through contacts with Lebanon and Israel. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Samahah] The Lebanese Government's response is very clear. We have no responsibility regarding the occupation. We have a responsibility to end it. Therefore, we have repeatedly demanded that UN Security Council Resolution 425 be implemented. When we regain sovereignty over our land in the south and the western al-Biqa', the security issue will be resolved. We are not the aggressors. Israel is occupying our land, and is attacking other parts of Lebanon from the occupied area. Any approach to us or any accusation made against us is unacceptable. We are not Israel's policemen. The international community must serve as a force to bring justice and restore the complete rights of Lebanon, the other Arab states, and the Palestinian people. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Samahah] We are awaiting the outcome of the investigation. [Correspondent] Have you decided which Arab state will care for Lebanon's interests in Iraq after the break in relations? [Samahah] No decision has yet been made in this regard. The Foreign Ministry will pursue this matter. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, with regard to [words indistinct]? [Samahah] The officials responsible for these stations are fully aware of the controls, what a news report on economic activity means, and where the line should be drawn. So far no one has committed any violation in this regard. I am confident that all the media officials are capable, are aware of the seriousness of this period, and are aware of the importance of respecting the Council of Minister's decision. Let us cooperate to create a serious and secure atmosphere in the country. We are surrounded by major concerns at this time, and face grave dangers, such as the recent Iraqi attack, what is happening in the south, what is happening at home regarding the confiscation of large quantities of weapons and ammunition from various parties in various parts of Lebanon. This process will continue. We are working on the media law, which we hope will not take long. Then matters will return to normal with the exercise of all liberties. The exercise of liberties goes on today. The Lebanese print media is operating normally within the law; and through them all Lebanese can express their views. This is in addition to the official media. Our citizens want to be free mentally and psychologically of the state of war that has existed until recently and move to a state of law and order. They want to exercise their liberties and democracy under laws that are prepared by the Government and are legislated by the Chamber of Deputies for the good and interest of the Lebanese people. The Lebanese Constitution is based on respect of freedoms and respect of belief, personal freedom, expression. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Samahah, in English] The Lebanese Government has just cut its diplomatic relations with the Iraq state, and the minister of foreign affairs will tell the Iraqi diplomats tomorrow morning that they have 72 hours to be out of the Lebanese territories. We think that the Iraqi Government giving orders to some of its personnel in Lebanon to kill Arab citizens living in Lebanon has committed, has perpetrated, an aggression to Lebanon from one side, and has violated the Vienna Accord from another side. Thank you.
