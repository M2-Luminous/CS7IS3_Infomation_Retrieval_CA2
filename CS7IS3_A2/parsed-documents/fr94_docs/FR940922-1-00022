FR940922-1-00022 FR940922-1-00008 Thursday September 22, 1994 Part II Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR Part 85 Clean Air Act: Ozone Transport Commission: Low Emission Vehicle Program for Northeast Ozone Transport Region; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 183␣/␣Thursday, September 22, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rule ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 85 [FRL&hyph;5074&hyph;4] Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Ozone Transport Commission; Emission Vehicle Program for the Northeast Ozone Transport Region AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 184 of the Clean Air Act, the Northeast Ozone Transport Commission recommended that EPA require all state members of the OTC to adopt an Ozone Transport Commission Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program. In today's supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM), EPA is proposing to find that reduction of new motor vehicle emissions through OTC LEV or LEV-equivalent program is necessary to mitigate the effects of pollution transport and to bring nonattainment areas in the OTR into attainment and to avoid interference with maintenance. EPA believes an alternative federal low emission vehicle program can be developed that would achieve reductions equivalent to or greater than the OTC LEV program. EPA also believes there could be significant additional benefits from such a program and proposes in today's notice a process by which development of such a program could continue. The Agency intends to work with stakeholders in this effort. Given the absence of such a program, however, EPA is proposing under sections 184(c) and 110(k)(5) of the Act that the OTC LEV program is necessary throughout the OTR and is consistent with the Act. EPA is thus proposing a SIP call under section 110(k)(5) to require each state in the OTR to revise its SIP to include the OTC LEV program within one year. Today's notice also proposes regulations determining ``model year'' for purposes of section 177 and part A of title II of the Act as that term is applied to on-highway motor vehicles. DATES: The comment period for this rulemaking will reopen immediately for purposes of taking comment on issues raised in this Supplemental Proposal and will remain open until October 24, 1994. Please direct all correspondence to the address specified below. EPA will hold a public hearing on this Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking if one is requested by September 29, 1994. EPA will hold such a hearing on September 29, 1994. The hearing, if requested, would begin at 9 a.m. and continue until 4:30 p.m. or until all commenters have the opportunity to testify.

Outline and Background This proposal supplements EPA's April 26 proposal, and EPA does not intend to thereby withdraw from consideration any of the various elements previously proposed. Rather, EPA intends to focus for purposes of public comment on EPA's proposed specific approach to, and basis for, approving the OTC LEV recommendation. In addition, EPA is proposing today ``model year'' regulations that are relevant to, but beyond the specific scope of EPA's April 26 proposal. This proposal is organized into the following sections: I. Outline and Background
