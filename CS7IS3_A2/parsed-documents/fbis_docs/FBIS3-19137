They are afraid that the financial markets will collapse, they smell inflation. Are they right? [Meister] Markets tend toward exaggeration. We will do all we can so that the market remains stable. However, one thing is correct indeed: The bond markets are currently unstable. Stock brokers suspect pent-up inflation and thus rising interest rates in the pipeline. Therefore, they reacted so strongly to the rising interest rates in the United States and to the over-20-percent growth of the German money supply. The strong increase surprised us, too. [Ulrich] Not only in the view of stock brokers is the money supply, which is the basis of the Bundesbank's policy, a compass that reacts to any rusty nail. [Meister] It is undisputed that special factors have distorted the real significance for two months now. Innumerable new loans and refluxes from Luxembourg have inflated the money supply. The state was also involved because of changed tax regulations. The money supply is to grow by 6 percent at most on annual average. I am confident we can achieve this goal. [Ulrich] Will the Bundesbank now not lower the prime rate any further? [Meister] In the future, too, we will sound out any leeway for lowering interest rates. Three weeks ago we lowered the discount rate because of the favorable price trend, even though we had to expect the growth of the money supply to remain high. [Ulrich] Do you blame the so-called gambler funds from the United States? [Meister] You will understand that I do not want to adopt this term. It is clear that the speculation of these funds regarding futures and loans puts a strain on the markets. Basically, central banks need not care about where those investors, who are bored in gambling casinos, use their money. However, we will not permit them to endanger the international financial system. [Ulrich] Do we have to fear a financial maximum credible accident, if a large bank miscalculates on the futures markets? [Meister] One cannot speak of that at all at the moment. However, it is important that, internationally, complicated deals in so-called derivatives, that is, options and figures, are paid much more attention now. The sums that are shifted in this connection, are gigantic and grow rapidly. The global players on the financial markets should be clear about one thing: The Bundesbank will not spread a net to bolster losses from high speculative deals. Nor are we liable for damage done by others.
