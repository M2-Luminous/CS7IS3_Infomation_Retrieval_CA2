House Speakership member brother Muhammad al-Khadim al-Wajih attended. At the outset of the meeting, the house speaker noted that the House of Representatives, through its sessions and also through the follow-up committee it has formed to find the facts pertaining to the crisis, will continue to play its effective national role to resolve the crisis, given the fact that the House of Representatives is the legislative authority elected by the people. He added: Moreover, it is this house that began the efforts to address the crisis when it issued its statement on the crisis on 5 November 1993 and formed a fact-finding committee from among its members. The brother house speaker went on to say that the task of addressing the crisis must remain, first and foremost, within the confines of the Presidential Council, the House of Representatives, the Council of Ministers, and the coalition government committees. The house speaker said: The people who elected us asked us to keep the trust, the significance of which was accentuated when the house members took the oath during its first session. Hence, the house will remain alive. It will continue to hold its sessions, given the fact that it is the representative of the people, an elected body, and the legitimate constitutional authority, which is the guardian of the constitution, legitimacy, law and order, and which oversees all executive organizations. Afterward, the committee examined various developments and repercussions of the crisis. The debates of the conferees during this session underlined the need to remove the effects of the crisis by resolving the problem of price hikes, halting the decline in the exchange rate of the national currency, promoting security and stability, improving the living conditions of the people, safeguarding Yemeni unity, and consecrating national unity. The conferees also reaffirmed the need to continue efforts to reach drastic solutions to the crisis democratically and objectively, within the constitutional and legitimate frameworks, and in a manner that will rid the homeland and people of the ordeal, as well as the economic difficulties created by the crisis. The endeavor to defuse the crisis, the conferees noted, must also ensure the strength and entrenchment of united Yemen, as well as the creation of a democratic, shura-inspired, civilized, and modern community.
