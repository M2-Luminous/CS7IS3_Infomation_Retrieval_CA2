FBIS3-15395 "drsov044_v_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-044 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Mar 1994 Lithuania Security Committee Head Denies Need for Fighters WS0703082494 Vilnius RESPUBLIKA in Lithuanian 22 Feb 94 No. 35 p 2 WS0703082494 Vilnius RESPUBLIKA Language: Lithuanian Article Type:BFN [Unattributed report: "How Much and What Type of Army Does Lithuania Need?"] [Text] Yesterday, the State Defense Council held its meeting chaired by the president. The meeting discussed the possibilities of producing military equipment in Lithuania. A decision was adopted to coordinate all issues with Latvia and Estonia, and to set up a special working group to analyze the possibilities of its own production and assess its economic basis. As V. Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas [parliament] National Security Committee, reported to RESPUBLIKA, alongside these problems, the meeting also dealt with technical matters in deploying the Army and the issue of control over the airspace. RESPUBLIKA found out that the problem of the establishment of a peacekeeping battalion was postponed for another meeting which will, probably, be held on 7-14 March. According to V. Petkevicius, the "Partnership for Peace" agreement does not oblige a single country to form peacekeeping battalions or corps. Preliminary estimations show that the establishment of such a battalion or a corps would require about $30 and $10-12 million, respectively. The Defense Council also had to consider the manner in which European standards must be applied to the Lithuanian Army. In V. Petkevicius' opinion, first of well, Lithuania should decide how much and what type of Army it needs. The military could claim 5 percent of the national budget at best. Unfortunately, the purchase of fighters will have to be abandoned, to say nothing of luxury cars for the National Defense Ministry. According to V. Petkevicius, fighters in Lithuania are as necessary as skis in Africa. Speaking about the problems at the National Defense Ministry, the chairman of the Seimas National Security Committee noted that measures would be applied to prevent the temptation of dealing in arms -- a draft law regulating the purchase of arms for Lithuanian defense structures is being prepared. The draft law does not project that "arms will be bought by the Arms Fund alone, and that ministries will be only contractors and experts in arms quality." Currently, the Prosecutor General's Office is investigating 150 cases concerning disorder at the National Defense Ministry.
