FR940721-0-00091 FR940721-0-00014 (d) In the event that, during a model year, a supplier of engines or transmissions produces an engine of a new displacement or transmission of a new type or produces the same engine displacement or transmission in a different plant, the supplier shall notify the manufacturer of the origin of the new engine or transmission prior to shipment of the first engine or transmission that will be installed in a passenger motor vehicle intended for public sale. (e) A single certificate may cover multiple engines or transmissions. If a certificate provided in advance of the delivery of an engine or transmission becomes inaccurate because of changed circumstances, a corrected certificate shall be provided no later than the time of delivery of the engine or transmission. (f) For suppliers of engines and transmissions, the information and certification required by this section is in addition to that required by §§583.10 and 583.11. §583.13 Supplier certification and certificates. Each supplier shall certify the information on each certificate provided under §§583.10, 583.11, and 583.12 by including the following phrase on the certificate: ``This information is certified in accordance with DOT regulations.'' The phrase shall immediately precede the other information on the certificate. The certificate may be submitted to a manufacturer or allied supplier in any mode (e.g., paper, electronic) provided the mode contains all information in the certificate. §583.14 Currency conversion rate. For purposes of calculations of content value under this part, manufacturers and suppliers shall calculate exchange rates using the methodology set forth in this section. (a) Manufacturers. (1) Unless a manufacturer has had a petition approved by the Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR 600.511&hyph;80(b)(1), for all calculations made by the manufacturer as a basis for the information provided on the label required by §583.5, manufacturers shall take the mean of the exchange rates in effect at the end of each quarter set by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for twelve calendar quarters prior to and including the calendar quarter ending one year prior to the date that the manufacturer submits information for a carline under §583.17. (2) A manufacturer that has had a petition approved by the Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR 600.511&hyph;80(b)(1), which provides for a different method of determining exchange rates, shall use the same method as a basis for the information provided on the label required by §583.5, and shall inform the Administrator of the exchange rate method it is using at the time the information required by §583.5 is submitted. (b) Suppliers. For all calculations underlying the information provided on each certificate required by §§583.10, 583.11, and 583.12, suppliers shall take the mean of the exchange rates in effect at the end of each quarter set by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for twelve calendar quarters prior to and including the calendar quarter ending one year prior to the date of such certificate. §583.15 Joint ownership. (a) A carline jointly owned and/or produced by more than one manufacturer shall be attributed to the single manufacturer that markets the carline, subject to paragraph (b) of this section. (b)(1) The joint owners of a carline may designate, by written agreement, the manufacturer of record of that carline. (2) The manufacturer of record is responsible for compliance with all the manufacturer requirements in this part with respect to the jointly owned carline. However, carline determinations must be consistent with §583.4(3). (3) A designation under this section of a manufacturer of record is effective beginning with the first model year beginning after the conclusion of the written agreement, or, if the joint owners so agree in writing, with a specified later model year. (4) Each manufacturer of record shall send to the Administrator written notification of its designation as such not later than 30 days after the conclusion of the written agreement, and state the carline of which it is considered the manufacturer, the names of the other persons which jointly own the carline, and the name of the person, if any, formerly considered to be the manufacturer of record. (5) The joint owners of a carline may change the manufacturer of record for a future model year by concluding a written agreement before the beginning of that model year. (6) The allied suppliers for the jointly owned carline are the suppliers that are wholly owned by any of the manufacturers of the jointly owned carline. §583.16 Maintenance of records. (a) General. Each manufacturer of new passenger motor vehicles and each supplier of passenger motor vehicle equipment subject to this part shall establish, maintain, and retain in organized and indexed form, records as specified in this section. All records, including the certificates provided by suppliers, may be stored in any mode provided the mode contains all information in the records and certificates. (b) Manufacturers. Each manufacturer shall maintain all records which provide a basis for the information it provides on the labels required by §583.5, including, but not limited to, certificates from suppliers, parts lists, calculations of content, and relevant contracts with suppliers.
