Contrary to what was expected, there was no plenary meeting yesterday. The mediators took turns meeting the two sides in a bid to find some kind of agreement. Diplomatic sources have said, though, that no such agreement was forthcoming and the mediators would have to make similar efforts today. Jardo Muecalia, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] representative in Washington, said yesterday that he was optimistic about the outcome of the Lusaka peace talks. He also expressed the hope that the Luanda government would change its attitude. Asked to comment on the talks, Ambassador Muecalia said progress had been made with regard to military and political issues. He noted, however, that such progress had only been possible thanks to the many concessions UNITA has made. He added he hoped the government would also make concessions.
