The visit resulted in the two countries overcoming their reservations and establishing a durable framework for building a new partnership despite continuing differences over many issues. U.S. President Clinton has emphasized that the United States has a high stake in improving its relationship with India. Indian Prime Minister Rao said that his discussions with President Clinton convinced him that India and the U.S. can develop a bilateral relationship of maturity and strength that can contribute not only to mutual good but also to the world as a whole. During his visit, Rao has successfully put India back on Washington's economic agenda and conceded nothing on issues like the non-proliferation, human rights and its position on the Kashmir problem. The bilateral dialogue will continue as Washington remains unconvinced by the Indian argument that it can not sign the "discriminatory" nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. On the Kashmir issue, the U.S. position is now closer to the Indian stand as U.S. President B. Clinton said that it is for India and Pakistan to get together and resolve it, without mentioning the will of the Kashmir people this time. Adding to the happiness of the Indians, President Clinton said that he has an open mind on the possibility of India acquiring permanent membership of the U.N. Security Council -- something the Indians have long been seeking. A distinct possibility of defence relationship including joint exercises has emerged following discussions with U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry. India's emphasis on the positive aspects of the economic relationship was also endorsed by Clinton when he said that India's important reform plan will be the engine of growth in the relations between the two countries. U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown is to visit India in November to discuss how to promote growth in trade and investment. It has been agreed to revitalize the Indo-U.S. joint commission of 1974, to establish regular foreign office consultations between the two countries as well as to upgrade cooperation in science and technology. The revitalization of the Indo-U.S. joint commission to be chaired by the Indian foreign minister and U.S. secretary of state is viewed here as U.S. recognition of the potential for building a positive economic relationship with India. The commission is to have four sub-commissions on education and culture, science and technology, agriculture and economics and commerce. The revival will begin with a meeting between finance secretaries of the two countries before the end of the year, according to Indian Foreign Secretary K. Srinivasan.
