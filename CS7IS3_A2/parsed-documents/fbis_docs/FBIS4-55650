FBIS4-55650 "dreeu097_r_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-097 Daily Report 16 May 1994 ROMANIA `Special Telecommunications Service' Described `Special Telecommunications Service' Described AU1805165494 Bucharest COTIDIANUL in Romanian 16 May 94 p 4 AU1805165494 Bucharest COTIDIANUL Romanian BFN [Report by Anca Lazarescu: "What Is the Special Telecommunications Service, What Does It Aim To Do, and To Whom Is It Subordinated?"; all figures as published] [Text] On 7 June 1993 MONITORUL OFICIAL published Government Decision No. 229 of 27 May 1993 "on certain measures related to the organization and functioning of the Special Telecommunications Service" [Serviciul de Telecomunicatii Speciale -- STS]. Assuming the very likely hypothesis that our readers have never heard of that so-called "special" service before, we have to reassure them that there is no reason for them to be excessively worried or surprised, because it had already functioned before the aforementioned government decision was published -- originally within the DIE [Department for Foreign Intelligence] and, after the revolution, within the Ministry of National Defense. Aside from this, our readers can be "relaxed" also considering that our parliamentary representatives know exactly as little about STS as they do. Or, at least, that is what some of them claim. Being aware or not of what the STS actually is, quite soon our representatives will have to take a vote on the budget of that institution. In the draft law on the state budget, the government earmarked 21 billion lei for the STS. Is that a lot or is it little? It depends on the angle from which one looks at it. Making a simple comparison, let us merely remark that for the Ministry of Telecommunications the 1994 state budget allots 8.4 billion lei. I let you reach your own conclusions. Article 1 of the government decision signed by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, Finance Minister Florin Georgescu, [former] Defense Minister Niculae Spiroiu, and Telecommunications Minister Andrei Chirica stipulates: "The STS is a special central body in the domain of special telecommunications." Thus, as a "central body," the STS is actually a kind of a governmental structure. As a matter of fact, Article 4 stipulates: "The STS is led by a director, the office of whom is equivalent to those of secretaries of state, while the office of his deputies to those of undersecretaries of state." Basically, "the organization, the functioning, and the principal attributions of the STS are established by the Supreme Defense Council of the country." (Article 2) The STS cooperates with the institutions belonging to the national defense system, but also with the Ministry of Telecommunications, in accordance with Article 3, carrying out the following activities: a) Administers, develops, and exploits special telephone communication networks and data transmission networks; b) Administers, develops, and exploits the TO [Telecomunicatii Operative] interurban teleconference network; c) Administers, develops, and exploits the special radio-communications network, which consists of stationary and mobile radio-communication networks and radio relays; d) Manages the radio-electric frequency spectrum used by the government; e) Ensures the protection of the telecommunication networks being responsible for the carrying out of the activities of radio-electronic surveillance, special technical checking measures, and the introduction of appropriate codifying [aparatura secretizata] equipment; f) Carries out or approves all investments and equipping works in the domain of special telecommunications listed in the appendix of the present decision; g) Carries out collateral activities needed for the achievement of the goals of its activity: Ensures its own technical-material supplies, including importations in concordance with the current legislation, engages in technical and informational research and design, and ensures training, medical assistance, and social-cultural activity for its personnel; h) Ensures liaison with international bodies in that branch. To this lengthy list of clouded and uncontrollable activities (the National Defense Council can supplement them by assigning it further tasks!) the STS is to carry out, let us add the explanations given by Tatiana Francu, the head of the STS Department for Relations with the Public, explanations that were published in the review EXPRES in virtue of the right to reply: "The STS is a special military body in the domain of telecommunications, working for the public authority and the central and territorial bodies of the state administration, and which ensures the cooperation link among the institutions belonging to the national defense system."

Everything would be all right, as it is normal that such a service should exist, if there were no doubts in connection with the way in which the STS was founded and the goals it actually pursues. The mystery surrounding it and the lack of any democratic control over its activity obviously generate suspicion. According to the report elaborated by the APADOR [expansion unknown] Association--Helsinki Committee, Government Decision No. 229 of 1993 is unconstitutional, because according to Article 107 of the Constitution, "government decisions are issued to organize the carrying out of laws." However, in this case there is no law the implementation of which would make necessary the setting up of the aforementioned service. What is even more, Article 1 of the government decision does not even mention the setting up of the service, but rather resumes purely and simply to define it. On the other hand, if this service is really a military body working for the institutions of the national defense system, in that case, according to Article 117 of the constitution, the STS could not possibly have been set up without Parliament's passing an organic law on its establishment. However, if the STS does not have a military nature, then why does the government decision fail to define what "special telecommunications" are and why is it that "the special telecommunication networks detailed in the appendix to the present decision are sent to the interested persons, only"? Regardless of how one looks at it, Government Decision No. 229 contradicts the Constitution. Unfortunately, Parliament can in no way exert control over this service. According to the Law on National Security, the number of intelligence services is limited to six. The STS is not mentioned among them. Until now Parliament has been exerting control solely over one of them, namely the SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service]. Could it be that the STS was founded especially to take over one part of the SRI's activity (such as the wiretapping of telephone conversations) and thus bypass any control? Under the circumstances of the total lack of openness and the numerous ambiguities they make use of, everything is possible.
