The output of engineering machinery, automobiles, electrical appliances, heavy-duty mine machinery, copiers, cameras and meters increased remarkably while that of agricultural machinery and basic mechanical parts declined. A lot of complete equipment was made for key national projects last year and more technology-intensive machinery was manufactured. The meeting revealed that China is now making a program to promote the development of the mechanical industry. By 2010, the machinery industry will be the mainstay industry of the national economy, with a total output value of 3,000 billion yuan, one third of the total of the country's industry. To meet the target, the program proposes several measures: build a national unified machinery product market; aid some highly- efficient enterprises to take the lead; readjust the capital structure by introducing joint-stock system; encourage the cooperation and merging among enterprises; support the large and medium state-run enterprises to conduct scientific and technological research. According to the program, five enterprises with sales volume of 10 billion yuan and 20 with five billion yuan will crop up in the country by the end of this century; the qualities of some mechanical products will reach the world advanced levels.
