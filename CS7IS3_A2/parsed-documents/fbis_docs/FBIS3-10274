The National Commission of Guatemalan Widows [Conavigua] said Army troops have been visiting villages in the interior of the country since last February to recruit youths. Conavigua stated in a communique: "The mothers, sisters, and wives of Guatemala protest once again against the abrupt, indiscriminate manner in which the Army is implementing an obligatory recruitment." According to the report, youths are "captured" when they leave school, mass, the market, or when walking in the square. Conavigua has referred to the Army's recruitment as a "brutal hunt." Conavigua also criticized the Army's never telling families their sons have been taken to military detachments for recruitment; therefore, relatives are kept in the dark for quite a while regarding their whereabouts Conavigua stated the persecutions were conducted such municipalities as Coatepeque, Momostenango, Totonicapan, Patzite, and El Estor, and in the country's interior, as well as in other municipalities in the central Department of Chimaltenango and the western Department of Quetzaltenango. International human rights organizations such as the Guatemalan Human Rights Ombudsman's Office, which is the independent human rights UN specialist in Guatemala, and the Guatemalan Mutual Support Group [GAM] have requested the government regulate or ban the current recruitment practices. GAM consists of Colombia, the United States, Mexico, Norway, Spain, and Venezuela.
