Participants in an international conference on cartography which opened in Moscow today know this well. Over to our correspondent, Andrey Zenkov: [Zenkov] In various eras, no matter how different the prevailing social system, no matter how complex the internal and external political situation, the Geographical Department, the Maps Department, the Supreme Geodesic Directorate, the Main Directorate for Cartography attached to the Council of Ministers and, now, Russia's Federal Service for Geodesy and Cartography, have always done basically the same job. With assistance from their experts they entered on maps the dividing lines which politicians, assisted by the military, decided on. For 68 years of its 75-year existence the Russian cartographic service has answered to the KGB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the State Committee for Construction, the Ministry of Ecology, or the Ministry of Natural Resources. Each of these bodies had its own priorities. [Begin Zhalkovskiy recording] We have now managed to declassify maps in the 1:1,000,000 series, the 1:500,000 series, and the 1:200,000 series. The Ministry of Defense has also agreed to the declassification of the 1:100,000 series. Maps for the use of the public, including maps of oblasts, maps of rayons, and maps of regions, are being produced on the basis of these maps. We will produce these maps. In fact we have already started. They will be very detailed. You will be able to find your own village -- and maybe even your own house on them. [end recording] As Yevgeniy Zhalkovskiy, first deputy head of the service, told me, few people realize that throughout the entire existence of the USSR, the only countries with whom we had official agreements on the mapping of borders were Finland, Poland, Korea, and Mongolia. Today special commissions are discussing these extremely difficult issues with the Baltic republics and the countries of the Caucasus region.
