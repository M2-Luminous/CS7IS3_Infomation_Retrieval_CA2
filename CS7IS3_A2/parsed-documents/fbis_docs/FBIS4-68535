And at the start of our interview in his huge apartment on Vavilov Street he warned me, as he put his crutches aside, that I should be totally objective so that all of us, biased journalists, will not regret it later when our heads may get cracked together. Two quite impressive-looking guys, who opened the door for me and then stayed on duty in the "foyer," were the best proof that there will be no shortage of those capable of cracking others' heads together. [Khinshteyn] Is it true that you escaped the White House through underground passages? [Barkashov] No, I came out together with enforcement ministers--Barannikov, Dunayev, and Achalov. They were the first to leave, while many others, including Rutskoy, were afraid to come out at all and did not believe the guarantees given by Alpha. As we were coming out, however, an Alpha officer separated the enforcement ministers from the rest, saying that there was an order to detain them. Naturally this alarmed us, and I expressed a desire to be arrested together with them. I showed my passport and said that I was a member of Achalov's staff. But the officer said that he did not have an order to this effect. [Khinshteyn] How many of your people died? [Barkashov] Two, and 11 were wounded. As we were coming out of the White House they somehow got separated from our chain and ended up brutally murdered. Their noses and ears were cut off, fingers torn apart. (Nothing of this kind is mentioned in the forensic report I have seen.--A.Kh.) The "democrats" did this out of fear. They thought of themselves as heroes, Rambos, and here they are running scared shitless. [Khinshteyn] Did you hide at bases and safehouses after the October events? [Barkashov] Partly. There were several safe apartments where we lived, because literally in a week I learned that I was on an all-Russia fugitive list. I also knew through my own channels in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] that there was an advisement not to take live prisoners during the arrest of several persons, including myself. [Khinshteyn] How did the assassination attempt on you occur? [Barkashov] It was late night and I was walking along the road to Krasnogorsk; I heard the sound of a car in the distance. They approached from behind. I did not hear the shots, but felt the pain right away. I flagged a passing vehicle. Just in case, I let the first one pass me, and then the second--not a passenger car--took me to a hospital. [Khinshteyn] Was this an action of our special services? Would it have not been easier for them, though, to kill you? [Barkashov] Undoubtedly, it was the special services. Perhaps it would have been easier to shoot me to death, but things do not always come out the way one wants. Also, they may have thought that I was armed, too. [Khinshteyn] How did it come out that it was you in the hospital? [Barkashov] I do not know. I checked in there under a different name, but suddenly general procuracy officers showed up and suggested that I move to the MVD hospital. Moreover, they said that they did not have a warrant for my arrest. Despite my protestations, however, I was transferred there under heavy guard. [Khinshteyn] Is it true that the RNE maintains ties with the KGB-FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service]? [Barkashov] Not true. Only a movement that does not have its own ideology and strategic goals can be controlled. It can be manipulated. The RNE has a clearly enunciated program and defined ideas. [Khinshteyn] Do you have people working for special services? [Barkashov] In the RNE--no; around it--without a doubt, mainly from the Main Protection Directorate. It is impossible for an agent to hide his intentions for long. People who come to the party resonate with it in their soul. The soul--do you understand? One cannot resonate artificially. [Khinshteyn] Do your guys conduct intelligence work? [Barkashov] We have to collect information in opposing movements. Those whom we suspect of extremism with respect to the Russian people and the Russian nationalist movement, in order to protect ourselves and be ready for whatever comes. For instance, I consider Beytar such an organization. [Khinshteyn] How many members are there in the RNE? [Barkashov] In Moscow--1,500; across Russia--about 15,000. This is just the confederates. [Khinshteyn] God forbid, you come to power. Will there be pogroms? [Barkashov] What nonsense. Serious people always start with important things. [Khinshteyn] You mean pogroms are unimportant? [Barkashov] Nonsense. Are we going after anybody now? We do not even bother MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, and never will. [Khinshteyn] Will you let people emigrate? Yeltsin, for instance? [Barkashov] If people disagree with our policy, they will be free to leave. But if they have committed crimes, they must be tried. In any case, this applies to the current government. Their activities will have to be investigated. [Khinshteyn] And when will this happen? [Barkashov] In a year, a year and a half. Definitely within two years. Time works in our favor. We will build an objective opinion, will get the support of the majority of the population, and will absolutely legitimately come to power. When I was in prison I was asked to run in absentia in four non-Moscow districts, and I am 98 percent certain that I would have won. What for, though? [Khinshteyn] I see you have a volume of Hitler on the bookshelf. Do you like him? [Barkashov] And why do you not notice that I have Rozanov or Blavatskaya? As to Hitler... I like what he did for his country. [Khinshteyn] Are you for concentration camps? [Barkashov] No, I am against it. I tell my wife: Do not plant potatoes. When she does the weeding, collects bugs, my heart aches. I imagine a concentration camp. [Khinshteyn] You sound like such a humanist. Like Romain Rolland. [Barkashov] Do not say this. I am a true humanist. A natural one. It is the state that concerns itself with idiots while millions of Russian children are not provided with elementary rations. We need to take care of normal children. [Khinshteyn] Since your release have you seen any of your White House confederates? [Barkashov] Those I wanted to see I already have. After all, I am ill--can my friends not visit me? Zhirinovskiy came; he sat in that very chair. We put away a bottle of cognac to my health. [Khinshteyn] Is it true that you were an instructor in Egypt? [Barkashov] I trained in a special unit training international soldiers for the Near East, but did not get a chance to fight: The president of Egypt refused our aid; although I did write memorandums asking to send volunteers to fight on the side of the oppressed Arab proper suffering from Israel's aggressive policy. So what--I like justice; there us such a trait among Russians. I transferred to reserves in the rank of senior sergeant. Now I am a corporal. How? I took two stripes off and became a corporal. [Khinshteyn] I just cannot figure it out: Would it not be easier to ban you? [Barkashov] It will not work. We act within the boundaries of the current law. We do not have shock troopers--people, carrying arms--and neither do we have arms; we never have. That we are better prepared for some actions than others is a result of discipline. While other parties gather together only once a year for a rally, we work daily. We sponsor plants, educational institutions, military units. Our guys go there regularly, sell newspapers, conduct political propaganda. But we cannot be charged with anything. One has to present one's thoughts correctly. [Khinshteyn] But you did arm yourselves with submachine guns, did you not? [Barkashov] I did, and I fired it. We had an order from the Supreme Soviet: protect peaceful demonstrators from being shot at. An order from a legitimately elected authority. [Khinshteyn] That is, there is nothing to get you on? [Barkashov] All right, so they kept me in prison. What did they achieve? Only a rise in our authority. Of course, it is better for them to let us go. [Khinshteyn] Aleksandr Petrovich, are you a fascist? [Barkashov] I am for national revival and justice for all, without degeneration of the Russian nation. If this is called national-socialism, I am a national-socialist. [Khinshteyn] Are there people in the current government of Russia who support you? [Barkashov] I do not know... [Khinshteyn] Or perhaps you do not want to say? [Barkashov] Perhaps. Do not ask questions to which you cannot get an answer. [end Barkashov] As we parted, Barkashov, who promised to accept me into the RNE if I a) change my convictions, b) agree with the program, and c) actively work, gave me an escort. "So that you do not get beaten up," he explained. Emerging onto the street, my escort waved to someone invisible. Meaning, it is all right. One of ours. It was a somewhat hasty assumption.
