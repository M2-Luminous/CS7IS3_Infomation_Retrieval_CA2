FR941130-1-00018 FR941130-1-00002 Regulatory Analysis A regulatory analysis has not been prepared for this proposed rule because the proposed rule is administrative in that it would amend the criteria the NRC uses for determining which of its licensees would qualify as small entities for the purposes of compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The amended size standards would conform to SBA's revised standards and result in an increase in the number of NRC licensees that would qualify as small entities. Regulatory Flexibility Certification As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule is administrative in that it would amend the criteria the NRC uses in determining which of its licensees would qualify as small entities for the purposes of compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The amended size standards would conform to SBA's revised standards and result in an increase in the number of NRC licensees that would qualify as small entities. Backfit Analysis The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule and, therefore, that a backfit analysis is not required for this proposed rule because these amendments do not impose any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).
