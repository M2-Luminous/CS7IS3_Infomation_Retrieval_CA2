In many articles in the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, he makes brilliant expositions about the importance of problems concerning agriculture, rural areas, and peasants, and about ways to promote agricultural production and improve rural work. Earnestly studying these expositions is of great importance to upholding the ideological guidance that agriculture serves as the foundation of the national economy, to further invigorating agricultural production and improving rural work, to maintaining social stability, and to promoting a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. We Must Never Forget Agriculture Is the Foundation of the Economy In sizing up the situation, studying problems, or making policy decisions, Comrade Xiaoping has always attached top strategic importance to problems concerning agriculture, rural areas, and peasants. He has repeated on many occasions that agriculture plays a key strategic role in our effort to develop agricultural production. He said: "In our strategy for economic development, energy and transport are the key points, so is agriculture." He believed that whether the Chinese economy will develop depends on whether rural areas make progress and on whether peasants can lead a good life. Whether the objective of quadrupling the 1980 GNP will be attained by the end of this century mainly depends on the efforts of peasants, who account for 80 percent of the Chinese population. Stability in rural areas is the foundation of national stability. "A total of 80 percent of the Chinese population resides in rural areas, so whether China will maintain stability mainly depends on whether rural areas will maintain stability. Even if we have done a good job in urban areas, we will go nowhere without a stable countryside serving as the foundation." "There will be no overall political stability without rural stability. We will not shake off poverty if the peasants do not shake off poverty." Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly told the whole party: "Agriculture is the foundation of the economy, we must never forget this"; "it is essential to have a constant and firm grasp of agriculture." The priority placed by Comrade Xiaoping on problems concerning agriculture, rural areas, and peasants is based on his consideration of international and internal economics and politics, so what he has said is highly pertinent. We must arrive at an adequate understanding of his expositions. We must regard problems concerning agriculture, rural areas, and peasants as important issues affecting social stability, consolidation of the achievements we have made in reform, our efforts to attain the objective of the modernization drive, and the future and destiny of the party and the country. However, in the previous period, quite a number of leading cadres have failed to really put agriculture in the first place of the economic work. Especially in the process of developing a market economy, leading cadres in many places shifted their energy elsewhere, neglecting or relaxing their leadership over agriculture. To counter this tendency, Comrade Jiang Zemin, in speeches at the national conferences on rural work held in October 1993 and March this year, called on the party membership to conscientiously study Comrade Xiaoping's important expositions about agriculture and sum up our experience in developing agricultural production to further uphold the ideological guidance that agriculture is the foundation for the economy. He said: As we step up reform and open China more widely to the outside world, there will be more need for us to attach importance to, safeguard, and strengthen agriculture. It is necessary to really, rather than superficially, practically, rather than verbally, and wholeheartedly, rather than half-heartedly, strengthen agriculture as the foundation for the economy. Provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal party committees must devote great efforts to rural work and prefectural and county party committees must also focus on it. The success of rural work should become an important criterion for appraising the work results of key leading cadres. Grain Problem Is the Principal Problem for Agricultural Production Comrade Xiaoping has given top priority to the grain problem. He believed that the grain problem is part and parcel of agricultural production. While talking to responsible members of the State Planning Commission, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, and the department in charge of agricultural production in January 1983, Comrade Xiaoping said: "We should have an overall plan for agricultural development. We must first of all increase grain production... and basically solve the problem of adequate grain production by 2000. This is an important strategic plan." After listening to reports by leading comrades of the central authorities on the economic situation in June 1986, he pointed out: "In exercising macroeconomic control, we should put agriculture in an appropriate place, bearing in mind the general objective of producing 480 billion kg of grain per year by the end of this century. The practice of importing a large quantity of grain should not be repeated in a few years, because that will affect our economic growth rate." Grain is the people's most fundamental means of subsistence and also an important raw material for light industry, so it has a direct bearing on the people's basic livelihood and immediate interest, on social stability, and on economic development as a whole. Especially in China, a big country with 1.1 billion people, if something has gone wrong with grain production, no country in the world can save us. If we live on imported grain, we will be controlled by others. Therefore, we must, at any time, never forget this important matter regarding independence and self-reliance of our nation, must pay close attention to the matter, and try our utmost to solve the problem, never relaxing our vigilance a bit. Township Enterprises Must Be Developed and Upgraded Comrade Xiaoping has paid great attention to the development of township enterprises and has given a high appraisal of achievements made by township enterprises. He said gladly in June 1987: "The most rewarding achievement totally unexpected in rural reform is the setting up of township enterprises. Many small enterprises in various trades suddenly emerged as a new force and worked together to develop a market economy. This does not reflect the merits and achievements of the central authorities. Township enterprises have been growing at an annual rate of 20 percent for several years." He believes that the township enterprise is an invention of the Chinese peasants. Comrade Xiaoping has adequately affirmed the important role the township enterprises have played in rural reform and development. After listing township enterprise achievements such as "helping promote rural development," "giving jobs to people who accounted for 50 percent of surplus rural labor," and "building up a large number of small new towns," he has emphasized that "township enterprises are very important" and that "they must be developed and upgraded." Thanks to the great concern of Comrade Xiaoping and under the leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council, China's township enterprises have developed and been upgraded more rapidly over the last few years. They have made gratifying achievements and have become the mainstay of our rural economy and an important pillar of our national economy. In 1993, China's township enterprise output value totaled 2.9 trillion yuan, net profit was 160 billion yuan, taxes turned over to the state totaled 95 billion yuan, export volume was 190 billion yuan, and 112 million workers were employed. By now, the annual gross output value of township enterprises constitutes over 60 percent of the gross rural output value and "one-third" of China's gross industrial output value. History has proved and will continue to prove that if the countryside is to become moderately prosperous, it is essential to develop township enterprises. The township enterprise serves as our greatest project for supporting poor areas and achieving common prosperity and a fundamental guarantee for attaining agricultural modernization. Appropriate Policies and Science Are Essential to Agricultural Development After making an in-depth analysis of our experience in developing agriculture, Comrade Xiaoping clearly pointed out that "two things are essential to agricultural development: appropriate policies and science." He adequately affirmed the correctness of the party's policy on introducing the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output. The system has proved effective and must not be changed for a long time, he said. He told the third full session of the Central Advisory Commission: "If we change the present policies, the state and the people will suffer losses, so the people, the 800 million peasants in particular, will come out against us. If we change present rural polices, we will immediately lower peasant living standards." "Judging by our experience, the present generation must not change the policies, neither must future generations." In the meantime, he was fully positive of the "endless development and role of science and technology" and vigorously advocated "tilling the land in a scientific way" and invigorating agriculture by applying scientific and technological achievements and promoting education. In a speech given in January 1983, he pointed out that "great efforts should be made to intensify research on agricultural science and technology and train more agricultural technicians, as well as to tackle key problems in agricultural scientific research." In line with Comrade Xiaoping's thinking on agricultural development, that is, that appropriate policies and science are essential to agricultural development, we must continue to stabilize the party's policies for rural areas and improve and develop them in practice. In addition, we must take effective measures to promote research on agricultural science and education and to propagate advanced agricultural techniques. We Have To Make Two Breakthroughs To Enhance Agricultural Reform and Development Comrade Xiaoping told several leading comrades of the central authorities in March 1990: "From a long-term point of view, we have to make two breakthroughs to enhance China's socialist agricultural reform and development. The first breakthrough is to abolish the people's commune and introduce the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output. This is a major advance, we must not change the system for a long time. The second breakthrough is to operate farming on an appropriate scale and develop the collective economy to meet the needs of tilling the land in a scientific way and of socialization of production. This is another major advance and needs, of course, a long period." The contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output is a great creation by Chinese peasants. Its greatest advantage has manifested itself in thoroughly doing away with the practice of "allowing everyone to eat from the same big pot" and thus enabling the peasants to make land management decisions on their own. The system has greatly mobilized peasant enthusiasm for production and thus greatly liberated productive forces in rural areas. With the development of rural productive forces and the planned economy being replaced by the market economy, the contradictions between separation of landholding and intensive management and between individual household operation and socialized production have become increasingly acute. To solve these contradictions, it is necessary to operate farming on an appropriate scale and develop the collective economy. This is a very difficult policy issue. We must properly explore and analyze our experience before we can work out the guiding principle and policies, as well as measures to implement the principle and policies. Our fundamental approach is that we must work energetically rather than rashly to attain our objective. Judging from our successful experience in introducing the cooperative joint- stock system in the countryside, the system should serve as a vanguard in deepening rural reforms and achieving the second breakthrough in the countryside.
