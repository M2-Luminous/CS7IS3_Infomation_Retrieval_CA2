The watershed came with the speech delivered by President Michal Kovac, which tipped the scales. The unity of opposition was disturbed by the hesitation of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], which, until the very last moment, did not exclude cooperation with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. This was stated by the vice chairman of the Coexistence [Egyutteles] Movement, Arpad Duka Zolyomi, whose statement continued to dominate today's press conference. Our radio was represented by Bernard Hornak, who invited Zolyomi to the microphone. [Begin recording] [Hornak] According to a preliminary agreement of the former opposition parties, politicians representing the [ethnic] Hungarian parties in Slovakia will not appear in the new government. In spite of this, you do support the formation of the new government, which should consist of representatives of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], of the so-called center bloc, and of the Christian Democratic Party [KDH]. [Zolyomi] I would like to return to the 26th session of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, where we learned that the emerging broader coalition did not count on our participation. Then we started to discuss under what conditions we were going to support this new government. We defined certain points, certain measures that could be taken in a joint effort with the government. These were very specific matters, out of which a more comprehensive concept was formulated. We therefore want to support this government, provided, of course, that it keeps to our agreement. In such a case, our requests or suggestions should appear in some form in the new government's program. [Hornak] You mentioned the conditions. What are they? [Zolyomi] They are concerned with specific matters related, for example, to the recommendations of the Council of Europe, which should put an end to matters that have been dragging on for almost a year. Then, certain questions relate to jurisdiction of local self-governing bodies, to an alternative educational system, and to the local administrative division. Naturally, this government, whose term of office will be limited, is probably not going to deal with this question in depth. [passage omitted]. A further matter to be dealt with is related to reorganizing and creating a new concept of the Council for Nationalities working within the framework of the Slovak Government and, in some way, the matter of minority representation in the civil service.
