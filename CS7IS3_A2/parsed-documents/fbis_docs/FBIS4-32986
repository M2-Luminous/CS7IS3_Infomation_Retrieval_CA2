Chamorro] [Text] To those who take a traditional approach to party politics, any possibility of renewing the program, bylaws, and leadership of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] is subordinate to the higher objective of preserving internal unity. Under different historical circumstances, this approach, when the party was in power, enforced discipline in the FSLN, and unity set a limit on change. Now, however, when we are in the opposition, we cannot afford not to change. Unity, which is misunderstood as an end in itself, is ceasing to be a vehicle for change and is winding up as a straitjacket on thinking. This restrictive approach has given rise to the mistaken attempt to build a revolutionary party in the image and likeness of its own apparatus, but behind the back of its huge constituency. This was the predominant trend at the recent assemblies in Masaya and Leon, where the pursuit of sectarian dominance in the name of unity emerged. The other proposal in Sandinism is to struggle for unity by bringing the FSLN and its responsibilities before society. From this perspective the challenge is not to maintain unity in the abstract but rather to adapt the party so that it brings together the majority of Sandinists who are now scattered: to unite, open up, and grow, and to design a political strategy that, from the existing spheres of power and the spheres yet to be developed in civil society, will enable us to forge alliances and broaden the involvement and influence of grassroots sectors. We live in times of ongoing crisis. The famous ESAF is tantamount to three straight years of an explosive socioeconomic situation. Opposing the IMF's economic program requires a Sandinism that can take effective action amid the dynamics of all segments of society: peasants, unions, associations of producers and businessmen, consumers, the unemployed, women, young people, professionals, etc. It demands a party that places respect for the autonomy of social and union movements before the temptation of a vanguard to direct all struggles by remote control through a Staff. Above all, it demands a leadership that in its commitment to accompany and support the just struggles of the people, takes up before the people, the responsibility to exert its influence to do away with violent methods of struggle. Nothing has damaged Sandinism's political credibility more than its ambiguity about condemning violence. Moreover, we are facing a crisis of credibility in all national and state political institutions, and no definite end to polarization is in sight. The greatest danger is that while Aleman's right-wing authoritarian agenda has already become an electoral option, the FSLN remains trapped in the painful process of shedding its skin. Lessons and Options A great deal of the shilly-shallying reflected in the current high-flown debate can be clarified in light of the recent election campaign along the Atlantic Coast and its outcome. The elections along the coast erased Sandinism's false dichotomies in one fell swoop: Is it a revolutionary or an electoral party? Is it leftist or Social Democrat? Should it win votes or minds? Should it be an opposition party or a government partner? Should it wage a grass-roots or a congressional struggle? The FSLN set out to be a winning electoral party, albeit without full cognizance or nationwide consistency, and it failed. It reaffirmed that elections are the only legitimate path to power (even though some still privately deny this fact) but it did not succeed in putting together a victorious strategy. And in the end, even though it was defeated, Sandinism is still struggling tenaciously to influence the composition and program of the regional governments in order to stem the influence and control of the right. There, as in the rest of the country, the Front does not want to be in the opposition forever. There are those, however, who cling to the ideological view that the quality and political awareness of votes is more important than their number in realizing the desire for power. But if we want to attack the structural roots of poverty and social injustice, we must all acknowledge that votes do indeed add up and are decisive in setting any government program in motion. Sandinism must become convinced that what happened in the 1990 national election must not be repeated in 1996. It is one thing to lose power and become the leading political force in a country; it would be another thing, and a catastrophic one, to lose again and become the number two or three electoral force. That would condemn the FSLN to the status of a party that repeatedly loses, a true minority party that might be very cohesive ideologically but that would be less and less able to influence the destiny of the nation and the defense of the people's interests. This is why I feel that the FSLN's most important goal, with the backing or in spite of the Special Congress, is to lay the groundwork for a political strategy, marked by an electoral approach, to sway a majority and gain power in 1996. Only a program of renewal that can get the FSLN moving again through viable proposals to society and through a credible leadership, will be able to do this. I wonder: How else can the FSLN capture the imagination of a million new young voters in 1996? It is altogether untrue that it is too early to place this item on the agenda. We need only acknowledge how much headway the right's platform has made to realize that we are far behind. And the only way to begin closing the gap is to place Sandinism's true options before it: not the false dilemma of unity or division, but rather the choice between renewal now and certain political defeat in 1996. There is no other way.
