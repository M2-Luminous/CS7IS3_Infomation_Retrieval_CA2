In accordance with generally recognized norms, the treaty may be denounced at one year's notice, the source quoted Yeltsin as saying. The treaty does exist so far. However, Russia interprets its first article, which provides for offering North Korea military help automatically, if a war breaks out in the Korean peninsula, in a somewhat different way. This provision is actually ineffective, Yeltsin said.
