This important instruction is of very great, immediate significance. Approaching things realistically and guarding against formalism and a showy style of work is a Marxist principle and also a fine tradition of our party and Army. In recent years, the Military Commission as well as the General Staff Headquarters, the General Political Department, and the General Logistics Department have repeatedly stressed this issue. Party committees and leading organs at all levels have implemented relevant instructions of the Military Commission and the General Departments. Various tasks have been implemented satisfactorily on the whole. Nevertheless, in the leadership work of a small number of units there are still the problems of formalism and a showy style of work. Consequently, some tasks failed to be fully implemented in grass-roots units. So-called formalism refers to a metaphysical viewpoint, method, or style of work which onesidedly concentrates on form to the neglect of substance. It is characterized by separation of form and substance, preference for form over substance, and hankering for superficial spectaculars to the neglect of practical results. A so- called showy style of work refers to cutting oneself off from the masses, losing contact with reality, doing work superficially, and having an unsound style of work. Not only will formalism and a showy style of work corrupt social values, tarnish the image of cadres, and dampen the enthusiasm of the masses, but they will also make the party's principles and policies stay at meetings, on papers or in mouths, and prevent them from being genuinely implemented to the letter. In an essay, "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing" in those years, Comrade Mao Zedong incisively analyzed and sharply criticized formalism of various forms and regarded them as the archenemy of the working class and the Communist Party and as a sign of impurity in party spirit. As far as formalism and a showy style of work in the Army are concerned, we should all the more have a profound understanding of their harmfulness. In peacetime, they can seriously hamper the enhancement of our combat capability, and in wartime, they can exact a price in blood from us. At present, we should meet the needs of the macro-climate of developing a socialist market economy and of the military strategic principles of the new period. The task of accomplishing the general objective of building a modern, regular, and revolutionary army is very arduous. As new developments and problems are emerging one after another, we should work steadily and make solid progress. On no account should we indulge in a showy style of work in this regard. We should approach elimination of formalism and a showy style of work from a political height and eliminate them as an "archenemy." When its comes to the harmfulness of formalism and a showy style of work, many people bitterly hate them, but in practice, never will they be bored with them. The main reason for this state of affairs is the way their thinking does mischief, namely, hankering after fame and gain, fearing hardship, and trying to please the public by claptrap rather than by solid work. To eliminate formalism and a showy style of work, we should correct our guiding thinking on work. The purpose of our work is to promote army building and reform and enhance the combat capability of the troops. Proceeding from this purpose, we should hold ourselves responsible for both the higher and lower levels and on no account should we seek fame and gain and do anything that is pleasant to the eye but is of no use. We should have a strong sense of revolutionary cause and do solid work. We should have an ideological level of being willing to be lonely and not being burdened with fame and gain and a drive of not stopping until the true state of affairs is clear and practical results are achieved. Not only should leading organs at all levels be the first to set a good example but they should also dare to express, with a clear-cut stand and in clear and unequivocal terms, their views to their subordinates on what to encourage and what to oppose so that those who do solid work will genuinely be looked up to and those who indulge in formalism and a showy style of work will draw no benefit therefrom. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Formalism is also bureaucratism." Facts have proven that formalism and bureaucratism are linked together. The latter encourages the former, and the former conceals the latter. In studying the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, leaders at all levels should change their leadership style, make a priority of linking theory with practical work to do a good job of carrying our work in a down- to-earth manner, and exert efforts to solve this problem. We should energetically conduct investigations and study, try our best to conduct fewer upper-level activities, frequently go down to the troops and the grass-roots units, take measures to carry out work in light of the actual needs of the troops, and attach special importance to carrying out regular and basic work in a down-to-earth manner. Approaching things realistically and guarding against formalism and a showy style of work is a rudimentary requirement and also a very high standard. Whether this goal can be achieved or not is a test for the comprehensive quality of leading organs and cadres. We should have a good mental state and a sense of mission and high responsibility for army building, rouse ourselves for vigorous efforts to make the country prosperous, do solid work with perseverance, and make persistent efforts to strive to implement the party's principles and policies and the Military Commission's decisions under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
