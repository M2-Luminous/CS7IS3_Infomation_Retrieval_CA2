FBIS3-48284 "dreas015__a94003" FBIS-EAS-94-015-A Document Type:Daily Report 24 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Possible `Deterioration' of Ties OW2401030694 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database in Japanese 24 Jan 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2401030694 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [By Shegeru Komago in Washington; from Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 January Morning Edition] [Text] The U.S. Government will probably send very high-ranking officials, including Chairwoman Laura Tyson of the president's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), to the vice ministerial level plenary meeting of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks opening in Washington this week. It intends to make an all-out effort to "gather information" on the tumultuous political situation in Japan after the political reform bills were rejected by the House of Councillors on 21 January]. As early adoption of "economic stimulation measures, including an income tax cut," which the United States had strongly hoped for, has become quite improbable, this week's meeting may well decide the fate of the Japan-U.S. summit meeting scheduled for February. The vice ministerial level plenary meeting on 24 and 25 January is supposed to make an interim assessment of the framework talks. Regular members on the U.S. side of this meeting include Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president (concurrently vice chairman of the National Economic Council), and vice ministerial level representatives of the Departments of Treasury, State and Commerce, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The Japanese side will be headed by Koichiro Matsuura, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs. According to a White House source, aside from Tyson, CEA member Blinder [name as published], Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Roger C. Altman, and National Intelligence Council officer for East Asia Ezra Vogel may also participate in the meeting "if time permits." It will be an unusual meeting, with all the officials in charge of economic policy and intelligence in the Clinton administration attending. Behind this lies U.S. anxiety about the situation. While the U.S. Government has expressed its discontent at the lack of progress in the framework talks by criticizing Japanese bureaucrats, it always felt a final breakthrough could be achieved through a political decision by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. However, with the rejection of the political reform bills, the prime minister's leadership has been weakened, and it has become difficult to make an early decision on any income tax cut, not to mention market liberalization. The U.S. administration, under pressure from Congress, is now forced to decide between pushing through or postponing a Japan-U.S. summit which is unlikely to be fruitful. Therefore, following the visit of Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen to Japan on short notice to learn about the political situation, the United States would again like to assess how effectively Japan can respond in the framework talks at this week's meeting. There is concern that if Tyson leads the discussions, there will be heated exchanges between Japan and United States at the meeting. If the meeting is characterized by confrontation at a time when U.S. expectations of the Hosokawa administration are being lowered, it could lead to a decisive deterioration in Japan-U.S. relations.
