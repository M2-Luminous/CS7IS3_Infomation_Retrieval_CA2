The applause was filled with repentance for their past crimes and with hope for their future. (Jiang Lusheng), who was awarded a citation for merit at the congress, clapped until his hands turned red, and his eyes were moist with tears. Having been given a life sentence in 1983 on the charge of larceny, today he truly experienced the value of turning over a new leaf. When he was sent to jail, he was just a graduate of a primary school. Over the past 11 years, at the prison's school for training offenders, he assiduously accrued knowledge and skills and was even invited to serve as senior technician. During production and labor, he accomplished scores of innovation achievements one after another, saved hundreds of thousands in funds for the state, and created a miracle even praised by foreign specialists. Hence, his term of imprisonment has changed from life imprisonment to a set term of imprisonment. (Liu Zhengxing), deputy director of the provincial judicial department and political commissar of the provincial labor reform bureau, said: There are many other activists like (Jiang Lusheng). Since 1985, a total of 27,511 offenders in the province have extricated themselves from the bounds of illiteracy in prison, and 72,761 offenders have obtained the certificates of technology of various grades issued by labor departments. A prodigal who returns is more precious than gold. As said by (Li Fengde), head of the provincial labor reform bureau, some of the many offenders who were released after serving the sentence have been employed as state cadres and plant directors and managers, and some of them have been elected people's congress deputies and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. (Wang Zenglin), former offender at the no. 3 provincial prison, has seized 27 law violators and criminals after leaving the prison and has become rich through hard work, thus being elected as the advanced laborer of the state and commended in Beijing. Wang Yuxi, vice governor of the province, said excitedly at the congress: In providing employment, the party and the government have treated the persons released after serving the sentence without discrimination. So long as these persons are reformed satisfactorily and are furnished with appropriate knowledge and proficient skills, they will be well received by society after serving the sentence. On hearing this, the audience burst into prolonged and warm applause once more again.
