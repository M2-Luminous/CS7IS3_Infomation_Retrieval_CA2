Supporters of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], the largest opposition faction, which is based in Damascus and shares internal opposition influence with Hamas, say that the process of gradually shifting the leadership to the occupied territory actually began last year in implementation of the PFLP's fifth general congress resolutions. But the al-Asad-Clinton meeting came as a warning that the conclusion of a peace treaty between Israel and Syria would occur sooner than the PFLP leaders had originally expected. The branches of the Damascus-based Palestinian opposition factions in the occupied territory were worried when al-Asad and Clinton met in Geneva in mid-January. Some of them admitted that the opposition card would have a price and that the Syrian president would demand that price, particularly as the request for muzzling that opposition is primarily an Israeli request. Representatives of the various Palestinian factions in the occupied territory have jokingly wondered about the next station, and some suggested Yemen while others mentioned "even Iran." One of them said that "it is natural for any Arab leader to put his interests before any other interests, and nobody can claim that Syria has carried the Palestinian opposition on its shoulders or that it has defended that opposition." Representatives of these trends rule out the possibility of any future confrontation with Damascus for signing an agreement with Israel, and they believe that the natural choice would be to look for another host state "where there are no Israeli representatives and no threat to our lives." A PFLP official added: "Our options are very limited. The first priority is having the command headquarters in the cordon states, but as these states are now leaning toward signing an agreement with Israel, that would leave only the second tier of cordon states, namely Sudan and Iraq, which is out of the question at the present time." The first warning the Damascus-based factions had since the Palestinian resistance left Lebanon in 1982 was the 1991 Madrid conference, when the cordon states -- that is Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan -- and the Palestinians met face to face with Israeli representatives. It took some of these factions, such as the PFLP led by George Habash, two years to acknowledge the need to reverse the equation it had applied until then and to recognize the importance of shifting its centrifugal political and leadership weight to the occupied territory, particularly as the burden of the opposition there would increase with the [PLO] Tunis leadership moving to the occupied territory. Riyad al-Maliki, considered to be the PFLP's official spokesman in the occupied territory, says: "If Syria signed an agreement with Israel within a short period of time, that would surprise us, but if that did occur and the process of transferring the leadership had reached an advanced stage, there would be no problems." The talk about moving the leadership to the occupied territory does not include Front officials moving from Damascus or other Arab capitals to Gaza, Jericho, or other parts of the West Bank. It rather means that the size of the responsibility falling on the shoulders of those in the occupied territory and their duties would increase in the next phase, in which a Palestinian national autonomy authority would emerge, and these responsibilities and duties would outweigh the tasks of the leadership abroad. The PFLP in the occupied territory is still maintaining secrecy regarding the names and ranks of its leaders in the occupied territory, particularly those still unknown to the occupation authorities, unlike Fatah which has revealed all its cards since the signing of the Declaration of Principles with Israel. A PFLP official says: "We will not become a public party, nor will we reveal our organizational structure, not even after the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. That is, first, because we have to take into consideration the possibility that the agreement might fail and, second, because we still do not know what position the future authority would take regarding the opposition and to what extent its coordination with the occupation authorities would have a bearing on the repressive measures used." Al-Maliki, who was the PFLP's spokesman during the occupied territory's intifadah, which began in 1987, and got automatic immunity on the basis of his meetings with diplomats representing Western states (not Americans), says that the mechanism of the opposition's work will change as the Palestinians enter the new phase of implementation. He points out that "we now see nothing except negotiations under occupation. That is why we have to address public opinion and expose the danger of the agreement signed with Israel, but we cannot prevent anyone from negotiating or arriving at a formula of some kind." He adds: "When the implementation begins there will emerge a reality that we would have to confront and we will not be content with just writing articles in the press or addressing the masses but will use the direct method."
