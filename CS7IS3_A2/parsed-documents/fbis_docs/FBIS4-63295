A delegation of Belarusian defense officials, headed by Defense Minister Col. Gen. Pavel Kazlowski, met with Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius, Parliament Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas and visited the Gelezinis Vilkas (Iron Wolf) field brigade. Both ministers agree that the 720-kilometer Lithuanian-Belarusian border is an incentive to cooperate. This argument seems to be above the differences in defense concepts. Lithuania links its security guarantees with integration into NATO, while Belarus is a member of the collective security system of the CIS. But Linkevicius and Kazlowski maintain that the fact cannot hinder bilateral cooperation. Linkevicius told reporters that contacts would be easier if Belarus joined NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program. The Belarusian Government is now discussing the degree of the country's possible participation in the program, Kazlowski said at a press conference. The Belarusian minister said relations with the Baltics are especially significant to Belarus. Kazlowski said his country would like to learn more about Lithuania's experience in creating its armed forces. The two ministers agreed to set up working groups to continue the dialogue started in Vilnius and to determine areas for possible cooperation.
