FR940303-2-00171 FR940303-2-00093 In MY 1993, the fleet average fuel economy for imported passenger cars increased by 0.5 mpg from the MY 1992 CAFE level. Import CAFE was 29.5 mpg in MY 1993. Thirteen of the 18 imported car manufacturers increased their CAFE values between MYs 1992 and 1993, including 6 of the 9 Asian importers. Figure II-1 illustrates the changes in total new passenger car fleet CAFE from MY 1978 to MY 1993. The total light truck fleet CAFE remained constant at the MY 1992 CAFE level of 20.8 mpg. Figure II-2 illustrates the progress in total fleet CAFE from MY 1979 to MY 1993 for light trucks. A number of passenger car and a few light truck manufacturers are projected not to achieve the levels of the MY 1993 CAFE standards. NHTSA is not yet able to determine which of these manufacturers may be liable for civil penalties for noncompliance. Some MY 1993 CAFE values may change when final figures are provided to NHTSA by EPA, in mid-1994. In addition, several manufacturers are not expected to pay civil penalties because the credits they earned by exceeding the fuel economy standards in earlier years offset later shortfalls. Other manufacturers may file carryback plans to demonstrate that they anticipate earning credits in future model years to offset current deficits.
