FBIS4-60328 "drnes100_j_94047" FBIS-NES-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Commentary on al-Bid Receiving `Inevitable Punishment' Commentary on al-Bid Receiving `Inevitable Punishment' JN2305193294 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1718 GMT 23 May 94 JN2305193294 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Station commentary] [Text] The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy's control the al-'Anad Air Base, their liquidation of the rebellious forces of apostasy, treason, and secession in Shabwah, and their seizure of the strategic 'Atiq and its adjacent areas are evidence of the determination of these forces to execute their military tasks. The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy should be commended for their concern for saving civilians from the effects of the military clashes with the forces controlled by the supporters of the apostasy and secession gang. We want to reiterate that the overwhelming victory in Shabwah, and, particularly in 'Atiq -- which is considered one of the most important strategic areas purged of the secessionist forces by the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy -- is considered an important stride toward ridding the homeland of the secessionists who sold themselves to the devil. We are not exaggerating if we say that the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, which are achieving successive victories, will never hesitate in assuming their military tasks imposed by their faith in God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity and by their loyalty to constitutional legitimacy and democracy, which we accepted as our option to build a new Yemen, the Yemen of progress and prosperity. This is a firm conviction entrenched in the minds of our Armed Forces, who are protecting the homeland and unity and defending constitutional legitimacy. This should also dominate the minds of the remaining men carrying arms in the misled units that are still being moved by the rebellious and secessionist gang against the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy. Those who are still receiving orders from the gang of apostasy and secession -- the gang which declared its secession with impudence and blatant challenge toward the will of people -- must realize that they are now considered mercenaries. It would be better for them to stand at the side of unity and people and to defend constitutional legitimacy. The rebellious and secessionist gang, which is receiving money from the enemies of the homeland -- in addition to the money they have plundered -- is only interested in destroying the gains and achievements of the people, in shedding blood, and spreading death. Then, this gang plans escape with the millions they have plundered to outside the homeland. Therefore, we urge the units still being controlled by the gang of apostasy and secession to join the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy and to stand where the Yemeni people want them. The units that are still under the control of the scum from the secessionist rebellious clique, should realize that al-Bid and his treacherous rebellious gang -- the enemies of the people who declared secession -- are playing an agent role and do not care about the consequences. Their imaginary state, which they have proclaimed, is not set up on land or based on legitimacy. This state has no supporters or position from which it can defend its presence. Thus, the proclamation of a secessionist state is only an illusion. The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy and the Yemeni people know how to react to this madness that prompted the forces of mutiny and treason to announce the secession statement of hallucination, which exposed the nature of the gang of apostasy and secession and revealed their hostile objectives against the Yemeni people and their unity. As we speak today about the ugliest creatures -- whom our people have known and who lived among our people, humiliated them, seized the liberties of their sons, desecrated their sanctities, and tampered with their potentials and resources -- we urge the sons of beloved Aden, who are suffering from the injustice of the stupid followers of the traitors 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his deviant clique, to wake up. This clique has no concern for the fate of the misled people. If the deviant al-Bid was able to escape from Aden, leaving the misled ones for their dark destiny -- if they continue to follow the orders of his clique -- he, and his men, will not escape punishment. The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy will chase him as well as his clique, which escaped with him to the Hadhramaut Governorate, whose people have suffered from the humiliation and injustice at the hands of the gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. The sons of Hadhramaut will never forget the killing of the ulema and the prominent figures in [word indistinct]. Neither will they forget those who were buried alive because they differed with the YSP. The sons of Hadhramaut will stand, in words and deeds, at the side of the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy. They know full well that these forces seek the wellbeing of the homeland and its people and the purging of the Yemeni homeland from the filth of the apostasy and secession gang which has become the bitterest enemy of the Yemeni people, their unity, gains, and national achievements. This gang will certainly have its inevitable punishment, and nothing will obstruct the will of God and the patient Yemeni people.
