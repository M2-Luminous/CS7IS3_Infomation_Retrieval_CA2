He said after his meeting with the foreign minister today that they also discussed the Palestinian demands to resolve the crisis, both a UN Security Council resolution and measures that the Israeli Government needs to take to prevent the recurrence of the massacre. He said the two sides also discussed cooperation between Egypt and the PLO to achieve the best results. On the possibility of a summit meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, 'Abbas said such a meeting is out of the question before certain measures have been taken: the issuance of a Security Council resolution and adoption of specific Israeli positions to handle the crisis resulting from the massacre. On the Palestinian proposals presented to Rabin, 'Abbas said the PLO has not yet received an Israeli reply. He said the PLO presented specific and known proposals that can be summed up by the following questions: How can the Palestinian people be protected and how can another Hebron massacre be prevented? We have not yet received a reply from the Israeli Government, he said. What is needed, 'Abbas asserted, is UN-recognized international observers to protect the Palestinians.
