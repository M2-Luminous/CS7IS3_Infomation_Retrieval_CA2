The report, drafted by Eytan Palner, will be published next week. According to Betzelem, from the beginning of the intifadah until the Hebron massacre, there were 62 incidents of Palestinian deaths caused by settlers in the territories. The report provides the following breakdown: 15 cases in 1988; 17 in 1989; nine in 1990; six in 1991; 1 in 1992; and 14 in 1993. During the same period, 13 settlers trials have been completed. Only one ended with the settler being convicted of murder, and this case is currently being appealed to the Supreme Court. In the other trials, the courts ruled causing death by negligence (6), manslaughter (1), or rioting (1), issued a sentence of admission to a psychiatric hospital (one person charged with two killings), and two settlers were acquitted. It is worth noting that in his testimony before the commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre yesterday, Central Command Commander Dani Yatom said that, as far as he can recall, there were one or two incidents in which settlers killed Palestinians over the past several years, and only one case was brought to trial.
