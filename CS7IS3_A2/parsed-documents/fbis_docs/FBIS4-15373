[Question] Proceeding from the results of the 27 March voting, please try to forecast the results of the second round of the Supreme Council elections. What steps will you take if less than 126 people's deputies are elected; what will you do if the number will range between 126 and 300; and, the third variant -- if more than 300 people's deputies are elected? [Kravchuk] These are first elections in Ukraine as an independent state. That is why one cannot expect the highest level of democracy from them. No serious conflicts took place during the elections. There were isolated cases of unethical conduct. There were no conflicts involving rallies or strikes. I would like one variant -- that a Supreme Council be elected and that the new Supreme Council do the following: First, adopt constitutional laws without which it is no longer possible to live, namely, on local power structures, the range of their jurisdiction, and the law on the President in accordance with Ukraine's Constitution. If these two laws are adopted, the [presidential] elections will be held on 26 June. [Question] Who, in your opinion, can postpone the presidential elections: the new Supreme Council or, under certain circumstances, this can be done by the president? [Kravchuk] It would be best if the new Supreme Council does this, because it would be a legitimate step.... However, in order for it to do this, it must be elected -- it is the most important problem. [Question] In the opinion of experts, Belarus has embarked upon a road that may become the beginning of the renewal of the Union. How can this influence Ukraine's position with regard to the CIS? [Kravchuk] Let us start with two important theses. First, the Soviet Union will never be reestablished. The second thesis lies in the fact that the CIS was not created as a Union and it is impossible to transform the CIS into the Union on the basis of those formative documents that were adopted by us.... It took the members of the European Union 35 years to create it, whereas we expect to do this by a single decision. It cannot be done by a decision. If there are no preconditions, no mechanisms will function. In my opinion, we must use the potential of the CIS and the potential of relations between states. Decisions on next steps must be adopted after asking the advice of the people and of the parliaments. [Question] What is your attitude toward the statement by Ukraine's people's deputy Leonid Kuchma to the effect that people with "clean hands" must make Ukraine's new policy? [Kravchuk] I read that statement. The former prime minister, who is presently president of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, made his analysis proceeding from the facts of real life. However, for me, there arises one moral problem, more specifically, the answer to the question of who has led to this. The person who was also in the government and who put in effort to create the present situation is trying to shift the blame onto the government, the president, and other executive structures. When Leonid Danylovych was "in power," the prices jumped tenfold and the correlation between the fund of consumption and the fund of accumulation was distorted. The worst cataclysms and strikes occurred precisely at that time. If you take the decrees adopted by the Kuchma government, those decrees have overturned everything. Today, I am signing guarantees for foreign firms that want, for example, to built the [oil] terminal. After those decrees, they no longer trust our laws. It is the most terrible thing to lose the trust of investors.... In one of his recent statements, Leonid Kuchma stated as a goal the need to remove Kravchuk's "power party" from the leadership. When Vyacheslav Chornovil says such things, I can understand it (even though he also belonged to the "power party" when he headed the Lvov Oblast Council). However, for Leonid Kuchma, the "power party" was the "cradle." The "Pivdenmash" Production Association is the state within a state. Such a status made it possible to have everything that could be had: Kuchma was a member of the Communist Party Central Committee, a deputy, a director, and secretary of the Party Committee. Even now, Kuchma belongs to the "power party," because he heads the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Does he have a moral right to call for the removal of the "power party?" It is not for nothing that people ask: "And pray who are the judges?" [quotation from Griboyedov's play] When Kuchma decided to quit the post of prime minister, we said that relations between us must remain normal. All of a sudden, Leonid Kuchma seems to have forgotten what he was saying to me. I did not see such cases anywhere in the world when a person who has left his post raises so much ado.... I have expressed my point of view, I kept silence [before], but I have said it now. If need be, I will say it again. [UNIAN] Commenting upon the statement at the electoral station by the Supreme Council chairman Ivan Plyushch to the effect that only those people who are not sure of their strength are afraid to go to elections, Leonid Kravchuk said: [Kravchuk] You will not succeed in causing me to fall out with Ivan Stepanovych [Plyushch]. He and I have shared and continue to share the same point of view on constitutional processes. When the Supreme Council is elected, it must adopt constitutional laws on local power structures and on the president....
