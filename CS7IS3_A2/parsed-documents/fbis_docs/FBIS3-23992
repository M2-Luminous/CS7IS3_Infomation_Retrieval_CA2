The situation will be unfavorable if cooperatives of gold miners do not receive traditional interest-free advances in preparation for a new season. The fact is that a large share of gold in Russia -- up to 60-65 percent of the total -- is obtained in the third quarter, and the first half of the year is spent on preparation for the season, i.e., the provision of equipment, fuel and food, the stripping of deposits and the mining of ore and underground sands, which requires money that was formerly paid to gold miners in the form of interest-free advances. Now the state proposes to advance these funds, which amount to half of the cost of gold mined in Russia -- more than 600 billion rubles -- at an annual interest of 120 percent. This variant, however, will, in the opinion of Viktor Tarakanovsky, head of the Council of the Union of Gold Miners' Cooperatives, make gold mining profitless even if the price of gold increases. Miners themselves predict that the price of one gram of gold may rise from the present 17,400 rubles to 41,000-42,000 rubles by the end of the year. The price of gold in Russia is fixed every month on the basis of world prices recalculated into rubles at the Central Bank's current exchange rate. Gold miners take advances for eight months, till the end of the third quarter, and are thus obliged to repay by this time the 300 billion rubles of advance and almost as much interest. Taken together this will amount to about 21 percent of the cost of the gold mined by them. Taking into account 30 percent of expenses and the total taxes levied at 55 percent, the expenditure on gold mining will exceed its cost. In order to resolve the problem gold miners propose to return to interest-free advances pointing out that it is in fact not a credit but a prepayment for the precious metal. The Union of Gold Miners' Cooperatives guarantees that advances will be issued only to enterprises which really mine gold. These guarantees are all the more necessary since, according to some estimates, during the last two years advances for mining of about six tonnes of gold were given to organizations which did not intend to mine it. During the year they "turned over" the money as they saw fit, then apologized for the absence of gold and returned the advance, pocketing, naturally, all the profit from it. Now the state, unwilling to issue free credits right and left, rejects altogether the system of interest-free advances. In the second half of January Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin instructed the Ministry of Finance to work out a new mechanism of financing gold production. The time limit of the instruction ended on February 1, and it was officially proposed to miners to borrow advances at 120 percent annual interest. At the same time it was hinted to slow-witted miners that anyone in their position would elementarily take advantage on the difference of this rate and that of commercial banks which is now at least 100-120 percent higher. But Viktor Tarakanovsky believes that miners would not be able, even if they wanted to, to "turn over" the money received since the preparation for the season should begin practically immediately. It should be pointed out that, should miners have agreed to such terms at the end of the last year when the time of the issue of advances came, they might possibly have greater freedom of manoeuvre now. It should be taken into account, however, that during the preparation for the season the world price of gold offers no advantages since miners are forced to buy many materials at prices much higher than world ones; in particular, the price of fuel for them in some regions reaches 800,000 rubles a tonne, which is almost four times above the world level. Gold miners' cooperatives pinned some hopes on the president's December decree on the liberalization of the gold market, which provided for the setting up of a "gold exchange" and the granting to some commercial banks of the right to conduct operations with gold. In this case gold-mining enterprises could agree with a concrete bank on mutually advantageous terms of cooperation. But the numerous delays in the implementation of the decree, of which not only miners complain, suggest the conclusion that the actual issue of licences to banks and operations at the gold exchange cannot start for several more months. Nor will miners be able to benefit by the growth in the domestic price of gold when it will be determined at the exchange. Although the domestic price may prove considerably higher, according to some estimates -- by 1.2-1.3 times -- than the world price (since the demand for gold as a means of preserving capital will probably be very high) any organization interested in obtaining gold can, if it makes proper efforts, buy it abroad. Several major state gold-mining associations, first of all the Yakut and Magadan ones (which account for about half of all mined gold), already demand that the price of gold should be raised to 60,000 rubles a gram. In these conditions the exchange price of gold will be altogether unpredictable, especially at the beginning. The Union of Gold Miners' Cooperatives does not consider such conditions acceptable but, since it is not a rigid structure, cooperatives themselves and their associations in regions may in some cases agree to such conditions (they will most probably be joined by state enterprises), especially since some cooperative leaders stated already at the end of last year their intention to maintain the volume of output even if the state takes the most rigid position in relation to them. But the problem of credits remains all the same, since they can be taken, if gold miners refuse to do so, by other commercial structures which are least of all concerned about the mining of gold. Perhaps the only thing left to count on is a repetition of late 1992 and the beginning of 1993 when practically everyone also spoke about unbearable conditions and the inevitable reduction of gold mining in 1993 as a result gold production remained at the 1992 level, just exceeding 140 tonnes.
