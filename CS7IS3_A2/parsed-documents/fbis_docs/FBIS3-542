Ngonhamo has accused the government of not making available necessary funds for the formation of the various components of the new army, which will consist of government and Renamo soldiers. [Begin Ngonhamo recording] We should not forget this program is facing serious financial problems. I am concerned by the government's slowness in dealing with our financial difficulties. We are tired of this slowness. It leads us to believe that there are people who do not want the new army to operate before elections are held in the country. If this situation persists, it will seriously affect the formation process, hindering the deployment of the army units in strategic areas. If the difficulties persist, it will not be possible to form the new army before the elections. It seems that the government has been alleging shortages of funds to deal with these issues, but the truth is that in this way it will not be possible to form the new army before the elections, as stipulated in the accord. We have two armies in Mozambique, and all their expenses would be included in the budget to be allocated to the Mozambique Armed Forces. We are facing serious financial problems, which include the instructors in Dondo District. How will it be when we have 2,500 infantry troops and other groups, such as the ones training in Nacala and Catembe in Maputo? What will happen? This situation will create a problem that only the government will be blamed for later on. We held a three-hour meeting in Dondo recently to find the solution to these issues, but the government seems to be allergic when it concerns money. No one wants to assume the responsibility. Everyone is pointing fingers at the others, and important and urgent decisions are not being made. Since the country is structured and has a government, we appeal to his excellency, President Joaquim Alberto Chissano, Mozambican head of state, to intervene so that the funds for the training program are released. We also appeal to all leaders of political parties to assist us, not financially, but in discussions with the government. If the agreement is not fulfilled, elections in the country will be seriously affected. [end recording]
