"I personally know nothing. Neither me, nor (SNS Honorary Chairman Jozef) Prokes, nobody," Andel said. The World Slavonic Congress was initiated by the leader of Russia's extreme nationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, as continuation of his party's congress held yesterday. Andel, deputy premier under the former government of Vladimir Meciar, said that he knew from official sources that a sole person from Slovakia attending Zhirinovskiy's party congress was Jozef Lauko. But he is there as a private person, Andel added. Andel said there was no need to be hunting for any sensations, even though "a sensation may be produced, but certainly not of this kind," he added without elaborating. Molnar, along with other foreign guests, was today sitting in the presidium of the World Slavonic Congress at which Zhirinovskiy proposed the creation of an "Eastern European Community of Slavonic Nations" spreading "from the Adriatic Sea to the Kurile Islands."
