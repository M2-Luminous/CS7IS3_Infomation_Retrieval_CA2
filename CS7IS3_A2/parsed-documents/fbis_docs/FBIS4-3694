The arrival of Premier Li Peng has further deepened and harmonized the friendship between the two peoples living on both sides of Tian Shan. "Love begins with the first meeting." President Akayev warmly used this Kyrgyz proverb to describe how Kyrgyzstan is developing its relations with China. Following talks with Premier Li Peng, he told us: "My understanding of China began with my visit to China in 1992. Premier Li Peng's current visit to Kyrgyzstan serves to make him understand Kyrgyzstan better and to complete the stage of mutual understanding. The time for carrying out very effective cooperation has finally arrived." Akayev made a general summary in the following terms of the development of relations between Kyrgyzstan and China since the two countries established diplomatic relations: "We have solved the three most important issues over the last two years. First, we have enhanced our neighborly and friendly relations. Second, we have laid a legal foundation for cooperation. Third, we have begun consultations on international and regional affairs." Kyrgyz leaders consider Premier Li Peng the "brother and friend" of the Kyrgyz people and they expressed deep emotion toward the honorable Chinese guest and toward the Chinese people. At many occasions, be it at the airport, at the elegant state guesthouse, and at the lively banquet, President Akayev and Premier Li Peng talked freely about friendship, exchanged views, and explored ways of cooperation. The scheduled one-hour official talks continued, as the passage of time was not noticed, for two and a half hours in a sincere and friendly atmosphere. At the ceremony for signing six important documents, the two leaders wore smiles of contentment. Strengthening economic and trade cooperation was one of Premier Li Peng's important intentions during the visit to Kyrgyzstan. He carried out with Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov an in-depth exchange of views on some major cooperation projects in a pragmatic atmosphere. No sooner had the Chinese entrepreneurs who accompanied Premier Li Peng's visit arrived in Bishkek than they got in contact with and held talks with their Kyrgyz counterparts. The two countries' businessmen signed letters of intent for cooperation in engineering projects and gold mining, as well as in other areas of mutual interest. As a matter of fact, Sino-Kyrgyz cooperation has already borne satisfactory fruits in some sectors. At the hotel where we stayed, we had the luck of enjoying Chinese-style noodles. The restaurant's manageress told us that the instant noodles produced by "Ketelapu," a Sino-Kyrgyz joint venture, are much loved by the Kyrgyz people and can be enjoyed at all local restaurants. President Akayev had also recently mentioned this noodle factory, which is a model for joint ventures, to Chinese reporters. Its fine dried noodles and instant noodles have not only met the demands of the Kyrgyz market but have also been exported to other countries, including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Therefore, the Kyrgyz Government awarded the state's highest honor certificate to Liang Chuansen, the former manager of this plant who had worked so hard to set up the plant. "Expanding and deepening the cooperation between the two countries are quite necessary and will benefit the two countries." This remark by Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov speaks volumes about the wish shared by the business circles of the two countries. Kyrgyzstan's radio station began its morning broadcast amid melodious music. The first news report was Premier Li Peng's goodwill visit to this mountainous country. The first video news report carried by the state television station's evening news program was the lively scene of Premier Li Peng's visit. Local media evaluated Premier Li Peng's visit highly. To cite just a few of them: "Premier Li Peng's visit to Kyrgyzstan is a major event of historical significance," "His visit will turn a new page in the Kyrgyz-Chinese relationship," "The friendly messenger from a great neighboring country is building a new Silk Road"..... Premier Li Peng's remark that "China is willing to develop equal and mutually beneficial cooperation with countries in Central Asia" was broadcast over the radiowaves to hundreds and thousands of households. Information officials at the Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry told us that in the last several days, newspapers and radio and television stations in Kyrgyzstan have carried extensive report on China and have praised China's recent construction achievements. In Tashkent, Premier Li Peng delivered a speech in which he declared in a firm and friendly manner that China will always be a "good friend and good neighbor" of the peoples of Central Asia. This has further left a deep impression in the minds of the people. Under the bright sunshine, the rolling Tian Shan looks great and magnificent. Today, thanks to the efforts of the Chinese and Kyrgyz leaders, the mountain chain linking the territories of the two countries is becoming a strong link of friendship and cooperation between the two peoples.
