Over 100,000 people -- 10 percent of those for whom Russian is their first language -- have left since the collapse of the Union,. "I still consider the main aim and the main thrust of my policy to be the quest for and the strengthening of interethnic accord; and we must do everything within our power -- the possible and the impossible alike -- to halt the migration process," A. Akayev declared. As he noted, teaching given in the Russian language in schools and higher educational establishments has been maintained in full in Kyrgyzstan, as has the training of teachers specializing in Russian. Moreover, a Russian Slavic University, where students from other Central Asian republics can study, was opened here recently -- the first and as yet the only one of its kind in the CIS. It is equally important, however, to solve the socioeconomic problems of Russians working at industrial enterprises, too. As A. Akayev announced, during his visit to Moscow he presented an entire package of agreements to B. Yeltsin, thanks to which the usual provision of plants and factories with orders from Russia would be maintained. And if there is work, there will be a comfortable standard of living for families. According to A. Akayev, these proposals "met with complete mutual understanding and support on the part of the Russian Federation president." But nevertheless, joint efforts by all Commonwealth countries are required in order to regulate migration processes, A. Akayev stressed. Kyrgyzstan submitted a draft multilateral agreement on protecting the rights and interests of national minorities back in 1991. But, alas, after it was amended, all that remained of it were empty declarations. In A. Akayev's view, it is worth returning to the draft of this document at the next meeting of CIS heads of states. Its basic provisions are as follows: First, adequate representation of national minorities in the state administration system; second, refusal to countenance discrimination against persons who do not speak the national languages of the new independent states; and, finally, a solution to the problem of dual citizenship.
