FR940707-2-00182 FR940707-2-00098 II. Description The NASD is proposing to adopt an Interpretation to its Rules of Fair Practice that would prohibit member firms that hold their own customer limit orders from trading ahead of those orders, regardless of whether the practice has been disclosed, and would make trading in disregard of the prohibition a violation of just and equitable principles of trade. The Interpretation establishes that a member holding its customers' limit order may not continue to trade for its own position without executing that limit order under the specific terms and conditions that the customer understands and accepts. If the member does trade ahead of its customer, it will be deemed a violation of Article III, Section 1 of the Rules of Fair Practice regarding just and equitable principles of trade. 8 8 The Interpretation does not distinguish between the limit order protection provided retail and institutional customers. The Interpretation also states that a member that ``controls or is controlled by'' 9 another member will be considered affiliated in a single entity for purposes of determining the application of the rule. Thus, if a member firm accepts a customer's limit order and forwards that limit order for execution to a market making unit that it controls, the firms will be considered affiliated and the prohibition against trading ahead of the customer's limit order will apply to the firm as a whole. 9 Amendment No. 1 to File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;58. See Letter from T. Grant Callery, Vice President and General Counsel, to Mark Barracca, Branch Chief, Division, Commission (June 14, 1994). The Interpretation will not apply to limit orders accepted by market makers from unaffiliated members. For example, a firm's customer limit orders that are sent to an unrelated market making firm for execution would not be covered by the Interpretation. The NASD has decided to defer temporarily application of the Interpretation to these trades so that a task force may complete its examination of the potential consequences of a broader application of the rule. The Interpretation emphasizes that all members accepting customer limit orders owe those customers duties of ``best execution'' regardless of whether the orders are executed through the member's market making capacity or sent to another member for execution. 10 10 The best execution Interpretation requires members to use reasonable diligence to ascertain the best inter-dealer market for the security and buy or sell in such a market so that the price to the customer is as favorable as possible under prevailing market conditions. NASD Rules of Fair Practice, Art. III, Section 1, NASD Manual (CCH) Â¶2151.03 III. Summary of Comments As noted above, the Commission received two comment letters on the proposal. 11 Merrill Lynch, a registered broker dealer, supports the proposal, noting that it will increase investor confidence in the NASDAQ market by improving the quality of executions they receive. The other commenter, STANY, supports the principle that the limit order of a commission-paying customer is entitled to priority over the order of the customer's broker-dealer. Both Merrill Lynch and STANY believe that the proposed interpretation should not apply to member-to-member transactions. Merrill Lynch believes that requiring leaders to provide limit order protection to other broker-dealers might have a serious deleterious effect on dealers' willingness and ability to make markets in these stocks. STANY offers three reasons why dealers that receive the limit orders of other firms' customers should not be subject to the restriction: (1) Agency dealers could be acting for their own customers, for themselves or for other dealers, thereby creating the possibility that some dealers could make markets within the spread without a capital commitment; (2) it would force a dealer to assume a fiduciary responsibility to customers of another firm with whom the dealer has no preexisting relationship; and (3) it may require dealers to execute certain limit orders at prices which do not provide an opportunity for any profit. 11 Letter from Frank Masi, President, Security Traders Association of New York (``STANY''), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission (March 29, 1994). Letter from Hugh Quigley, Managing Director, Merrill Lynch. Pierce, Fenner & Smith (``Merrill Lynch'') to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission (April 20, 1994). IV. Discussion The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9) and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling and processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect he mechanism of a free and open market and a national market systems and in general to protect investors and the public interest. Section 15A(b)(9) requires that the rules of the association not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1)(C) (i) and (iv) set forth the objectives of assuring economically efficient execution of securities transactions and the practicability of brokers executing investors' orders in the best market. 12 12 Although the proposed rule change is adopted pursuant to Section 15A of the Act, the Commission believes the goals of Section 11A are equally served by this proposed rule change. The NASD's proposal seeks to address the practice of NASDAQ market makers trading ahead of their customers' limit orders. That practice, its origins and implications for investors was recently discussed in the Division of Market Regulation's Market 2000 Report. 13 That study concluded that the adverse effects of trading ahead exist whether the customer's limit order is handled by the customer's firm or by another market maker. The study recommended that the NASD revise its proposal to prohibit broker-dealers from trading ahead of all customer limit orders for NASDAQ National Market securities. 13 Division of Market Regulation, SEC, Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developemnts V&hyph;5 (1993).
