Analysis of their results is a task for the future, but one thing is clear now -- we got something we did not expect, he said. There was a definite negative attitude among voters to the elections, in Sobchak's opinion. As a result, the elections were recognized in only 25 out of 50 constituencies and even in these no candidate got the required 50 percent of votes. Therefore, in accordance with the law, there will be a second round of voting in these constituencies on 3 April in which the candidates who got the most votes will take part, the mayor said. Elections will be held in the other constituencies in the fall, when structures of public self government will be set up. For the transition period it is planned to set up a public council of elected deputies and of representatives of political parties and blocs under the mayor's office, Sobchak said. This is necessary to ensure that, while there is still no assembly, the public may take part in examining all important issues in the city. This is a forced measure, Sobchak noted, but, as the saying goes, it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good. This will allow time to test the deputies to see what they are capable of and then, perhaps in the fall, the citizens will make the right choice. Sobchak said it was a very dangerous situation when people were being disappointed by democratic forms of state affairs. The very fact of the elections that had taken place, he pointed out, forces one to think seriously about the reasons for the passivity of St. Petersburg's citizens. This is an abnormal situation, the mayor said, and it confirms how deeply resented the previous members of the city council were, whose deputies were competing with one another to see who would cancel the most decisions by the mayor, and effectively failed to tackle the city's problems. In Sobchak's opinion, the reasons are also that the present candidates did not have their own individuality, they were unable to convince the electors, and the latter naturally refused to give them their confidence. The mayor believes the negative result is also a reflection of the elections to the State Duma, but in the present situation the city cannot be left without its own legislative assembly. Therefore, Sobchak again appealed to the citizens to assume responsibility and carry out their civic duty in the second round of voting.
