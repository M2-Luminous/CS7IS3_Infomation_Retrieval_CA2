The move has been prompted by an increase in the press group personnel and, therefore, the need to improve their working conditions. The specific location of the center's new office has not been disclosed yet, but it is known that its staffers will have spacious rooms and a separate entrance, something that will ease access to the bulwark of counterintelligence for journalists and other interested citizens. To whom it may concern: the center's telephone numbers will not change.
