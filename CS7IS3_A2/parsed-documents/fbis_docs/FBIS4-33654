Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli said that Venezuela will not be a party--under any circumstances--to any armed action in Haiti to oust the military regime. Burelli reaffirmed Venezuela's willingness to cooperate in solving the Haitian crisis, mentioning both nations' historical ties. The Haitian crisis was one of the subjects discussed during the foreign ministers' meeting held on Monday, taking advantage of the OAS meeting in Belem de Para (Brazil). The Venezuelan foreign minister said that Venezuela is one of the nations that has made great efforts seeking a solution to the Haitian problem and for the restoration of ousted Constitutional President Jean Bertrand Aristide. Venezuela, the United States, France, and Canada are part of the so-called "Group of Friends" that have sought alternatives for the political crisis Haiti has experienced since Aristide left power. Burelli also indicated that Venezuela will only accept a small group of Haitian refugees, after the Venezuelan Embassy in the United States has certified their qualifications to be received by the nation. The Venezuelan foreign minister indicated that it was necessary "to definitely clear up speculation," which has arisen on Venezuela's decision to accept Haitian refugees. Burelli referred to the letter sent by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in which he requests Venezuela's cooperation to receive Haitian refugees. Nevertheless, the Venezuelan reply to Christopher sums up that "under current circumstances it has a flow of uninvited immigrants," who have made even more difficult the conditions "increasing poverty and aggravating the social order problem," Burelli indicated. "We would accept a group qualified and certified by our embassy in Washington," he added. Burelli also denied some statements published by several local papers indicating Venezuela was ready to receive several hundreds of Haitian refugees. He admitted, however, that if Haitian refugees do arrive, their stay permanence will "only be temporary," dependent on the solution of problems in Haiti. The minister finally ruled out the possibility of Venezuela becoming a Haitian refugee camp.
