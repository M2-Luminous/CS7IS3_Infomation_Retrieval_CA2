FR940513-0-00049 FR940513-0-00012 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;20] Alteration of Jet Route J&hyph;171; Colorado AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; delay of effective date. SUMMARY: On January 12, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule altering Jet Route J&hyph;171 from Tobe, CO, to Hugo, CO. This action accommodated the new Denver International Airport airspace reconfiguration. In view of the delay in the opening date of the new Denver International Airport, this action delays the rule's effective date indefinitely. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective May 13, 1994, the effective date of the Final Rule at 59 FR 1619, and as postponed at 59 FR 10744 (March 8, 1994), is delayed indefinitely. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Norman W. Thomas, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9230. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 12, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule altering Jet Route J&hyph;171 from Tobe, CO, to Hugo, CO, to accommodate the new Denver International Airport airspace reconfiguration. Most recently, the FAA had delayed this rule until May 15, 1994. The official opening of the Denver International Airport has been delayed indefinitely due to the automatic baggage system difficulties. Accordingly, the effective date of this jet route alteration should be delayed indefinitely. Once the opening date of the new airport is determined, the FAA will publish another rule indicating the effective date of this rule. Because the public needs to be made aware of this delay immediately, notice and public procedure are impracticable and good cause exists for making this action effective in less than 30 days. In consideration of the foregoing, effective May 13, 1994, the effective date of the final rule altering the Jet Route J&hyph;171, (59 FR 1619; January 12, 1994) as delayed at 59 FR 10744 (March 8, 1994), is delayed indefinitely. Issued in Washington, DC, on May 10, 1994. Harold W. Becker, Manager, Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division.
