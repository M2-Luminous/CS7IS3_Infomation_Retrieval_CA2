People say that there has been a sharp disagreement between the NDP's [National Democratic Party] group of 26 and the region's governor, Major General Samih al-Sa'id, in a scenario that repeated the crisis of the current interior minister, Major General Hasan al-Alfi, with the same group before he took over the ministry last April. People are also talking about how the Asyut police now have a list of the most notorious families involved in supporting terrorism, especially the Abu-Sayf family of al-Qusiyah and the Abu-'Aqrab family of Abu Tij. Secret reports now call for disarming these families of their licensed and unlicensed weapons. Implementation actually began in al-Qusiyah among the members of the Abu-Sayf family. On the basis of unnamed sources, people hint that the NDP still has failed to confront terrorism, despite its village grass roots organizations known as committees of 20. Some people react to these with ridicule; others ignore them, regardless of the stress that the party's secretary, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Muhsin, places on them. People in Asyut talk of these and many other things as they sit at the Majestic Cafe across from the station. What is not talked about there or at the Lu'lu'ah Cafe is anything related to the terrorist groups--their number, their spread, their various weapons, their recent entry into the university and enlistment of a number of its students, and the explosion in Bank Square and the Badr Tourist Hotel during the last week of Ramadan. Here in Asyut the fire is not only under the ashes; it is on top of them and around them, as shown by the mounted patrols, the nighttime and daytime ambushes deployed everywhere, and the search and investigate operations that allow no one to pass without an identity card to serve as a permit. Everyone is subject to suspicion until someone higher up intervenes to release him. No sooner did suspicious cases begin to increase in the city of Asyut, neighboring villages, and the 11 district centers, than NDP members began to intervene in every village and hamlet to free suspects. They had two motives. First, most suspects were from these families, related to these families, or had rallied under their banner. Second, primary elections for the People's Assembly were close; and these measures, though largely successful in preventing terrorists from entering populous cities and in keeping them and their activities on the outskirts, would have a negative effect on the popularity of each member in his constituency if he were unable to have his constituents released from police hands immediately. This was how the split developed between many district police officers in the villages and NDP members from the People's Assembly, the Consultative Council, and the local council. It was not unusual to find a member of the People's Assembly sitting with his family to have suspects released and brought back to the villages they had left. Some of them approached Governor Samih al-Sa'id, asking him to soften these measures, especially as the security chief was also busy with his security plans on which he would make not the slightest concession, given last month's rise in terrorist operations. These included the recent Sidfa incident and the attack on a police car, with the response that killed six terrorists. The governor told us that the measure was necessary to tighten control and that he was fully satisfied with it and in agreement with the security chief on the matter. The measure had led to positive results that Asyut citizens now could see in the streets. The Interior Ministry in Cairo knew about it and had not objected. The other cause of the split was that the governor was widely reported to have accused NDP members publicly at several meetings--despite his good relations with them at funerals, weddings, and so forth--of being passive and not having done anything against terrorism. Both Siraj Abu-Sayf, the People's Assembly member from al-Qusiyah, and Muhammad Ahmad Husayn from Asyut stated this. The two are on opposite sides, but both agree that the governor is accusing the members of being passive: "We ought to have grabbed a machine gun and run after the terrorists who are challenging the police! Are we stronger, or are the police, with all their weapons and equipment? Our role is to educate and help; entering a war with terrorism is another responsibility." Perhaps it was the governor's most recent accusation--for his part, he has utterly denied it, claiming it was a mere difference of opinion, nothing to spoil friendship, and that they were united against terrorism--that opened wide the door to the rumor of a split between the governor and the NDP's so-called group of 26. Furthermore, the governor proclaimed this accusation in a public meeting with members during the 'Id al-Fitr vacation. All of them reacted badly, particularly since the governor repeated the charges in his private meetings. He even accused Siraj Abu-Sayf of passivity, greatly incensing Abu-Sayf, who is now talking to officials in Cairo to discuss the matter and settle the disagreement. He asks everyone he meets, "What shall I do? Am I to fight terrorism with my own hands?" All the NDP members say they are working against terrorism. According to Mahmud Abu-'Aqrab, the NDP's youth secretary in Abu Tij, the party's 20-member base committees are touring villages, alerting the people, and asking them to cooperate. "But not all our services to security or to the public are announced in the newspapers, lest they become a target for terrorism." The governor told AL-MUSAWWAR in a recorded interview that they are trying to portray the situation between him and the People's Assembly members as a repeat scenario of the previous crisis of Major General Hasan al-Alfi. "However, there is absolutely no disagreement. The charges have absolutely no truth. I deny it in the press and to everyone. We are in complete agreement." Denial of the Denial The sole fact in the case is that security chief Majdi al-Basyuni issued an order for 'Abd-al-Ma'bud Khalifah Abu-Sayf, Rushdi Khalifah, Hisham Salih, and Khalid Mursi Salih to surrender their weapons as soon as they received the notification. They were given 10 days, which ended last Sunday--the time these lines were written. According to our information, the first has a semi-automatic German pistol. The second has a German pistol and rifle. The last has a German pistol. The third has a pistol. Rushdi turned in his gun, but the three others are awaiting the results of efforts by family head Siraj Abu-Sayf with officials in Cairo, particularly as all these guns are licensed and details about them are known to the Interior Ministry and State Security offices in Asyut. Perhaps this was the beginning of a campaign to collect guns from families in Asyut. Major General 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Hilali had already collected 60 guns from the Abu-'Aqrab family in a single campaign. Strangely, the weapons were returned to the family after al-Hilali was removed and transferred on orders from Cairo. No one answered our question about why these two families in particular. However, there is information that the dangerous extremist Murtada Muhammad Khalifah Abu-Sayf comes from the Abu-Sayf family. He was on the list of suspects in the events of 1981. From the second family comes the leader of the military wing in Abu Tij, 'Abd-al-Hamid Abu-'Aqrab, who assassinated Major General al-Shimi in one of the most serious terrorist incidents ever to occur in Asyut. The former has fled to Saudi Arabia; the second is still in the center of Asyut. Siraj Abu-Sayf told AL-MUSAWWAR: "We expelled this terrorist long ago. Everyone knows that he has lived outside the country for more than six years. Are they holding the Abu-Sayf family, which has lost two members as victims to terrorist incidents, accountable for a man outside Egypt who has not been proved guilty of the recent actions? The opposition is the cause of all this. The governor listens to them and keeps repeating after them that Siraj Abu-Sayf is uncooperative. I am more cooperative than any person in Asyut. If police officers, men, and detectives now are afraid of terrorism, are we to stand against it? My area is completely secure. It is they who are doing this--first of all the governor. I won't keep quiet about it. I will turn the world upside down. Instead of honoring us, they came to take our guns. So how are we to fight terrorism and ward off those guys?" He continued: "What's strange is that the MP's [members of Parliament] are afraid to talk lest people say, `Are you going to cause trouble with every governor?' Fine, and what the opposition keeps saying, about there being a repaying of old accounts with Minister al-Alfi--how are we to reply to it? I am in Cairo. The MP's telephoned me from Asyut and said, `We are with you all the way.' I am going to talk to all the officials until the problem is resolved and the weapons come back to our home. What happened was unreasonable." Mahmud Abu-'Aqrab, the spokesman for the family that is the other party to the case, told us: "We turned in more than six extremists, including the emir of Abu Tij itself. What more can we do? Al-Hilali charged us with concealing 'Abd-al-Hamid Abu-'Aqrab. He knows we were the first people who became targets of his group. It got so bad that I was shot at in the town. We politicians can do nothing but talk, educate, and move the masses. If you tell me to pick up a gun and fight terrorism, then you are advocating civil war in Asyut. Furthermore, 'Abd-al-Hamid was on the streets, not hiding in his home. All the terrorists are known by name--yet who has taken them? If I picked up a rifle, I'd be a terrorist! "Accusing us of terrorism is shameful. We are sacrificing ourselves for the country. Everyone is doing it. Shall I or my family agree to sacrifice our entire history because of one fellow who is an extremist? As for the matter of the 60 guns, they were all licensed. They cost one-half million pounds. Ninety percent of us are farmers. How can we guard our farms and livestock? The rifles are for guarding, not terrorism. They can't be smuggled out for terrorism." Witness for the Prosecution Muhammad Ahmad Husayn is a People's Assembly member for Asyut. People classify him as being by himself, apart from the 26. If the latter choose the right, he chooses the left without a thought. He strongly rejected moving through the NDP when they contacted him to begin moving at the village level--the ones that the governor indicated in his noisy meeting on the second day of the holiday, or, as people call it, "the problem meeting." Husayn's argument is that such moves serve no purpose or goal, especially if they come from executives and if executives or even popular figures prepare them. Before any such moves, the NDP must be cleaned up. "I said in the most recent meeting that the NDP first must be cleansed from inside from drug traffickers and previous offenders. Corrupt people are not going to fight terrorism. I told the governor to clean up the party." The governor told AL-MUSAWWAR that he was responsible for NDP members and that the party secretary consulted him about options. As an example of this coordination, he told us how the two together had tried to settle the al-Badari People's Assembly seat on the Murad household in an unopposed election as a kind of honor to the memory of the late Murad Husayn, the holder of the now vacant seat. The governor added that he was completely satisfied with these choices because they were in no way deficient. The matter had been submitted to everyone: anyone who found something wrong should hasten to set it right. The information being handed about is that improper choices have been made in the party and that with some village-level party secretaries no consideration was given to good behavior, ethics, or reputation. One of them in the village of Naj' Sabu' is accused of wiretapping the telephone booth in the village, like another in the village of Rifa, a third in al-Zawiyah, and so on. Is this what Ahmad Husayn has in mind when he speaks about cleaning up the party? Perhaps. We repeat that in Asyut there is no single reality on which people agree. The chasm between the governor and the NDP members is widening--if it is indeed the case that during Samih al-Sa'id's entire year in Asyut, Siraj Abu-Sayf has entered al-Sa'id's office only three times, after which he decided not to enter [again] because the governor was always busy for hours. Similarly, Hamid Hisham from Abnub has threatened never to enter the governor's office during his tenure in Asyut. Jamil Abu-'Aqrab has asked only to be given equal treatment with the journalists who go in and out of the governor's office. In fact, while I was interviewing the governor for AL-MUSAWWAR, I noticed on his desk two envelopes packed with papers from Husam al-Kilani from Dayrut and from another member that the two wanted signed. The governor pointed to the envelopes and said, "These are requests from [parliamentary] deputies. Where are the disagreements about which they are talking?" The same scenario that happened with al-Alfi. This time the members are not speaking openly about it to the press, but they are speaking critically in private sessions. However, when they are confronted with it, they deny it. In sessions with the governor they turn into butter and honey, and it's "All's well; the grass roots committees are working according to your excellency's plan." Nevertheless, the split is apparent. There is no one in all Asyut who cannot see it. The Islamic Group? All this is happening now on the bright side of the picture in Asyut. As for the hidden side--we mean the extremists--according to our exclusive information there are at highest estimate no more than 40 extremists to be found in the 11 districts. Each works in his district without a single link or central planning. In particular, the Islamic Group has have not yet settled the question of their amir after the recent death of Tharwat Hajjaj in Cairo. A virtual struggle is now taking place. On one side is the faction of Rif'at Zaydan 'Abdallah. His police dossier says that he was born on 2 July 1970 on the 'Abd-al-Baqi estate in Dayrut district. He is a student at the Commercial Art Institute. His father was an al-Sharqiyah peasant from the village of Bani Yahya, but they fled the village because of a vendetta, his father and uncle having been accused of killing their cousin, the government-employed night watchman. He is among the 11 dangerous terrorists whom the Interior Ministry publicized after the attempted assassination of Minister Safwat al-Sharif. The other faction--relatively newer--is led by a face completely new on the Asyut scene: Najih Mahmud 'Abd-al-Latif. He is 35 years old and from Tall Zaydan on al-Badari Island. He is thought to be the leader of that area, which is still difficult for the police, given his long experience in military work. He was a major, but was discharged for belonging to the extremist groups. People say that his entry into the terrorist team lies behind the recent upsurge in terrorist actions and that he was primarily responsible for the 23 February attack on al-Badari Island's police detachment, which killed a police car driver, Ahmad Hajjaj, and wounded six other members of the detachment. The attack made off from the island with 12 Kalashnikov rifles, a Carl Gustav machine gun, and eight assorted guns. The case is now under investigation by the al-Badari prosecutor. The rest of the terrorist list includes Salih 'Id 'Abd-al-'Azim Khalil, alias "al-Sadat." He was born in 1971 in the village of Bani Qurrah and holds a vocational secondary diploma. His brother, 'Atif 'Id, 30 years old, holds an agricultural diploma and lives in the same village. Ahmad Sanusi Hilal Jr., 25 years old, holds a bachelor of law degree and is from the village of 'Arab al-Jahmah. He is considered by far the most dangerous. Police believe that he is probably responsible for the Dayr al-Muharraq incident. Mukhtar Husayn Kamil Farajallah is from al-Qusiyah. 'Adil Fawzi 'Abd-al-Sami' is from Bani Qurrah. Sa'd Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahim is an expelled high school student from the village of Mir. Hasan Khalifah 'Uthman is from al-Qusiyah. These ten persons are now moving freely in al-Badari, Sidfa (where operations are being led by Najih 'Abd-al-Latif), and al-Qusiyah (where Ahmad Sanusi is active). Apart from these three districts, we can say that the police are now in control of all areas. However, two new developments on the scene require a change in security plans. First, the Islamic Group recently have begun to summon their members from nearby governorates--from Mallawi in al-Minya, the oases in the New Valley, and Tima in Sawhaj. In the recent train incident the police ascertained that one of the most important suspects was from the village of Salamun in Tima district of Sawhaj governorate. Also, the person who engaged the police on 2 January in the Ibrahim Mosque in the town of Sahil Salim was 'Abd-al-Hamid Muhammad Hasan 'Abd-al-Majid from Mallawi in al-Minya governorate. This somewhat complicates matters now for the police and requires that ambushes be set up on the borders of Asyut, with increased vigilance, especially at night, because the overland linkage of Middle Egypt's governorates makes things difficult. Samih al-Sa'id, the governor of Asyut, has therefore stressed that the governorates of Sawhaj, al-Minya, and Asyut should be proclaimed a single sector in which security plans are jointly implemented to prevent the Islamic Group from moving freely around Asyut. Second, the Islamic Group have again tried to enter the university. Two students were involved in the attempt to bomb Bank Square in the heart of Asyut and in leaving an explosive parcel in front of the Badr Tourist Hotel. Their arrest within 24 hours aborted the two operations, but it did not abort moves by student members of the Islamic Group in the university, who attempted to carry out a strike in support of the two students. The university president, Raja'i al-Tahlawi, responded by expelling four students for inciting the unsuccessful strike. Finally, a number of facts remain to be mentioned: First, all the differences between the governor and the NDP, which certain persons known by name in Asyut are feeding, will benefit only the extremists in the end. Therefore a degree of clarity and frankness is needed between the two sides. Polite visits to funerals and weddings will not be enough to bury the causes of the conflict soon; neither will attempts at denial by all sides. Second, harassing certain families for reasons known to everyone and attempting to drag the police into the problem will completely alienate those families from the ranks confronting terrorism. If these families do not give their support, they will stand neutral; which is extremely dangerous, particularly since the decisions have not paid attention to the principle that equality in wrong is justice. Third, terrorism is limited to the numerical level of the Islamic Group. However, those active on the scene not only have considerable fighting experience, but are good at moving. The entry of persons from al-Minya, Sawhaj, and the New Valley will prolong the battle. It will have to be decisively resolved by security integration at the level of all these governorates--the one-sector policy that the governor of Asyut stressed. Fourth, Asyut University's current policy of forbidding those who are the source [of evil] must continue. The picture must be clarified as soon as any measures are taken, so as to contain any student sympathy with the extremists. The final fact is that in Asyut there is no single reality on which people agree. This is what a thorough reading of this report confirms.
