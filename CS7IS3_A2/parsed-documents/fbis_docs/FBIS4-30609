In a statement released Monday, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Association, said he is worried about the impact on the economy of the dollar's collapse and the political turmoil resulting from Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's resignation. Nagano warned an excessive appreciation of the yen could kill the Japanese manufacturing sector. He called on the government for a speedy stimulation of domestic demand through deregulation and the opening of Japanese markets to imports. The dollar temporarily plummeted to a new post World War II lows of 99.50 yen Monday morning in Tokyo.
