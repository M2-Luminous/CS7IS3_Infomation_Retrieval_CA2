SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announces that, pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the criteria set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(H) to Tulane University of Louisiana under Cooperative Agreement Number DE-FG01&hyph;94EW54102. The subject Cooperative Agreement will be for a two year project period and a total estimated amount of $23,000,000. Under this Cooperative Agreement Tulane will initiate a comprehensive risk evaluation program that will focus on identifying urgent human health risks, including worker safety, that exist at and around the nation's major hazardous and mixed waste facilities and sites; and provide a mechanism for the systematic evaluation of hazards to health and the environment that will facilitate near-term decision-making, consistent with the goals of the nation's environmental cleanup initiative. The Tulane/Xavier Center for Bioenvironmental Research has extensive experience in environmental and occupational health and safety research, which provides the critical foundation for the rapid initiation and completion of an unbiased, comprehensive study that will have a high degree of credibility with all stakeholders. The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(H), that the award of this non-competitive Cooperative Agreement to Tulane University is in the public interest.
