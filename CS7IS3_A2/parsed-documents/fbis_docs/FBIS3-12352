Throngs of citizens have assembled on the highways and roads amid a heavy traffic jam. According to the information announced by the interior minister a short while ago, nine people were killed and a number of others injured in the blast.

Deputy Rushayd al-Khazin has just arrived at the scene. The manifestations of destruction were evident as Minister Mirhij was speaking to reporters.

They will not be able to destroy churches, mosques, or other places of worship in Lebanon. These places are deeply valued in the hearts of our people and in our land. This crime, no matter what its effect, will absolutely not affect our domestic situation or the internal peace that we all want. Our stand and that of our people's are the same: We will secure internal unity, social peace, and stand shoulder to shoulder in one line to defend Lebanon and our democratic system: [Reporter] What is the latest death toll? [Mirhij] A huge explosion occurred in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in occupied Palestine. That crime left dozens dead. There are those who seek to destabilize our society from within. We say that our society is stronger than (?these attempts). [Reporter] [Question indistinct]? [Mirhij] There must be [words indistinct], but this is not the proper time to determine this issue. [Reporter] Mr. Minister, having been briefed by the security agencies on the effects of the explosion, what is the latest death toll? [Mirhij] We are not yet sure of the number of dead, but I believe there are nine dead. [Reporter] [Question indistinct]? [Mirhij] The explosive charge was designed to cause a big massacre, but God's care, [words indistinct] some charges went off but not all. Had all the explosive charges gone off, the result would have been devastating. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] explosive charges? [Mirhij] We have not delved into details. This is the task of the security forces. [end recording] [Shahin] The security forces are conducting investigations inside the church. Reporters have been forbidden to enter the church for security reasons. They will be allowed in later after the initial investigations. Destruction and devastation are evident inside and outside the church. There are no doors or windows. Cars parked nearby have been damaged, along with homes. The church is located in the Zuq Musbih area and there is heavy traffic on the highway. The Internal Security Forces are trying to facilitate traffic.
