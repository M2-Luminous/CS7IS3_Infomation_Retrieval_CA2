Association of Austria, here this afternoon. Waldheim, also former federal president of Austria, and his delegation arrived here on Monday [4 April] for a 10-day visit to China at the invitation of the U.N. Association of China. During the meeting Qiao and Waldheim exchanged views on a wide range of issues including the development of Sino-Austrian relations and international issues of common interest. On China-Austria ties, both expressed the hope for furthering bilateral cooperation in every field, especially in infrastructure development. They agreed that there exist great possibilities and broad prospects for expanding such cooperation. Qiao reaffirmed China's consistent adherence to the principles of equality in handling state-to-state relations and its stand for the settlement of international disputes through peaceful means. If these principles are departed from, he said, contradictions will be accelerated and problems can not be settled. This will contribute nothing to world peace. Waldheim said he agreed with Qiao's view. During the meeting the two also exchanged views on the position and roles of the U.N. and the regional situation as well. This evening Huang Hua, as the first leader of the Chinese delegation to the U.N., hosted a dinner in honor of Mr. Waldheim and his party.
