Senior Metropolitan Police officers and representatives of the National Security Council and National Intelligence Agency arrived at the possible World Trade Center link after a two-hour meeting. The high-level meeting was called after a team of Metropolitan Police searched a shophouse in Bang Kapi where they found another steel water tank, 25 sacks of fertilizer, electrical wiring and 50 other items believed used in assembling the bomb. Police said the investigators were led to the three-story shophouse by a water tank shop on Ramkhamhaeng Road whose address was on the side of the bomb found on board a rented truck in front of the Lumphini Police Station on Thursday. The station police had taken the truck from Chitlom Road near the Israel Embassy where it was left by a "Mideast-looking" driver after it hit a motorcycle on coming out of the Central Department Store parking lot on March 11. The bomb was found when the truck owner, turning up to claim the vehicle, became suspicious of the water tank and a strong stench and asked the police to investigate. The smell was found to come from a body inside the tank. Police found the tank was filled with ammonium nitrate, diesel fuel, six bars of C-4 plastic explosive wired to a battery aboard the truck, and the body, found later to be that of the driver assigned to deliver the vehicle to a Mideast-looking man at Makro superstore in Bang Kapi on March 10. Police said they questioned staff at the water tank shop who confirmed they had delivered two tanks to a house on Sukhaphiban Road at the order of a foreign buyer. Police said they found a receipt which showed the fertilizer had been ordered from a shop in Thon Buri. The shop had been rented to a Mideast-looking man who spoke Thai about four months ago, police said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Chaiyasit Kanchanakit said investigators have identified of the Mideast-looking man who drove the truck and rented the shophouse. He said the man had rented the house since August last year and had transferred money to the house owner to pay for the rent from a province in the South. Interpol has already been contacted to look for the man who might have left the country, he said. Up to four foreigners lived in the house, he said, but the landlord believed they had now left Thailand. Pol. [Police] Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said, based on the contents and materials used to make the bomb and the items found yesterday at the house, police and intelligence agencies decided the terrorists belonged to the same group which exploded a bomb at the World Trade Center in New York. The bomb used at the World Trade Center on February 26 last year was said to be made of the same concoction known among U.S. Federation Bureau of Investigation agents as a "witches' brew". Police on Thursday said the homemade bomb found on the truck, using the mixture of fertilizer and diesel fuel to add to its explosive strength, was big enough to destroy a large building. Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said investigation teams had been assigned to watch out for foreigners who look like the person in the sketch drawn up from witnesses' accounts. "The problem is we are not sure if they are still in Thailand," said Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit, who on Thursday said he was "50 percent" sure the terrorists are still in the Kingdom. The officer said he was confident the terrorists were foreigners who had chosen the Israel Embassy as their target because the truck carrying the bomb was heading toward the embassy on Soi Lang Suan when it was involved in an accident with a motorcycle. He said the information given by the owner of the truck, the water tank shop staff and the motorcyclist indicates the Mideast- looking who rented the truck and bought the water tanks was the same person. The man communicated with his hands and spoke both English and Arabic. Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said he was confident there was more than one, probably three to four, people involved in the plot and they would have had to have been in the country for some time because the person who drove the truck appeared to know Bangkok's roads. Police Director-General Pratin Santipraphop said he believed at least two Mideast-looking men were involved in an international plot to blow up the Israeli Embassy. But the names of the two suspects art still unknown and it is not sure if they are still in Thailand, he said. Pol. Gen. Pratin. said police yesterday searched several areas of Bang Mot and Ramkhamhaeng in search of the suspects. He said he had not appointed a special police team to work on the case but admitted to working closely with officials from the Israeli Embassy. Metropolitan Police Assistant Director-General Bunchop Phumwichit said plainclothes police had been sent to various hotels, hangouts of Mideast visitors, Makro superstore in Bang Kapi, the water tank shop and the Central Department Store parking lot to gather more information. Immigration police have been instructed to step up surveillance at border checkpoints. The Israeli Embassy has sent a message to thank the police for the increased security following the discovery of the bomb, he said. Extra security has been ordered for foreign embassies, particularly the Israeli Embassy, since Thursday night. A Syrian tourist, Mohammad Hazamail, 35, was detained at his rented room at Phetchaburi Apartment yesterday by Immigration police and taken immediately to Lumphini police station for questioning and identification by the motorcyclist. The man was released later after being cleared. Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said earlier yesterday it was too early to say if the bomb had any connection with the World Trade Center bombing. Mr. Banyat said he was waiting for the findings of government agencies seeking to establish the identities of the people who made the bomb. Earlier this year police distributed photographs of three Pakistanis, wanted by the U.S. and carrying a reward of $2 million, believed to be responsible for the bombing of the World Trade Centre and hiding somewhere in Thailand. The three were identified as Mir Aimal Kansi (or Kasi), Muhammad Farooq and Ramzi Ahmad Yousef. Mr. Banyat said he had reported to Prime Minister Chuan Likphai in Vietnam about the incident.
