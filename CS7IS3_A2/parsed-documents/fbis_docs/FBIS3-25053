After a meeting on Sunday in Ulundi, the policy-making Central Committee said not enough progress had been made in the trilateral talks to warrant participation in the election since its recent special conference. "The progress made in negotiations since the meeting...does not yet make it possible for the IFP to enter elections," the committee said in a statement. The meeting resolved to instruct its negotiators to "further negotiate...on the clear understanding the constitutional concerns of the IFP hang together as inter-related and interlocked fundamental issues." It added failure to negotiate the Freedom Alliance's proposed amendments to any one clause of the constitution, would have adverse implications on all other IFP concerns. Further trilateral talks will take place on Monday in the last round of talks ahead of registration of parties for the election.
