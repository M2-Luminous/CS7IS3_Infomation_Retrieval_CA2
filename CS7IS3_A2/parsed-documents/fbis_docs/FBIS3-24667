Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-17Feb94-Russia Russia Ouestions Safety of Nuclear Weapons in Kazakhstan SUMMARY In an effort to generate international pressure on an apparently recalcitrant Kazakhstan to agree to the speedy removal of nuclear weapons from its territory, Russian military officials appear to have instigated charges that conditions at nuclear weapons sites in Kazakhstan have deteriorated so sharply that a nuclear accident is possible. Although Kazakhstani officials acknowledged they have suspended the withdrawal of missiles pending negotiations on the terms of their removal, they have strongly denied the safety allegations, which were leaked to a prominent Russian journalist on the eve of Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to the United States. The Russian allegations, similar to those the Russians have made--and continue to make--about Ukraine-based weapons, suggest that Moscow is prepared to use the same pressure tactics to assure an acceptable and timely settlement with Kazakhstan as it used on Ukraine. END SUMMARY In the first public indication of a serious rift with Kazakhstan over the withdrawal of nuclear weapons, Izvestiya on 12 February published a front-page article by its veteran military-affairs commentator Viktor Litovkin (See Note 1) reporting that "informed sources at the Russian Ministry of Defense" allege that Kazakhstan-based nuclear weapons at Zhangiz-Tobe and Derzhavinsk face "a critical situation" in a number of respects, including safety and security. The article charged that: -- Fire suppression systems and electrical service at warhead maintenance facilities "are literally on their last legs and virtually do not work." Some of the divisions' warhead maintenance buildings lack heat and water and are in danger of collapse. -- Security equipment at warhead storage and maintenance facilities--including electrified fences, "signal rockets," and mine fields--"have been disconnected" from their power supply, allowing intruders to violate the perimeter of the complexes undetected. -- The security guard force is so undermanned and undertrained "that you can only be amazed that no one has yet stolen a single atom bomb." The morale among officers at the bases "could not be worse," and several--including four nuclear warhead "specialists"--have deserted. (Note 1) Litovkin is a longtime military-affairs commentator who often appears to use his articles to provide a platform for the views of Russian military officials. In an indication of the favor in which he is held by military officials, Litovkin was among the first group of journalists invited to visit and write about a Typhoon-class ballistic missile submarine, the world's largest and Russia's newest class of missile submarines (Izvestiya, 28 February 1992). Political Overtones The allegations appear linked to a slowdown in negotiations between Russia and Kazakhstan on the removal of the weapons to Russia. The article explicitly blamed the problems at the sites on the absence of an agreement between Russia and Kazakhstan on the "status" and "future fate" of the strategic nuclear forces in Kazakhstan and accused Kazakhstani officials of prohibiting the removal of the weapons to Russia for maintenance and the delivery of maintenance-related equipment to the missile bases. "Repeated requests" by Russian military authorities to address these problems have gone unanswered by Kazakhstani of ficials, the article asserted, concluding that the Russian military "is afraid that this process might drag on indefinitely." Kazakhstani Reaction A Kazakhstani Government official denied the allegations, saying that they had been fabricated by forces in Russia hoping to disrupt the talks and complicate Nazarbayev's visit to the United States. Kazakhstani State Adviser Tulegen Zhukeyev held a press conference the day Litovkin's article was published to deny the statements as "absolutely untrue." He acknowledged, however, that Kazakhstan had "suspended" the withdrawal of missiles from the country because of the "unsettled problem of compensation" and charged that the Izvestiya report was "instigated by forces"- -including the "Russian military and industrial complex"--that want to "introduce additional difficulties" in negotiations to settle the problem. Zhukeyev, noting that the allegations appeared on the eve of Nazarbeyev's visit to the United States, also claimed the Izvestiya article was timed to generate "international pressure" on Kazakhstan, but he insisted that Kazakhstan would not be bullied. "The problem can be settled only through civilized negotiations with due account of the interests of all sides," he said. Zhukeyev also asserted that nuclear weapons in Kazakhstan "are completely safe and well- controlled" and denied that Kazakhstan has ever "hampered the delivery of spares" or maintenance equipment (ITAR-TASS, 12 February; Kazakhstani radio, 14 February). Echoes of Ukraine The allegations in the Russian press that Kazakhstan's nuclear weapons are unsafe are strikingly reminiscent of similar warnings in regard to Ukrainian weapons. For example, Litovkin touched off a controversy in early 1993 when he published an article in Izvestiya--also citing unnamed Russian military officials- -alleging that nuclear weapons in Ukraine had deteriorated to the point of threatening "a second Chernobyl" (16 February 1993). Litovkin's article was followed by public statements by Russian military officials alleging nuclear weapons hazards in Ukraine. These charges have continued to surface, even after the 14 January signing by Presidents Clinton, Kravchuk, and Yeltsin of a trilateral agreement in which Ukraine agreed to dismantle and remove its nuclear weapons. For example, in a widely reported 18 January press conference at the Russian Ministry of Defense, Col. Gen. Yevgeniy Maslin, introduced as the ministry's "chief expert in the area of nuclear safety," said the physical condition of the warheads in Ukraine is becoming "intolerable." Saying that "nuclear safety in Ukraine is continuing to get worse," Maslin asserted that warhead storage facilities are "packed" beyond "standard limits," that "background radiation" at the facilities has increased, and that warranty periods on "most component parts have expired." Maslin also said that some military officials in Ukraine understand the safety hazards of the weapons there "but wish to retain their positions in the new structures that emerged there to supervise the nuclear weapons." He criticized Ukrainian lawmakers, saying they are too concerned with "playing the nuclear card" in exchange for economic benefits without appreciating the danger posed by the weapons (ITAR-TASS, Moscow radio, 18 January; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 19 January; Russian TV, 18, 20 January). Outlook Although Russian Ministry of Defense officials have not yet been observed to comment publicly on the issue of the safety of nuclear weapons in Kazakhstan, it appears highly probable that Litovkin is fronting for them in this case just as he appeared to do earlier on the Ukrainian safety issue. By raising the spectre of nuclear accidents in Kazakhstan, Moscow is probably hoping to generate international as well as domestic Kazakhstani pressure on the government in Almaty to accede to a timely settlement acceptable to Russia. If they follow the same tactics they have used toward Ukraine, Russian military and government officials can be expected to raise the safety issue publicly in the coming months, particularly if Kazakhstan is seen to be holding out for a settlement unacceptable to Moscow. With regard to Ukraine, the resumption of the use of scare tactics by the Russian military- -even after the signing of the trilateral agreement--suggests that Moscow wants to keep pressure on Ukraine until the terms of the trilateral accord are fulfilled.
