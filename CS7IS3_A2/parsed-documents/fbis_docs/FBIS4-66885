Today, the Russian press publishes materials on the intention of Ukraine to capture Kuban and develop new types of mass destruction weapons, while the Ukrainian president is opening a clinic for children. Kravchuk, laughing: You said it yourself and this is paradoxical indeed. Paradoxes in the press--in this case in some of the Russian newspapers--are, unfortunately, paradoxical indeed. I have read this publication today and I am under the impression that this is a kind of myth. Somebody thought: Why not create a myth? So this myth is being passed off as some reality. I can tell you right out that nobody has issued any instructions for missiles to be retargeted, neither the president nor the Defense Council nor other state structures of ours. It has not even crossed our minds. As they say, it is only imaginative writing presenting it as reality. Nor is there, was there, can there be, or will there be any development of any mass destruction weapons, because in general we as a state have been against mass destruction weapons right from the outset. We have no chemical or bacteriological weapons, and we as a state have determined our position with regard to eliminating nuclear weapons. The impression is, you know, that this is some kind of unhealthy perception of Ukraine and I can say no more. I would just like to say that this is simply a myth.
