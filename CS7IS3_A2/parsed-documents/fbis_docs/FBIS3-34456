Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said that violating the rights of others, resorting to violence, and undermining the principle of cooperation and assistance are grave indications that harm the Palestinian people's unity and cohesion. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi held the Israeli authorities responsible for the disorder and chaos among Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, especially the spread of weapons in the streets, which reach the hands of adolescents and irresponsible individuals. He added that in accordance with international law, Israel, as an occupying country, is obligated to protect Palestinian residents and care for their safety. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said: In light of this situation, for which everyone knows Israel is responsible, the Palestinians should rally around their unity and avoid infighting, which does not serve the Palestinian people. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi appealed to the Palestinian leadership to work tirelessly and adopt a unified Palestinian position on a democratic basis in order to avoid all the dangers that threaten the Palestinian people, their militant heritage, and honorable history of struggle against the occupation.
