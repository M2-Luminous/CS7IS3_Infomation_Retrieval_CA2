The U.S. Government will begin final coordination on the Japan-U.S. summit meeting after the new administration is inaugurated in Japan. The next Japan-U.S. summit meeting was originally regarded as the deadline for drawing up agreements on all the sectors in the economic framework talks. However, since the framework talks were virtually broken off in February, the schedule is expected to be greatly delayed. Because both Japanese and U.S. Governments believe that "the next Japan-U.S. summit meeting will serve as a major turning point in efforts for the economic framework talks," they intend to seek the resumption of the economic framework talks and agreements on the three priority sectors -- namely, automobile and auto parts; government procurement; and insurance -- at least before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting. It has so far been believed that the Japan-U.S. summit will take place before the Naples summit of G-7 leaders. There was speculation that the Japanese prime minister would visit the United States to hold summit talks with the U.S. President on his way to Naples. In response to the U.S. request, the Japanese Government and the new prime minister will make a final decision on the schedule for the Japan-U.S. summit after the new administration is inaugurated.
