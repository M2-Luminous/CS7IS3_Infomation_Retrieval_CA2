FR941213-0-00016 FR941213-0-00003 School Bus Safety Determination The safety of children in school buses is an important concern, since any crash, particularly one resulting in fatalities or serious injury to children, is so tragic. However, the number of crashes, injuries and fatalities involving school buses is small, particularly when considering exposure and when compared to the number of crashes, injuries and fatalities related to other priority programs. The agencies believe significant attention has been devoted to School Bus Safety and steps have been taken to improve the already excellent safety record of this mode of transportation. Furthermore, the states already have the ability under the Section 402 program to address school bus and other highway safety programs, and are proficient in allocating existing resources as they deem necessary to achieve maximum safety benefits. In addition, the States are able to address the majority of school bus-related fatalities, which occur while children are boarding or exiting, not riding the bus, under the Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety program, which is a designated National Priority area. For these reasons, and based on a review of the comments and other information currently available, the agencies conclude that there is not sufficient justification for designating School Bus Safety as a National Priority program area.
