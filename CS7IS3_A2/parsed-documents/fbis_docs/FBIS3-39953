Then came the Anti-Prohibitionists and the Pannella List. Now Marco Pannella has invented another label, that of the "Reformers"; has revived his List; and has succeeded in planting a number of loyal associates in areas dominated by the Northern League, thanks to a last-minute agreement between Pannella and [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. Thus, the keenest supporter of the plain single-candidate system -- that is, of a British-style two-party system -- is yet again swimming against the tide and complicating matters by aligning his candidates under three different banners (four, including the League's). If this proves successful, Pannella will hit the bull's-eye. If not, he and all his men risk missing a turn. As he promised, Pannella will challenge Italian Social Movement [MSI] Secretary Fini in the capital's most right-wing constituency, Rome 24 (Prati-Flaminio-Tor di Quinto), where the progressive forces are fielding Edoardo Missoni and the Pact is fielding the Liberals' Costanza Pera. Running under the same banner ("Pannella List-Reformers"), the paparazzo, Oliviero Toscani, will be running against [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto and Pierferdinando Casini [Christian Democratic Center] in the red constituency of Bologna 3, while Paolo Villaggio (who failed to be elected by a whisker last time round, on Communist Renewal's list) will be standing in a college in his home region of Liguria. These three different names, with different backgrounds, perhaps share a common future of almost certain defeat. Indeed, Pannella's aim seems to be, rather, to make a provocative protest against the predominant absence of real competition in this election. But what about seats in parliament? Those should result from the proportional quotas, to which the Pannella List will try to accede in almost all the regions (apart from the smallest -- Umbria, Molise, Basilicata, Marches, and Calabria, where it has not even presented lists). The other 19 constituencies will be contested by (apart from Pannella himself) the usual members of his clan -- Emma Bonino, Roberto Cicciomessere, Peppino Calderisi, Massimo Teodori, Paolo Vigevano, Lorenzo Strik Lievers, Marco Taradash, Elio Vito... The interconnections have been so made that if the threshold of 4 percent is achieved the whole clan will return to the lower house. If not, there will be no seats, and it will be farewell to the Pannella List. [passage omitted]
