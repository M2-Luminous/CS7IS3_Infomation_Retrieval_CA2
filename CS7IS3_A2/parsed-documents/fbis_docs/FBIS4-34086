Chiefs of State and Government, Messrs. Foreign Ministers, Messrs. Ministers, Mr. Governor of the Department of Bolivar, Mr. Mayor of Cartagena, Mr. Commander of the Naval Fleet of the Atlantic, Messrs. Lawmakers, Ladies and Gentlemen. Messrs. Chiefs of State and Government: We are beginning the Ibero-American conference of chiefs of state and government, which is in its fourth year of existence, based on our mutual appreciation and our common values, which have given rise to this conference and which have consolidated it. I was pleased to welcome you in 1993 in the city of Salvador, where I could see everyone's desires to nurture and enhance the affinities that time and history have bequeathed to us. Guadalajara, Madrid, Salvador, and Cartagena are stopovers in a journey leading to a future of solidaristic interaction, heading for peace, prosperity for our peoples, and social justice. Commerce and integration as factors of Ibero-American development -- the topics on this Summit's agenda -- are the natural consequence of previous debates. Here we will analyze the factors that condition commercial and economic development in our nations. The fact that everyone (?is familiar) with everyone else's course allows debates to be frank and, above all, friendly. In the commercial area, we strive for fair rules and for really open markets. We conceive of regional integration as a process that supplements trade between the various regions of the earth. We agree on the need to couple the efficiency that is essential for growth with better living standards for our people. We have a broad consensus at this summit. We are supported by the agreements that we reached in the past on the pressing need for a new agenda for development, which may raise the issue to the level of a United Nations priority. Mr. President Cesar Gaviria: In this idyllic and centuries-old Cartagena, we are moved by the warm hospitality of the Colombian Government and people. Under your competent guidance we will move forward in our deliberations, in an innovative and constructive form. Different yet supplemental experiences have led us to believe in the advantages of integration. The European Union [EU] is a process in an advanced stage of implementation that should be carefully studied and analyzed. Latin American and Caribbean countries are developing their own development programs with positive results. Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the Andean Pact, the Central American Common Market, the Caribbean Community, the Group of Three, and our most recent proposal, the South American Free Trade Area, are dynamic projects for liberalization of international trade. We were greatly satisfied to hear the statements by Bolivia in Colonia and by Chile in Belem do Para, seeking to join Mercosur. These are concrete steps for creation of the South American economic area, which we conceive of as an open, rather than excluding, area. In this regard, we hail the North American Free Trade Agreement, whose evolution we are closely following. We see NAFTA as a possible bridge between Ibero-American nations and the large markets of the developed countries of the Americas. The dialogue between the Rio Group and the European Union is another route for cooperation and integration. Within this framework, we found major and encouraging signs of a new and more concrete approach from the EU to Latin America, an achievement to which the dialogue we held at this forum must have certainly contributed. The current international situation offers new opportunities for diplomacy. This forum is operating under auspicious circumstances, based on our peoples' devotion to democracy and on their leaders' commitment to improving it. We represent a community of nations marked by its devotion to peace. However, the aspirations of (?tranquility) that we share coexist with the contrasting image of exclusion and violence. In this regard, the Ibero-American conference has tried to contribute to the strengthening of tolerance and harmony. Tolerance and harmony should give inspiration to the relations between our countries. The isolating policy of sanitary cordons no longer suits the pluralistic and dynamic world in which we live. Mr. President Cesar Gaviria: I would like to conclude my speech by warmly congratulating you on your election as secretary general of the Organization of American States, where I am sure you will do a fine job. I wish you success in the task that you have undertaken. I am now transferring to Your Excellency the direction of the work of this Fourth Conference of Ibero-American Chiefs of State and Government. Thank you, very much. [applause]
