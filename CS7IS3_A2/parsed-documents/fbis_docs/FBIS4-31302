The main topic of their conversation was the situation in Europe and bilateral relations. This is what the prime minister told journalists after the talks, when commenting on these relations: [Begin Klaus recording] Indeed, I do not understand the calls for a dialogue with a capital D, because I think that the Czech-German dialogue has been continuing on a daily basis and that it is being carried out every day. [sentence as heard] In the course of this dialogue, we explain specific matters to each other. I reject the claim that there is any kind of discontinuity. I reject the idea that up until now we have not talked to each other and that a D-Day will come when we will draw a new line and say: Czech-German dialogue is starting as of this moment. That is a fiction being created by individuals on both sides, regrettably, and I think that this kind of discontinuity does not exist. [passage omitted] [end recording] [Announcer] Milan Uhde and Jan Kasal, chairman and deputy chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, met the CDU-CSU Bundestag foreign policy spokesman, Karl Lamers, in Prague today, too. They explained to the guest why it was impossible to fulfill the demand that the Benes Decrees [expelling Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War II and confiscating their property] be abolished. They explained that raising and repeating this demand had a negative effect on Czech-German relations.
