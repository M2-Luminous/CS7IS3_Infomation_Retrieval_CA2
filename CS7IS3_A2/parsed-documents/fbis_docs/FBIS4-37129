This approach is embodied in the fact that Yemeni unity is the fate and lot of the people, and that this unity should not be harmed and is not subject to bargaining. He said the state welcomes and does not reject dialogue with any party, if this dialogue deals with Yemeni unity, the establishment of this unity, and with legitimacy, democracy, and political pluralism. Those who reject this are infidels. This came at a news conference by the brother House of Representatives speaker today and attended by local, Arab, and foreign correspondents in Sanaa. House of Representatives Speaker brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar emphasized that the Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy are confronting the forces of apostasy and secession, and that the Yemeni people from all walks of life support their Armed Forces. He explained that the forces of apostasy and secession have imposed war on our people, something our people do not want. He said the secessionists cannot have some of their illusions realized because Yemeni unity is a fact, the fruit of the struggle of the Yemeni people, their response to the Yemeni revolution's objectives, and the nucleus of comprehensive Arab unity.
