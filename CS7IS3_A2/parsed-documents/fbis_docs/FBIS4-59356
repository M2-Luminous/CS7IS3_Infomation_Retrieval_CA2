They skirt the core issues between the two countries, but nonetheless New Delhi insists that "non-issues" be discussed at yet another--and perhaps equally futile--8th meeting between the two foreign secretaries. One is left with the unhappy impression that the proposed exercise is designed to have the world believe that India and Pakistan are engaged in resolving the dispute on their own and so the international community need not concern itself with it. Whereas the unfortunate position is that the entire exercise is cosmetic, intended to gain time for the 500,000 Indian forces to complete their ethnic-cleansing job in Kashmir. This is established by New Delhi's March 21st clarification of its January 24 non-paper on Kashmir. The slight hope raised by the original vaguely-worded non-paper has been quashed by the latest communication declaring categorically that India views the state as an integral part of India and it sees no need to ascertain the will of the Kashmiris--which amounts to saying the core issue is not open to negotiation. This communication also exposes the self-serving nature of the non-paper-I's call for an agreement on the maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the Line of Control. (But not the whole country.) The new formulation tends to detract even from the Simla Agreement by talking of the "ultimate solution" instead of the "final status" of the state; and the real aim appears to be to convert the Line of Control into a bilateral border, which compromises Pakistan's traditional position. Oddly enough, India apparently seeks Pakistan's help in consolidating its imperial hold on the adjoining areas with its proposal for so called mutual cooperation in the prevention of any encouragement of any act detriment to the maintenance of peaceful and harmonious relations. India seems to conveniently forget that peace and tranquillity along the Line of Control is being jeopardised--in fact breached--by India itself. Through its deployment of half a million troops equipped with the most lethal weaponry and the most callous use of it against unarmed civilians. The havoc caused by India's systematic genocide of Kashmiris has been documented meticulously by several human rights organisations. New Delhi's non-paper-I stresses the need to avoid "military exercises" in the vicinity of the Control Line. It forgets that Pakistan has never carried out any military exercises on its side of the Line; and that for the last four years, it is India that has actually been carrying out "live" military operation on its side of the Line, resulting in an estimated 100,000 casualties, including 30,000 killed. If anything, it is Pakistan which should be calling upon India to pull out the additional forces it has inducted into the state since 1990 and restore the balance of forces between India and Pakistan as envisaged in the U.N.- sponsored ceasefire agreement of 1949. Pakistan, in fact, could charge India, before the UN Security Council, with flagrant breach of this international agreement. In any case, India ought to de-induct the additional forces to restore the balance and to prove that it is sincere in its proposal for peace and tranquillity along the Line of Control. Additionally, India should establish its bona fides in this regard by agreeing to strengthen the presence of the United Nations Military Observers' Group for India and Pakistan (UN-MOGIP) to enable it perform its mandatory job of monitoring the Control Line, where there has been recurrent shelling and air violations. The UN Observers should be enabled to patrol the Line on both sides of it; and also authorised to monitor the situation further inland on both sides of LOC. Additionally full and free access should be provided to UN agencies and international human rights organisations to all areas of Jammu and Kashmir to check grave human rights violations. On the related issue of Siachin, there is no need for a repeat discussion on the principles of a settlement; they were all decided at the Defence Secretaries meeting in June 1989 when it was agreed that redeployment of troops must take place in accordance with the Simla Agreement which requires both sides to withdraw their forces to the positions obtaining in 1972. India's non-paper-2 seeks to repudiate that commitment and to that end, it contends that as agreed in November 1992, the two sides shall disengage from "authenticated" positions they are presently occupying and fall back to new positions since identified by India. Now, the Indian contention happens to be completely false; Pakistan never agreed to any authentication of currently-held positions; and there is no question of any fresh understanding on any fallback positions for the simple reason that India is required by the Simla agreement to vacate all positions that it was not occupying in 1972 and it certainly had no positions in Siachin or anywhere near it. There is no point in holding fresh talks to repudiate the earlier ones. Five rounds of Indo-Pakistan talks on demarcation of the Sir Creek estuary (subject matter of non-paper-3) have ended in complete deadlock; the common-sense answer lies in now referring the issue to international arbitration. In the case of the Wullar Barrage built by India on river Jhelum in violation of the Indus Basin International Treaty, (non-paper-4) technical and legal experts have first to thrash out the issue in all its bearings before the Foreign Secretaries can usefully apply their minds to it. Again, while Pakistan would like even to further extend the scope of the Joint Commission by including environmental protection, combating natural disasters and strengthening SAARC in its purview the prevailing level of mutual bitterness between the two countries, especially in the context of carnage in Kashmir, makes the present time most inappropriate for a meeting. (India's non- paper-5). Likewise, it is the deadly deadlock over the core issue of Kashmir which imperils Pakistan's security and consequently inhibits any fruitful dialogue on nuclear non-proliferation. On principle, Islamabad subscribes fervently to non-proliferation and would welcome any agreement intended to insulate population centres against any nuclear attack, vide non- paper-6. But we are averse to make-believe declarations. We are not convinced of the genuineness of the Indian proposal for protection of population centres when we find India pulling back its forces from its eastern frontier and concentrating them against Pakistan's major cities, when we see India so deploying its missiles on the border that our major population centres are the designed targets, or when we notice India acquiring and arming deep-penetration attack aircraft to hit deeper into our territory. India's proposal for a "no-first-strike" commitment also sounds hollow when India is so determinedly refusing to enter into any regional non-proliferation arrangement. For years, Pakistan has been offering: simultaneous ratification of NPT, simultaneous acceptance of IAEA full-scope safeguards, mutual inspection of each other's nuclear facilities, a bilateral nuclear test ban treaty and establishment of a nuclear free zone in South Asia. Each one of these proposals has been rejected by India. More recently, Pakistan has proposed a conference of India. Pakistan, Russia, China and the United States, to evolve regional arrangements for nuclear non-proliferation and South Asian security; but this too has not been accepted by India. It is India's duplicity and its habit of wriggling out of solemn commitments by legalistic sophistry or fancy interpretations which make many Pakistanis sceptical about any dialogue with India. While CIA has offered US Congress irrefutable evidence of India's capability of deploying a nuclear arsenal and of even evolving a hydrogen bomb, New Delhi still insists on calling its 1974 nuclear bomb a "peaceful explosion". While ordering two more squadrons of the latest MiG-29's to reinforce its existing lineup of 750 most modern warplanes, new Delhi opposes the US release of 38 F-16s to Pakistan that it has already paid for on grounds that it will upset the balance of power in the subcontinent. While the UN Security Council, the US State Department, India's own founding fathers (Nehru) and Lord Mountbatten papers all agree on describing Kashmir as disputed territory whose future is still to be determined by its people, India insists on claiming it as an integral part of the Indian Union and dismissing the massive popular uprising in Kashmir as no more than "terrorist infiltration by a neighbour," and is employing 500,000 fully armed soldiers to decimate the Kashmiris much the same way the Yugoslav Serbs are ethnic-cleansing the Bosnian Muslims. The conclusion is inescapable: The fake talks on "non-issues" that India seeks to hold at the foreign secretaries-level are designed to hoodwink the world into believing that India is applying its mind to resolving the Kashmir crisis, whereas the Indian strategy is to gain an uninterrupted opportunity to "end the Kashmir problem by ending the Kashmiris. Pakistan must beware of the trap.
