FBIS3-49100 "dreeu001__a94020" FBIS-EEU-94-001-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX HUNGARY Labor Center Reports Economic Statistics AU0501150594 Budapest MTI in English 1214 GMT 5 Jan 94 AU0501150594 Budapest MTI Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Budapest, 5 January (MTI) -- Compared to the record high in March, 1993, the number of unemployed declined by 50,000, to 630,000 at the end of the year. According to the short-term forecast of the National Labor Center, the decline will continue in the first half of 1994, and the number of people out of work will stand at around 580,000. Statistics indicate that the value of Hungarian industrial production rose by 4 percent in 1993. The number of unemployed declined from 680,000 in March (a rate of 13 percent), to 630,000 (12.2 percent). This, however, is not the total number of unemployed. Last year, the National Labor Center carried out a national survey on those left out of the registers because their unemployment aid is no longer granted (as they had been out of work for one year). The result was that 12 percent of the long-term unemployed were left out of the register without any financial aid. The forecast of the institution for the first six months of 1994 reckons with only 20,000 people who stand to lose their eligibility, which means that roughly 50,000 people will not be on the unemployment records, but will be out of work in the summer of 1994. The short-term forecast covered 4,600 firms that employed about one-third of workers (1.7 million people) and predicts a decline of 50,000 in the number of registered unemployed to 580,000, that is 11.4 percent of the population in the working age group. The analyses stresses that company manpower strategies have changed considerably in view of the boom taking shape in economy. The proportion of companies dismissing workers has steadily declined since the second half of 1992, and, in the second half of 1993, the number of economic units dismissing workers was less than those offering vacancies. Company investment inclination also shows a steady rise, with 18 percent of firms expanding capacities in the second half of 1993. This proportion was significantly higher in industry, building industry, and servicing industry. The number of firms reporting growing orders is also on the rise. In the last quarter of 1993, the proportion of firms in a good or improving situation outnumbered that of firms in a lastingly poor or deteriorating situation, for the first time in two and a half years. Demand will mainly increase for skilled workers, and more and more companies intend to employ first-time job seekers, which will improve the employment opportunities of this age-group (the rate of unemployment in the 16 to 25 age-group is 17 percent). Figures indicate the boom also has beneficial effects on the territorial differences in unemployment, with employment opportunities showing the fastest rise in counties with the highest unemployment rates. The analysis reckons with a further improvement in economic performance and, therefore, better employment opportunities as dismissals related to restructuring in industry, building industry and services is drawing to an end, after three years. However, in spite of the improving economic situation, the future of long-term unemployed persons unable to find work due to lack of qualifications or for health reasons, is still to be settled, experts note.
