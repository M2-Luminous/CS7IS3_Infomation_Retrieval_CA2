Cooperation and reflection are required to see this complex work, covering laws, procedures, and standards, through to a successful conclusion. We will take an overview of the situation. The three European directives issued in 1990 required the implementation in France of new legislative, regulatory, and standardizing measures and, in certain cases, modifications and additions to the existing set of measures designed to protect man and the environment from biological risks. For them to be included in French law, the authorities judged that directive 90/679 on worker protection could be applied in the context of a major addition to the Code du Travail [Work Code], and that directives 90/219 and 90/220 should be applied by a law adopted by parliament and enacted on 13 July 1992. The European Community moreover required that a set of 56 standards accompany the application of the directives to cover genetic engineering (90/219 and 90/220). In this article we will therefore examine the situation of these three aspects: work regulation, the law on biotechnology, and European standardization. Work Regulation Directive 90/679 is thus to be applied in France through the Work Code which will receive a major new section. Very soon, a decree will create "a section seven to the first chapter of section two of book two of the Work Code" entitled "Prevention of Biological Risk." After the definition of certain terms and the classification of biological agents into four groups -- the first containing agents that are not dangerous for man and the other three grouping dangerous agents by degrees of harmfulness -- the decree will provide, in subsection two, general rules for the assessment and prevention of biological risk. Subsection three will stress the requirement for training and dissemination of information. Subsection four will list provisions specific to certain activities (medical, funeral, and veterinary establishments, medical biology laboratories, industrial processes using pathogenic biological agents, etc.). Lastly, subsection five will deal with the medical monitoring of exposed personnel and the duties of the work medical service. This decree should come into effect before the end of 1993. The Law of 13 July 1993 This law is intended to regulate research, training, development, production and marketing operations relating to genetically manipulated microorganisms and organisms (GMM's and GMO's). It is based on existing structures which it further strengthens: the genetic engineering commission, charged with establishing the danger criteria for genetic constructions, assessing projects, and prescribing confinement measures; and the commission for the study and dissemination of the products of biomolecular engineering, termed biomolecular engineering products, which is charged with studying each specific R&D project and project stage operating in an unconfined environment, and which issues an opinion prior to the marketing of the product. Both commissions send their opinions to their parent ministries, the government ministers being the only authority empowered to authorize and prescribe safety provisions or to refuse an R&D operation. The two decrees formalizing and defining the missions of these two commissions were published in the Official Journal [OJ] on 30 January and 24 February 1993. The two orders detailing their respective contents were also published in the OJ on 9 February and 22 May 1993. The commissions will continue to examine all dossiers submitted to them, as they have been since 1975 and 1986 respectively. In addition, the law distinguishes training and R&D work from production and marketing operations. Research And Development The decree of 27 March 1993 stipulates that R&D units and study projects, whether public or private, must be approved by the research ministry after the genetic engineering commission has given its opinion. Operations already underway must have been submitted for approval by way of a form drawn up by the order of 9 June 1993 which must have been sent in before the limit date given in the above-mentioned decree, i.e. 27 September 1993. Theoretically, all operations already underway that have not been indicated by this date are illegal and fall into the new operations category. New operations, before any work can begin, must request approval on the basis of a dossier which must follow the guidelines laid out in an as-yet unpublished decree. It is hoped that this legal vacuum that has existed since 27 September 1993 will be quickly filled. Production The law states that the production of GMM's and GMO's will be regulated by the law of 1976 relative to installations classified for reasons of environmental protection. No decree or order has yet been published, since the insertion of this new section into this law poses a number of problems which could have repercussions for the whole industry. For the time being, the administrative control of production starting with genetically manipulated micro-organisms is done according to heading 58 paragraph 11 of the list of classified installations. Marketing In this case, too, the vertical, sectorial marketing regulations (agricultural products, human or veterinary medical products, etc.) are being or will be progressively altered. A regulatory measure should gather up those subjects that are not covered by any vertical regulation. This, then, is a brief summary of the current situation of a regulation that is progressively being inserted into structures that -- fortunately -- already exist. We can only hope that the internal discussions currently underway lead us to solutions enabling the safe, problem-free, non-delayed, and effective application of the new biological technologies, based on the in vitro manipulation of DNA and which are grouped together under the heading of biotechnologies. Standardization Well before this avalanche of Community and national regulations -- under the direct auspices of the chairman of the interministerial group for chemical products attached to the prime minister's office and the ministry of industry -- France had already begun to implement several tens of standards. For public and private operators, the application of these standards -- which can be revised depending on the development of knowledge and in consultation with the commissions on genetic engineering and biomolecular engineering -- has enabled France to make quite spectacular strides in biotechnology, and in complete safety. In the field of agriculture alone, for example, between 1986 and 1992 France was able to set up more than 150 on-site experimental projects, behind the United States which had begun some 300 experiments out of a total of 600 being conducted worldwide. In the context of its own standardization policy, the European Community wanted to push ahead with the establishment of standards on a European scale. A more theoretical and less pragmatic discussion than that made several years earlier in France led to a 54-standard project being devised along the themes taken up in certain chapters of the French Standards text, without encompassing all of them. This is partly explained by the lack of experience in this area of certain European partners and by the speed with which the project had to be set up. Nevertheless, AFNOR (the French standards association), which has established a considerable lead in this area, and with the backing of the national interprofessional bio-industry organization (Organibio), asked the European Committee for Standardization [CEN] to form a technical committee, TC 233 biotechnology, which it would coordinate. Moreover, the CEN obtained an EC mandate (from Directorate General Three) to finance much of this work. After the inevitable delay while an effective body was set up, the program is now developing in acceptable conditions. It is hoped that the great majority of national biotechnology experts will cooperate by making constructive comments on the documents being drawn up in the various international working groups set up to produce the first draft. This has been a rapid and perhaps tedious overview of the current state of biotechnology regulations and standardization in France and in Europe. In such a wide field of application -- ranging from agriculture to genetic therapy and from basic research to marketing -- it is a long and arduous process to take everyone's point of view into consideration. The important thing, however, must surely be that we are seeing, for the first time in scientific history, safety discussions taking priority over industrial application. There is a potential risk associated with biotechnology, very well defined by Professor Royer in his 1981 report commissioned by the industry ministry. Only by the pragmatic study permitted by the intelligent application of regulations and standards can we further our knowledge of this potential risk and either confirm it or disprove it. Advances in developing this knowledge can only be made using a progressive approach, structured between safety barriers, permitting dialogue only between operators and members of independent socio-scientific commissions, and subject to secrecy in the discussions.
