[passage omitted] Also present at the meeting was our Radiozurnal, represented by Jarmila Tosecka and Peter Rohac. Despite difficult conditions, they have prepared a comprehensive report. [passage omitted] [Tosecka] During the debate, the organizers acquainted the participants in the meeting with the open letter addressed to the president of the Slovak Republic and the citizens of Slovakia: [Begin unidentified voice recording] We are sorry that solutions that concern a further intensification and application of the principle of self-administration, civic freedoms, and human rights in the case of minorities provoke hatred, intolerance, and political arrogance. The state belongs to each citizen; no more to some than to others just because they speak a different language. Let us seek a path to each other, but on the basis of equality. We will find stability only when a community will not want to interfere, on the basis of vindicated privileges, in a restrictive way, in the rights of another group. We are convinced that democracy is indivisible. It is either for everyone, or it will cease to be democracy. As citizens of the Slovak Republic, we hope that you will understand our sincere endeavor to achieve more democracy for all citizens of Slovakia because only from them any sovereignty arises. [end recording] [Tosecka] All those present approved by acclamation the final statement issued by the participants in the Komarno meeting. It is divided into three parts. [passage omitted] The first part contains a statement on the territorial administrative reorganization of Slovakia, and I quote: The participants in the meeting state that the present system of public administration in the Slovak Republic does not tally either with European requirements or the demands of the local population. Since 1990, the government has been planning a reorganization of the public administration system. The participants declare first that the government proposal does not suit the majority of the local government bodies in Slovakia and is unacceptable to the Hungarian community because the area in which the Hungarian community lives will, according to that proposal, be divided into five territorial administrative units that would promote organized assimilation. Second, in setting up administrative areas and organs of state administration, it is necessary to proceed from the principle that will ensure that the law prevails, and from a two-tier system of public administration. In our view, there exists two possibilities of reaching a solution--that is, to form one continuous territorial administrative unit, a region, stretching from the territory south of Bratislava up to Kosice, broken by a corridor, and then continuing to include Juzny Zemplin and the area between Uh and Latorica; furthermore, to create three territorial administrative units, regions, stretching from Bratislava to Sahy, from Sahy to Kosice, and then Juzny Zemplin and the area between Uh and Latorica. The Hungarian language island south of Nitra should form an individual area that would consist of 18 villages with almost 13,000 inhabitants of Hungarian nationality. Furthermore, the opportunity should be embodied in the law of bilingual dealings both in verbal and written form with official matters at offices, within the framework of territorial administrative units of the first and second tier, endowed with particular powers. Further, from the viewpoint of authorities and powers, the system of institutions within the framework of territorial administrative units should be compatible throughout the territory of Slovakia, with the exception of the territories inhabited by Hungarians or members of other national minorities. These territories should have a special legal status. Second, there is the statement on the jurisdiction of local government bodies. The participants in the meeting state that, in the Slovak Republic, the rights of local government bodies are inadequate. The development of local government bodies meets with obstacles. Their rights are deliberately restricted. Central power is getting more powerful, to the detriment of local government bodies, and the superiority of state administrative bodies is asserted against them. For this reason, the Slovak Republic should sign, as soon as possible, an association agreement with the European Charter of Local Government Bodies, and it should embody the rights of local government bodies in the Constitution and the law. Furthermore, the vast majority of public matters should be tackled at a local level. I can quote, furthermore, the right of local governing bodies to form associations and their right to join international associations. In the interest of legal certainty, the Constitution should define for taxation purposes the system of local government bodies, their authority, and their powers. Before the implementation of the new system of the territorial administrative division of the country, within the sense of Section Two of Article 64 of the Slovak Constitution, it is necessary to create, on the basis of a voluntary association of local government bodies, larger territorial units that would come under the jurisdiction of future territorial self-governing bodies, while paying regard to the recommendation of the Council of Europe No. 1201. In the interest of the decentralization of power, the rationalization of state administration, and the strengthening of public accountability by transferring powers from the state administration organs to local government bodies, it is necessary to bring administration closer to citizens and to broaden constitutional powers of local government bodies, in particular in the field of education, culture, health, public security, and environmental protection. Third, there is the statement on the constitutional status of Hungarians. The participants in the meeting state that the Hungarian population in Slovakia, despite a number of repressive acts and oppression during the totalitarian regime after World War II and other attempts to bring about ethnical homogenization of the population, has preserved its capacity to express itself again as a political entity, organize its community, and preserve the original population structure on the lands where it has been living for the past thousand years and, in the majority of cases, where it forms a majority of the local population. [passage omitted] ...as a national community, it fights with resolve to ensure that, apart from individual rights to which everyone has the right, community rights are also acknowledged to it and that its status as a community is embodied in the Constitution.
