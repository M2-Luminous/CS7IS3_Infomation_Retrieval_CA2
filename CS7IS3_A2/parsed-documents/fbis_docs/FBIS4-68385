I. Starikov, by CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY correspondent Yu. Kormiltsev, Magnitogorsk, under rubric "Economy": "Anatoliy Starikov: `Don't Patch Up the Holes, but Make Decisions in a State Way''] [Text] Five years ago the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine bathed in the rays of glory. The first-born child of socialist industry continued to surprise people with its record-breaking successes. Just think, it used to produce 16 million tons of steel a year! More than any European country. Today the world's largest combine, like the entire metallurgical industry in Russia, is in a difficult situation. Entry into the civilized market proved to be no simple matter. In this situation nothing will help -- not the former merits, not the decorations awarded, not the high-sounding titles. Every enterprise is fated to take its own path in getting to the market. The reform also required that the MMK [Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine] administrators think about economics in a new way, take different approaches than they had in the past, and display new talents. This was the topic of a conversation that our correspondent had with Anatoliy Ilich Starikov, general director of the "MMK" AO [joint-stock company] and president of the Chelyabinsk Oblast Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. [Kormiltsev] It is unusual to hear reproachful statements directed at our metallurgists. Because your plans and production orders always used to be fulfilled with enviable constancy. But currently either the prices have risen unexpectedly, or the raw materials have not been paid for promptly. Of course, everyone is having a difficult time. But for such a giant as MMK, things certainly should be a bit easier, shouldn't they? [Starikov] Everything is not so simple. Let's recall history.. At one time a very catchy jingle was born here: "We'll run ourselves ragged, but we won't let down Magnitka" [rhymes in Russian]. We ran ourselves ragged during the entire war. And even later. Properly speaking, things never were easy. After all, we operated on imported raw materials practically all our life. Nevertheless we had the highest profitability level -- 28 percent. That was twice as high as, for example, the level in Lipetsk at that time. It is another matter that, while giving its all to the Motherland, Magnitka gradually lagged behind with regard to the qualitative specifications of the metal. The equipment was wearing out, and the assemblies were getting old... Also, iron gets tired. You cannot master the latest technologies just by shouting "hurray!" And so, even if you were a three-time patriot at your beloved enterprise, if you do not renew the technology, sooner or later everything will begin to fall apart. At one time a long-term program for the remodeling of the combine was prepared. But certain events occurred, and we proved to be "thrown overboard," outside the state programs. Well, the market will not accept emotions, and former enthusiasm will not save us. This is a stern and mobile conveyor belt where, from day to day, there is a merciless struggle for survival. But how can we survive if, all of a sudden, everyone has proven to be debtors -- not only the producers, but also the consumers? The unprecedented crisis of nonpayments, according to certain pundits, is just a demand crisis. So they begin --excuse me for speaking so sharply -- brainwashing everyone, telling them, "You're producing the wrong kind of output, that your partners just do not need." That's demagoguery! The reason for the production slump is not the law of demand for our metal. The combine's fixed assets today have been supporting a workload of only 56 percent. But worldwide practice says that if they have a workload of less than 80 percent, their use is inefficient. We were forced to stop, for example, two coke-chemical batteries: because of a shortage of coal we are converting the remaining ones to an operational mode that removes the graphite from the walls, and this leads to the premature wearing out of the furnaces, so that, consequently, their service life is reduced by half. What will this lead to? To a disaster. Those are the conditions we are working in. Now is it understandable why our combine does not always succeed in being a reliable partner? And the fact that thousands of other enterprises are in the same situation is small solace for us. [Kormiltsev] Do you mean, then, that we are yielding our positions? [Starikov] We maneuver, and sometimes we retreat, but we do not give up! We are not sitting idly by. The market has made harsher demands on all the services, and has also new things to worry about. Let me return again to history. To a certain degree, things were not really too bad for us previously, before the reforms. The ministry, Gosplan, and Gossnab assumed many functions. The state used to provide us with raw materials and production orders, and with equipment. There was an opportunity to engage deeply in the development of technological innovations and to experiment. It was for good reason that Magnitka used to be called a nationwide school for advanced experience. But then the centralized supply and distribution disappeared. The market arrived. Suddenly there appeared the acute need to change the way we thought about the economy. Beginning with the enterprise director and ending with the packer. We cannot produce even a single ton of unordered metal! It is, essentially speaking, a revolutionary task. There are no sales for the old steel. And if there is no sale of the output, there is no money. And the only people we can blame are ourselves. The consumer psychology has to be changed as quickly as possible. We must not run around in confusion, or act nervously, but we must calmly analyze our own capabilities, of which I feel there are many. [Kormiltsev] So where did you begin? [Starikov] We begun from where we had been burned. With economic independence. It is not a matter of a fashionable slogan. We actually need economic independence. But who needs it, and to what degree? You cannot understand what the market is by analyzing other people's mistakes. It is necessary to feel the market with your own hands, to experience it, because most administrators have become accustomed to thinking and doing something "from this point to that point," knowing that the plant administration will be able to correct any distortion or bad decision. But it is necessary for each of them to be not only an efficient executor, but also an intelligent conveyor of market ideology. Putting it more succinctly, we have created a number of daughter enterprises. We have written out their functional duties. We attempted to provide for many things. But the spontaneous situation in the market proved to be stronger than our good intentions. The old psychology is like residual magnetism. For that reason many of the subdivision administrators felt that the market relations are built only on buying and selling. Apparently their head was spinning from the complete liberalization of prices, by the fact that today no one from the top is requiring detailed reports, that everyone is his own boss, and that you can turn any way you want to. For a long time it was necessary to explain things and even to spoil the relations with certain "market experts." It is necessary to engage not in speculation, but in the organizing of labor, in trade, and to learn how to live in the new economic situation. Management is not the primitive buying and selling of output. It is possible to be victorious over your rival in the market not by asking a high price, but, on the contrary, by asking a lower one. But in order to do this it is necessary to construction all your work in a new way. I will say honestly that we have not yet become completely successful in breaking the market primitivism, or that peculiar kind of self-seeking attitude. Although much has been done in this direction: we have had the training of personnel, familiarity with foreign practice, and we have invited foreign specialists here. Nevertheless we have not yet succeeded in bringing to a conclusion everything that was planned. But since 1 April all the production subdivisions that are linked with the production of metal have been united into the lead plant on the basis of cost accountability. [Kormiltsev] The daughter enterprises have forced you to take a different look at the process of managing the combine. Currently there have been many discussions about the functions of the plant administration, and about renewing them. What is the significance of this? [Starikov] We are opposed to a simplified understanding of the sale of output. The combine is not a flea market where the main slogan is "buying and selling" at any cost. We are in favor of a civilized market that saturates society with the output that it needs. And it is necessary to predict the market. For five years ahead or even more. We are required to know what is awaiting us tomorrow. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a marketing service. A combine is a cumbersome thing. It is difficult to rock it. But it is also difficult to stop it. The forces of inertia can drag you down a blind alley. That is why the work with personnel occupies absolutely the first place with us. Previously we relied on professionalism. We wanted the steelmaker to be able to pour the steel better, more effectively, and the roller to obtain the necessary rolled shape, etc. Now the emphasis is on market knowledge. It is becoming a vital necessity to consider the expenditures. Otherwise you will be burnt to a crisp. Previously the financial service lived its own life, a paper life that was comprehensible to only a few people. But now the financiers are becoming the leading specialists. That is what the analysts must also be. And it is our duty to organize the work of that service properly. And what about credit? To tell the truth, prior to the reform we had a rather confused idea about credit. Why was that? The party and the government make the decision, say, to build a converter shop at Magnitka. The funds are allocated, the people are sent out, and the contractors are designated. Today it's different. You decide for yourself who you are going to call, and to whom you are going to entrust the important project. You yourself think what this will produce -- not only from the production point of view, but also from the social and ecological points of view. There is an entire range of questions here, and each one requires careful study. And questions of ownership? There continue to be unabated disputes about the methods, means, and alternatives of privatization. Some people assert that the managerial upper layer is attempting quietly to grab as much as they can for themselves, and to get rich at the expense of ordinary laborers. Others feel that it is not worthwhile to hurry to buy shares... It is obvious, however, that there has arrived for us a very important period that previously was completely unknown to us --it will be necessary for us to learn how to work with securities, to penetrate more deeply into the wisdom of leasing, trade, and cooperation with foreign companies. In each such area it will be necessary to define one's position, and take a cautious approach in planning a program of actions. Because once the market has been declared to be state policy, it is necessary to take a professional, state attitude toward it. [Kormiltsev] Let's return to the real-life situation today. Almost all the problems that you listed are linked with the remodeling of the combine. Without that remodeling the production of quality metal will not occur, and without metal there will not be any decent wages, no social blessings, no clean sky over Magnitka. The market is merciless competition. Essentially speaking, the state has eliminated itself from the leadership of the economy, and there will not be any sponsorship of enterprises, such as we used to have. How, then, do you plan to carry out the remodeling? [Starikov] It is difficult to give any unambiguous answer. I shall express my own point of view. The restructuring of production in such a cumbersome thing as our combine requires a tremendous amount of funds. Not a single enterprise of this kind is capable of earning those funds independently. We shall not speak about the historical debts that Magnitka has a right to expect from the country, because Magnitka continues to "run itself ragged." Let's see how similar problems are resolved in the civilized countries. The state there does not eliminate itself from large-scale production. It is a subject of the market, its regulator. If it is necessary to erect, for example, a one-of-a-kind mill or shop, that question is resolved frequently not even at the level of that state, but at the level of the European government. But we suffer from an old disease: we rush from one extreme to another. After rejecting total control of the economic sphere, our state moved completely away from production. The enterprises got unlimited freedom, and the economy remained all alone with its own problems. We traditionally consider ourselves to be monopolists in our branch. But things are very, very difficult even for us. I feel that only the state can introduce order in the rampant price anarchy. Only the state can and must regulate the interrelationships between the producers and the consumers. No, I do not want to beg in a veiled manner to have the state give us credit. I know that the Kremlin's treasury has been empty for a long time. But the state can and must give a bank a guarantee to cover the credit, because we are talking about the restructuring of a base branch. [Kormiltsev] Was the recent visit by a governmental delegation headed by Oleg Soskovets reassuring in this regard? [Starikov] I shall state outright that we attach fundamental importance to that visit. We have prepared a program for the development of the combine until the year 2000. There are two directions in this strategy: the change in the technology of production for producing only output that is capable of meeting the competition, and, at the expense of that, diversification, the creation of a machine-building complex and a construction industry, and the further development of the production of consumer goods. Understandably, these ideas require colossal funds. Of course, we are earning some of them, by creating joint-stock companies, and also at the expense of improving the administration of production, the creation of more rigid demands placed on the executors, the introduction of all kinds of innovations, etc., in a word, by the expense of reducing all the expenditures. But we are also counting on state support. And on the attracting of foreign investments. The governmental delegation visited very important projects in the combine that are ready for activation. It was convinced that we had undertaken a big task. The important guests saw with their own eyes the condition to which the flagship in heavy industry has been brought. Even the small balance-sheet profit that was received last year was used not to develop the enterprise, and not to implement the social program, but to patch up holes, to assure elementary survival. It is necessary to be realistic and understand that if, in the near future, we do not build at the combine cold-rolling and hot-rolling mills No. 2000, if we do not renew all of production, we will not be able to withstand the competition with the West. And then, alongside of the Snickers and Mars Bars, metal from Europe will come to Russia's domestic market. The state has allocated to us 11 billion rubles to complete hot-rolling mill No. 2000. We have been promised assistance in shifting the deadlines for paying part of our taxes and a reduction in the customs duties on the bringing in of imported equipment... In a word, the appropriate document concerning our metallurgical combine is being prepared in Moscow. Of course this is gratifying. But the same problems of nonpayments, remodeling, and excessive taxes also confront the metallurgists of Chelyabinsk, Zlatoust, and Asha, and the miners and machine-builders. Consequently, it is necessary to resolve them in a state manner, rather than on an individual basis, with everyone taking his own chances of being successful. [Kormiltsev] You have mentioned Western investments. Much has already been said about this in the press. Somehow it looks as though the West is in no hurry to pull Russia out of its economic blind alley. [Starikov] Once again, everything is not so simple. I feel that at the conference that, to state it outright, was very important for us and that was organized at our combine by the Moscow delegation, there were also shifts in this direction. Foreign companies have their own well worked-out methods for investing capital. Some of them are in no hurry to invest their funds not only because the political situation in our country still seems to them to be insufficiently stable, but also because they need clear-cut guarantees that have been well known for a long time in the West. For example, it is necessary to give 25 percent of the shares to foreign investors. Naturally, our economic managers immediately begin to think deeply about this. There appears the fear that if foreign businessmen receive the controlling block of shares, domestic industry will be threatened by complete failure, all the social and ecological programs will be discontinued, etc. But take, for example, the Tulachermet joint-stock company. They have already sold a rather large number of shares in their daughter enterprises to foreign investors, and the people at the plant only won from this. Incidentally, recently the president of a certain major international company, speaking on behalf of an authoritative foreign expert commission that had been studying the combine's work, made a proposal concerning the sale to the company of a block of our shares. I shall state outright that that was not particularly to the liking of all of my associates. But I think that it is time for us to make bolder use of the foreign experience of privatizing major companies and enterprises. If there are investments, the renovation will occur more rapidly. Because, thank God, the metallurgists at Magnitka have always known how to work.
