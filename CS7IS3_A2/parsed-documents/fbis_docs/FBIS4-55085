In his interview for Radio Skopje, Ristic said "Zhirinovskiy's behavior is quite interesting, some even say extreme. As he is visiting Yugoslavia at the moment, we invited him as an ordinary citizen, to get directly acquainted with his philosophy and views on the Balkan region. But, I believe chances are he will not be able to come, as the Bolsheviks in Belgrade, and I do not think these Bolsheviks in Macedonia are any better, have deprived him of the right to publicly appear in Belgrade." Radio Skopje unofficially informs that the Macedonian authorities are not inclined to grant Zhirinovskiy entry and stay in the country. The A1 television finds out Zhirinovskiy had planned to arrive in Macedonia at the Skopje airport. The airport authorities were allegedly ordered not to allow Zhirinovskiy to set foot on Macedonia territory. A1 reports that the air companies have also brought a decision not to allow Zhirinovskiy to board any of their planes flying on international routes.
