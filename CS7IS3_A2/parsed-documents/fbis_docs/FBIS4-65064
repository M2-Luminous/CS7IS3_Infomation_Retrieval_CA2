The foreign and defense ministers of both sides want to adopt the relevant documents in Luxembourg on Monday [9 May]. "In this way, we have come far closer to the objective of a pan-European peace policy," FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stated in his speech, which was publicized in advance. Meanwhile, Russia shows understanding for the extension of the WEU to East Europe, he said. The new associated status is granted to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and the three Baltic states. Thus, the associated partners will be able to attend WEU Council meetings at regular intervals in the future. Moreover, they get the opportunity to participate in humanitarian and combat missions. The East Europeans will not get a security guarantee. FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed in Luxembourg that Germany will do everything to create "legal and real prerequisites" for future WEU missions. This also includes the rescue of European Union citizens from places such as Yemen or Rwanda. Kinkel announced that Bonn is basically prepared to participate in the development of satellite-assisted reconnaissance of the WEU states. However, the FRG Government has not yet made a final decision. Without such reconnaissance, which the United States ensures in NATO, the combating of crises by the WEU is hardly conceivable. The costs will probably be substantial, he said. [passage omitted]
