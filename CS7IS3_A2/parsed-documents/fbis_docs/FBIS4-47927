In a report on UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, Butrus-Ghali says, however, other reductions before October elections are not convenient. In its last resolution on Mozambique, the Security Council requested the UN secretary general to present proposals for the gradual withdrawal of the soldiers. About 800 Italian soldiers who were stationed in the Beira Corridor left Mozambique in April, and about 200 others are still in the country.
