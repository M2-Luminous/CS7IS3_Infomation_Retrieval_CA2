The Property Commission dealing with this issue has already initiated proceedings concerning half the compensation claims filed by church authorities. The return of church property is taking place according to the provisions of the law "on the relationship of the state with the Catholic Church." The Property Commission has so far received 2,985 applications for the return of church property. Although the deadline for the receipt of such applications expired on 31 December 1992, fresh applications are still being received by the Commission, but they will not be considered. By the end of 1993, the Commission had initiated proceedings on 1,560 claims, over 50 percent of the total received. Some 684 claims have been settled, 573 of them in favor of the church, in other words in favor of a parish, diocese, monastery, or church foundation. But the size of the property regained by the church is often less than the amount claimed by it. Until now, the church authorities have regained 16,000 hectares of farmland and forest land. After the war, the church lost about 130,000 hectares of land out of the 180,000 it held at the time, and that does not include prewar territory east of the Bug River, nor parts of Poland that formerly belonged to Germany. Of its so-called built-up property, the church has regained slightly less than 200 hectares, the largest of which are the monastery in Henrykow and the church estate in Frombork. Even though the law allows the payment of compensation for lost land out of the state treasury, not once has the Property Commission applied this solution. That does not mean that the church has not received any money. In some cases, instead of the actual property, church authorities received a financial settlement from a local government body or other corporate user of the property in question. Such settlements total 2 billion zlotys so far. Some 111 church claims for compensation have been rejected or postponed, mainly in cases where the return of church property would have been in breach with the law. Boguslaw Skreta and Dr. Jan Chmiel of the Property Commission have assured me that in reaching a decision the Commission takes care that neither the interests of the church nor those of the state are jeopardized. The Property Commission was set up in 1989. It consists of 12 members, six on the government side and six on the church side. Four members constitute the so-called adjudicating body, which decides on the outcome of a case by means of a vote. The Commission's meetings take the form of a court hearing, at which each side presents documentary evidence and employs legal arguments. The Commission tries to reach an amicable settlement. It may restore the original property to the church, or it can offer the church an alternative property. There is no appeal against the Commission's rulings.
