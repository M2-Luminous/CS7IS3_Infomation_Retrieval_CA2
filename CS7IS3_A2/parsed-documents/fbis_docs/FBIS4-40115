Skachenko begins his report by saying that the main battle is being waged in the press, where the current president, Leonid Kravchuk, is leading. Polls have revealed that there are three main contenders to the post--Leonid Kravchuk, Leonid Kuchma, and Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the Socialist Party and parliamentary speaker. Skachenko asks Kuchma the following question: Support given to you by western and eastern regions is totally different. Are you not afraid that your election to the post of the president will only increase confrontation between western and eastern regions of the country? Kuchma replies: "I do not want to think about it because I think that in any situation, especially in a situation as crucial as this, we need to look for things to unite us. The economy and, naturally, the construction of a sovereign, independent, and democratic state ought to become our uniting factors. I am deeply convinced that only then will Ukraine be able to hope that life will be better, as they say, tomorrow. The economy will put everything in its place and this confrontation will exist no more." Skachenko then says that Leonid Kuchma became head of the coalition government in October 1992 as a result of yet another political crisis. His team tried to implement market reforms and unsuccessfully fought against corruption. Market reforms died down by the spring of 1992 because of constant disagreements between the government and parliament. Opponents accused Kuchma of being too fond of Russia, of lacking strong will power and a united team. Kuchma resigned in the autumn of 1993 but did not lose his popularity. He is especially popular with the Russian-speaking population in southern and eastern parts of Ukraine. Asked about the possibility of Ukraine joining a new union with Russia, Kuchma says: "I do not know. But you know I am not used to being a slave. I am used to being a master and I want to be a master in my country, without anyone above me. I am really not used to it."
