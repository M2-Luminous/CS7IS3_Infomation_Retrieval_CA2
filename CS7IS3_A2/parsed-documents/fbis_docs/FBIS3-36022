He blamed that on "the improper editing of the program, as a result of which his phrases were taken out of context, and that distorted their meaning." Despite that, Poltoranin brought apologies to "all who could have been affected by his words. According to a spokesman for the faction, Poltoranin had to give explanations on a demand from a number of faction officials because of the public response to one of his statements. He declared on television several days ago: "Here in Russia, newspapers have always written in Russian. Today, in all this bacchanalia a new language of the press is being spread. I call it "camp Ivrit," an explosive mixture of russophobia, hatred for traditions, lies, and contempt for human dignity. If that flow goes further, we will simply blow up the nation and cause a huge tide of anti-semitism." In the words of a popular Russian TV commentator, the reaction of the public and press has been prompt and unequivocal: Poltoranin's remark on "camp Ivrit" smacks disgustingly of anti-semitism. At the end of the session, the leadership of the "Russia's Choice" faction asked its members to be as tactful as possible in their statements and always think before they say anything, especially on ethnic matters.
