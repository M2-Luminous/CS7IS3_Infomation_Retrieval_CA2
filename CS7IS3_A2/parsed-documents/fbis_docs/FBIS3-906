"I want to go home now. It is not fair to continue to keep me here (in Nigeria) and prevent me from participating in the peace process," the Nigerian press quoted Johnson Tuesday [15 March] as saying. Johnson was leader of the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL), a breakaway faction of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). [passage omitted] "Charles Taylor who shed uncountable blood is now participating in the peace process. What of me who wanted peace all along and supported the cause of peace," Johnson was quoted Tuesday as saying. He said that he did not seek asylum in Nigeria before he was brought in December 1992. "Nigeria plotted my coming here. They have been taking good care of me and my family," he said, adding: "If I am to think of the good things the government makes sure I enjoy, I may not bother to go home." "But the point is this: Where is my future? What of my teeming supporters in Liberia, in Europe, in America and elsewhere in the world"? he asked. Johnson said he has written to the Nigerian military leader, Gen. Sani Abacha and the ECOWAS chairman, President Nicephore Soglo of Benin Republic on his fate. [passage omitted]
