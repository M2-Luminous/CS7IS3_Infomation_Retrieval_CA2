Linkevicius met with representatives of the parliamentary opposition. Referring to practical endeavors which may be accomplished prior to the adoption of a military doctrine and national security concept, L. Linkevicius stressed that it is necessary to begin to actually control the borders and airspace of Lithuania. The minister said: "We should make our contribution to the system of collective security because so far we have to a certain degree been dependents." He did not reject the likelihood of military formations from Lithuania taking part in a UN peacekeeping mission, or the need for young men in service with the army to not only take weapons and drill training but to also study the English language. Outlining his view of the reorganization of the DSOK [National Volunteer Defense Service], L. Linkevicius said that the reorganization does not amount to elimination of the DSOK, and that under the current conditions this structure could perform the functions of a volunteer national guard and assume responsibility for territorial defense and security for important state facilities. In the opinion of L. Linkevicius, from now on only those who have been in active military service, have been recommended by their commanders, and have impeccable biographies should be volunteers. Seimas member P. Tupikas asked whether L. Linkevicius feels morally responsible for the fact that the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party, while in opposition, hampered A. Butkevicius in creating a system of national defense, compromised it in every way possible, and papers were endlessly slipped to A. Brazauskas in the Supreme Council. L. Linkevicius answered that he did not engage in these affairs. Seimas member A. Patackas said that "volunteers are being separated from their weapons," which only staff employees will be trusted with keeping. Such employees are few; for this reason, at many locations weapons are kept solely at command posts. In the words of A. Patackas, in this situation the main principle is violated: "A volunteer should always have his weapon handy." A. Patackas expressed concern in conjunction with the fact that a structural reorganization is also being planned after the certification of volunteers in the course of which, according to his information, they rejected the services of at least one-third of the volunteers. The member of Seimas called on the minister to remember that volunteers are a patriotic force, too; in turn, the minister observed that patriotism is not a profession, and genuine patriots cannot compromise the DSOK. Minister of National Defense L. Linkevicius said that weapons should be stored strictly in keeping with the rules. The argument that the volunteers might need armaments at any moment in order to repulse enemy attacks did not convince him. L. Linkevicius said: "We do not have this kind of situation now," and repeated yet again that weapons are not toys. The minister rejected rebukes that he did not demand allocation of more funds from the 1994 budget for the system of national defense. The minister of defense said: "Being a member of the government, I cannot fail to think about education and health care, too." In the words of L. Linkevicius, there will be sufficient funds for military training; however, it may become necessary to reduce the army.
