After listening to a lecture by Wuhan University Professor Chen Shuxiang, the core theory study group members -- including Guan Guangfu [secretary of the provincial party committee], Jia Zhijie [governor], Hui Liangyu, Qian Yunlu, Ding Fengying, Li Daqiang, Wang Zhongnong, Deng Guozheng, and Huang Yuanzhi -- glowingly expressed views on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's market economy theories in light of the province's realities. They acknowledged the importance and urgency of studying socialist market economy theories and deemed the building of a socialist market economy structure, ideological emancipation, and the continued development of productive forces as a great and innovative experiment in China, as well as a new topic in the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The core theory study group maintained that given the fact that most cadres are still unfamiliar with the new situations and new tasks, it is all the more necessary to conscientiously study socialist market economy theories. The socialist market economy is part and parcel of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In order to grasp socialist market economy theories, it is imperative to comprehensively and systematically study the relevant expositions contained in Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; clearly understand the spirit and essence of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions; and make painstaking efforts to study and comprehend the "Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee" in order to accurately grasp the guiding ideology, basic principles, and specific steps of the on-going reform. The core theory study group stressed that the key to building a socialist market economy structure lies in placing resources under both market regulation and state macroeconomic regulation and control. In building a socialist market economy, it is imperative to abide by the law of value, adapt to changes in supply-demand relations, and provide more efficient sectors with more resources by virtue of the lever of prices and through a competition mechanism. The core theory study group noted: We often are confronted with the following scenario: Once control is lifted, economic operation becomes chaotic, and once regulated, economic operation becomes stifled. This is because there has been no sound market mechanism in the province. In the process of economic regulation and control, we have been unable to clearly define macroeconomic regulation and control, intermediate economic regulation and control, and microeconomic regulation and control. This is why we are still unable to employ various economic regulation and control measures in a coordinated fashion. In addition, the country has yet to build a unified big market. Under such circumstances, we should correctly handle in practice the relations between stronger macroeconomic regulation and control, on the one hand, and stronger market mechanism, on the other; make flexible use of economic signals sent by the market; and waste no time in coordinating production and consumption. The core theory study group asserted that in building a socialist market economy structure, it is necessary to conscientiously study and boldly draw upon successful market economy experiences from all countries in the world. Operationally, a socialist market economy is identical to a capitalist market economy. Thus we should boldly draw upon and master successful market economic experiences and measures from all countries in the world, as long as such experiences and measures are in conformity with the law of modern production. A market economy should not be built in total disregard of a country's basic historical and social conditions. We should try to digest and transform the successful market economy experiences of developed countries in order to make them serve socialism and help create and develop both a new economic operational mechanism with Chinese characteristics, and a socialist market economy structure. The core theory study group stated that in developing a socialist market economy, we should build two civilizations simultaneously. This is at once a basic point repeatedly stressed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and a line of demarcation between socialism and capitalism. With regard to building two civilizations, party and government leaders at all levels across the province should strengthen confidence, make unswerving and persistent efforts, and develop a strong sense of responsibility. We should take overall interests into account, concentrate on key aspects of work, realize spiritual civilization in each and every domain, successfully sum up and invent new forms of spiritual civilization welcomed by the broad masses of people, build better systems and promulgate better rules and regulations for spiritual civilization, and strive to raise the standard and quality of spiritual civilization. Before the meeting, the core theory study group members had already studied the relevant socialist market economy theories on their own. In accordance with a theory study plan, since the second quarter of this year the core theory study group members have started studying by themselves each and every relevant article carried in Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, as well as the "Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee."
