Now it has transpired that the president promised Major General Aleksandr Vinidiktov, chief of the Space Equipment Test and Operation Center, that he will make available 4 trillion rubles over the next 10 years to convert the former strategic missile base into a cosmodrome. Until recently there were 60 launch silos at the base. Now the majority have been dismantled. Only five silos remain mothballed. But even this number is more than is required to launch small satellites: Only relatively small spacecraft can be launched from the silos. It was decided to keep only two of them. From 1996 satellites weighing up to 1.5 tonnes will be put into orbit from the territory of Amur Oblast with Rokot rockets. The whole project for building the new cosmodrome will call for substantial financial and manpower resources. Some 10,000 people will be engaged in building various cosmodrome installations.
