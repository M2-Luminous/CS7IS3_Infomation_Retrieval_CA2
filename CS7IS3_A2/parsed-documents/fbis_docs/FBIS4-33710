Shortly after the approval of the law, Senate President Humberto Lucena and Deputy Fabio Feldmann -- who was the rapporteur of the bill in the Chamber of Deputies -- came to Planalto Palace to meet with President Itamar Franco and with the justice and finance ministers. The meeting has not yet concluded. Because the new law establishes that directors and members of the board of the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) must be appointed by the president of the Republic and confirmed by a majority vote of the national Congress, President Franco may issue tonight a provisional measure confirming incumbent CADE officials so that they may start implementing the new law tomorrow. In case of price abuses, the law provides for fines of up to 30 percent of the gross annual sales of large enterprises and preventive imprisonment for their directors and owners. A large enterprise is a group that controls 30 percent of the market.
