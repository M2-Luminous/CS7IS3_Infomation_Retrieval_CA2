As learned, in 1993 the province's revenues topped 10 billion yuan, an increase of 3.37 billion yuan over the previous year, which is 36.4 percent. At a provincial financial work meeting yesterday, Governor Chen Bangzhu and Vice Governor Chu Bo fully confirmed their achievements. Early last year, influenced by stock and real estate fever, there were serious outflows of funds from the province to other provinces. Apart from this, other factors also restricted the province's revenues. During the first five months, the province registered a fall in its revenue. To tackle this problem, governments and financial departments at all levels throughout the province assigned pertinent financial task to the grass-roots level. To strengthen tax collection and management, beginning in the second half of last year, financial and taxation departments in the province began to stop provisional tax exemptions. In the course of carrying out a general taxation, financial, and price inspections, funds in violation of discipline totaling 580 million yuan were discovered. In the course of strengthening tax collection and management, financial and taxation departments in the province also vigorously carried out an improvement of financial resources. Last year the number of counties and cities topping 100 million yuan in revenues increased from the previous five to 14, and the number of townships and towns which topped 10 million yuan in revenue increased from eight in the previous year to 33.
