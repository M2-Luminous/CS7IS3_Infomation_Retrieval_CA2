A Change of Power in the Supreme Council--the Socialist Oleksandr Moroz Has Been Elected Chairman. UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Predicts: Out of Seven Candidates for the Post of President of Ukraine, the Democrat-Centrist Ivan Plyushch Will Win"] [Text] We might say that the election of a new chairman of the Supreme Council has become the first stage of the logical completion of a well-known and extremely important decision of the old membership of parliament, namely: 1) to hold an early election of people's deputies; 2) to hold an early election of the president of Ukraine. So the first point has been "carried out," and thank God, quite successfully. For anyone who thinks normally "early elections" mean a radical change in the personalities in power both in the parliament and in presidential structures, which have shown their inability to govern the state and ensure at the very least the regular physiological existence for their nation. The membership of the parliament has been changed perceptibly. A new chairman also appeared promptly. By now, Ukraine has been driven into the ground. At present, Ukraine is bankrupt. I had heard this before, but prior to the publication of this article, I decided to ascertain this with my own eyes. My good friend Volodymyr Nykonenko, chairman of the Druzhba kolkhoz, who is boundlessly devoted to the land and the people who work it, succeeded in "shaking loose" 800 million karbovantsy to finish the construction of gas mains in the villages of his farm. The poor Nykonenko has been working on that gas for many years. He suddenly called me and asked me to find out when the money had "gone" to Poltava, to the oblast agricultural administration (incidentally, his kolkhoz in this oblast, in Chernukhinskiy Rayon, subscribes to 10 copies of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA--therefore, it is a collective activist of our Subscriber Club). I went to the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs of Ukraine. I found the Administration for Investment Management, and their executives told me: "You are going to wait for a long time. The quota assigned for capital construction in Poltava Oblast is 106 billion karbovantsy, whereas only 2 percent has been received by the oblast. That is it! The Ministry of Finance does not have the money." "When will they remit the rest?" "We do not know. At any rate, not soon." "Are they withholding it solely from Poltava Oblast?" ""All oblasts are in this condition. In total, rural areas are supposed to receive 5.8 trillion karbovantsy for capital construction. The Ministry of Finance has allocated 2.8 percent." "That is it?" "Besides, the shortfall for last year is 1 trillion." I was indignant: "This is how the Ministry of Finance operates--Pyatachenko is hoarding it." "For a long time now, he has not had things to hoard. There are no withholdings for the budget. There are no sources of revenue. Production is at a standstill. Ukraine is bankrupt." I had heard the terrible official word. Ukraine is bankrupt! Later, I met Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko in the Supreme Council and told him this. He silently threw up his hands. "Write down your considerations about everything as it is, Hryhoriy Oleksandrovych. Let us raise the alarm. Let us tell the people the truth about who has driven Ukraine into the ground." "I will try to write this, but not now--in a couple of weeks." I did not ask him again, because I understood that he would have no time two weeks later, either. In today's issue of our newspaper, we print an article by Volodymyr Chernyak--a diagnosis of disease or perhaps.... No, I will not write the word "death." Ukraine is bankrupt, but it is alive. It should be rescued immediately. We should look for those who can do it--soon, as soon as possible! One change of power, in the Supreme Council, has already occurred. I believe that Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch acted wisely in refusing to take part in the election of the new chairman of the Supreme Council. I will repeat that the revolutionary decision on early elections is not a doorbell but an entire gong, telling all the current "leaders" that they should vacate their long-held seats of power for other "leaders" and deputies. UKRAYINSKA HAZETA has already written this, but I will repeat again that more reasonable and sober figures have come together in the current parliament. It is true. The new chairman was elected on Thursday, 18 May, in the first round. Oleksandr Moroz, a well-known and quite active modern politician, the chief of the political council of the Socialist Party, became chairman (perhaps out of fear, HOLOS UKRAYINY immediately used "political council" with the capital letters, as was once the case with the Politburo. To be sure, there was a basis for that, because in his speech, Mr. Moroz frightened the newspaper-organ of the Supreme Council, stating, to my mind incorrectly, that HOLOS UKRAYINY should offer information about the positions of the deputies rather than give the thoughts of a journalist concerning the position of a deputy. This was a great mistake by the chairman, because if a newspaper does not evaluate the positions of deputies and the chairman, it will be bathroom tissue rather than a newspaper). This is why I was doubly concerned when Mr. Moroz was elected chairman: I did not like his communist-censorship leanings; second, more than his "socialist affiliation," I was worried about the people milling around him and surrounding him because, now his most authoritative comrades in arms and like-minded people will want to receive leadership portfolios from him. God forbid, Mr. Chairman may yield to the pressure of "the kin and relations" without distinction. This is generally dangerous in politics. It is good if the contenders have a place for God in their hearts--for Love for our poor people, who have suffered in the darkness of communism, and will intelligently search for ways other than the well-known way of Lenin. Even now my hands tremble at the very thought that we might be governed by, say, these two so-called Ukrainians, one of whom, with the last name ending in "enko," courageously demonstrates his disregard for the native tongue of our people and for their statehood. Terror overcomes us also because many people from among the new deputies, apparently highly educated and intelligent people, deliberately and impudently "speak only the foreign language" [the phrase in quotation marks is given in Russian in the original]. Indeed, Russian is a foreign language in Ukraine because it is not the state language. This is why it is considered foreign, just as French, Polish, German, or English are. I mean the official language in state institutions, to say nothing of the chamber of the Supreme Council. To be sure, I have some expectations that the new chairman, who, incidentally, knows Ukrainian and has a "B-plus" command of it, will tactfully and unceremoniously force each deputy to respect the Language Law (anti-Ukrainian figures specifically have to be forced). For its part, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA will provide lessons in the state language with assistance from the language commentator Oleksandr Ponomariv, a professor of the imeni Taras Shevchenko Kiev University and one of the best experts on the Ukrainian language; the newspaper will also name the names of those who spit upon this language in the supreme premises of power. So it would be greatly disturbing if the closest comrade in arms of the new chairman, the October Socialist Mr. Marchenko (a Ukrainian in form, an alien in content) "ends up among the engineers on the steam locomotive" [the phrase in quotation marks given in Russian in the original], which is pulling Ukraine to the "station" [the phrase in quotation marks given in Russian in the original] of Independence. We are only afraid about this station turning out to be the "commune-station." [the phrase in quotation marks given in Russian in the original], or that the former people's deputy Mr. Kotsyuba (in the past, a comrade in arms of the Rukh people and now one of the leaders of the Communist Party of Ukraine) can claim a "supreme post." He can say: "Oleksandr Oleksandrovych, we, the Communists, have pushed you through to become chairman; give me the portfolio of a minister or deputy minister, or say an ambassador to Europe, to Paris!" The gentleman Communist Marmazov does not bring us spiritual peace and joy. So far, the behavior of Petro Symonenko (number one in the Communist Party of Ukraine) has been changing the previous negative attitude toward him because it turns out that he has a good and easy command of the state language (meanwhile, the notion was advertised that the "leader" recognizes only Russian); nor is he an enemy of privatization, of precisely the kind that does not rob the people; he is also in favor of a market economy; he is supposedly altogether not in favor of the former USSR (a few days ago, he stated in the press in a quite human manner that "we are in favor of a Union of states with equal rights, although we understand that this is a protracted process, too"). It is possible that Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz will not act as, for example, Mr. Shcherbytskyy in his time; the latter is no longer known to young people but is greatly respected by our current president of Ukraine as a "prominent politician" [the phrase in quotation marks given in Russian in the original] (see and read the so-called sensational interview on 21 May in KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI)--he dragged along to Kiev his "great" fellow natives from his Dnepropetrovsk. Why do I say "possible" with regard to Mr. Moroz? Because on the first day of his reign he showed himself not to be stubborn and, as he stated in his "throne" speech, truly capable of looking for ways to consolidate various forces rather than fanning the flames of confrontation and sicking some people on others. The issue of electing the first deputy of the chairman of the Supreme Council became the first test of his wisdom. Mr. Moroz and apparently the forces that stood behind him proposed Chairman of the Peasant Party Oleksandr Tkachenko as candidate. He is an undisguised Communist, just as the staunch prominent poet of Ukraine Borys Oliynyk. Naturally, Tkachenko has contributed greatly to the victory of Oleksandr Moroz. In general, Oleksandr Tkachenko, 54, is an uncomplicated person (he is undoubtedly a committed and wholehearted Ukrainian) and a somewhat tragic one (he was minister of agriculture and deputy prime minister; at the same time, certain highly placed persons in power used him--they tossed him, as a camouflage outfit, to be a candidate for the post of president of Ukraine in order to attract votes away from Rukh and Republican candidates, and later forced him to pull out for the benefit of another "party comrade"; however, this ended up in his dismissal from his job altogether, and for a period of time he looked for a vacant position on his own). Now he is a figure of some consequence among the agrarians. So the rightist forces in the parliament (there are fewer of them than there are Communists) lodged a resolute protest against Mr. Tkachenko. This was right. The chairman is a Socialist, and his right-hand man would have also been from the legions of the left. This turns out to be somewhat disproportionate. The meeting of the Supreme Council was frustrated, and the chairman went on to further consider the situation with the factions and parties. Naturally, only the deputies know this "nitty-gritty" better. I called our political commentator and co-chairman of the Statehood faction, Academician Ihor Yukhnovskyy, to find out whether power had been ultimately transferred to Socialist-Communists and if we could announce "a silent Communist coup." The good friend of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA told us: "Do not worry. Ukraine will continue to be reborn as an independent, self-reliant, democratic state." "So has Moroz not been stubborn? Is he keeping his word about consolidation?" "We will see." "Whose candidacy have they settled on now?" "Perhaps it will be Yuriy Ivanovych Kostenko. However, let us survive till Tuesday." Our conversation took place on Friday, 20 May. We survived until Tuesday. Oleksandr Tkachenko, the leader of the Peasant Party, was elected first deputy chairman, and Oleh Dyomin, a nonparty member, was elected deputy. They were members of an alternative pair, which got the greatest number of votes from among those proposed by all factions of the Supreme Council. It was as a result of the victory of these candidates that a stormy, even hostile debate was held last Wednesday. The rightist forces justifiably attacked the leftists, and the latter justifiably accused the rightists. The chairman spoke to make a comment. Who was right? Both. Understandably, squabbles in the parliament will, unfortunately, continue until all leaders understand that now we should fight for the immediate resolution of the most acute economic problems rather than for political victories. Ukraine is in danger now. It is being pushed toward this at the last moment by imperial forces, in particular those of Russia. UKRAYINSKA HAZETA will discuss Oleksandr Tkachenko and Oleh Dyomin separately. Who is who? Oleksandr Moroz has just turned 50. This is a golden age for a politician. He was born in the village of Buda, Tarashchanskiy Rayon, Kiev Oblast. He grew up in a family with many children. Moroz received a higher education at the Ukrainian Agricultural Academy. He is a mechanical engineer. Moroz also graduated from the Higher Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. He worked in his profession for 12 years. Later, he was on the staff of the Kiev Oblast Committee of the party. He has been a people's deputy since 18 March 1990. Moroz was elected and reelected in the Tarashchanskiy Election District. He is married and has two daughters and four grandchildren. According to my observations, none other than Ivan Plyushch discovered him as a politician, or more precisely, promoted him in the Supreme Soviet, while at the same time breaking through to the supreme level of power himself. Actually, previously they had worked in the same Kiev Oblast and in the same area, that of agriculture, as leaders: Ivan Plyushch as chairman of the oblast executive committee, and Oleksandr Moroz as chief of the agrarian department of the oblast committee of the party. In the past, both were Communists, leaders of the Communist Party. The spirit of these times of building the "bright future" [the phrase in quotation marks given in Russian in the original] has faded. At present, based on their words and deeds, both wish to build an independent Ukraine, the Ukrainian state. One of them, the younger one, has risen to the top of supreme power in Ukraine. The other, who is three years older, has already been there. It is not feasible to blame him for the mistakes of the Supreme Council, because this was the first parliament that, in its Communist vestments, proclaimed to the entire world the Ukrainian state, which was finally independent of all unions and the "great Soviet family" [the phrase in quotation marks given in Russian in the original]. So the Supreme Council deserved the early election, and, together with it, its chairman during this period of transition, and I would say, an unsteady period in which all of us got a breath of the air of freedom which it appeared would never break through the misanthropic Communist regime (in a matter of speaking, everything was being done for the people, and in reality the people felt like prisoners both in run-of-the mill jobs and in high positions). Both Moroz and Plyushch, as well as all nomenklatura apparatchiks, know full well how they had to be servile rather than serve, fake sincerity, and pretend to be zealots of the great bright ideas. As a personality, one could not come into his own self. Even those who occupied the apex of power (I mean on the scale of Ukraine) were in awe of Moscow, feared dismissal, and spoke the "truth" correctly, as Moscow wanted it. Then what can we say about the practices within the republic? They were as Shevchenko wrote--the large beats up on the small. Everything that happened in the Supreme Council is for the better. For example, I like the fact that Mr. Moroz knows by heart and quotes from Taras Shevchenko. The bad people, the foes, the nonpatriots of Ukraine do not know and do not wish to know our Great Poet. I like the fact that Mr. Moroz wants himself, us, and his grandchildren (I hope, Ukrainians) to live in their independent state. He put it well after his election as chairman: The people should feel themselves free in a free state. However, to this end a truly free state should be built up so that the people will not live as they do now, anxious and alarmed day and night and contemptuous of work, their way of life, and their highly placed bosses. Could our past and present leaders be loved and respected, given that they have brought the Ukrainian people to the point where-- 78 percent of the people are below the poverty line; 20 percent of the people barely make ends meet; and only 2 percent live so as not to deny themselves anything? These terrifying facts (this may not exist in any country of the world) were given in his presentation by a new people's deputy of Ukraine, Professor Mykhaylo Pavlovskyy, a candidate for the position of chairman of the Supreme Council (he later withdrew his candidacy). His professional profound discourse about the critical economic position of Ukraine and at the same time realistic proposals for its breaking through toward the light will be published by UKRAYINSKA HAZETA in the next issue. In conjunction with this, we would like to quote the words of the new chairman of the Supreme Council to the effect that "we should urgently engage in forming the government.... We should not be geared toward the election of the president." If these are not words but rather a serious plan of action, there is no need to look far and wide for a real prime minister (rather than an "acting" one, which has suited the president of Ukraine for such a long time). He is Mykhaylo Pavlovskyy, 55. There should be no fears about his belonging to the Ukrainian Republican Party. If he agrees to become a member of the government, he will suspend his party affiliation. This is what Ukraine needs. New, fresh forces are needed, which are competent, reasonable, and businesslike. There are rumors that Vitaliy Masol is "wanted" for prime minister. He is from yesterday. He is a Shcherbytskyy cadre from the times of the Soviet period of stagnation. His command of Ukrainian is poor. Besides, he is retired. In the next issue we will discuss the potential and chances of some of the registered candidates for the post of president of Ukraine. Out of 11 contenders, the four random and minor ones were left out. Those are instructors at two colleges in Kiev--the notorious Larisa Skoryk, and Mykola Rud, who is known only at work and at home, as well as the former people's deputy and engineer from Kharkov Ivan Valenya, and Viktor Pynzenyk (the most intelligent one among them, a quite prominent economist). What did they count on? Do they really not have a feeling that they will become a laughingstock among their acquaintances rather than chiefs of state? Even among the ultimately designated seven, only two stand on really solid ground. Leonid KRAVCHUK. He has already had an opportunity to prove that he was capable of changing the life of the people for the better. He has not changed it. On the contrary, everybody has been getting worse off all the time. It is doubtful that he will win. It is better for him to live gracefully on his own. Leonid KUCHMA. He has already had an opportunity (an even greater one than Leonid Kravchuk) to show that he is capable of bettering the life of the Ukrainian people. On the contrary, he has tried to scare the Ukrainian people that it would get worse if we do not unite with Russia. He could not stand the strain and submitted his resignation. He stood at the helm of the government for 11 months. He now desires a higher seat.... It is not any easier there. Besides, he does not know the Ukrainian language properly, and that language does not enjoy his particular sympathy. Volodymyr LANOVYY. As a deputy prime minister, he has already had an opportunity to prove that he is capable of developing and introducing an effective economic program. However, he talks much and promises a lot. Prior to his coming to politics, his working language in the Institute of Economics was Russian only, and it is now difficult for him to speak Ukrainian. However, his main drawback lies in the fact that by nature he is not an energetic, persistent politician. He represents the type of an experienced scientist who feels best in the reading room among his scientist colleagues. Oleksandr MOROZ. Now he already has the rank of Supreme Council chairman. However, he still remains a candidate for the post of president--for now. It appears to me that Mr. Moroz will withdraw his candidacy, because there are several substantive reasons to do so. First, real politicians do not grasp all to lose all, and do not hold the two highest positions in the country. This is the greater scheme of things. The Socialist Moroz won in a chamber in which more than one-half out of 336 voters were his supporters, whereas in the "chamber" of Ukraine, with millions of voters opposed to the Communist system, he will indisputably fail to get the necessary number of votes at present, despite the successful election of Communists to the Supreme Council. Now is not their time, if there ever will be such. I am certain that Oleksandr Moroz understands this full well and wants to work as chairman more than anything else. He knows what needs to be done. If Plyushch becomes president on top of this, they will move mountains. Valeriy BABYCH. We can only welcome him for his courage in wanting to become president of Ukraine. Without a political image, almost unknown among the peasants, workers, and also the intelligentsia, he, the chief of the Ukrainian Finance Group (few people are really knowledgeable about this organization, either), came to the start line. Evidently, he is merely trying the "princely crown" on for size because he is very young, or else he is on a "diversionary" mission. It is hard for him to speak Ukrainian. I ascertained this during a chance conversation with him at the palace of our president. I have heard that he is a top-notch financier. However, at present Ukraine needs a wise and reasonable politician-president. Petro TALANCHUK. He is the minister of education of Ukraine, 56. As early as in October of last year, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA predicted that he would be one of the real candidates for president of Ukraine. This has been the case. He is a professor, doctor of technical sciences, and president of the Academy of Engineering Sciences. He graduated from the Technical University of Kiev and became the rector of this college. He is a great patriot of Ukraine, a highly cultured individual whose knowledge of science and production is profound. He deserves to become president of Ukraine, but he is not very popular with the people as a politician. We will publish a more detailed story about him in the next issue. Ivan PLYUSHCH. He is 53. Plyushch is widely known and respected by the common people and the intelligentsia. He is energetic, persistent, and principled (he did not support L. Kravchuk's position on the issues of the Black Sea Fleet; he has his own, different view of the economic union and the CIS, believing that economic agreements with individual states are sufficient). This is how some new people's deputies dubbed Plyushch: "He was a firm director of the Supreme Council." Is it good or bad? If we consider that Mr. Plyushch always got the decision he wanted, he is a terrible man. However, if all of the decisions he "pushed through" are aimed solely at protecting the interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, if these decisions make Ukraine strong and its people happy, I would want to advance two new "deputy-style" slogans, but this time on a greater scale: "People, let us elect Ivan Plyushch director of Ukraine!" "Long live Director of Ukraine Ivan Plyushch! He is the one we need now--the second president of the independent Ukrainian state." I have arranged with Ivan Stepanovych to publish in the next issue a article entitled "Ivan Stepanovych Is Never Angry" about such "directorship in Ukraine" and generally about the everyday life of just People's Deputy Ivan Plyushch. I will recall that the election of the president will be held on 26 June. It will definitely be held. It cannot be postponed by any means. Oleksandr Moroz said very correctly from the rostrum of the Supreme Council that political agitation on account of the election of the president of Ukraine cannot be fueled. The rampage of governmental mafia structures is continuing; the undisguised plundering of the people is under way. Elections are needed. A new president is needed. A new government consisting of Ukrainian patriots is needed. One deputy prime minister already intends to resign. No, nobody should be dismissed. Everybody, beginning with the president, the acting prime minister, and deputy ministers, must come to the rostrum of the Supreme Council, report on the operation of the Cabinet of Ministers, and give an account of who has made our people into beggars before the deputies and all honorable people. It is hard to understand why our president simultaneously comes out against the election of the president in his voice while using his hand to write a petition concerning his desire to fight for this position. In submitting himself to a new popular vote, the president should know that the people are happy with his previous reign. In this case, he will be victorious. Meanwhile, in our country 78 percent of the people do not know what they are going to eat tomorrow....
