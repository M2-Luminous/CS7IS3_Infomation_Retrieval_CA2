Commenting on the massacre that took place at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron yesterday morning in which scores of Palestinians were killed, 'Asfur told MENA that an executive mechanism must be worked out for an international presence in the occupied Palestinian territories. He affirmed that the venue of the negotiations, whether it is Washington or any other place, is not a problem. The negotiations that took place in Taba and Cairo went well, particularly during the recent rounds. He noted that good progress was made in the last week of negotiations. The Palestinian delegation was anxious to reach an agreement to implement the self-rule plan as soon as possible. 'Asfur said that the massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque was carried out by a group of inhuman people. It was directed not only against the Palestinian people, but also against Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin personally and the Israeli Government. He said that if Rabin and his government want the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles agreement, they must put a real end not only to the actions of these settlers but to the Israeli settlements and presence in the areas that will come under Palestinian autonomy. 'Asfur affirmed that what happened in Hebron proves that what is needed is not protection for the Israeli settlers but for the Palestinian people, because they are the ones facing danger from the Israeli settlers. He expressed the hope that the Israeli Government will realize this and will adopt tangible measures to reduce, limit, and remove what could hamper the peace process.
