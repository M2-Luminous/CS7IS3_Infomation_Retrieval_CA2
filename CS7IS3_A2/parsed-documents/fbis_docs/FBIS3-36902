He said this at the enlarged meeting of the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers on Wednesday. According to Shevardnadze, Georgia has overcome its political and economic isolation. Namely, it has recently signed a Russian-Georgian treaty and economic agreements. On the way out of the crisis, the Georgian leader pointed out that the economic processes, including the transition to a market economy, must be controlled by the state. Shevardnadze pointed out that this primarily meant control over wages and prices which must be in mutual conformity. Taking into consideration the sharp decrease in the Georgian national currency's (coupons) exchange rate he said that another currency might be introduced in the republic and be in parallel use with Georgian coupons. This currency could be rubles or dollars. However, Shevardnadze emphasized that the coupons must be made competitive to the foreign currency.
