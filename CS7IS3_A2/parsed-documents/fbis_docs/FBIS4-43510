But Prime Minister Berlusconi's visit has also given rise to controversy from the German Left on the presence of neofascist ministers in the Italian Government. Giovanni Masotti, our correspondent, reports from Bonn: [Masotti] Silvio Berlusconi is making his first visit abroad, to Bonn, and the prime minister is again under pressure over the delicate matter of National Alliance ministers in the government. The controversy has been reopened by the German Social Democrats who are in serious difficulty following their defeat in the European elections and by the Greens. The left-wing opposition is asking Chancellor Kohl both to distance himself from Berlusconi and to stop Forza Italia from joining the European People's Party in the European Parliament. The accusation of having opened the door of government to the neofascists is rejected by the prime minister in an interview published today in the Bonn daily newspaper GENERALE ANZEIGER. Berlusconi says that the National Alliance party fully accepts and respects the Italian Constitution and the laws of the democratic state. It has nothing to do with Le Pen or the German extreme right-wing. The first goal that my government has set itself, Berlusconi stresses, is that of realizing and respecting the state of law. A press conference will be held in the afternoon by the prime minister. He will then immediately leave for Rome.
