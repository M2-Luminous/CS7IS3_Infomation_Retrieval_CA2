The purpose of this facility is to cast light on the behavior of radioactive substances in an ecosphere. This facility is one which will carry out simulation experiments on the behavior and circulation characteristics of radioactive substances both on land and in the water, with the goal of grasping, over the mid- to long-term, the impact of radioactive substances on the environment. This facility is to be built in response to strong concerns over the influence of the radioactive substances found on the site of the nuclear fuel system facility on the environment and on humans through contact through things such as the food chain. The Food Chain Will Also Be Studied This research facility will be composed of two facilities, the water-system ecosphere facility and the land-system ecosphere facility. The environmental conditions within the facility can be freely controlled to perform experiments imitating various kinds of environmental conditions. A Bird's-Eye View of the Simulation Facility Because the land system ecosphere facility will study the conditions that would occur if radioactive substances escaped into the environment, the propagation of plant life, the movement of these substances to animals through the food-chain, and their introduction into the water sphere through means such as rainfall, this facility will be built to include: 1. A greenhouse with rainfall equipment; 2. An animal breeding building for the breeding of small animals; and 3. Dwellings to be used as residences by the researchers. Furthermore, because the water system ecosphere will study things such as the food chain from plankton to fish species, it will include features such as: 1. A closed-system pool which imitates ocean surface conditions; and 2. A high pressure water tank that imitates conditions in mid- to deep-water. Moreover, along with intercepting substances either entering from or exiting to the outside environment, both the land and water systems are equipped with circulation support equipment, such as temperature adjustment equipment, equipment to adjust gases such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen, and equipment to control the quality of the water, which allow both ecospheres to maintain their simulated environmental conditions. These facilities have the following special characteristics: 1. Because they can imitate various natural environmental conditions, experiments can be performed under conditions close to those occurring naturally. 2. At the same time, they can imitate conditions in which measurements and experimentation would be difficult in the actual environment. 3. Furthermore, because there is no substance infiltration from, or escape to the outside environment, the course and conditions of the transference and circulation of substances within the facility can be correctly ascertained. 4. Moreover, the mutual influence of living things and the environment can be ascertained through the breeding and cultivation of animals and plants. Interest Is Great, Even Internationally STA has requested Â¥4.6 billion in the FY94 budget for facility and equipment costs, and plans to equip the facility over a five-year plan starting next fiscal year. Construction and operation will be carried out by the Environmental Science and Technology Research Institute (non-profit organization). Other than the facility discussed in this article, this research institute is also promoting the planned "Closed-System Research Facility" studying the influence of radioactive substances on agricultural products and other plants. These facilities will study the impact that radioactive substances have on living organisms and the environment, and because these are epoch-making facilities for environmental and ecological scientific research, they will probably be seen as core research centers for international environmental protection research.
