A general danger alarm has been in force in Doboj and Teslic since 0710. The residents are in shelters. A warning was also sounded at 0900. Doboj, Teslic, and all suburbs are being targeted with mortars and tanks as we report. The shells are hitting Teslic from the direction of Tesanj, and in Doboj from the direction of Matuzici and Gracanica. According to the available data, members of the 110th brigade of the Croatian Defense Council, who have been under the Muslim command of the 7-South Operative Group since the beginning of the war, have joined in the artillery attacks on civilian targets. As we have learned from the military sources of the 1st Krajina Corps, which was also confirmed in the press center, members of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] on the Zepce-Maglaj front have publicly taken sides with the Muslims. Members of a special British company installed, between Maglaj and Zepce, four radar stations for detecting Serbian artillery. The data is then given to the Muslim units. After the blockade of Maglaj and Tesanj was lifted, the so-called peacemakers brought to the Muslim forces in this region a significant amount of arms and ammunition, which are mercilessly used against civilian targets. Members of UNPROFOR have openly taken sides with the Muslims and are engaging in small arms fire from their personnel carriers on the Serb positions and settlements on Mount Ozren, Parnica, Bijela Ploca, and Jablanica, together with the Muslim units. The units of the army of the republic of Srpska have not yet responded to these obvious provocations because it is clear to everyone that an attempt is being made to provoke the Serbs and possibly transfer NATO actions to these parts of the republic of Srpska.
