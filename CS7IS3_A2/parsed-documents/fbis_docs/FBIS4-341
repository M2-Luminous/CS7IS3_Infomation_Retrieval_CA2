FBIS4-341 "drafr068_c_94022" FBIS-AFR-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 8 Apr South African Press Review for 8 Apr MB0804130094 MB0804130094 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR New Police Union Members Threaten Strike -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 8 April in a page-10 editorial comments on the threatened strike by members of the newly formed South African Police Union (SAPU), saying the primary grievance fuelling discontent is "financial". Union members object to discrepancies between their salaries and those paid to soldiers in the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF). SAPU leaders are "under pressure to agree to a strike on April 13 if no remedial action is taken. The argument of militant members is powerful: SAPU memoranda submitted to President de Klerk and the Transitional Executive Council have been shelved, but when the NPKF recruits went on strike their demands for more pay were speedily met." THE STAR believes a strike by SAPU members can only "compound the crisis" in police ranks. The NPKF is a "small and untested military unit" and "a heavy burden of protecting the electoral process already falls on the overstretched SADF [South African Defense Force]. If that burden is increased by a strike in police ranks, the election itself may be imperiled, particularly if there is renewed violence outside kwaZulu/Natal." Article Warns of `Undemocratic' Guarantees for Zulu Kingdom -- Hugh Roberton writes in an article on the same page that what Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Zwelithini are demanding "in essence are guarantees of the survival, and future status, of the Zulu king and his kingdom. The only way which De Klerk and Mandela can do this is by way of constitutional guarantees which do not now exist." For the sake of what would be a "precarious peace at best, are De Klerk and Mandela prepared to promise to guarantee the king's right, for instance, to have a say in the appointment of some of the regional kwaZulu/Natal cabinet?" Roberton believes that "while a degree of constitutional flexibility is needed in South Africa to satisfy the `special circumstances' that might exist in a region, such flexibility surely should not extend to granting individuals, or groups, powers which they do not now have and which they have not had for almost a century. Such a profoundly undemocratic dispensing of power in the case of kwaZulu would amount to entrenching a 19th century tribal fiefdom into the constitution of a country standing at the doorway of the 21st century." SOWETAN Proposals Can Be Made To Satisfy Zulu Leaders -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 8 April finds it "difficult" to be optimistic about the 8 April meeting between President de Klerk, ANC leader Nelson Mandela, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. However, SOWETAN is sure there are "various proposals that can be made to satisfy both Zulu leaders. In any case, isolating Buthelezi will not solve the problem: he is a key factor in the politics of kwaZulu-Natal. It is now evident that the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] is prepared to enter the race, which makes a solution in Natal even more vital. The state of emergency cannot be lifted immediately even if it were an almost panic-driven move to quell the violence." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Emergency Not Enforced in Natal -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English for 8-14 April in its page-14 editorial says the emergency regulations imposed in Natal were "horribly like the emergency regulations of the 1980s, and would fall foul of the Bill of Rights the government and the ANC purport to support." The security force members have "blanket immunity" and the detainees receive "so little protection." However, having "given themselves these powers, the authorities then fail to use them in any significant way." Among other things the soldiers form a "scanty presence in the urban areas," and the police "find themselves unable to disarm marchers in Empangeni who are blatantly breaking the ban on dangerous weapons." "It would have been better to use existing, normal law and order powers -- of which the authorities have plenty -- to deal with the problem, rather than a showy emergency that is not enforced."
