FR940613-1-00056 FR940613-1-00006 A holder's responsibility for demonstrating UST financial responsibility for third-party bodily injury and property damage compensation poses a different issue. While RCRA Subtitle I does not include provisions that actually impose third-party liability upon UST owners and operators, it does require UST owners and operators to demonstrate their ability to compensate third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of an UST or UST system. The Agency believes that a holder who complies with all the conditions set forth in today's proposal should not be required to comply with any of the UST financial responsibility requirements as an owner or operator, including those for both corrective action and third-party liability coverage. EPA has chosen to propose this exemption based on the statutory authority provided in section 9003. The proposed exemption is consistent with the interpretation of that language adopted in the preamble to the UST financial responsibility final rule (53 FR 43323). In that rule, EPA exempted tanks taken out of operation prior to the effective date of the rule from UST financial responsibility compliance. In the preamble to the final rule, EPA recognized that ``insurance providers would be extremely reluctant to assure tanks taken out of operation because of the perceived greater uncertainty associated with them'' (53 FR 43327). In particular, insurers have indicated that in the case of foreclosed USTs, they would be concerned about vandalism and other threats to USTs at non-operational, unattended gas stations or similar locations with public access. The preamble also states that ``even if providers of assurance would assure these tanks, it is unlikely that they would cover leaks which occurred before the effective date of the policy'' (53 FR 43327). A similar situation exists for holders who empty their tanks and enter temporary or permanent closure after foreclosure. EPA has discovered that it is practically impossible to obtain third-party environmental insurance coverage for a new owner of empty tanks. Providers of financial assurance are very reluctant to provide any coverage for tanks that no longer store petroleum product. Further, providers are reluctant to provide coverage for damages that occur after the effective date of the policy for releases that might have occurred prior to the effective date of the policy. Under this proposed rule a holder is required to empty its tanks in order to be exempt from corrective action regulatory requirements. Since providers are unlikely to provide any coverage for empty tanks at non-operational facilities or for releases that occurred prior to foreclosure, and since third-party damages would be extremely unlikely to stem from releases occurring after the holder forecloses on and empties its tanks, the Agency believes it is unnecessary to require third-party liability coverage for such tanks. RCRA section 9003(c)(6) supports this proposed exemption. That provision emphasizes the connection between the UST financial responsibility requirement and a tank's operational status: ``The regulations promulgated pursuant to this section shall include:␣.␣.␣.␣(6) requirements for maintaining evidence of financial responsibility for taking corrective action and compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by sudden and nonsudden accidental releases arising from operating an underground storage tank.'' [emphasis added.] The Agency believes that since a holder must demonstrate that its tanks are empty and that it is complying with the UST temporary or permanent closure requirements in order to avoid corrective action liability as an operator, there should be no need for a holder who meets these requirements to demonstrate financial responsibility for corrective action or third-party damages. By requiring the holder to empty the tank in order to be exempt from corrective action requirements, EPA is ensuring that damages caused by future releases from that tank will be minimized if not avoided altogether. As a result, EPA is proposing that holders who act in accordance with the requirements described in this proposed rule be exempt from all subtitle I financial responsibility requirements. V. State Program Approval RCRA subtitle I section 9004, as implemented by 40 CFR part 281, provides states the ability to operate an UST regulatory program in lieu of the federal program if they first submit the program for review and receive approval from EPA. EPA approval of a state program means that the requirements in the state's laws and regulations will be in effect rather than the federal requirements. Program approval ensures that a single set of requirements (the state's) will be enforced in that state, thus eliminating the duplication and confusion that can result from having separate state and federal requirements. EPA considers state program approval to be an integral part of the UST regulatory program.
