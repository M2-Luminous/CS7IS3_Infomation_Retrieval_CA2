Over now to the parliament building: [Correspondent Forro] Good morning. This is Evelin Forro, reporting from parliament. The president of the Republic has now taken his seat and you can now hear his announcement: [Goncz] My dear friends: This meeting will not be very exciting. I will announce a few things which will obviously not surprise you. Today I held discussions with Gyula Horn [chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] and then with the chairmen of the parliamentary parties. The topic of the discussions was the preparation of the inaugural session of the National Assembly. The expected date of the inaugural session is 28 June 1994. Its task, the task of the inaugural session, will be to examine the mandates, to elect officials, to determine the order of sessions, and to elect members of the standing committees. At the inaugural session I intend to announce my proposal for prime minister, Gyula Horn. So what you are hearing now is not an official announcement, and the reason for this is very simple: Until the inaugural session the country still has a government. After the inaugural session the present government will transform itself into a caretaker government. That is the natural time when I must announce my recommendation for the post of prime minister. I have asked Gyula Horn whether he will accept my nomination and he has replied in the affirmative. The issues that must be decided at the inaugural session require preparation, political and professional coordinating discussions between the parliamentary parties. These coordinating discussions will begin on 9 June. Obviously, the order of importance will be determined -- incidentally, I will not interfere in this -- by the fact that the decision about the functions is to a certain extent also contingent on the coalition discussions. Discussion of the practical issues, of procedural issues, at the level of experts can, (?in my view), begin even earlier. There is a huge number of tiny practical tasks that will have to be performed by 28 June. It was about these things that we conferred with the party chairmen, and at the same time I asked them to inform me about the results of their talks at their....[pauses] at our discussion 20 June 1994. I would also like to inform you that this week I will conduct one-on-one discussions with the chairmen of the parliamentary parties, taking them nicely one by one so that I might hear their opinions about the country's economic and political situation. Perhaps it will interest you to know that we will begin with the smaller parties and proceed upwards, so that....[sentence incomplete as heard] [Forro] [passage omitted] After meeting with Gyula Horn, the president received the leaders of the parliamentary parties together. In addition to Gyula Horn there were Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats; Laszlo Surjan, chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party; and Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent Smallholders' Party. Peter Boross, the outgoing prime minister, represented the Hungarian Democratic Forum instead of [party Chairman] Lajos Fur. Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], is in the hospital having a knee operation. Laszlo Kover, head of Fidesz's parliamentary group, represented him. [passage omitted] Arpad Goncz said he wants a stable and balanced government which is capable of functioning and which is based on a broad consensus. I asked the president on behalf of Hungarian Radio how he will be able to cooperate with MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn, the probable prime minister. Arpad Goncz said: I hope we can cooperate well since we have known each other for a long time.
