This has also been confirmed by the Defense Ministry, while Defense Minister Janez Jansa has already appointed a special commission that will carry out an investigation. The commission has allowed the experts of the country that owns the aircraft to carry out some security measures on the aircraft's armaments. Robert Rakar from Radio Koper has more details: [Begin Rakar recording] Secovlje Airport has been virtually closed since 1022 when a U.S. F-16 aircraft carried out a crash landing there. The pilot chose Secovlje for the crash landing because of an engine fault. Witnesses to this incident have told us that the aircraft first touched the runway at its beginning, whereupon it bounced into the air and its engine died. It then tried to land again, and during this last attempt its undercarriage collapsed. The aircraft then crashed into a verge at the end of the runway. The pilot was not injured and two hours after the accident he was transferred to Aviano by special U.S. Army helicopter where he will undergo all the necessary medical checkups. A special Defense Ministry commission, lead by Brigadier Iztok Podbregar, took over the matter from the border police. We can expect the arrival of a special U.S. military commission to carry out the necessary investigation together with the Slovene commission at any moment. It is very difficult to obtain any information, but unofficially six miles out of Secovlje the pilot disarmed two rockets and dumped them into the sea. We will be able to confirm this information once the commission has completed its work. Brigadier Podbregar promised that the investigation will be carried out as swiftly as possible.
