Eddie George, the ever more outspoken Governor, urged the Government not to be tempted into "policy short-termism" but to pursue steady and sustained growth. He appealed to the Government and the public to get used to the idea of a slow recovery with none of the feel-good factor of the 1980's boom. In a speech to businessmen last night he acknowledged that people were saying that it still does not feel much like a recovery. "But that is precisely the point -- we have to avoid the excesses of the late 1980's, which felt wonderfully good in the short term, but which were the root cause of the misery that followed," Mr George said. His speech came the day after the Bank of England published its latest Inflation Report, published every three months, which indirectly blamed the recent rise in interest rates on Britain's money and bond markets on the Chancellor's insistence at his February meeting with the governor on a quarter-point cut in base rates. Officials at the Bank are increasingly concerned that the Government, battered by the poor showing in the local polls and the prospect of heavy defeats in next months European elections, will be tempted to throw away its anti-inflation discipline in favour of a politically popular go-for-growth policy. The Governor's call yesterday for cautious "stability-oriented" policies came on the day that the European Commission revised downwards its prediction for British economic growth next year. The Commission said that Britain would probably achieve the 2.5 percent growth rate estimated by the Treasury this year, but now believes that tax increases will slow growth to only 2.3 percent next year. In November, the Commission had been looking for 2.7 percent growth in 1995. Although Britain is currently outperforming the rest of Europe, which entered recession much later, the latest Commission growth forecasts predict that Britain will have a slower rate of growth next year than the rest of the Community, which it expects to rise to 2.5 percent. Mr George's hard-line stance on interest rates, underlined in both the Inflation Report and in his speech last night, is likely to put him on a collision course with Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, particularly if the economic recovery decelerates later this year because of higher taxes. The Bank's criticism of the February 8 rate cut has now become highly public, to increasing irritation within the Treasury. The cut was decided only after a difficult two-day meeting, with Mr George opposed to another easing in monetary policy and Mr Clarke arguing for a larger 0.5-point cut. The Bank has become increasingly public in its views about economic management, aided by Mr Clarke who has campaigned for more openness in economic policy decision-making but who is now having to face the consequences in the form of a publicly critical central bank. On the February 8 base rate signal, Mr Clarke said that it was "as plain as a pikestaff" that the decision to cut was the right one. Mr George was unrepentant about his opposition, saying: "It is debatable whether I lost the argument. I lost the decision." The City was disappointed yesterday with news that Britain's manufacturing production had fallen by 0.5 percent in March and that even industrial output, which includes North Sea oil and gas, had fallen by 0.6 percent.
