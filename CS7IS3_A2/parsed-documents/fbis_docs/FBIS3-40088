These measures took reform of the financial system and restructuring of the financial order as their point of departure in the application of economic and legal measures, augmented by administrative measures, to solve problems in economic development. They included controlling the issuance of currency, raising interest rates, controlling the total amount of credit, correcting the breaking of credit regulations, halting various forms of helter-skelter fund raising, enhancing central bank macroeconomic regulation and control, improving control over the issuance of negotiable securities and the size of the securities market, improving foreign exchange control and stabilizing the renminbi exchange rate, increasing control over real estate, controlling the inauguration of new projects, strictly controlling excessive increase in the purchasing power of social groups, restricting price increases, and accelerating fiscal, financial, investment, and social security reforms. The inauguration of these strengthened macroeconomic regulation and control measures aroused wide attention both at home and abroad. Hong Kong, which is closely associated with inland economic developments, showed particular concern and sensitivity. Economic, financial, and public opinion sectors concerned commented constantly. The initial reaction and perception of some was that this was another round of all-around retrenchment of the inland economy that would have a seriously adverse affect on Hong Kong's economy. It was even predicted that, in consequence, Hong Kong's economic growth rate might decrease by various percentage points. Developments during the past two months have changed, or are in process of changing, some of the mistaken notions of people abroad. The Central Committee's actions to increase macroeconomic regulation and control have shown initial results. In certain regards, they have generated positive effects. These are manifested largely in the following: Banks' mindless granting of loans and various kinds of helter-skelter fund raising have been preliminarily corrected; the renminbi rate of exchange in allocation markets is tending to stabilize, development zones have been reined in to a certain extent, and the real estate craze has abated; the policy of raising interest rates has shown results, a marked upturn in savings accounts occurring; prices of the means of production have turned downward; and a restructuring of securities markets has begun. Of course, inasmuch as only a short time has passed since inauguration of applicable macroeconomic regulation and control measures, full implementation will require a process. The positive results seen so far are just a beginning, and results in some areas are difficult to see within a short period, particularly in some lagging indicators such as the degree of rise in market prices, which remains fairly high. The industrial structure is still not sufficiently rational as well. Continued close implementation of applicable measures is needed. Near Term Effect on Hong Kong's Economy A near term and partial view of the possible impact on Hong Kong's economy of inland China's increased macroeconomic regulation and control is as follows: 1. Until such time as the positive results and role of inland China's increased macroeconomic regulation and control, restructuring of the financial order, and adjustments and retrenchments of investment and credit in some fields and in some areas are fully reflected, these measures will produce some psychological pressures on Hong Kong investors. 2. Some Hong Kong businessmen who have made primarily short term investments and who have speculated in inland China real estate will be hurt by the temporary cooling of the inland China real estate market. Some medium and small real estate companies that lack staying power and whose financial resources are limited will close their doors and go bankrupt, and Hong Kong parties having a professional association or who are creditors for these companies will be incriminated. 3. As a result of the rectification of the financial order and readjustment of the industrial structure, former investment projects not in keeping with national industrial policy will be unable to obtain continued support from inland China banks. Hong Kong businessmen involved in joint investments may consequently sustain losses. 4. Following cutbacks on credit in inland China, some new projects will be rigorously examined, and this may, to a certain extent, correspondingly slow Hong Kong bank credit activities. It is expected that financing by Chinese financial institutions during the second half of the year will be less than during the first half of the year. As a result of the tightening of credit by inland banks, trading companies will turn to foreign owned banks in China to seek import financing and letters of hypothecation. This will be beneficial to foreign owned banks. 5. The effect will be different on commercial and trading businesses. Those selling mostly in foreign markets will be little affected, but those selling mostly in the domestic market will be fairly greatly affected. The effect on trade involving inland China processing for Hong Kong will be fairly slight; trade with Hong Kong not related to processing will be reduced because of inland China's financial retrenchment. 6. The Hong Kong Stock Market reacted extremely sensitively and rapidly to inland China's increased macroeconomic regulation and control. Stimulated by good news from talks held in Beijing between the foreign ministers of China and the United Kingdom, the Heng Seng Index rose to 7,205 points. Later on, affected by China's increased macroeconomic regulation and control, the market declined to about 6,800 points. Share prices of some listed companies that Chinese-owned companies purchased, or that market rumors said Chinese owned companies wanted to purchase, i.e., "red chip shares," also fell greatly. However, now that inland China's measures for increasing macroeconomic regulation and control have produced preliminary results, the Hong Kong Stock Marked has rallied remarkably. Recently, as a result of the normalization of the inland China economy and the financial order, the renminbi exchange rate has become more stable and inflation has been brought under control. This helps the development of normal economic and trade relations between inland China and Hong Kong. Therefore, generally speaking, the near-term effect on Hong Kong's overall economy is relatively small, and the effect is positive rather than negative. Long-Range Effect on Hong Kong's Economy Over the long term, the Chinese government's strategic measures for increasing macroeconomic regulation and control will have far reaching effects on the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of inland China's economy. First of all, the present increased macroeconomic regulation and control differs from the 1988 improvement of the economic environment and rectification of the economic order. The current measures are a combination of both increased regulation and control and reform. They are rooted in reform, reform being used to solve problems that have come about in the course of moving ahead. The emphasis of this reform is mostly on macroeconomic reform including financial, tax, investment and social security reform, these reforms serving to stimulate steady intensification of enterprise reform. Reform proceeds from top to bottom, and is conducted in a coordinated way. Reform methods are primarily economic and legal in nature, completely coordinated, and carried out with vigor. The focus of reform is financing, this reform serving to spur progress in taxation, investment, and social security reform, as well as enterprise reform. Second, the present increase in macroeconomic regulation and control devotes extremely close attention to the legal system. It emphasizess the need for vigorous application of legal methods in conducting rigorous crackdowns on all forms of behavior in violation of the law and discipline. It truly achieves the goal of acting according to law and punishing violations of the law, thereby placing economic construction and reform and opening to the outside world within the purview of the legal system with all possible speed, regularizing the behavior of all economic interest entities. Third, the present macroeconomic regulation and control is not an across-the-board retrenchment but rather a readjustment and an optimization of the structure. The emphasis is on concentrating funds to ensure procurement of agricultural and sideline products, to ensure the normal production of key national enterprises, to ensure procurement and activities associated with foreign trade, to ease bottlenecks that limit the development of the economy today, and to ensure key national construction projects, particularly energy and transportation projects, and key facilities. It is not intended to make major cuts in investment projects with arbitrary uniformity. Fourth, these macroeconomic regulation and control measures have been inaugurated at a time when economic construction, and reform and opening to the outside world are entering a new era, and the overall domestic economic situation is good. This is manifested in ample supplies of consumer goods, a substantial rise in the real income of city and countryside residents, a relatively stable consumption psychology, and maturity and good sense in buying plans. These measures are not being implemented in a situation of reduced income, shortages of supply, and a psychology of fear. Therefore, China's restructuring of the financial order, strict enforcement of financial discipline, promotion of financial reform, and increased macroeconomic regulation and control are important actions and steps to advance the normal operation of he socialist market economy and to move the national economy into a benign cycle. Its goal is to make the development of China's economy more healthy, more stable, and better coordinated. This is beneficial for further improvement of inland China's investment climate, for improving economic relations and trade between Hong Kong and inland China, and for the long term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong's economy. Therefore, inland China's increased macroeconomic regulation and control is generally understood and welcomed by people both at home and abroad.
