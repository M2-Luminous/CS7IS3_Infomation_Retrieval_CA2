About 250 inmates chosen from Shandong's 57,000 convicts at prisons and reform-through-labour camps will be honoured for the occasion, said Liu Zhengxin, deputy director of the Justice Bureau. About a third of them will have their terms reduced or be released on parole, Liu added. Those who excel in their work, reeducation study and daily life in prisons usually receive better treatment than other prisoners. The province hopes the meeting encourages more inmates to behave better in prisons and reform-through-labour institutions, Liu added.
