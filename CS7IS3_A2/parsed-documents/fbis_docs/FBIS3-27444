"You can rest assured that China will never change its fixed policy of opening the door to the outside world," Zhu said in a speech titled "China's Reform and Development in 1994." Zhu, who arrived here Wednesday for a nine-day visit, said China will instead open wider to the outside world and positively participate in competition and economic cooperation. The recent reform measures taken by the government are designed to adapt China to the laws of the international economy and create a better environment for foreign investment in China, he said. He admitted that some government institutions' failure to link up the work during the early stage of promulgations of the reform laws has caused concerns among foreign investors over the preferential policies.
