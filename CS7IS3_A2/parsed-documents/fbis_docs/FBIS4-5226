"The Liberal Democratic Party is determined, as a responsible party, to act with unity and solidarity to establish a government that can meet public expectations," LDP President Yohei Kono said in a prepared statement. "Japan now faces a mountain of problems that cannot be solved by the current ruling coalition consisting of political parties with conflicting policies," Kono said. He made the remarks following emergency meetings of the LDP's top five executives and then of former prime ministers at the very moment when coalition partners were moving to pick a successor to Hosokawa from among their ranks. In a related development, Kono quickly persuaded former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe not to take any action that might trigger an intraparty schism, LDP officials said. Instead, the two agreed to act in solidarity to deal with developments in the political community following the imminent demise of the Hosokawa administration, they said. Watanabe, a former foreign minister, has been deemed one of the most promising candidates to succeed Hosokawa if he would break with the LDP and opt to form an alliance with the ruling parties. Minutes after Hosokawa expressed his intention to step down, Watanabe, chief of the LDP's second-largest faction, suggested he is ready to form an alliance with the ruling coalition. "Japan is in a crisis," he said. "We should join forces with people that have the same ideas to surmount the crisis." However, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone moved quickly to block a possible second breakup of the LDP, which suffered defections by dozens of legislators last June. "Do not take action at this moment," Nakasone was quoted by party officials as telling Watanabe. "Adopt a wait-and-see attitude with steadfast confidence." Meanwhile, the LDP's top five executives decided to create a new administration free from payoff scandals if the LDP once again sweeps to power, the officials said. The LDP was stripped of its 38-year lock on power last summer amid public outrage over a string of bribery scandals, one of which seemed to demonstrate the party executives' link with gangsters. The executives also decided not to allow the ruling coalition to pick a new premier from among their own ranks, while closely monitoring moves to be taken by the ruling parties, they said.
