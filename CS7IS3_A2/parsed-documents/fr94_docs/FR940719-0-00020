FR940719-0-00020 FR940719-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Drug Enforcement Administration 21 CFR Part 1306 Presriptions_Transmission by Facsimile AGENCY: Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The DEA amends its regulations to allow for the transmission of controlled substance prescriptions between the prescriber and the dispenser via facsimile. This change will facilitate the delivery of medication in situations where medication needs change quickly and physicians' orders need to be communicated rapidly. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: G. Thomas Gitchel, Chief, Liaison and Policy Section, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC 20537, telephone (202) 307&hyph;7297. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on September 23, 1993 (58 FR 49453). This rule allows for the transmission of written prescriptions by a practitioner to the dispensing pharmacy by facsimile. All conditions specified under 21 CFR 1306.05 regarding the manner in which a prescription must be prepared, shall apply to prescriptions generated via facsimile. By virtue of this rule, DEA recognizes the practice of transmitting a Schedule II prescription from the prescriber to the pharmacy by means of facsimile, but requires that the original written prescription be presented and verified against the facsimile at the time the substances are actually dispensed, and that the original document be properly annotated and retained for filing. Two exceptions to this requirement are granted. The first exception involves pharmacies providing home infusion/intravenous (I.V.) pain therapy. Prescriptions for home infusion/I.V. pain therapy may be transmitted by the practitioner or the practitioner's agent to the home infusion pharmacy by facsimile and they may be considered ``written prescriptions'' as required by 21 U.S.C. 829(a). In other words, in the case of home (or hospice) infusion/I.V. pain therapy, it is not necessary for the original prescription to be delivered to the pharmacy either prior to or subsequent to the delivery of the medication to the patient's home. The facsimile copy of the prescription shall be retained as the original document by the home infusion pharmacy and it must contain all information required by 21 CFR 1306.05(a) including the date issued, full name and address of the patient, name, address, DEA registration number and signature of the practitioner. The exception to the regulations for home infusion/I.V. therapy is intended to facilitate the means by which home infusion pharmacies obtain prescriptions for patients requiring the frequently modified parenteral controlled release administration of narcotic substances, but does not extend to the dispensing of oral dosage units of controlled substances. By facilitating the process by which such prescriptions are communicated, the need to treat them as ``emergency prescriptions'' as defined by 21 CFR 1306.11(d), which presently requires that a Schedule II emergency prescription be limited to an amount for the duration of the emergency, will be substantially eliminated. This exception will also facilitate the delivery of medication to the terminally ill in non-hospital settings were medication needs change quickly and physicians' orders need to be communicated rapidly. The second exception applies to Schedule II prescriptions written for patients in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCF) which are filled by and delivered to the facility by a pharmacy. A prescription for any controlled substance in Schedule II written for a patient in a LTCF may be transmitted by facsimile by the practitioner or the practitioner's agent to the dispensing pharmacy and may be considered ``written prescriptions'' as required by 21 U.S.C. 829(a). The facsimile copy of the prescription shall be retained as the original document by the dispensing pharmacy and it must contain all information required by 21 CFR 1306.05(a) including the date issued, full name and address of the patient (the address shall indicate that the location is a LTCF), name, address, DEA registration number and signature of the practitioner. By facilitating the process by which prescriptions are communicated, the need to treat them as ``emergency prescriptions'' as defined by 21 CFR 1306.11(d), which presently requires that a Schedule II emergency prescription be limited to an amount for the duration of the emergency, will be substantially eliminated. This exception will also facilitate the delivery of medication to patients in LTCF settings where medication needs change quickly and physicians' orders need to be communicated rapidly. Under current regulations, a pharmacist bears the responsibility for ensuring that prescriptions for controlled substances have been issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of this professional practice pursuant to 21 CFR 1306.04(a). Orders purporting to be prescriptions, which are not issued in the usual course of professional treatment, are not considered prescriptions within the meaning and intent of the Controlled Substances Act and a person who issues or fills such an order shall be subject to penalties provided by law. That responsibility applies equally to an order transmitted by facsimile. Therefore, this rule should not constitute an increased potential for the diversion of controlled substances. In exercising professional judgment, a pharmacist must take adequate measures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances through prescription forgeries. Some measures to be considered in authenticating prescriptions received via facsimile equipment would include maintenance of a practitioner's facsimile number reference file, verification of the telephone number of the originating facsimile equipment and/or telephone verification with the practitioner's office that the prescription was both written by the practitioner and transmitted by the practitioner or the practitioner's agent. Although such measures parallel efforts currently employed in verifying the authenticity of prescriptions transmitted by traditional means, the requirement of this rule places an additional responsibility on the pharmacist to take efforts to ensure that the facsimile has been initiated by the prescriber.
