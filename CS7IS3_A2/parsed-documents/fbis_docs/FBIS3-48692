FBIS3-48692 "dreas018__a94013" FBIS-EAS-94-018-A Document Type:Daily Report 27 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Supercomputer Bidding Procedures Analyzed OW2701023394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 26 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2701023394 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] A preliminary decision has been made on the issue concerning the government procurement of 11 supercomputers with the first supplementary budget for fiscal 1993. At this point, the decision has been nearly made on which makers will supply 10 supercomputers: five will be procured from domestic makers while the other five will be from American makers. It appears to be a well-balanced decision, considering the fact that the government procurement issue is regarded as a major sector at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. However, in addition to the fact that Cray Research Inc., the largest U.S. maker, has been asking for revamping of the procurement procedures, Japanese research institutes that will purchase these supercomputers have voiced their dissatisfaction with the stiff attitude of the United States. Since it is believed that another five or more computers will be procured in the next fiscal year, this decision may arouse future problems. With the original budget for fiscal 1993, the government has procured four computers: two from NEC and one each from Hitachi Ltd. and Fujitsu. Then, in the bidding for procurement with the supplementary budget, what was noteworthy was the bidding of a "Japan-U.S. alliance," with Japanese companies providing American supercomputers. This alliance came into being because many research institutes asked for parallel-processing computers, which are equipped with a large number of microprocessing units (MPU) that are capable of data processing. So far, in the bidding for the so-called "vector-type" conventional supercomputers, the competition was limited to four companies: Cray, Fujitsu, NEC, and Hitachi. However, in the bidding for parallel-type computers, Intel Corp. of the United States, the largest maker of MPUs used for personal computers, and another U.S. maker, Thinking Machines [name as published], have also strengthened their competitive power. And those Japanese makers or system designers that do not possess their own powerful products have one after another started to rely on U.S. products. Thus, it has been voiced in the computer industry that "Japan-U.S. friction can no longer be regarded as a simple issue." On 28 January, the Science and Technology Agency and the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Cooperation will decide on which maker they provide the 10th supercomputer that will be purchased with the supplementary budget funds. However, it is expected that the lone bidder, Cray, will get the order without any competition after the checking of its price and technological specifications. Moreover, when the Ministry of Health and Welfare's National Cancer Center holds its bidding for the last supercomputer in February, it is believed that the bidding will be favorable to American makers. However, Cray will certainly be dissatisfied with the results because it will end up winning orders for only two computers despite its objective of four or five. Cray's failure was caused by Fujitsu's "overwhelming" success in winning orders for four units. In its competition with Cray, Fujitsu gained high marks in its products' performance. Moreover, its price was lower by a large margin. In this connection, other companies, such as NEC and Hitachi, are determined to "make a comeback in the next fiscal year." Kazuyoshi Hori, president of Cray Research in Japan, maintained: "Under the current system of checking technological features, examiners generally swallow all the data supplied by makers. A third-party organ should be set up for conducting more strict examinations." He also suggested: "To put a brake on the price war, there should be a minimum price in the bidding." He also pointed out that if the price should fall far below the fund set aside in the budget, it will virtually become the criteria in working out the budget for the next procurement, and "this will bring about trouble for concerned research institutes." Concerning this opinion, some research institute sources have stated: "Generally speaking, what he has pointed out makes good sense." However, when it comes to concrete measures, many have said: "How will the minimum price be decided? Moreover, makers' efforts to cut costs should not be ignored." Furthermore, they have long been dissatisfied with the fact that aside from issues connected with research work, priority has to be given to such problems as the Japan-U.S. friction. Reportedly, U.S. officials paid visits, under the pretext of hearings, to every Japanese research institution on separate occasions before the biddings. There is also a growing opposition to such a practice.
