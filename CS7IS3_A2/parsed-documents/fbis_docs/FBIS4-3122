Zhu Yuli, general manager of the aviation industry of China; and Li Qiyan, mayor of the municipality, signed the agreement. Beijing Aeronautical and Astronautical University is a famous university in our country. Over the past 40 years or so since its founding, the university has cultivated more than 40,000 skilled persons for our country's aeronautical and astronautical industries and some other economic spheres. This university has rich teaching forces, many branches of learning, 36 undergraduate specialized courses, 60 master courses, 20 doctorate courses, 3 academicians of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 82 teachers for the students engaged in the study of doctorate, and nearly 10,000 students. The joint management of this university between the Aviation Industry of China and the Beijing Municipal government is a result from the mutual cooperation to promote educational reform and development and is to create conditions for further bringing into play the university's advantages and potentials of cultivating high-layered and high- quality skilled persons, making high-scientific and high- technological research, participating in the "211" project, and developing itself into the first-grade university. According to the agreement, the university should jointly be managed by the both sides. The university will still be administratively subordinate to the Aviation Industry of China and its investment system and outlay channels will not be changed. The university will continue to cultivate skilled persons to meet the needs of the aeronautical industry and undertake and also fulfill the tasks assigned by the aviation industry of China. The Beijing Municipal Government will support the university's reform and development, bring the university into line with the municipal plan for higher educational and scientific and technological development, and support the university to conduct educational reform on a trial basis. The municipal government will put the university's new area project and campus reconstruction project as well as some of its key projects, including the projects built with the funds invested and donated by foreign firms, including Ruina Group, into the list of the municipal key construction projects. The aviation industry of China will support the university to positively help the university upgrade its teachers' quality and cultivate urgently-needed higher- level skilled persons and to serve the municipality's scientific and technological progress, economic construction, and urban development. Through consultation, both sides will cooperatively organize the university leading group and jointly study and solve the key problems cropping up in the course of joint management. Cheng Xitong extended greetings to the signing of the agreement. He said that going into real action is better than outlines. I hope that the agreement will not become a mere scrap of paper. He urged that we should actually fulfill the agreement, do solid work, and realize the agreement. [passage omitted] Xie Guang, chairman of the scientific work committee under the Ministry of National Defense; and Zhang Xiaowen, vice chairman of the state education commission, made speeches at the ceremony.
