FR940418-2-00101 FR940418-2-00058 From a public policy perspective, learning consortia afford regional, state and local workforce and economic development policy makers and assistance providers points of access to reach a wider spectrum of firms through their business outreach efforts. Dealing with consortia of small organizations rather than individual organizations allows assistance providers to leverage the investment of scarce resources. Learning consortia have tremendous potential to help alleviate this nation's growing dislocated worker problem in several ways: (1) Consortia of businesses can be effective training and technical assistance delivery systems to upgrade incumbent workers' skills and improve company productivity to prevent worker dislocations. (2) Consortia learning systems, like learning centers and teaching factories, have the potential of being effective providers for dislocated worker retraining. (3) Networks of globally competitive small businesses could create new jobs for the reemployment of dislocated workers. Currently, there are hundreds of examples of successful interfirm networks operating across the country. For some, a geographic cluster is the basis for forging the network. Others are formed as part of a supplier development strategy, an industry association strategy, or as a regional economic development strategy. Part II_Application Process A.
