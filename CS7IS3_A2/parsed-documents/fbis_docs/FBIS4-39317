This was announced yesterday by Kazakhstan Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev at a press conference in Moscow. He also said the republic is ready to consider the question of Russia's participation in developing and transporting Kazakhstan oil. In spite of the upbeat assessments made at the press conference, Russian-Kazakhstan economic relations have two sore points. These are Baykonur and the development of the Caspian shelf. More broadly, this means the problem of oil deliveries from the Caspian region. In the Russian-Kazakhstan litigation around Baykonur, a new party has emerged: the Lockheed Corporation. It is interested in the program of Russian commercial space launches. First, the corporation produces satellites that are launched. Second, under a contract with NASA, it is one of the main contractors for manufacturing the Alfa station, and this project is directly related to launches from Baykonur. Therefore, in its struggle for the cosmodrome, Russia can acquire a strong ally and, judging by information from confidential sources in the Russian Government, a joint team is being formed with Lockheed. Whereas the situation around Baykonur has become rather commonplace, Moscow has not raised the issue of the Caspian until recently. On 2 June Grigoriy Karasin, chief of the Foreign Affairs Ministry Press and Information Service, stated that his department had presented the British embassy with an official note. It says that Russia deems invalid any agreements connected with developing mineral resources in the Caspian Sea basin that have not been approved by Russia and other countries of the basin. This rigid demand is substantiated by the sea's inland ecological regime. Thereby Russia confirms its intention directly to participate in projects that are being implemented in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. The Kazakhstan projects are Tengiz and Kaspshelf, and in Azerbaijan there is a similar project to produce oil on the Azerbaijan shelf of the Caspian. The note was sent to Great Britain because a leading role in all the projects belongs to British Petroleum. So far Russia, through Lukoil, directly participates in the Azerbaijan project. Lukoil holds 10 percent of the stock; Azerbaijan, 30 percent, and the rest is controlled by a consortium of Western firms. Russia, jointly with Kazakhstan and Oman, participates in the Caspian pipeline consortium on a parity basis. The best possible option for Russia would be transportation of Azerbaijan oil through the Caspian pipeline. On the other hand, Russia is ready to render Azerbaijan assistance in building oil pipelines through Turkey or Iran. In any event, Russia's share in the Azerbaijan project should increase. Russia's ultimate goal, diplomatically covered up by references to ecology, is apparently to preserve control of the oil export from this largest non-Russian oil producing region in the CIS. In all probability, this idea was also maintained by Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik at the 14th International Oil Congress in Norway. Russia has officially favored accession to the European Energy Charter. This idea has not been approved yet because the West is not ready to lift restrictions on Russian oil in Europe.
