The pro-U.S. flunkyist nation-selling act of the puppet traitor was, above all, the opening of the market of rice, which is blood and flesh of the South Korean people. Even successive puppets did not dare to touch on this issue. Nevertheless, the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam carried out behind- the-scenes negotiations with the White House over the issue of rice market opening, using it as a useful card, immediately after the merge of political parties. By doing this, he was selected as a presidential candidate at last. As was disclosed to the world, Pak Chol-on made remarks during the presidential elections that if he were to speak out, Kim Yong- sam would be removed from office. His remarks referred to such maneuvers by Kim Yong-sam, and Kim Yong-sam's imprisoning him was designed to shut his mouth. During the so-called summit held between South Korea and the United States on 23 November last year in the wake of the Uruguay Round negotiation, traitor Kim Yong-sam secretly pledged the opening of the rice markets and finally signed the memorandum of agreement. Because of the traitorous act of the puppet Kim Yong-sam, agriculture in South Korea faced destiny of complete bankruptcy and six million South Korean farmers lost means of living. Thus, South Korea has been deprived of even the last foundation of national economy and reduced to the U.S. rice market. The criminal act of the puppet Kim Yong-sam as a flunkyist nation-seller did not end at this. As has been known, Clinton's idea for the new Pacific community is designed to hold in check [kyonje] Japan and China with the U.S. system for colonial domination over South Korea as the axis and to bind countries in the Asia and Pacific region with its domination system. Nevertheless, the puppet Kim Yong-sam, who attended the Asian- Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seattle last November, stated that his new diplomacy is similar to Clinton's idea for the new Pacific community, thus attempting to court Clinton's favor. He then put the rope of this domination system on South Korea. Moreover, last April, the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam agreed to allow the United States to freely use port facilities in South Korea in an emergency according to the agreement on wartime support for the occupation forces concluded with the United States. In May, he conceded most U.S. Air Force facilities, which were to be turned over to South Korea, to the U.S. Seventh Air Force so that it can use these facilities continuously. Following this, in August, he effectuated the plan for supplementing logistics and civilian manpower to the U.S. Forces through the "93-Ulchi Focus-Lens" exercise. Thus, he reduced the whole land of South Korea to a consumption object for execution of the U.S. strategy. With a view to keeping U.S. Forces in South Korea, the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam fabricated even a nation-selling special treaty to increase the rate of sharing expenses for maintaining U.S. Forces in South Korea during South Korea-U.S. annual security consultative conference and South Korea-U.S. summit. Thus, he finally made the reduction of U.S. Forces in South Korea withheld. The pro-Japan flunkyist nation-selling act of puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam far surpasses the pro-Japan flunkyist acts of Pak Chong-hui and Kim Chong-pil. The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam once denounced Kim Chong-pil, who signed the South Korea-Japan treaty, as a pro- Japan nation-seller more vicious than the five traitors of the Ulsa Protectorate Treaty [of 1905] between Korea and Japan. However, he invited Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa and reconfirmed the nation- selling agreement on basic relations between South Korea and Japan. Moreover, he committed a flunkyist nation-selling act by nullifying Japan's past crimes. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, whose political foundation is weaker than any successive puppet regime, entered more deeply into Japan's economic and military sphere in an attempt to win its support. The Japanese reactionaries built high barriers against South Korean products. However, the Kim Yong-sam nation-selling clique announced his so-called economic policy toward Japan in last August. According to this policy, the measures on banning imports of some Japanese commodities, which have been implemented only for form's sake, will be completely lifted by 1997. While advancing along the road of military collaboration with Japan which is emerging as a great nuclear state and great military power, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique let the high-ranking officers of the Japan Self-Defense Forces participate [chamga] in the Team Spirit joint military exercise under the pretext of an observers team. Because of pro-U.S. and pro-Japan flunkyist nation-selling acts of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, South Korea's subordination to the United States and Japan has been further deepened and South Korea is falling in depth as a dual colony of the United States and Japan.
