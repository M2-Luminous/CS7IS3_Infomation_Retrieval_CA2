However, he said that the Forces cannot be accused as a party until the outcome of the investigations is known. The disbandment of the Forces party was the result of an "administrative-political decision." He stressed that the authorities are not applying double standards when dealing with the parties and that the Lebanese resistance is to continue. Al-Hariri was speaking to a number of Lebanese journalists in Paris following his meeting with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. [passage omitted] Al-Hariri said that "all the measures we are taking are aimed at strengthening the situation. Lebanon is targeted. It is no secret.... Lebanon represents a challenge to Israel after peace [is achieved], because the stage ahead will witness an economic challenge." Asked about the Lebanese Forces' responsibility for the church blast, he said: "We are not accusing the Forces, but, rather, elements [from them]. As for the party's disbandment, it was the result of an administrative-political decision based on a number of pieces of information available to the judiciary and security services. The issue was raised with the Council of Ministers and a decision was taken." [passage omitted] Asked whether the decision to disband the Forces is a prelude to hitting Hizballah, he said: "Until an agreement is reached with Israel on its withdrawal from Lebanon, the resistance issue remains a red line which cannot be touched. We, the country, and the government have paid heavy prices for the sake of safeguarding the Lebanese' right to resist, and we will not stop it. This is settled. As for actions outside the resistance, they are unacceptable and will not be overlooked. Their perpetrators will be judged like anyone else. The resistance is limited to a certain area. Any actions outside this area will certainly not be overlooked." Asked about Christians' fears that the resistance might contribute to reinforcing sectarian sentiments, he said: "If Samir Ja'ja' comes and decides to resist Israel and the state treats him differently from Hizballah, then the talk (about fears) is true." He pointed out that he has not made any contacts with Ja'ja' since the Lebanese Forces' arrest and the party's disbandment. [passage omitted]
