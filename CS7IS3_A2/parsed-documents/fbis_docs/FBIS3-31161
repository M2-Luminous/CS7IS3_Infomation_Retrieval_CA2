In a statement issued after the Wednesday meeting of the National Board of the KLD, the suspension of the self-government reform of the state, an increase in inflation over the last quarter of last year caused, in the KLD's view, by budget expenditures directed more at social welfare protection than active forms of counteraction of unemployment, and also the slowing-down of privatization, were listed as being among the threats to the long-term policies of the economic development of Poland. The congress also inter alia listed the introduction of lump-sum taxation for small firms, and which constitutes a real threat to their existence, as being among the unfavorable decisions [of the government]. In the statement, it is stressed that in a situation where the Suchocka government was -- thanks to budget discipline -- able to decrease the budget deficit in 1993 by over 20 trillion zlotys, "it ought to be realistic to take decisions reducing the tax burden and stimulating enterprise, and not wasting money through unrealistic and uncontrolled welfare expenditures and also the massive arousal of social expectations." Speaking on the subject of the Wednesday demonstration by Solidarity, Tusk stated that in a situation where the trade union right is demanding the implementation of ever greater workers' demands, and the government is capable of giving way before these expectations, in accordance with that which it promised in the election campaign, all the more significant is the voice of "the milieux that are today weak, so that the logic of the economic reform be defended." As Tusk told journalists, the congress is pleased with the fact that, in accordance with the Tuesday assurances of Democratic Union [UD] activists, the statement by Mazowiecki from a few months ago remains applicable, that the idea of the creation of a new party from the milieux of the UD and KLD is conceived as an alternative relative to the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. UD activists have assured the congress that there are not and will not be any talks on the subject of possible closer cooperation with the SLD until the time of the April Unification Congress of the two parties, Tusk added.
