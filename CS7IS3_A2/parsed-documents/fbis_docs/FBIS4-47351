In the new process, natural gas is subjected to thermochemical processing before being burned. As part of research in this direction, a thermodynamic analysis was performed to compare a natural gas conversion method with endothermal effects to one with exothermal effects. The analysis established that endothermal conversion in steam-gas units would provide the biggest efficiency gains but would also necessitate the redesign of equipment currently in place at the republic's thermal electric power plants. Thermodynamic analysis of the binary unit in which natural gas is subjected to exothermal conversion before being burned demonstrated that choosing a thermal layout with a thermochemical gas-turbine superstructure would result in improved efficiency thanks to a reduction in unrecoverable losses in the heat production process. As a result, it would be possible to modernize existing thermal electric power plants in such a way that the efficiency of transforming heat to work could remain unchanged. R&D performed jointly with the Power Generation Equipment Design Institute [Energoproyekt] confirmed the possibility of boosting the efficiency of natural gas utilization without altering existing thermal power generation equipment. Many of the currently used methods of reducing NO[.sub]x[/] emissions call for altering the gas-burning process by reducing the maximum jet temperature and creating enriched conditions by varying the intensity of mixing fuel and oxidizing agent. Two-stage combustion is one of the most radical methods of suppressing NO[.sub]x[/]. A system for burning natural gas after preliminary exothermal conversion is essentially no different from conventional two-stage burning systems. Consequently, modernizing thermal electric power plants by installing a gas turbine superstructure with thermochemical natural gas processing not only boosts plant efficiency but also significantly reduces NO[.sub]x[/] emissions. Calculations of key operating indicators before and after the proposed modernization were performed for scenarios assuming steam-turbine unit efficiencies of 39% and 41%.
