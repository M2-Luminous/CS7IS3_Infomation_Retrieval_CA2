The government and local governing bodies together with the Central Electoral Commission should guarantee equal opportunities to all participants in the election campaign. Under the decree candidates who are employed at executive government bodies at the time of registration should resign from their positions not later than 40 days before the elections. Their jobs will be kept for them for the time of the election campaign. They will take part in election meetings and appear in the media as private individuals. The heads of executive government bodies have no right to campaign for or against candidates to parliament. At a conference of top ranking officials in Chishinau on the coming elections President Snegur has declared that the specific conditions of the first multi-party parliamentary elections in Moldova require that he state his attitude to the election campaign. He said: "Firstly, the constitution binds the president to be involved in the election campaign. I will bend every effort to guarantee the best conditions for parliamentary elections. I call the voters to cast their ballots for those who firmly stand for strengthening the Moldovan state and independence." "Secondly, the president went on to say, [punctuation as received] I will continue to support political forces that pursue a policy of strengthening Moldova as an independent and sovereign country without any conditions or double standards. This stand is in full accord with my program in the presidential elections that won clear support from voters. I favor those who strengthen the unity of the country by concrete actions. I am going to vote for those who put forward and are capable of carrying out concrete programs to overcome the economic crisis, those who would guarantee stable progress and I am going to urge voters to follow my example." "Thirdly, every guarantee of equal participation in the elections to all political forces will inevitably result in irreversible democratization, a key attribute of constructing a democratic and law-governed state". "Fourthly, local executive bodies should organize the election campaign strictly in keeping with the law and presidential decree offering equal opportunities to all candidates". "In the fifth place, Snegur emphasized, I am confident that the people on the left bank of the Dniester have fully realized who wanted to separate us and why. I hope everyone has understood what should be done to prevent the elections from being blocked by those who do not want us to live in peace and harmony the way we have for centuries." The president urged the media to cover the election campaign fully and objectively without insulting any of the participants. The Moldovan head of state singled out the responsibility of government bodies of all levels for taking resolute measures to stop any attempts of any political forces or individuals to win seats in parliament through fanning ethnic discord. Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli thinks the early parliamentary elections offer a unique chance to determine the future of the nation. At the conference in Chisinau he said the elections should put an end to the speculations of destructive forces operating in Moldova that are opposed to the independence of the country and favor unification with Romania. The prime minister urged cabinet members planning to run for the new parliament to go on leave by January 15. He said cabinet members and representatives of executive bodies should run in the election campaign on equal grounds with other candidates. IF [INTERFAX] Note: The prime minister himself has been on leave since Monday. He is running for parliament on the ticket of the influential Agrarian Democratic Party along with his deputies Nikolai Oleinik and Valentin Kunev as well as the current speaker Pyotr Luchinsky.
