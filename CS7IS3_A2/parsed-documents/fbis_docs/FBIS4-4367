FBIS4-4367 "dreas062_h_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Malaysia * Military Chief To Serve Minimum of 3 Years * Military Chief To Serve Minimum of 3 Years 94SE0090A Kuala Lumpur UTUSAN MALAYSIA in Malay 9 Feb 94 p 2 94SE0090A Kuala Lumpur UTUSAN MALAYSIA Malay CSO [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 8 Feb--The Minister of Defense will revise the periods of service of those who hold the post of Armed Forces commander to enable them to serve longer despite reaching retirement age. Minister of Defense Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said that under this revision, a person serving as Armed Forces commander may hold the position for at least three years. Because of compulsory retirement, the periods currently served sometimes do not reach a year. "Although the present period of service is fair for everyone, it will be improved in two years, when the Armed Forces commander will be given at least three years to direct the Malaysian Armed Forces (ATM)," he said. He said this as a special guest on the Forum program aired by TV 1 tonight. As an example, the new Armed Forces commander, General Tan Sri Borhan Ahmad, will have the opportunity to lead the Armed Forces for only 11 months, because he is scheduled for retirement at the end of this year. Similarly, the previous commander, General Tan Sri Abdul Rahman Abdul Hamid, had the opportunity to lead the Armed Forces for only a year because of retirement. In this connection, Najib said that although the present term of service of the Armed Forces commander is short, it will not hurt ATM planning. "This is because those who are to be promoted to replace the Armed Forces commander when he retires were also involved in earlier planning. This means that whenever we make a decision at the Ministry of Defense, it is not the decision of one commander alone but is a collective decision," he said. In the interview, Najib did not reject the possibility that in the future the post of Armed Forces commander will not be limited to candidates from the Army only. He said that in order for an Air Force commander or Navy commander to become Armed Forces commander in the future, both positions will be raised to the rank of general to be on a par with the Army commander. "At present, the Air Force commander is a lieutenant general with three stars, and the Navy commander is a vice admiral with three stars, whereas the Army commander is a general with four stars," he said. When asked when the Air Force commander or Navy commander will hold the post of Armed Forces commander, he said that it depends on time and conditions. "We need time to apply new doctrines, and this will be implemented when the doctrines have become established," he said. He said that appointments to Armed Forces commander have focused on candidates from the Army because in the past Malaysia concentrated its attention on eliminating communist terrorists. "In the future, however, attention will be more on conventional warfare, involving combinations of the three ATM services. Therefore, the future designation of Armed Forces commander will be based on the personal qualifications and capabilities of the candidates," he said. The forum was chaired by BERITA HARIAN reporter Mohamed Shah Abdullah, while panel members were UTUSAN MALAYSIA reporter Zulkiflee Bakar and BERNAMA reporter Mohamed Fuad.
