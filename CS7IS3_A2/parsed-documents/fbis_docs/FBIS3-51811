This decision was made by the association of the directors of those schools working in Port-au-Prince. This decision is a direct consequence of the shortage of fuel and the scarcity of oil product in Port-au-Prince. We will later discuss the details of this news item, especially with regard to the closing of industries and businesses in Port-au- Prince. For instance, the radio stations in the capital last week began working on a reduced schedule.
