It is a strategic goal restated by the fifth and sixth development plans. And yet has this strategic goal been achieved as it should be in the private sector? Governed by considerations of achieving balance between the greatest possible return, and lowest possible cost, and it is seen that foreign labor is cheaper, making it possible to achieve the desired return. [sentence as published] So, what are the ways of increasing Saudization in the private sector? How can trained Saudi labor be provided to meet businessmen's requirements? From Mr. Salih al-Tu'aymi, secretary general of the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce, who polled businessmen and relevant officials in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, we find that there are three basic indicators. These are: the continuation by the private sector to meet its labor needs from sources that provide the greatest possible profit, which is the labor that offers lower wages and high qualifications. The other view is that the private sector should be directed to fill its labor needs from the local market, in order to provide more economic stability, to raise the rate of working capital formation, and the participation of the private sector in developing the abilities of Saudi Arabia's human resources by giving them the chance to learn necessary skills. The third view involves the preparation of a timetable overseeing the readiness of the local labor market to assess how well it is meeting the needs of the private sector. It views the private sector as the most important sector for absorbing civilian labor in the Kingdom. The timetable would set out deadlines for all quarters affected by this issue, in both the private sector and government agencies. National Demand Al-Tu'aymi restated the goals of the successive five-year development plans in terms of human resource development--the Saudization of jobs by finding work for every able citizen, by which palpable successes may be achieved in the government sectors and some private sector institutions. The state has understood since the beginning of the development process that, while the importation of expatriate labor brings some economic benefits, the Saudization of available positions is a mandatory national demand that must be fulfilled, working with the limitation that there are not an abundance of qualified national workers. The balance is one of costs and benefits, and the interrelation of economic, social, and political factors in defining the nature of the labor problem in the Saudi economy. That is, the state desires action larger than the capacity of the local market to supply the local needs, so it is necessary to bring in tens of thousands of expatriate workers to fill the gap between developmental needs for manpower and local manpower supply. This has imposed a delicate balance of the benefits obtainable through the use of national versus expatriate labor, defining the cost involved in hiring, and studying the needed profitability on the part of government institutions and the national economy. The determination of benefits and profitability is of costs at the private company level, for both local and imported labor. The decision to employ either one in an activity may be positive or negative, in the sense that a purely commercial measure as a basis of computing this factor is inaccurate if it does not take sufficiently into consideration the indirect effects of making a hiring decision. A businessman anticipates revenue from hiring a worker. The accounting produces a result in favor of expatriate labor, with the hiring company getting a profitability it would be difficult to achieve using local labor, given the open market, low customs fees, and the low wage level acceptable to imported workers, compared with what a national worker would accept. The use of imported labor is in line with company needs (profession, expertise, qualifications) and is not contracted unless the needed skills are offered. This leads to the expatriate worker being assimilated directly into the institutional activity. There is no training or familiarization period. In addition, an expatriate employee will accept a job any place in the Kingdom; this is not the case with a native employee, who prefers settled work. There is also a relative weakness in native workers' job stability: he is always looking for an opportunity for a pay raise, promotion, and better working conditions. And expatriate laborer can be obtained in the numbers and types needed for company activity more quickly than national labor can be. This is because trained labor is available whenever it is sought. Among the other factors that turned up in the Riyadh Chamber's questionnaire were the ease of getting rid of expatriate labor, should there be a drop in their level of performance, and the fact that the proprieter must pay installments of his share of the Saudi workers' social insurance. Furthermore, a Saudi worker may bother him during the whole workday, leaving the promotion process up to the private business owner. National Benefits In spite of these factors, the hiring of Saudi workers brings national benefits that exceed the cost of employing them, and which make them more economically profitable than hiring expatriate workers. One of these points is stability in economic activity, as these activities are based on workers who are not affected by changes in the Kingdom's labor market due to developments occurring in the home countries of expatriate workers, such as bans or limits on the movement of workers, or the existence of more attractive job opportunities for them. By hiring expatriate workers, the Saudi economy bears indirect burdens, such as the financial remittances that these workers send back to their countries, with the volume of these remittances corresponding to the difference between the income of these workers and their consumption, which usually is in line with their level of consumption in their home countries. This situation creates an increase in the Saudi riyal supply versus free currencies. This may affect the exchange rate between the riyal and those currencies, and of course this corresponds to the extent of the drain on the Saudi economy with the expansion in the hiring of expatriate labor. As to the growth in use of national labor, the development benefits within the Saudi economy will increase in a self-sustaining way, with the capital accumulation it brings. The increase in importing expatriate labor leads to Saudi workers being deprived of the chance to learn the technical skills necessary to the continued expansion of the development process, as the national economy is deprived of the expertise that is compounded in the course of this process, when the expatriate workers return home. Improving the financial circumstances of Saudi consumers permits them to reduce a better part of the course of the national economy's financial outflows, and its stability. [Hiring Saudis] safeguards the values, customs, and traditions of Saudi society that stem from Islamic law, while expatriate workers come from many diverse--and non-Arab--sources. Strategy of Replacement The fifth development plan emphasized the replacement of expatriate labor with Saudi labor to an extent greater than finding new job opportunities; the plan aimed to orient 220,400 workers with the goal of replacement, representing 50.8 percent of total Saudi labor with the chance of increasing it over the years covered by the plan, versus 213,500 employed workers with new job opportunities, representing 49.2 percent of the same total. The plan included the orienting of a higher percentage of new Saudi workers, destined for clerical affairs; the campaign of target workers in this activity reached 119,300 workers, with a 27.5 percent of the total target increase in workers in the plan's time period, against a goal of orienting 59.1 percent of the workers in various productive sectors, with 13.6 percent of this increase. The plan aimed at reducing agricultural labor by 25.1 percent, representing 5.5 percent of total workers employed, despite the increased importance of agricultural activity and its role in driving the development process, both in terms of other productive sectors and of the national economy. Figures showed a 13.9 percent reduction in technical and vocational labor in the total labor picture. This figure does not include the number of Saudis expected to be hired out of technical, training, and vocational institutes, though one may remark here that university graduates represent 12 percent of labor targeted for increase over the years covered by the plan, as against 15.7 percent of workers pre-elementary level and 22.1 percent of workers with certificates of completion of the elementary level only. It may be noted that the five-year plan's estimates could result from a base anticipation of 218,700 workers entering the private sector, who left schools the intermediate level, representing 50.4 percent of total targeted labor, with regard to the schools run by the Ministry of Education and the General Directorate for Women's Education. Addressing the size of the problem, we must point out the inactive surplus of workers in the Kingdom. These workers represent a demand for work in government agencies and the private sector. The five-year plan anticipated an increase of 334,900 Saudi workers over the five years, of which 220,400 would replace expatriate workers, who number 173,500, a net increase over the work force. That is an average level of 86,700, 41,000, amd 42,700 workers respectively, of which the private sector would absorb 47,000 in the period 1988-1991, at an annual average of 18,500. This would be the annual average surplus of Saudi labor, 68,300 workers, with government agencies absorbing an average of 8,300 workers per year. According to the study made by the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, an average of 12,000 workers annually get jobs in the private sector through employment offices. This is an average annual increase in new private firms, with an annual average labor surplus of 48,000. This does not generally mean a problem for the Saudi economy, given the private job opportunities available to some, who prefer voluntary unemployment, and others, who work in non-civilian sectors. Linking Loans to Saudization To encourage the private sector to hire Saudis, Dr. Sayyid Fathi al-Khuli, Professor of Economics at King 'Abd-al-'Aziz University, in a study of the private sector's actual manpower needs, emphasized that vocational and technical training institutes should graduate the kinds of workers the private sector actually needs. He also proposed linking the government's agricultural and industrial loans to the private sector to an actual commitment on the part of the borrowers to have no less than 10-percent Saudi employees. And this percentage would gradually rise. He supported the preparation of a field study to find the reasons for Saudi youth's aversion to private sector work, and the real reasons for the private sector's aversion to hiring Saudi workers; and in the light of these studies, appropriate solutions would be found. Prof. Ibrahim Kamal, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in al-Ta'if, is of the opinion that Saudi youth are responsible and capable of work in various trades. In recent years, he said, numerous classes have graduated from the training centers and industrial institutes. They have been trained in the most modern systems and methods. This highlighted the role of the Council of Saudi Chambers of Commerce in perceiving the private sector's actual needs for Saudi labor, and in organizing training courses, both in terms of direct hiring and prior training based on studies of the labor market's actual need. Rise in Local Workers Turning to the subject of the extent of the private sector's dependence on imported labor, the economic study prepared by the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce made it clear that the number of Saudi workers in the private sector would not decrease over seven consecutive years. Expatriate labor, on the other hand, would decline, meaning an increase in Saudi labor in the private sector, from 16 percent in 1985 to 17.8 percent in 1989. This increase has kept mounting in subequent years with the growing role of the private sector in development, and the government's increased attention--through government agencies and the Council of Saudi Chambers of Commerce--to supplying and training Saudi workers. Detailed Calculations The Riyadh Chamber of Commerce study recommended that more attention be given to manpower research, by continuing to conduct regular censuses; detailed calculations, such as of workers in various activities; and their distribution in terms of job and nationality. It also recommended behavior studies in the labor market to find positive and negative aspects and deal with them; it recommended a study of habits and traditions that belittle the worth of manual labor, and an attempt to inculcate new concepts in our youth to accentuate the worth of manual labor in service to the nation. Summary A sampling of opinions among the economists and field studies on ways of promoting Saudization led us to an important fact, which is that channels must be created for ongoing liaison between the private sector and Saudi manpower, through the Kingdom's chambers of commerce, to determine the actual needs of the national sector; plus the organization of training courses in line with market needs, and training workers for management; and directing youth to appropriate positions in line with actual needs. They also highlighted the importance of studying the labor market and its movements, watching for negative aspects from time to time; studying jobs to which Saudi youth have an aversion, in order to find solutions; finding ways to encourage the private sector to hire Saudis, such as linking loans to the degree to which private firms Saudize; and granting incentives in the form of reduced customs fees, charity, and income taxes for companies that achieve high degrees of Saudization. All of this must be achieved in the context of an integrated strategy with the specific goal of Saudization and the methods needed to meet this goal.
