Speaking in parliament before discussion of the composition of the cabinet, he declared that it would be extremely unwise to resort "to such decisions (resignations) at this stage." In the meantime, observers forecast volatile parliamentary debates Tuesday afternoon. This is borne out by the fact that even the parliamentary majority, formed to back Shevardnadze's initiatives, withheld support for most candidates nominated by him.
