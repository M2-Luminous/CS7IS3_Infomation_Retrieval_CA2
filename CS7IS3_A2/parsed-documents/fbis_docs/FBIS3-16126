He said "there is nothing new" in the proposals made by the Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze in Washington. "The leaders of Russia, Georgia and Abkhazia have already asked the UN to send a peacekeeping force to the conflict zone. The question is that Georgians would like to have them deployed along the Psou River, while Abkhazians would like to have them along the Inguri River. However, the UN is not hurrying to take a decision, he said. "The opponents of giving the Russian troops the status of a UN peacekeeping force insist that such a decision should be preceded by certain progress in a political settlement of the conflict," he noted. The diplomat pointed out that Moscow continues to adhere to another approach. "We think that the sooner the UN takes a corresponding decision, the sooner the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict is settled," he said.
