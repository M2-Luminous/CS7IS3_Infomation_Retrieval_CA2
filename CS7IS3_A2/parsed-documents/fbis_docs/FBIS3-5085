During the meeting, criticism against Japan's current accounts surplus was stronger than ever. This was expected because economic conditions in all seven nations, except the United States, are bad, and the G-7 are all plagued with the problem of mass unemployment. Japan was particularly isolated at this recent international conference because even the United States joined the attack on Japan. However, looking back at the G-7 meeting and recent behavior of the government, we are concerned that Japan is becoming overly inward-looking in its relations with the United States, and in the international arena. Japan cannot evade the responsibility for enjoying a huge current accounts surplus for more than 10 consecutive years. Yet, it has also made various efforts. With regard to efforts to expand domestic demand, Japan has compiled a 15-trillion-yen comprehensive economic package featuring income tax cuts. Yet, these macroeconomic measures are not appreciated at all. It is true that there is room for argument with regard to the merit of these measures. However, in view of declining revenue income, the economic package probably represents maximum efforts on the part of Japan. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen voiced the criticism that "Japan's stimulation measures are insufficient." IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus also said, "Only minimal growth effect can be expected." To the Japanese financial authorities, their arduous efforts that went into the formulation of the economic stimulation budget have indeed received shockingly little appreciation. The ratio of Japan's current accounts surplus to GNP is expected to diminish rapidly even according to the forecast of international organs. Yet, the United States turns a blind eye to such estimates. It is also strongly critical of the tax cut, claiming "since this is limited to one year, it would only be half as effective." How come our efforts to expand domestic demand are not conveyed to foreign countries accurately? If things go on like this, Japan will surely be in a very difficult position. Why is it that we are unable to make even U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale understand us correctly? The Hosokawa administration has failed in its efforts to win the foreign countries' understanding. The question is: Why is the communication process that bad despite the fact that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton enjoy a good relationship of trust? The Ministry of Finance used to have friendly relations with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Such relations deteriorated in the past two or three years, and they have worsened recently. The U.S. Treasury Department's assessment of our macroeconomic policy may be a consequence of this. Communication channels between the governments and legislatures of Japan and the United States have also been reduced. In short, there is not one out of 100 members of the U.S. Congress who truly supports Japan. The fact is, in 1985, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to impose sanctions on Japan unanimously. What has the Foreign Ministry been doing? And what about the Japanese Embassy in Washington? Has the Hosokawa administration been serious about having dialogues with the United States? Has it really worked hard to persuade the international community? Coordination between Japan and the United States was a basis for the past G-7 meetings. Such a basis has disintegrated since the recent Frankfurt meeting. The recent meeting seemed to have conducted level-headed discussions and reached appropriate conclusions on issues such as aid to Russia, economic growth strategy, Japan's surplus, and turbulence in the bond market due to interest rate fluctuations in the United States. There is no guarantee that an encirclement of Japan would not be formed. Any nation may try to look for a scapegoat for its domestic difficulties. Japan should brace itself up. It should also exert untiring efforts to make the world understand its position. Bureaucrats should look to the world. Otherwise, we may end up repeating the stupid mistake of not being appreciated even though we donated $13 billion during the Gulf war.
