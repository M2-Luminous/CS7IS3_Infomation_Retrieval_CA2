According to the earliest evidence uncovered in the inquiry being conducted by the mission, a group of unidentified, heavily armed individuals, at around 0100, invaded a house that sheltered at least 10 people. It seems that after they had blocked the access roads, the attackers launched teargas and grenades into the building, thus forcing the occupants to leave the place. Armed individuals then began shooting, fatally injuring at least six persons. Several occupants who were present at the time managed to escape. The police authorities of Delmas 33 told the mission that the victims were part of a subversive terrorist organization and that the slaughter occurred following a violent quarrel among members of this group over a money split. However, according to credible testimony communicated to the mission, the victims, ranging in age from 20 to 30 years, were activists in political organizations in Cite Soleil who, during the month of January, were compelled to leave their neighborhood following intensified repression. The OAS/UN civilian mission vigorously condemns these violations of the right to life and enjoins competent authorities to conduct an inquiry so the authors of these crimes can be brought to justice.
