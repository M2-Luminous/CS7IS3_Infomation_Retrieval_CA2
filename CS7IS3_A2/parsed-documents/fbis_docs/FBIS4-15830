Moreover, the social democratic principles in the party program also influenced this victory. Assuming power, the LDDP managed to slightly normalize the political situation in the country and partially halt the dangerous confrontation among political forces. Unfortunately, due to its inherent faults (an eclectic theoretical approach, the lack of political will, the infinite syndrome of remorse, and so on), the ruling party failed to introduce essential changes in Lithuania's situation or offer more serious resistance to the destructive right-wing forces. Pressured by these right-wing forces, the LDDP Seimas majority adopted a number of extremely equivocal decisions: On the undifferentiated litas' exchange rate, on joining NATO, and on free arms trade. It is already obvious today, however, that LDDP actions have become more dynamic. Work of law enforcement institutions has been strengthened. More attention and money are being devoted to the resolution of social problems. LDDP's foreign policy has become more active and constructive. If these tendencies prevail in future LDDP activities, the Lithuanian socialists will support the moves of the ruling party. Such positive actions really help overcome the crisis in Lithuania, prevent political instability, and serve the interests of the entire population. The Socialist Party sincerely admits this. We are determined to point out the government's mistakes in a good-natured manner in the future as well. In contrast with the absolute majority of the right parties, however, we respect the constitutional right of the LDDP to govern Lithuania until the next Seimas elections. [Signed] Lithuanian Socialist Party Council [Dated] 26 March 1994, Vilnius.
