In the course of the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao scheduled for Wednesday the parties are expected to sign protocols on cooperation in the field of space research and military-technical assistance. In addition, the parties intend to undertake certain measures to increase the volume of trade which dropped to $1 billion in 1993 compared with $1.3 billion the previous year and $5.5 billion in 1990 - the most successful year. In his interview with Interfax a top-ranking official of the Indian Embassy in Moscow expressed his opinion that lowering of turnover in the Russian-Indian trade was caused "predominantly by transport difficulties." In particular, after the collapse of the USSR, Odessa (the most cargo from India was shipped via this city) has become part of Ukraine. However, in the near future goods from India will be delivered via the Novorossiysk port. The Foreign Economic Relations Ministry (FERM) experts point out that India was one of the leading trade partners of the former USSR, about 2 percent of the country's foreign trade was with this country. Thanks to the procurements made in India the USSR was able to import tea (about 70 percent), coffee (60 percent), black pepper (98 percent), jute and goods made of it (more than 90 percent). In addition, the USSR procured a great quantity of cotton cloth, medicines, detergents, and perfume. The Soviet Union predominantly exported raw materials (more than 65 percent) to India, including oil and oil products, fertilizers, and non-ferrous metals. The USSR's share in India's foreign trade was about 9 percent. More than 70 various industrial facilities were built in India with the assistance of the USSR. In 1992-1993 the parties accomplished several measures aimed at the development of new conditions for Russian-Indian cooperation. In May 1992 they signed an agreement providing for settling mutual accounts in hard currency (until that time the trade was accomplished on clearing basis). The parties have also introduced barter deals. In the course of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to India in 1993 the parties reached several agreements on the Indian debt. In particular, the debt to the former USSR totaling about 320 million rupees (about $10 billion) is to be paid off by payments in rupees which are to be spent for the procurement of Indian goods. A 45-year postponement in paying off 120 billion rupees ($3.75 billion) with annual payments in equal installments was granted to India (by 1994 Russia has already received about $840 million towards India's debt). More than 60 percent of the Indian military has been armed thanks to the shipments of Soviet weapons over the last two decades. In 1993 armaments and military equipment constituted 54 percent of Russian export to India. Nevertheless, according to Russian experts, Russia has to take serious measures to preserve and strengthen its positions on India's arms market in as other arms exporters have become more active in that region of late.
