Sergey Shakhray Will Participate in Negotiations With Chechnya" -- place, date not given] [Excerpts] [Molchanov] Sergey Mikhaylovich, what is the real story behind your resignation? [Shakhray] It is known that my resignation was preceded by my dismissal from the post of nationalities and regional policy minister which, in my opinion, was effected in violation of ethical norms. I had two options: either to keep silent or to protest the impermissibility of breaching the norms of official ethics. The sole way of expressing one's position in a situation when you are a member of a team is not to impose political assessments on your colleagues. And if you have to talk about a breach of ethics, this must be done after you resign. This is how I acted, announcing my resignation. This is my right. And it is the right of the president and the premier to accept or reject this resignation. The resignation was not accepted. There were meetings with the president and the premier. My further tasks, duties, and functions under the new conditions were clarified. And the most important thing for me here was that nationalities and regional policy remained under my jurisdiction, as vice premier. Moreover, representatives of many regions requested the country's leadership not to accept my resignation. In this situation I considered it inappropriate to insist on my resignation. (It would be very important for me to express through this newspaper my gratitude to those who supported me in those days). On the other hand, what has happened helped me identify both my true allies and adversaries, and even "traitors." A valuable experience. The question of resignation was closed; the conversation with the president moved to more urgent matters: on regional and nationalities policy, drafting a treaty on Kaliningrad Oblast, and mechanisms and implementation of the treaty between the power bodies of Russia and Tatarstan. In view of the numerous insinuations and rumors about my resignation being related to the upcoming negotiations with Chechnya, I asked directly whether I had been removed from the position of chief negotiator at the talks on a settlement with the Chechen Republic which I led in accordance with the president's message and a Duma resolution. The answer was negative. I introduced the new minister to the ministry collective, which I think was very important psychologically both for him and myself. We shall work. [passage omitted] [Molchanov] As vice premier, which matters will you oversee now? [Shakhray] They include the following sets of questions: First, nationalities and regional policy; second, interaction with legislative and judicial bodies. (After all I have experience of working in parliament and in the government). My terms of reference also include matters of interaction between the government and the mass media. I stress: interaction, not supervision, coordination, or direction. Not as it is envisioned in the TV and radio broadcasting plan drafted by the State Duma. I consider one of the major shortfalls in the government's performance the inability to explain its decisions, take public reaction into account, and shape public opinion.
