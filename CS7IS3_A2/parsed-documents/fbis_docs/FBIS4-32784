Ambassador Martinez said that the fact that there were no high level meetings before the summit is very positive for this fourth Ibero-American summit. He said that this Colombian initiative was viewed positively by the Ibero-American family. He noted that the idea is aimed at making possible more intense discussions among the chiefs of state in the context of the summit. Regarding violence in Colombian streets, the ambassador said that the local Colombian authorities have said they will adopt strict security measures to prevent incidents that would mar the image the government wants to enhance. He noted: That country is interested in demonstrating that violence and drug trafficking are not Colombia's most outstanding features, that since the adoption of the new Constitution there is a new Colombia, very different from what it was in the past. The ambassador added: Colombia has always worked intensively in the framework of international organizations, but it is evident that during the government of President Cesar Gaviria there has been a will to intensify those efforts. In the ambassador's opinion, the celebration of elections in Colombia this weekend will have no negative effect on the course of the presidential summit, which has been held in Mexico, Spain, and Brazil in the past.
