Governments at all levels have taken this matter seriously in recent years and done a good deal of work with a considerable measure of success. Nevertheless, peasants in some places continue to be saddled with an excessive social burden, which not only constrains agricultural output growth, but also constitutes the leading social problem in rural areas today. Present Situation 1. The heavy burden of rural education. To begin with, rural elementary and secondary schools collect too many assorted fees and charges. Departments in charge of education at all levels pay teachers' wages only but otherwise give no financial aid to schools. To keep operating normally, the schools always target students in their fund-raising efforts. Every freshman in the junior high section of Longjiang Secondary School in Qionghai Shi must pay 20 fees and charges each year, which cost him as much as 141 yuan in all. Zheyuanbo Elementary School at Dalu Zhen in Qionghai Shi issues formal receipts for fee collection. According to a survey report issued by the agricultural commission of Dingan County, students attending township and administrative district elementary and secondary schools must pay for a host of things in addition to tuition and textbooks, including maintenance, water and electricity, equipment, recreation, instructional apparatus, books, private teachers, class society, school administration, sanitation, scholarships, teaching and research, law and order, personal insurance, cafeteria, school construction, physical examination, tree planting, locks, and broomsticks. Each semester a senior high student must shell out more than 180 yuan; a junior high student, 150 yuan; and an elementary school student, 90 yuan. In Wanning County, the price bureau authorizes rural elementary and secondary schools to collect 13 fees each semester with a combined value of 73 yuan, 59.5 yuan, or 36.2 yuan, depending on whether the student attends senior high, junior high, or elementary school. In reality, elementary and secondary school students must each dish out over 100 yuan per semester in fees and charges. Of the 140 school-age children in Longjie district (village) in Longtang Zhen in Dingan County in 1992, 50 were forced to quit school because they could not afford the tuition. Second, there is a growing trend to raise funds from among the rural population to build schools, a trend that has really picked up steam in recent years in the countryside. Apart from a modicum of funds from the state, peasants are left almost entirely on their own to come up with the necessary funds. Thus school construction expenses have become one of the onerous burdens on peasants. In Dingan County, the per capita school construction burden on peasants is 55 yuan. In Longjie administrative district (village) in Longtang Zhen, 73 yuan were raised on a per capita basis to fund school construction. Nanyin Village has yet to achieve grain self-sufficiency; 60 percent of the peasant households find it necessary to sell off some of their grain to eke out a living. To help pay for a two-story teaching building for the village elementary school, every peasant was required to come up with 75 yuan (stones and rocks extra). This and other burdens make life a struggle for many peasants. Their children are forced to quit school because they don't have the money to pay their tuition. 2. Growing sugar cane an unprofitable proposition for peasants. Sugar cane is a leading cash crop in rural Hainan. Since the beginning of last year, however, the demand for sugar cane has stagnated and prices have dropped to 1,800 yuan per ton. Sugar cane procurement prices too have been adjusted downward three times, from 130 to 100 yuan per ton. Furthermore, peasants were issued IOUs as government fell behind in payment for months. Between the pressing season of 1992 and that of 1993, sugar cane growers in the province were owed almost 100 million yuan, or 30.4 yuan per ton. As sugar refineries fell into arrears, the peasants experienced difficulty paying off their loans on time even as their interest payments mounted month after month, which translated into yet another heavy burden on them. Between the pressing seasons of 1992 and 1993, the prices of refined white sugar skyrocketed to more than 2,300 yuan a ton. Yet the sugar cane procurement price remained 100 yuan or so. Furthermore, the prices of agricultural capital goods have risen sharply since last year, pushing up production costs steadily. Then there are the "12 worms in every sugar cane," meaning that 12 fees have to be paid during the entire process from the moment the cane is cut through shipment to its sale. Everybody, including the despatcher, the truck driver, the quality inspector, and the person in charge of weighing the cane, tries to extort some money from the cane grower. Paying off all these people can set him back between 80 and 100 yuan per mu of land cultivated with sugar cane. According to calculations, once the yield of his sugar cane fields drops below 3 tons per mu, a grower cannot expect to make a profit. The underpricing of sugar cane at the procurement level has dampened the enthusiasm of peasants for growing this particular crop. Sugar cane mismanagement has now become commonplace in many localities, with numerous peasants giving up on management or planning to switch to other crops. According to statistics compiled by the appropriate departments, a decline in sugar cane output in Hainan this year is a foregone conclusion. 3. Taxes on pigs, cattle, and sheep excessive. For every pig slaughtered, a peasant in Qiongzhong County is required to pay a total of 39.4 yuan to five agencies, specifically, 11 yuan to the food department, 16.5 yuan to the industry and commerce administrative bureau, 6.6 yuan to the tax agency, 3.3 yuan to the animal husbandry department, and 2 yuan to the environmental protection agency. In Qionghai Shi, it costs a peasant anywhere from 27 yuan to 32 yuan to slaughter a pig, including 6.6 yuan in slaughtering tax, 11 yuan in industrial and commercial administrative fees, 2 yuan in environmental protection fee, 1 yuan in epidemic prevention fee, 0.4 yuan in slaughtering charge, and 5 yuan in slaughtering fee. Some departments are given to raising the standards for calculating fees arbitrarily. With no authorization, a certain provincial-level department went ahead anyway and issued a directive raising the environmental protection fees for slaughtering pigs, cattle, and sheep from a uniform 0.5 yuan to 1, 2, or 3 yuan, depending on whether the animal is a pig, cattle, or sheep, and passed on this extra burden to the producers (peasants). It takes a lot of hard work by the peasant to raise a pig, but he makes hardly a penny in profit after selling the animal. 4. Too many fees and charges imposed on the fishery industry. According to the survey report by the agricultural commission of Qionghai Shi, the following fees and charges are imposed on fishermen in Tangyu Zhen by the various departments involved: 1) Each year the township government collects from every fisherman 50 yuan in harbor construction fee and 5 yuan in military pension fund; 2) the administrative district (village) collects 15 yuan in accumulation fund annually, along with another 15 yuan in management fund; 3) the fishery supervisory board collects 10.8 yuan for every unit of horsepower. With one worker being equivalent to seven units of horsepower, that amounts to a levy of 75.6 yuan; 4) the environmental protection agency collects an environmental resource protection fee each year on the basis of 5 yuan per unit of horsepower, which translates into an average of 35 yuan; 5) the police sub-station collects a law and order fee at the rate of 3 yuan per person per year; 6) the provincial shipping inspection department collects an annual inspection fee which ranges from 220 yuan to 250 yuan per vessel, or 22 to 25 yuan per person on the average; 7) a new vessel registration and certification fee is also levied, which could be anywhere from 300 to 400 yuan. The burden on fishermen averages 708 yuan per person per year, about 8.5 percent of the total per capita income (including taxes). The extra-tax burden is 308 yuan, or 3.7 percent of the total income. 5. Too many charges on agricultural vehicles. An array of fees is collected on the walking tractor used in the countryside, including 11 fees authorized by the provincial price bureau and three provided for by the provincial transportation department, not to mention other payments required by the provincial finance department and industry and commerce bureau. When a peasant purchases a walking tractor before entering the rural transportation business, he is required under the law to pay 975.8 yuan in taxes each year. In fact, he must dish out much more. According to a survey by the agricultural commission of Lingshui County, he who owns a pedicab must pay 11 fees in addition to shelling out 1,645 yuan in taxes. 6. Overly high rural electric rates. The cost of electricity exceeds 1 yuan per kilowatt-hour in the countryside in most municipalities and counties in Hainan. It costs an average of 1.3 yuan per kwh in the two counties of Qiongshan and Chengmai, 1.35 yuan in Qionghai Shi, as much as 2 yuan per kwh in some townships and towns, and a whopping 4 yuan in a handful of townships. Hence this strange spectacle in some villages --people lighting kerosene lamps to watch TV. The high costs of electricity are mainly caused by: 1) the mismanagement of the power industry. The industry is over-staffed, circuits are poorly designed, equipment is obsolete, and waste is considerable; 2) rural power supply stations continue to charge fees as they please. In Qionghai Shi, for instance, peasants are already paying for the acquisition and installation of rural electric meters. On top of that, however, some township and town power bureaus collect a meter fee at the rate of 1 yuan per meter. As there are more than 60,000 meters in the city, this levy alone generates an additional 720,000 yuan. 7. The high costs of health care in the countryside. The prices of drugs and medical care have shot up rapidly in recent years. In addition, a handful of rural hospitals have been imposing or raising fees indiscriminately. The result is hefty health care bills for peasants. As the masses in Ledong county tell it, ever since rural hospitals introduced a new system under which the hospital pays the basic wages and the technical office takes care of subsidies, bonuses, and other wages, the technical office has been charging all manner of fees arbitrarily. To enhance their incomes, doctors have all their patients undergo a full check-up and every laboratory test available regardless of the severity of their illness. They also over-prescribe. If you have a cold, a visit to the doctor can cost you anywhere from a dozen yuan to a hundred yuan. 8. The proliferation of fees, charges, fund-raising schemes, and apportionments proliferate. There has been an explosion of fees, charges, fund-raising schemes, and apportionments in the countryside, with numerous agencies getting in the act. Taxes collected by the state have not gone up by much, but local levies, fees, charges, fund-raising, and apportionments are legion. According to peasants in Qionghai Shi, marriage registration entails the payment of five fees: marriage certificate fee, 9 yuan; sponsor fee, 20 yuan; physical check-up fee, 25.5 yuan; fetus protection fee, 20 yuan; and frequency modulation trumpet fee, 58 yuan. The combined price tag is 132.5 yuan. Studies show that some counties have written regulations requiring every peasant household to pay a 1-yuan law and order fee, with another yuan payable to the administrative district (village). Besides apportioning construction investment funds among the peasant households, some villages also collect funds to pay for bridges, roads, wells, cultural centers, communal temples, and ancestral halls. 9. Hidden burden getting heavier. Following steep increases in the prices of agricultural capital goods since the beginning of the year, agricultural production costs have gone up significantly. Between January and June this year the prices of agricultural capital goods soared 37.1 percent compared to the corresponding period a year ago. Specifically, the prices of chemical fertilizers shot up 56.1 percent; oil for use in farm machinery, 78.7 percent; and small farm tools, 25.4 percent. In contrast, the market price of grain (rice) rose just 23 percent in the January-June period over the same period last year. The production costs of early season rice this year are projected to exceed those of last year by 40 percent or so, leaving little profit for grain-growing peasants. Causes 1. Misconceptions spreading unchecked. As the old institutions give way to the new, the pleasure-seeking habit of some cadres provides fertile soil for money worship. Amidst funding contracting, some departments and units have been scrambling to raise revenue in each and every way possible, officially to increase the wages and benefits of their workers but actually to line their own pockets and satisfy their own greed. Concocting various contexts and relying on their power and position, some power organs at the township and town level force peasants to part with their hard-earned money, even compelling them to sell their livestock and deducting money from the sums payable to the peasants in return for the grain they turn over to the government. Some municipal, county, and township agencies try to outdo one another. Whatever one jurisdiction levies, others want to do likewise. The idea is to collect the most fees and charges and offer the most benefits. As a result, fees and charges overlap one another, expenses are apportioned indiscriminately, and funds are raised in a disorderly manner. All these trends have become commonplace. 2. Many public welfare projects are being undertaken with no bearing to reality. With the introduction of the household responsibility system of linking remuneration to output in the countryside after the 3d Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the peasants' living standards have indeed risen markedly. On the whole, however, most peasants have just enough to eat and wear; the truly affluent peasants are few and far between. In some localities, the officials overestimate the extent of wealth among the peasants and consequently mistake unripe conditions to be just the opposite. Divorcing themselves from reality and ignoring objective conditions, with no regard for the level of development of the local economy, they blindly pursue big projects and grand projects and indiscriminately go after "upgrading," all in the name of reaching some standards in everything they do, whether it be building an elementary school, a nursing home, or a nursery school. Even after a project meets the standards, there are new demands. For instance, after a school was built according to specifications, there were demands for "six coordinations" or "ten coordinations" and calls for the construction of a school of the garden style. Where does the money come from? Since the government refuses to pay, the costs have to be passed onto the peasants. Caught up in the social climate of putting money before everything else, some departments and units have come to regard as a commodity what should rightly be provided as a service and demand that peasants pay for it. 3. Organizational over-staffing. The emphasis in institutional organization on having an identical lineup of agencies or departments at every level is an important reason why fee-collection, apportionment of expenses, and fund-raising have gone out of hand. In recent years there has been a mindless preoccupation with institutional matching, meaning that when a municipality or county sets up a bureau, townships insist on having a station or center staffed with full-time workers. The result is a rise in the off-budget staffing level in townships. Nowadays one can typically find more than a dozen departments with almost 60 workers in a township. More offices mean more staffers and a heavier burden on peasants. 4. Shortfall in educational funding. The shortfall in educational funding is a major problem facing society today, with the shortage being particularly acute at the township level. One cannot complain when rural schools in poverty-stricken areas try to stay afloat, improve the conditions in which they operate, and close the gap in their budgets by imposing a number of charges as appropriate. However, some rural schools have overstepped the bounds of reasonableness by collecting too many charges, thus making the burden on peasants even more onerous. 5. Poor quality of cadres Most complaints in the countryside these days have to do with three trends. One is wining and dining, with rural grassroots cadres being the worst offenders. By spending lavishly on food and drinks, they have created a leading public evil. Second, everybody is going in for ostentation and extravagance and trying to outdo one another on that score. The standards are getting more and more stringent. Third, a covert form of greed is spreading. The cadres in some villages (administrative districts) line their personal pockets with public funds. Using all kinds of pretexts and in every way possible, they infringe upon public properties and the peasants' interests. Some of the off-budget personnel are of an exceptionally poor quality. They have little awareness of the concept of the law and some have been assigned to their jobs without any training. The result is that they break the law frequently. In recent years, municipalities, counties, townships, and villages (administrative districts) have all been making their own home-grown policies. Although both the State Council and provincial government have issued repeated orders demanding that the burden on peasants be lessened, a number of grassroots cadres have chosen to ignore such orders and, driven by private interests, continue to try to balance their budgets on the peasants' backs by levying charges on them and apportioning expenses and raising funds among them in an arbitrary manner. 6. There is no adequate effective supervision and inspection. It is the responsibility of the price, finance, and auditing departments to investigate the "three indiscriminates," that is, the indiscriminate levying of charges, indiscriminate apportionment of expenses, and indiscriminate fund-raising. In reality nobody wants to get involved because of the resistance and many difficulties encountered. Moreover, cooperation is lacking among the agencies. There are cases in which fees are collected, expenses apportioned, and funds raised in blatant violation of the national policy, yet such acts are authorized by or have the blessing of leading organs at the same level of government. The prices, finance, and auditing agencies have neither the power to investigate nor the courage to report to the authorities above. So the trends are allowed to go unchecked and the "three indiscriminates" get worse and worse. Meanwhile, the burden on peasants becomes heavier and heavier.
