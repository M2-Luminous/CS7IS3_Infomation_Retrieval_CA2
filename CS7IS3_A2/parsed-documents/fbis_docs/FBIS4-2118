The tourists, along with six mainland crew members and two guides, died in a fire on board a tourist vessel during a cruise on Qiandao Hu, or Thousand Island Lake, in the central province of Zhejiang. News of the mishap was suppressed for two days. The ire of the relatives of the victims was further raised when they learned that autopsies had been carried out on the bodies on Monday [4 April] without their permission. The relatives' demands to examine the boat and to move the corpses to Hangzhou, from where they could be flown back to Taiwan, were also rejected by mainland authorities. Instead the relatives were restricted to a hotel by the authorities. Chinese New Party legislator Jaw Shau-kong, in a written inquiry to the Executive Yuan, said the government should not be hesitant to suspend the ongoing private exchanges across the Taiwan Strait should Beijing fail to resolve problems arising from the incident. "The denial of the relatives demands is consistent with the Chinese Communists' ignorance of human rights," Jaw said. "The government should not sit idle, but should help the relatives." Chin Han-sheng, director of the Kuomintang Cultural Affairs Department, also lambasted the mainland officials. "Beijing has every responsibility to clarify the myths surrounding the deaths, but all it has done over the past few days has been muddleheaded and careless. Meanwhile, the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] held an emergency meeting Tuesday to draw up countermeasures. After the meeting, MAC Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian issued a statement saying, "the mainland authorities should carefully handle the matter so as not to hurt the feelings of Taiwan residents and the ties between the two sides. He also said Taiwan reporters should be allowed to report on the incident, and that officials of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) should be permitted to go to the mainland to provide the relatives with humanitarian assistance. The semi-official SEF was organized to handle private exchanges between Taiwan and the mainland in the absence of official contacts.
