It must be the common aim of all democrats and Europeans to achieve a high turnout, a clear yes in favor of a strong European Parliament, a democratic Europe of self-confident and coresponsible citizens. [applause] For this reason, I would like to appeal to the voters urgently: Please go to the polls on 12 June to help strengthen the new Europe in those fields that are particularly important, that is, citizens' rights and its parliament. [applause] Anyone wanting a Europe of citizens, not a Europe of technocrats, will have to vote for this at the voting booth, not in the pub. Anyone wanting peace and prosperity for us Germans in a common European future, will have to vote on 12 June and make it clear that for us there is no return to an unfortunate, nationalist past. But above all, and I do not hesitate to state this clearly here in the Bundestag, right-wing extremism must not get a chance. [applause] I am saying this as your foreign minister, because I have to deal with the nasty picture these unfortunate happenings in the right-wing extremist field here in Germany have generated abroad. And I know what I am talking about. I was the one who was standing at open graves in Turkey, experiencing the reaction. We could take this as an example here. Ladies and gentlemen, we should also state more clearly what we owe the EU. Or does anyone believe that the explosion of our prosperity, our international reputation, or our reunification would have been possible as it has been, if we had not been a member of this community of free European nations? Our exports to the European Economic Area increased by double the amount of those to the rest of the world. And there is no big industrial country in the world that is so dependent on one single region as Germany is on Europe. Most people are not aware of this. [applause] We are not only the biggest net payers, but also the biggest net exporters. And the EU welcomed our people in the new laender immediately and with open arms, and it will support them with more than 30 billion German marks [DM] until 1999. This is an enormous sum from the structural funds destined for the poorer countries in the EU. One cannot say, therefore, that nothing comes back from this Europe, particularly to the new laender. On the contrary. Let me also remind you that, due to their cross-border connections, a lot of money is flowing to the new laender from the program destined for the Central and East European countries. I would also like to remind you that Delors and other members of the European Commission have repeatedly gone to the new laender to see the situation there and give specific help with reconstruction. And please do not forget the share that the European countries, our partners, have contributed in terms of direct investment in the new laender. This needs to be said as well. [applause] I have just come back from the Baltic Sea Conference in Talinn. And I can only tell you that the other Central and East European countries envy us, and they are almost forcing their way into this community. Things can, therefore, not be all that bad in this Union. In the new European Parliament, Germany will no longer have 81, but 99 delegates. And for the first time -- this is all too easily forgotten -- the citizens in the new laender will elect their European Parliament members direct. And I would also like to say, especially in my capacity as foreign minister, it befits us Germans to return to this Europe that has shown us a lot of solidarity, some things we have received from the EU and our partners and friends since the end of the war. [applause] This does not mean that we are supposed to play the paymaster. Rather, it means that we should reject going a special German way and bring all our weight to bear in the EU. More than ever, it constitutes -- all the faultfinders must not forget this -- the hope for the future for the peoples of the whole of Central and East Europe. Looking at the international unions, no matter whether it is the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, NAFTA, ASEAN, or what else there is in this world -- by the way, unions that were also established because the others realized that one cannot manage any longer alone as a nation -- looking at these unions and the picture of Europe, at this EU, from the outside, we see that we are envied for this European Community, its capacity, and what it has brought us. I say it once again: This EU cannot be so bad! We should refrain from criticizing this union all the time in an alarmist, faultfinding, and defeatist way to the outside, and inside it and -- which needs to be said -- before the election. [applause] Of course, one can and may criticize this union. There are undesirable developments everywhere, also in Brussels. I can only say that many things, but not everything can be criticized in this Europe. Indeed, I do so myself and I witness undesirable developments every day. Some things that were overdone in the European zeal of harmonization have to be cleared out. We resolutely advocate that subsidiarity really results in more free space for the citizens and the strengthening of the cities and regions. In practice, however, this cannot be achieved overnight. However, it is quite a different matter if some blame one while, in reality, mean the other. It is unfortunately true that the rejection of European integration as a whole is basically hidden behind some justified individual criticism. I was also not very happy about the difficult course of the negotiations for membership of the four countries of the European Free Trade Association. Speaking frankly, I am concerned when I think about the further course in taking the Central and East European countries into this union. Sometimes one plays with fire in this respect. We do not need to go to Bosnia to understand this. One must be struck with blindness if one does not realize that after its reunification, Germany needs its neighbors' trust in its European way of thinking more than ever before. [applause] Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time this country is only surrounded by friends. We are the country in the EU with the most neighbors. It has never been the case in our history to surrounded only by friends. However, I also tell you that he who wants friends has to cultivate friends. [applause] Here our special relationship with France is very important. It is not only the driving force behind the work of European unification. It is, so to speak, the pledge of what Thomas Mann called a European Germany. We do not want to exchange all that again for a twisted course that some are propagating and that would inevitably result again in alliances and counteralliances in Europe. It is the priority foreign policy task of reunified Germany to prevent this, because one can say one thing without presumption: A joint European house, which we so much like to talk about, can only be developed with vigorous German support. If there is an outstanding German responsibility to history after the fulfillment of our national dream, it is the responsibility for this structure. Mr. Scharping, your criticism that we do not consistently advocate Delors' White Paper is simply wrong. Yes, you are, of course, right that the creation of jobs is at issue. However, because of my daily exertion, I can only tell you that we are really making great efforts to help translate exactly Delors' White Paper into reality. With the European action plan for growth and development, we have set the course for the creation of 17 million jobs in Europe by 2000 and it will be at the top of our agenda for the European presidency. You know exactly that what we need is Europe's new competitiveness in the world. But what we do not need are the investment programs out of yesterday's rag-bag because investments have to pay off and be privately financed. We do not want a state economy. With a view to what you have said, Mr. Scharping, I also ask you, of course: Who continues to oppose the privatization of large sectors of our economy? Who is calling all the time for state spending programs? Who is inhibiting investments here and in Europe? At any rate, it is not us. I think that this was rightly pointed out before. The criticism that we do not feel bound to the social market economy is wrong. For what other reason did the FRG Government so massively advocate the social protocol for the Maastricht Treaty? We do not accept these reproaches! [applause] Ladies and gentlemen; Germany will take over the EU Presidency in over a month. France will succeed us. In more than 20 working meetings of a special working group, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and I have prepared what we intend to carry out jointly within a year of the troika. I think it is a good opportunity for us to have a chance to work together for a year. It is a good situation, and it is very important for our presidency to prepare the course to be pursued until the review conference in 1996. Much of what is disputed among member states must be solved in Franco-German cooperation, and it must be solved in a way that is acceptable for all member states. It is a stroke of luck for both nations and for the whole of Europe that we have this close partnership. The France-German relationship must and will be the driving force of European integration. [applause] What will be the points on which our presidency will be focused? First, 17 million unemployed in Europe are a problem that overshadows everything else. So economic growth must be achieved and new competitive jobs must be created. We will do everything in our power to push things in Europe and in our country. There is a ray of light and hope regarding economic recovery not only in Germany, but also in a number of other European countries. The second point on which the German presidency will be focused will be ensuring peace, prosperity, and stability on the whole continent. With the European Parliament giving the go-ahead for the accession of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway, the way has been paved for a larger core Europe, which will be able to resolutely cope with the completion of European integration. German and European interests cannot be divided in this respect. [applause] Neither we nor our West European partners can in the long run be well off, if our European neighbors in the East are badly off. The EU's ostpolitik until the turn of the millennium must be based on this realization. Germany will remain an advocate of European, not West European, thought. This will be the central task of German foreign policy in the coming years. [applause] Third, the strengthening of cooperation in internal and justice policy will be a touchstone of whether our citizens see the EU in connection with drugs and organized crime or as a gain in personal and professional chances in life. It is unacceptable that international drug traffickers and money launderers should be more successful than the police. We must combat international crime effectively, meaning beyond the borders and within the European framework. If we do not want to lose the people's support for our Europe policy, we need to have concrete progress in the development of Europol and a common asylum, refugee, and immigration policy. But, ladies and gentlemen, speaking about internal security, I must tell you that there is something that increasingly annoys me. I am annoyed at the fact that the impression has been created time and again that the problems we have in this area could be solved through the easy way of new laws. This holds true for the FRG and Europe. We must tell the people that this is the wrong conclusion. I am also annoyed at the fact that the impression has been created that the Federal Government, with its ministers and the federal chancellor, are primarily responsible for combating crime in this country. I want to stress -- and I say so in view of my former activities -- that it is primarily the laender that are responsible for combating crime in this country, namely, the minister-presidents and the interior and justice ministers. [applause] It has relatively little to do with the legislative work of the federal government, but it is a problem of practical police work. [shouts] Yes, parliament is responsible for the laws, but the land parliaments are also responsible, and not just the Bundestag. Ladies and gentlemen; in Europe today, German interests, like French, Italian, or British interests, are intertwined interests. We will serve them best by bringing them in line with those of our partners. We will be guided by this principle in our presidency. I tell you, Germany will be closely watched as to how it will carry out this first presidency for the old and new federal laender on behalf of Germany. We must work very hard, and I promise we will do everything in our power to represent our country well to the outside world, and we will work to advance Europe. [applause]
