The coalition has reportedly arrived at a consensus on continuing consultations on the premise that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata be jointly supported as the single candidate for the premiership which Hosokawa abruptly quit last Friday [8 April]. After days of infighting since last Friday, the two rival camps -- one led by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the other led by Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) -- voiced their wishes yesterday to restore their unity and to agree to nominate Hata to succeed Hosokawa, the sources said. The SDP-led caucus also includes the new party Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Democratic Socialist Party. It is pitted against the Shinseito-led bloc that includes Komeito (Clean Government Party), the Japan New Party (JNP) and the United Social Democratic Party. The move toward reconciliation apparently reflects the failure of either coalition camp to find a prime ministerial candidate who could gain enough votes from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to emerge on top. "I'm pretty sure we can resolve our problems and maintain our coalition government," SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said yesterday. Kubo's Shinseito counterpart, Ichiro Ozawa, told reporters, "everything is going in the right direction," indicating the bikering among the coalition partners over the choice of Hosokawa's successor was ending. Because of this new development, chances slimmed markedly for senior LDP member Michio Watanabe to run for the office of the new prime minister. Watanabe, a former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, was tipped one of the most promising contenders for the premiership if he bolted from the LDP with enough followers to join hands with the Shinseito-led camp. However, the Shinseito camp began yesterday to abandon their plans to back Watanabe in view of the slim possibility of his leaving the largest opposition party to team up with them. Inside the coalition, the two rival camps had separately tried to woo members of the LDP, which lost power last summer after an uninterrupted 38 years of single-party rule. None of the three groups -- the two coalition camps and the LDP -- has the parliamentary majority necessary to choose the next prime minister on its own. The Shinseito-led faction only has 157 members in the 511-seat House of Representatives. So a reneging Watanabe would have had to persuade at least 95 LDP members to vote for him to add to the support from the Shinseito-led camp. But Watanabe had reportedly collected only some 20 signatories willing to defect by the time he gave up his bid for the top government post. Despite the broad agreement in the ruling coalition, differences reportedly remain over the procedures for settling the successor issue. It has not been decided yet whether the matter will be addressed in a forum of secretaries general of the coalition parties, or through direct talks among the leaders of all the seven ruling parties. The SDP-led block abhors Shinseito's Ozawa, the main strategist in the Hosokawa administration. It has been insisting on a meeting of all coalition leaders, apparently in an attempt to prevent shinseito's Ozawa and his main political ally, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa from taking the lead in the picking of a replacement for Hosokawa. Shinseito and Komeito, for their part, remain adamant contending for a secretaries general-level caucus to discuss the matter first.
