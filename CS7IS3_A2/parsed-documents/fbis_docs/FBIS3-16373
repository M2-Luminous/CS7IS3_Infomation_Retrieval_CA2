Like many others, it had a number without any identifiable meaning added to its name--Svobodnyy-18. But almost everybody in Amur Oblast called it simply and plainly the "rocket city." A mysterious and apparently very serious military unit was stationed here. At the time of conversion and across-the-board cutbacks in the armed forces, the situation at Svobodnyy-18 became so bad that its troubles spilled far outside the bounds of the secret territory. This was no longer a "rocket bulwark of the motherland;" the servicemen who stayed suffered together with their families from poor food supply, inadequate heating in their homes, and other everyday problems. Now the oblast has received the news that the government has instructed appropriate organizations to develop a project for the construction of a space launch site in the Russian Far East, and the base for the "Amur Baykonur" will be Svobodnyy-18. The base's facilities have already been transferred to the military space forces. Head of the Amur Oblast administration Vladimir Polevanov confirmed a few days ago in a public address the seriousness of the government's intent to launch space vessels from the territory entrusted to him. As AMURSKAYA PRAVDA reported, the Amur governor took advantage of Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev's recent visit to the oblast to send two memoranda to Boris Yeltsin. In one, B. Polevanov invited the president to visit Amur Oblast, and in the other he asked the president on behalf of Amur Oblast residents to speed up the signing of the edict on the construction of a space launch site in the designated area. He even made a suggestion to Boris Nikolayevich on what to call the future facility: "Svobodnyy Russian Space Launch Center." Meanwhile, oblast residents are not unanimous in accepting the need to build a space launch site here. A lot of concerns in this respect are being voiced by representatives of the "greens," environmental science specialists, State Duma deputies, and ordinary citizens. At their request Leonid Korotkov, a Russian parliament deputy from Amur Oblast, began with the help of experts a careful study of the current environmental situation in the area of all three space launch sites that existed on the territory of the former USSR. So far the information he has collected is extremely discouraging. The oblast public is waiting for detailed data on potential changes in the ecological situation in connection with the space launch site construction. Depending on the results, the president will be informed of the true reaction of Amur Oblast residents. Sergey Leskov, IZVESTIYA The idea of building a launch site equal to Baykonur has been discussed increasingly often lately. The reason is simple--Russia and Kazakhstan still cannot agree on mutually acceptable terms for utilizing the largest space complex in the world built in the Aral steppes. As to construction of a space launch station in the area of Blagoveshchensk, where the disbanded rocket forces used to be stationed, the main argument in its favor is its geographic location. Although Svobodnyy-18 is located on a more northern latitude than Baykonur, it is still in the southernmost region of the territory of Russia. Launch site proximity to the equator saves fuel in the process of putting the craft into orbit and in all countries is considered one of the most important factors in choosing a launch site. In confidential conversations officials note that the new launch site will open the way for Russia to enter the fast developing market of space services in Southeast Asia. It is believed in the Russian Space Agency [RSA], however, that these pluses are offset by Amur Oblast's considerable distance from space infrastructure facilities. According to RSA Deputy General Director Boris Ostroumov, construction of a major space launch site in the Far East would be tantamount to building it out of diamonds. Given the paucity of the Russian space budget, a realistic approach, in the RSA's opinion, would be to preserve and maintain existing facilities. There is still hope of reaching an accommodation with Kazakhstan. On 10 March a Russian delegation, headed by RSA General Director Yuriy Koptev, left for another round of negotiations in Almaty. There are also technical capabilities for expanding the functions of the northern space launch site in Plesetsk, although each start from there requires 10-15 percent more fuel as compared to Baykonur. The extra costs would be greatest in launching heavy rockets of the Proton and Energiya type from Plesetsk. At this point the question of building a space launch site in Amur Oblast is far from finalized. The initiative for this idea comes from the military, which for quite understandable reasons would like to continue utilizing the former rocket base. As of today there is only an instruction to study the technical proposal for construction of the space launch site, but definitely not a government order for the project design. The situation will possibly become clearer after 14 March, when a Ministry of Defense commission headed by Colonel General Vladimir Ivanov, head of the military space troops, will visit the site of the Svobodnyy-18 military base. The Ministry of Defense prefers not make any comment until it examines the facilities of the potential space launch site.
