Incremental from baseline to option 1 $227.87 $2.10 Incremental from option 1 to option 2 2 121,746 2 6,232 Incremental from option 2 to option 3/S 2 12,513 2 215.86 Incremental from option 3/S to option 3 6,790 71,252 Incremental from option 3 to option 4 3 undefined 3 undefined Incremental from option 4 to option 5 3 undefined 3 undefined 1 Dollar values are in constant 1981 dollars for comparison with other rules. 2 Options are ranked by increasing levels of pollutant removals. Negative cost-effectiveness numbers mean that costs have decreased from the previous option, while removals have increased, improving cost-effectiveness. This increase in removals at a lower cost makes Option 1 and Option 2 inefficient in comparison to Option 3/S. 3 These options result in additional costs with no additional removals. Therefore, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (incremental cost/incremental removals) is infinite. As can be seen from the above tables, the cost-effectiveness of Option 1 is $2.10 per pound-equivalent of pollutant removed. Option 1 is relatively cost-effective when compared to the cost-effectiveness values of other effluent limitations guidelines. Movement from Option 1 to Option 2 and from Option 2 to Option 3/S is cost-effective relative to Option 1 because costs are reduced while removals increase. Movement from Option 3/S to Option 3 is less efficient than movement from Option 1 to Option 2 or from Option 2 to Option 3/S. The average cost-effectiveness of Option 3 is $1.79 per pound-equivalent and for Option 3/S is $1.68. Options 4 and 5 are not cost-effective as they result in additional costs with no additional removals relative to Option 3. Option 3/S is the most cost-effective option. Successive improvements in weighted removals are achieved at progressively lower costs by moving from Option 1 through Option 2 to Option 3/S. Further movement from Option 3/S to Options 3, 4 or 5 provides minor additional removals at substantially higher marginal cost. The costs and removals resulting from the two regulatory options considered for Subcategory E facilities are presented in Table 16 below. Option 1, the proposed option is expected to be met with no additional compliance costs, therefore its cost-effectiveness is zero. Option 2 requires additional costs but results in no additional removals, so its cost-effectiveness value is undefined.

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) calls for the Agency to prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) for regulations that have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The purpose of the Act is to ensure that, while achieving statutory goals, government regulations do not impose disproportionate impacts on small entities. The implications of the Regulatory Flexibility Act are discussed below for facilities regulated under Subcategory C. No economic impacts on small entities are projected for Subcategory E.
