Security Council unless it is resolved by Feb. 21 when the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] convenes a Board of Directors meeting. Han made the prediction in an interview with Japanese correspondents stationed in Seoul, the KYODO news service reported Thursday. Han also explained that even if North Korea agrees to IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, the agency will now have to undertake much more thorough and additional inspections as continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea has already broken, KYODO said. Han said he expects some kind of results will emerge from the IAEA-North Korean negotiations on the inspection within next week. Han added that they could be either positive or negotiative, KYODO said.
