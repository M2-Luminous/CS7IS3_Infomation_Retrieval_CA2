FBIS4-59976 "drnes097_l_94002" FBIS-NES-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 ISRAEL Protest Lodged Over PLO-UNDP Agreement Protest Lodged Over PLO-UNDP Agreement TA1805140294 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 18 May 94 p A4 TA1805140294 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] [Text] Israel demands that the agreement signed recently by the PLO and the UNDP [UN Development Program] be amended, seeing that Faruq Qaddumi signed it with the title "foreign minister of Palestine." As it was signed, the agreement gives the PLO a status in the entire West Bank, and not just in Jericho. The UNDP, which specializes in extending aid to developing countries, has been operating in the territories for many years in coordination with Israel financing economic and agricultural development programs. The establishment of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho required a change in the UNDP's status in the Palestinian Authority areas. The Gaza-Jericho agreement stipulates that the PLO may sign agreements concerning development programs and economic aid to the Palestinians with countries and international organizations on behalf of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli UN delegation came across the PLO-UNDP agreement last week and reported it to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. Israel lodged a harsh protest with the UNDP over the agreement, which contrary to what had been promised, was not coordinated with it. Israel argued that the agreement contravenes the Israeli-PLO accords, that Qaddumi's title of foreign minister of Palestine contravenes UN resolutions, and that it transpires from the agreement that the PLO is the source of authority in all the territories and not just in Gaza and Jericho. At the same time, Israel asked the United States to help it pressure the UN not to pass a resolution ratifying the agreement and to prevent a precedent which could be emulated in other agreements between the PLO and international organizations. UN officials sent a message to Israel apologizing for the error, noting that they had gave in to PLO pressure to sign the draft agreement, and asserting that the UN will send a letter to the PLO informing it that there has been no "recognition" of Qaddumi's status as foreign minister and that the agreement will only apply to Gaza and Jericho. Political sources in Jerusalem said yesterday that the Palestinians have been trying to sneak "symbols of sovereignty" into Gaza and Jericho. For example, contrary to what had been agreed upon, the word "national" appears on the badges worn by Palestinian policemen on their sleeves and a sign bearing the inscription "The Palestine Police" was hung on the police building in Gaza. The assessment in internal consultations held by the Foreign Ministry is that the Palestinians will attempt to use the offices of the donor countries in Jericho to maintain external relations with them. The Gaza-Jericho agreement bans the Palestinian Authority from maintaining external relations or opening embassies in its territory or in other countries.
