Cetin said the following: [Begin Cetin recording] Our ambassador has been instructed to apply to NATO, and the application has been made. Turkey was the first to apply to NATO to call the NATO Council to a meeting on the issue. Instructions were also given to apply to the UN Security Council on the issue of lifting the arms embargo.

Pointing out that Turkey's continued support strengthens the Bosnians, (Drakovic) added that grief caused by Saturday's [5 February] attack can be seen on the faces of the Turkish people.
