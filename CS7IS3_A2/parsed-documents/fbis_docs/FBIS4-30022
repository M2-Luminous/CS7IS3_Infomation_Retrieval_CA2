The closure of the border point on April 9 following fighting between Cambodian government forces and Khmer Rouge guerrillas has hurt Thai traders and caused hardship to the Cambodians. Tourism has also slumped. Earlier, the border was set to be reopened on June 1 but minor hitches delayed this by a month. An agreement to reopen the border was signed yesterday after successful talks between the Cambodian delegation led by Banteay Meanchey Governor Gen Duong Khem and the 12th Army Division commander Gen Lai Vira and Thai representatives headed by Sa Kaeo Governor Kasem Chaiyasit and Burapha Task Force commander Maj-Gen Niphon Pharunnit. Governor Kasem said although fighting had scaled down in Cambodia, stray shells still fell occasionally on the Thai side, causing damage to property and inflicting casualties. Maj-Gen Niphon said he had proposed the setting up of a Thai- Cambodian coordinating office to deal with cross-border robbery and banditry by armed Cambodians. Banteay Meanchey police chief Pol Maj [Police Major] Mar Putthou said Highway 5 from Poipet to Sisophon was under military protection and safe for travel. At the crossing yesterday about 5,000 traders and villagers from both sides gathered at the border checkpoint, hoping to cross the border to resume their trade. But their hopes faded as officials barred them from crossing.
