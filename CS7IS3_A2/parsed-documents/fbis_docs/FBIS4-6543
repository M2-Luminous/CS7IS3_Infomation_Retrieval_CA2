Furthermore, with the rapid rise in the yen, wages in dollars considerably exceed the United States, and the environment surrounding the manufacturing industry has become grim. 3) The relative price structure among the Japanese export, industrial , and consumption goods and service sectors has a unique distortion viewed internationally. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to correct the high yen and seriously undertake relaxation of regulations. Conversion of Purchasing Power Parity by Sector Necessary In the 11 January issue of this newspaper, there was an article entitled: Come Back Manufacturing Industry; Common Sense Lies Seen in Data and Common Sense 3 Equals High Productivity and Efficiency. Although the productivity of the Japanese manufacturing industry is high in commonsense terms, it was no more than 77 percent that of the United States in 1990 according to an analysis by the Japan Productivity Center. Basically, however, it is correct to view that Japan is higher than the United States as "common sense" dictates. The Productivity Center converts the value added of the manufacturing industry by the purchasing power parity (PPP) of the whole nation to calculate productivity. In the international comparison of physical productivity, calculating by PPP is certainly closer to the real situation than conversion by the exchange rate. However, this differs according to industrial sector. The purchasing power parity of the manufacturing industry, which is a ratio of the respective nation's total amount of money in the identical U.S. and Japanese manufacturing industry product baskets, should be markedly higher than the agricultural product basket. Making an international comparison of productivity by industry ignoring the differences in purchasing power parity among such sectors becomes a misleading basis. However, it is difficult to measure directly the purchasing power parity of the manufacturing industry. Therefore, if the purchasing power parity of the manufacturing industry for 1991 is calculated using the U.S. and Japanese industrial product wholesale prices with the second quarter of 1973 as the starting point for approximation, $1 is equal to 154.5 yen. On the other hand, the purchasing power parity of the GDP (gross domestic product) on an OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) basis was $1 equals 193 yen in 1991. The most recent point in time when the U.S. and Japanese GDP were known by industry was 1991. The GDP per employed person in the manufacturing industry in that year was 8.434 million yen for Japan and $50,220 for the United States. If this is converted by GDP purchasing power parity, Japan is 87 percent of the United States. It certainly is low, but if it were the manufacturing industry, Japan is higher than the United States at 109 percent. This is closer to the real situation. It seems that Japan is slightly higher even adding labor time (the labor time of manufacturing industry production workers is a little over 7 percent lower for the United States). The figures of the Productivity Center are widely used by Nikkeiren (Japan Federation of Employers' Associations) and others, but it is probably necessary to be cautious on that problem point. Cost Increases With High Yen and Manufacturing Industry Hollowing Out According to national income statistics, however, employee income per person in the manufacturing industry in 1991 was 4.635 million yen for Japan and $37,049 for the United States. The exchange rate for 1991 was $1 equals 134.54 yen. It should be converted by this from the viewpoint of international competition, and the Japanese wage level is 93 percent that of the United States. That means Japan enjoyed high productivity, low wages, and rather comfortable management. However, the situation changed completely with the high yen later. Supposing no change in wages, using the 1993 exchange rate, 111.18 yen, Japanese wages were 113 percent compared to the United States. It is higher than the 9-percent difference in productivity of 1991. Moreover, Japanese productivity dropped for a short period due to the later recession (the United States was booming and productivity rising). Mining and manufacturing industries production dropped 10.3 percent from 1991 to 1993, manufacturing industry employees also decreased 1.3 percent, but productivity dropped about 9 percent. Premised on the above calculations, Japanese wage costs exceed the United States by over 10 percent, and international competition must be viewed as rather severe. Temporary factors due to business cycles should be taken into consideration here, but basically the high yen is the main cause. The exchange rate in December 1993 was $1 equals 109.7 yen, but the purchasing power parity of industrial product wholesale prices was $1 equals 146.92 yen. The difference of both is about 37 yen and has greatly expanded from 20 yen in 1991. The yen rate has become much removed from the basic conditions of the Japanese manufacturing industry. No matter how much effort is put into rationalization and improving productivity, the Japanese manufacturing industry is not able to catch up with the high wage costs due to the soaring yen; as a result, it will soon be forced to hollow out. Hollowing out is a pullback from exports, overseas procurement of raw materials and products, and reduction and abandonment of domestic production due to an import offensive. Even if there is such an impact, big businesses can partially deal with it and will probably continue to exist, but the existence of medium, small, and petty businesses will be threatened under the large-scale decrease in demand and demands to cut unit prices exceeding ceilings. The Japanese manufacturing industry has been formed by many layers of medium, small, and petty businesses through the long period of accumulation of proficiency with adaptation to circumstances supporting the production of growth products that change from time to time. There is the fear that once these businesses disappear due to cessation of business, reappearance will be close to impossible and Japan's basis for creativity will be destroyed. If there are such structural problems besides the serious deflation effect brought by the high yen, correction of the high yen is an important issue involving national interest. $1 equaling 115 to 120 yen probably will be appropriate. If "the volume of trade on the foreign exchange market in recent years is 60 times the flow trade (1993 Economic White Paper), it must be that the high yen effect from the trade surplus is limited and speculation along with monetary conditions at home and abroad is strongly influencing the yen rate. It can be seen from the fact that just one word uttered by U.S. President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Bentsen has greatly changed the flow of yen trade. In order to correct the high yen, in addition to effective economic measures and complete opening of markets, we should prepare for effective measures to counteract verbal intervention from key members of the U.S. Government. Productivity Imbalance Raises Price Level The above are considerations about the manufacturing industry, but let's turn our eyes to industry as a whole. The GDP per employed person in the 1991 private industry total was 6.768 million yen for Japan and $42,718 for the United States. If this is converted by $1 to 193 yen, which is the GDP purchasing power parity, Japan is 82 percent of the United States. In other words, the productivity of the manufacturing industry was higher than the United States, but the productivity of the whole nation is 20 percent lower. One can see how low the productivity of nonmanufacturing industries is. For the manufacturing industry, including the trade goods sector which is exposed to international competition, price is a given condition, so to speak, and if wages, which are determined by the domestic labor market, also are a given condition, there is no other way than to raise productivity. However, since international competition is less in the nonmanufacturing industry and there is a lot of industry protection and entry regulation, competitive conditions are not severe. For that reason, price can be decided in terms of a non-given condition to a certain extent, and consequently, income has become high and productivity has become low. This is one of the major factors in the so-called domestic-foreign price difference (in addition, high land prices are a big aspect). Although wages are decided by a nationwide labor market, such conditions by industry are reflected to a certain extent and wages in the nonmanufacturing industry have become high. Consequently, employee income per person for 1991 in the private industry total where the nonmanufacturing industry has a high weight was 14 percent higher with Japan at 4.357 million yen and the United States at 3.820 million yen calculated at the exchange rate. Although the productivity of the nation overall is low, the price level is considerably higher than the United States because wages are high. If these wages are converted at the 1993 exchange rate, Japan will actually be 38 percent higher than the United States. So far, as the yen went higher, the manufactyuring industry adapted to the new yen level by efforts at rationalization, high value-added, and improved productivity. Low price stability has continued for the output price of the manufacturing industry viewed on a yen basis. On the other hand, the nonmanufacturing industry has easy competitive conditions, improved productivity is behind, and the output price has continued to rise. The spotty price between these sectors is conspicuous viewed internationally and makes the structural problems of Japanese industry stand out. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Comparison Between Japan and Germany in Various Kinds of Purchasing Power Pa-| |rity and Exchange Market (November 1993) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Yen/Dollar |Mark/Dollar | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Exchange market (monthly |107.83 |1.7003 | |average) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Purchasing power parity | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Export price basis |92.27 |1.7497 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industry product wholesa-|146.11 |1.7109 | |le price basis | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Consumer price basis |199.69 |1.6678 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Note: Purchasing power parity = exchange rate at base point of time x Japan (| |Germany) price index/U.S. price index.

In Japan, however, the export basket is slightly over 92 yen, and the industrial product basket is on the 146 yen level. In the consumer spending basket, it is an extremely wide margin at $1 to about 200 yen. The real exchange rate is on the 103 yen level and close to the export basket. The German exchange rate is close to the balanced economic fundamentals, but the Japanese structure is very distorted in the form of higher prices the further the sector is from trade and viewed from the economy overall, the exchange rate can be called abnormal and high. The nonmanufacturing industry, in a sense, can be called a support sector for the manufacturing industry and the fact that there has become such high cost there probably involves the existence of the manufacturing industry. Drastic structural reform such as full-scale relaxation or abolition of regulations is desired. In the same table, the purchasing power parity on an export price basis of slightly over 92 yen is impressive, but comparing the U.S. and Japan export product composition, a characteristic is that the United States has many agricultural products and raw materials for industry, and Japan has many capital goods and autos; and it cannot be compared in the same export basket. The fact that the contents are not the same can also be said of other baskets, but since the discrepancy is believed to be rather large for exports, no precise meaning is seen in the level of 92 yen.
