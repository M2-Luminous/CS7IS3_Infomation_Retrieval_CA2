In an address at a gathering to commemorate the fallen EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] fighters from Paphos, which was organized today by the town's fighter associations, President Kliridhis recalled that because of the lack of political will, which has also been noted by the United Nations, the National Council decided unanimously that the discussion of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] has been terminated and that we should proceed with discussions on the substance of the Cyprus issue after the necessary measures have been taken to break the Turkish intransigence. President Kliridhis also reiterated that he is prepared to sign an agreement on the CBM's provided the Turkish side accepts the 21 March document. The president added that the Greek Cypriots are united in the most crucial phase of our national problem and expressed the conviction that they will remain united in addressing it successfully. Arriving at the ceremony, President Kliridhis said that he expects consultations on the Cyprus issue to continue in view of the Butrus-Ghali discussion. Responding to a question, he said that he has not yet received replies to his letters sent to the U.S. President and the British prime minister. Responding to another question, President Kliridhis said that he is not pessimistic.
