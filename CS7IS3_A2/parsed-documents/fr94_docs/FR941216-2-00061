Requests for copies of EPA comments can be directed to the Office of Federal Activities at (202) 260&hyph;5076. An explanation of the ratings assigned to draft environmental impact statements (EISs) was published in FR dated April 10, 1994 (59 FR 16807). Draft EISs ERP No. D&hyph;BLM&hyph;K67027&hyph;AZ Rating EO2, Cypus Tohono Open Pit Mine Expansion Project, Plan of Operation Approval and Drilling Permit, Implementation, Tohono O'odham Nation, Papago Indian Reservation, Pinal County, AZ. Summary: EPA expressed environmental objections with the potential discharges from ponds and the open pit into groundwater. EPA recommended the final EIS provide more information on potential acid drainage formation, metals present in areas where there is potential for mobilization, and permeability of materials used to line pads and ponds. The final EIS should evaluate an alternative which includes increasing the stormwater containment capacity of the pregnant leach solution ponds to handle a 100-year, 24-hour storm. The final EIS also needs to provide analysis of the Clean Water Act Section 404 compliance. ERP No. D&hyph;FHW&hyph;E40755&hyph;NC Rating EC2, US 70 Improvements Project, I&hyph;40 to the Intersection of US 70 and US 70 Business, Funding and COE Section 404 Permit, Wake and Johnston Counties, NC. Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns regarding wetlands and air quality and requested additional information on wetlands mitigation and socio-economic impacts. ERP No. D&hyph;UAF&hyph;L11025&hyph;AK Rating EO2, Alaska Military Operations Areas (MOAs) Temporary MOAs Conversion to Permanent MOAs; New MOAs Creation; MOAs Modification; Supersonic Aircraft Operations and Routine Flying Training, Joint/Combined Flying Training and Major Flying Exercises Activities, Elmendorf Air Force Base, AK. Summary: EPA had environmental objections based on impacts to biological and recreation resources, potential adverse effects on subsistence activities and potential noise impacts on off-base residents. Additional information and clarification is needed to describe cumulative adverse impacts and mitigation effectiveness monitoring, develop more specific noise thresholds for impacted species and describe the conformity of the proposed action with requirements of Executive Order 12898. ERP No. D&hyph;USN&hyph;D11023&hyph;MD Rating EC2, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Base Realignment and Construction, Patuxent River, St. Mary's, Calvert and Charles Counties, MD. Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns regarding water conservation and requested that wetlands and forest habitat be more clearly defined in the final EIS. Final EISs ERP No. F&hyph;BLM&hyph;E65044&hyph;FL Florida Land and Resource Management Plan, Implementation, Split-Estate Federal Mineral Ownership (FMO), several counties, FL. Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns over habitat loss from the proposed alternative and suggests the Withlacoochee State Forest prohibit future limestone sales. The final EIS was responsive to other concerns EPA expressed in the draft EIS. ERP No. F&hyph;CGD&hyph;D50005&hyph;VA Parallel Crossing of the Chesapeake Bay, Construction and Operation, US 13 between the Delmarva Peninsula and southeastern Virginia, Funding, COE Section 10 and 404 Permits and CGD Bridge Permit, Virginia Beach, Northampton County, VA. Summary: EPA continued to express environmental objection to the preferred alternative and felt the Coast Guard did not adequately consider the 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement with respect to induced growth. ERP No. F&hyph;FHW&hyph;J40129&hyph;WY US 14/16/20 Highway Improvements, Cody to Yellowstone National Park Highway, Funding and COE Section 404 Permit, Shoshone National Forest, Park County, WY.

ERP No. F&hyph;TVA&hyph;E65041&hyph;00 Land Between The Lakes (LBL) Natural Resource Management Plan, Implementation, KY and TN. Summary: EPA had environmental concerns regarding timbering and encouraged reductions in these impacts. EPA felt that the preferred alternative increased resource preservation. ERP No. F&hyph;UMT&hyph;J40119&hyph;UT I&hyph;15/State Street Corridor Highway and Transit Improvements, Funding, Salt Lake County, UT. Summary: EPA had no objections to the project as proposed.
