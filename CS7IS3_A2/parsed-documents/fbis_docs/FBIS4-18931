[Juppe] Good morning. [Giesbert] You are the key person behind three issues in the news in the last few hours: Edouard Balladur's visit to China, NATO air strikes in Gorazde, and chaos in Rwanda against the background of tribal war. I would like you to give us details on these issues, preferably without any stereotypes. Let's start with the visit to China. According to today's newspapers, this was not a great success, this was a failure. Are you satisfied? [Juppe] We achieved our goal. What was our goal? It was not to establish democracy in China within three days. It was not to sign contracts, as I have read in some newspapers. Our goal was to reestablish a political dialogue with China. What was the situation when we came to office last year? China and France were not on speaking terms. I will even reveal a detail, since you do not want stereotypes: Our ambassador was unable to meet Chinese ministers, either in their ministries or in the French Embassy. There was no dialogue at all. Can you imagine France not communicating with China? [Giesbert] The dialogue was difficult. You ducked the issue of human rights. [Juppe] Not at all. We did not duck the issue. France outlined what its concept of human rights was in talks between the two prime ministers and the two foreign ministers and it explained why it considers the human rights situation in China to be unsatisfactory. [Giesbert] Dissidents were freed as soon as Edouard Balladur left China. [Juppe] I must tell you that I am quite amazed by this way of presenting things; I was there, things were slightly different. When we arrived in Shanghai, we saw press agency reports indicating that one or two dissidents had been questioned, not arrested, but questioned. We immediately demanded explanations -- I did so myself by summoning the Chinese ambassador to my office -- and we said that we demanded to know what the real situation was. The accompanying Chinese minister, commiting the Chinese government, solemnly told us that these arrests had not taken place. The Chinese press agency confirmed this information the day after our arrival. When I hear today that they were freed the day after we had left, I say there has been disinformation somewhere. [Giesbert] Are you saying that there were false reports somewhere? [Juppe] There was disinformation somewhere. What I can say is that we were perfectly clear -- I said so myself to my interlocutors -- we came to talk, it is normal, it is necessary for France and China to talk to each other; however, we do not agree on a certain number of issues and we clearly explained which ones. [Giesbert] We noticed a different emphasis between the prime minister and yourself. You were firm, extremely firm, and Edouard Balladur said that this issue of human rights should be settled, I quote, with discretion. [Juppe] I believe that distance is a distortion. I was with Edouard Balladur and I did not feel the slightest difference between our respective positions. [Giesbert] In an article published in LE JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE Bernard Kouchner reproached Edouard Balladur for having given in to the Chinese leaders. He spoke of a policy of silence and blindness, he blamed you for sacrificing human rights for trade, a state trade paid for by the French taxpayers. I was quoting Bernard Kouchner. [Juppe] Mr. Kouchner was doing his job -- this time rather poorly and in a sectarian manner -- he is in the opposition. He preferred to kneel down in front of CNN cameras with a sack of rice on his shoulders, this period is over now. [Giesbert] Some weeks ago French diplomacy made a rather grand gesture toward China by abandoning -- so the rumor went -- Taiwan. Following your return from China, do you have the feeling that you have been paid back? [Juppe] This comparison is interesting. We are being told: Moral values are at stake, we should not have spoken to China, we should have stuck with Taiwan. What was the moral stand concerning Taiwan when Mr. Joxe was in office? It was to sell Mirage aircraft and frigates. I cannot understand. We did not break with Taiwan, we simply told Taiwan that we would honor our commitments, whatever the cost. In the future, we will try to show a certain restraint concerning arms sales to Taiwan. We are ready to continue our cooperation with Taiwan and we will do so. Meanwhile, we have quite a lot of things to do in China. Do you realize that this country with a population of 1.2 billion has an annual growth rate of 13 percent? It needs telephone lines, nuclear power plants, high-speed trains, it needs wheat, it is currently importing wheat. These are issues on which we have been working. This will take time because it is not the government which decides, but firms which are negotiating. It is with this in mind that we resumed the dialogue. Let me say that I would like to place this visit to China alongside the visits I made to India and Japan. These three countries of the world, rather distant from each other, include nearly half the world's population. I noted that France had been absent from these countries for five to six years; there was no visit by ministers, no real political dialogue, no commercial ambition. I am being a bit unfair because, fortunately, there are French firms working there. Can we have a foreign policy while being absent from a region like this? I believe that this was the meaning of my visit, too, and I wanted to stress this. [Giesbert] Mr. Juppe, let's now talk about Bosnia. We do not really understand what happened in Gorazde yesterday when two American planes bombed Serb positions. Was it to protect UN soldiers or to prevent Serbs overrunning Gorazde? [Juppe] Both. Gorazde is a safe haven, I will not repeat what this means. The United Nations has decided that a certain number of zones in Bosnia should be specially protected. I believe that we waited for slightly too long; I am delighted that we eventually strongly intervened to put on the brake. However we must now know what the future holds. [Giesbert] Is this really aimed at putting a brake on? Isn't it rather a pinprick? [Juppe] Listen, bombings are never a pinprick. A turning point was reached about a month ago with the ultimatum in Sarajevo. At the time I said that all this should be part of a political and diplomatic plan. What worries me -- besides the situation on the ground, obviously -- is that the diplomatic process is currently at a virtual standstill. There are talks with the Muslims and the Croats on one side; contacts with the Serbs have not really resumed yet. What I am asking -- and this is rather urgent now -- is to include all these diplomatic initiatives into a coherent framework. There is only one such plan now, which is the European Union action plan, which makes provisions for the sharing of territory between the various communities, for lifting sanctions as soon as the Serbs commit themselves to peace. I invite all parties -- including the Serbs, obviously -- to resume talks on this basis. [Giesbert] Does this mean that you are launching a new Juppe initiative? [Juppe] This is not a new initiative. I am reasserting a conviction that I have been defending for months. We made a significant step forward on the ground by demonstrating our will, our resolution and our strength. This should not lead us to forget that the one and only possible solution is a negotiated settlement. [Giesbert] Do you believe that the United Nations is capable of imposing a cease-fire in Gorazde today? [Juppe] I know that steps in that direction have been taken and that UN Protection Force officials and a certain number of diplomats are trying to get the Bosnian Serb leader, Karadzic, and leading Bosnian Muslim officials together so as to resume talks. [Giesbert] The Bosnian Muslims are saying, this is too late now. This is what the Bosnian president, Alija Izetbegovic, said yesterday. [Juppe] Let me stress that it is never too late and that such words are unacceptable. [Giesbert] We had the feeling yesterday that the Americans were ruling the roost; was that the case? [Juppe] No it was a decision by the Atlantic alliance, following a request from the UN secretariat general in the framework of an operation in which we are full participants. These planes could have been French, French planes are part of the Alliance forces. [Giesbert] Let's now discuss the situation in Rwanda, where it is the Americans who are absent. We have reports of appalling ethnic massacres: Hutus are hunting down Tutsis throughout the country and the other way round. [Juppe] We just have to watch pictures to understand that there are no limits to horror. As you know France has been deeply involved in Rwanda in the past few months in attempts to restore peace. [Giesbert] Not very successfully, it seems. [Juppe] We did get results: The Arusha agreements were signed, French soldiers were on the scene to help in the reconciliation process, and things were moving forward. Unfortunately the attack on the plane transporting the presidents of Burundi and Rwanda provoked a resumption of the fighting. We decided very rapidly, very calmly, and very efficiently to set up a plan of action at Kigali airport to evacuate our nationals, this has now been nearly achieved. [Giesbert] Some 60 are still there, are you optimistic about the evacuation of these last remaining French nationals? [Juppe] We will evacuate them today. [Giesbert] When we see what is going on, do you believe France should maintain a presence in Rwanda, in Burundi? [Juppe] We cannot abandon our nationals and I believe that it is our duty to help the resumption of dialogue. This seems impossible when you see what is going on, the level of hatred between Hutus and Tutsis, but the Arusha agreements were signed and France's role is to attempt everything possible, with the neighboring countries, with the OAU, with the United Nations, to see reason prevail over the currently raging madness. This is our role. [passage omitted]
