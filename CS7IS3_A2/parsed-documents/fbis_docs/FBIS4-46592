What kind of gun is this? "N. Mekhrengin (Kirov Oblast)" We are correcting our error, albeit belatedly. Powerful reinforcing mortars were required during the Great Patriotic War, and designing of 240-mm mortars along with 160-mm mortars began in 1942. Several design bureaus were doing this at the same time. Thus, the ZIS-27 (1942) and S-16 (1943) 240-mm mortars were designed under V. Grabin. In 1943 OKB-172 (where convicts worked) began working on the OB-29 240-mm mortar project. The OB-29 weighed 3,500 kg deployed, the mortar round weighed 125 kg, and the range of fire was 250-7,000 m. During 1944-1945 B. Shavyrin's SKB [special design bureau] developed the most powerful model of a 240-mm mortar. Plant testing began back before the end of the war. Design deficiencies were found in the course of testing, and after they were remedied tests were renewed in 1947 and ended in 1949. Shavyrin's 240-mm mortar, designated M-240, became operational in 1950, at which time its range of fire was 8 km. In 1953 a special, more powerful propelling charge was developed for the M-240 which supported a range of fire of 9.7 km. The M-240 240-mm mortar represents a rigid (without recoil mechanisms), breech-loaded, smoothbore system on a wheeled carriage, which fires a fin-stabilized projectile (mortar round). It consists of the following basic parts: barrel with breech mechanism, breech piece, frame with shock absorber, mount with laying mechanisms and equilibrator, road wheels with suspension, trail with mechanism for transferring the mortar to a deployed and travelling position, base plate, and sights. The barrel is a smoothbore tube secured in a trunnion band, which has the capability of tipping on trunnions to position the barrel for loading. The breech end is closed by an upward swinging breech mechanism. The mount consist of two frames (upper and lower) hinged together. The lower is assembled on a two-wheeled axle. Elevating gear and an equilibrator accommodated between brackets of the axle and mount upper frame serve to lay the mortar for elevation. There is a spring suspension, and wheels are trolleybus type with foam rubber filling. The sight is a panoramic MP-46. The mortar is loaded from the breech end, for which the barrel is placed in a horizontal position. A loading tray is mounted after the breech mechanism is opened. Five team members manually lift the mortar round, place it on the tray and ram it into the bore. Then it is lowered into the breech piece for firing. The time for converting the M-240 from a travelling to a deployed position at a previously prepared firing position is 20-25 minutes, and the reverse takes 15-20 minutes. The mortar is moved by an ATL [light artillery prime mover] or other artillery prime mover at a speed up to 40 km/hr. Ammunition for it is in the body of the prime mover or in a motor vehicle. In the late 1960's the gun part (model 2B8) of the 2S4 Tyulpan self-propelled mortar was designed on the basis of the M-240, for which the 2B8 240-mm mortar was mounted on a special chassis (Object 305). The barrel and ballistics were left unchanged in the 2B8 tipping part of the 2S4 Tyulpan self-propelled mortar. In contrast to the M-240, where all operations were manual, the 2B8 has a hydraulic system which completely replaces the team's difficult work of loading and laying the mortar. Only laying for deflection remained manual. In contrast to the M-240, the loading angle for the 2B8 is around +63ï¿½. Mortar rounds are fed automatically onto the rammer guides from mechanical ammunition stowage in the chassis body. Two ammunition stowage areas hold 40 high-explosive or 20 rocket-assisted mortar rounds. In addition, loading can be done from the ground using a crane. The V-59 diesel installed in the Tyulpan permitted developing a speed up to 62.8 km/hr on the highway and 25-30 km/hr on dirt roads. Both mortars fire the F-864 high-explosive steel round weighing 130.7 kg, with explosives weighing 31.9 kg. The GVMZ-7 fuze has settings for instantaneous and delayed action. The F-864 round has five charges giving it a muzzle velocity of from 158 to 362 m/sec and a corresponding range from 800 to 9,650 m. The primer charge is in the round's central tube and the other charges are contained in ring-shaped bags fastened to the central tube with silk cords. In addition to the F-864, it is possible to fire a rocket-assisted and a guided mortar round from the 2B8. According to western press information, "special charges" also were created for the M-240 and 2B8. The following are the primary missions of 240-mm mortars: - destroy sturdy field stone-wood-earth structures; - destroy enemy personnel and equipment inaccessible to flat trajectory fire of artillery pieces. The latter quality makes the 240-mm mortar irreplaceable when operating, for example, in a city with high stone structures. Using the 1st and 2nd charges, the steepness of fall of the rounds becomes almost vertical, which ensures destruction of practically any target. The rocket-assisted round increases the range of fire, and the guided round selects and destroys point targets, including armored equipment. Not one country in the world has adopted such powerful mortars in the postwar period. The present caliber of mortars of the United States, England, France and Germany does not exceed 120 mm.
