[Klaric] The Spaniards are doing a very bad job. Between May and September of 1993, they were absent from East Mostar for 102 days. When the Croatian fascists bombarded us, they were not here, and that is when we most needed them. The situation is improving somewhat now, although I cannot say that I am satisfied. [Rafat] Can you be specific as to why, in your view, they are doing a bad job? [Klaric] They are always sitting in their armored vehicles. They come out only to purchase, for a few marks, antiques that were stolen by criminals during the bombings. We have the names of the guilty local persons, and we will find out the names of their Spanish accomplices. [Rafat] Why do you not report this to the military command? [Klaric] I write to the colonel in command of the Blue Helmets every week asking him to come and talk about our problems, but he does not even answer my letters. [Rafat] What are the problems you want to discuss? [Klaric] Why, for 102 days, did they not patrol East Mostar? Why, in the reports he submits to UNPROFOR's [United Nations Protection Forces] higher officials, does he always reduce the number of attacks and the continual violations of peace agreements by the Croatian War Board, thus blatantly favoring the Croatian fascists? And most importantly, why do they not help us in rebuilding some of our basic infrastructures, so as to unburden the lives of the citizens? If they do not reply, it is because they know that they have not acted neutrally.
