The Principal Court of Administrative Disputes was not satisfied with President Gaviria's explanations on the presence of U.S. military soldiers in Colombia. Rodrigo Barrera is with the Council of State president now. Good evening, Rodrigo. [Barrera] Good evening. Council of State President Amado Gutierre, what steps will the council take now that it presented this charge against the president of the Republic? [Gutierrez] We have nothing further to do. Our actions are limited to sending our declaration to the Congressional Investigation and Charges Commission [comision de investigacion y acusacion de la honorable camara] and to the Attorney General. It is for them to decide on this institution and on the official [not further identified]. We cannot take any further steps, because we do not know if the congressional commission will decide to initiate a political process or if the attorney general will open a disciplinary investigation. This refers to the charges against the institution and the official. [Barrera] According to the Council of State, there are enough merits to initiate a political trial, however. On what basis was this decision made? [Gutierrez] We simply stated the presence of foreign military troops, as well as foreign war aircraft and ships, in our national territory does not conform to the Constitution and violates our national sovereignty. [Barrera] Thus, Congress has to take it from there? [Gutierrez] The congressional commission has to decide now whether it will open a political trial. [Barrera] In his letter, the president has told the Council of State the Defense Ministry had the autonomy to approve those actions. Why was his argument unacceptable? [Gutierrez] Because the end of that document states the agreement was signed with the authorization of the respective governments. It is understood that a government is the president of the Republic and his ministers. [Barrera] Stated differently, either the president has lied to the Council of State or the minister has lied to the president. [Gutierrez] I cannot determine this; the commission will do so once it studies our declaration, as well as the attorney general if he decides to do so.
