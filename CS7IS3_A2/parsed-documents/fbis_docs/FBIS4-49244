While visiting the site of the New Fourth Army headquarters and the New Fourth Army Memorial Hall in Yancheng on the afternoon of 22 April, Zhang Zhen said with deep feeling: The New Fourth Army fought here in the War of Resistance Against Japan for eight years. The troops had very inferior weapons and few bullets. What did they rely on to attain victory? They relied on the party Central Committee's correct leadership and Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant command, on the masses of people's effective support, and on the army's fine revolutionary traditions. At the end of his visit, Zhang Zhen respectfully copied a Marshal Chen Yi poem: "How many old fighters of those years are alive now? Millions upon millions of mighty new soldiers are a consolation to those loyal souls." The copy was presented to the New Fourth Army Memorial Hall. He also visited the Bancheng Martyrs' Mausoleum, which was old site of the New Fourth Army headquarters, and paid his respects to officers and men of the New Fourth Army who were killed in action during the War of Resistance Against Japan. On his way to investigate and study various localities, Zhang Zhen referred to his own personal fighting experiences and described the old Red Army's traditions. He said: Our army was established personally by revolutionaries of the older generation, including Mao Zedong; weathered tests, including the 25,000-li Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, China's War of Liberation, and the War To Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea; and has many fine traditions. The fine traditions include: the party's absolute leadership over the army; the aim to wholeheartedly serve the people; effective ideological and political work; the three main rules of discipline and the eight points for attention [san da ji lu ba xiang zhu yi 0005 1129 4764 1774 0360 7309 3137 1942]; political, economic, and military democracy at the company level; and unity between the military and government and between the military and the people. Revolutionary martyrs paid with their blood as the price for these fine traditions that are our army's valuable spiritual treasure. He encouraged the officers and men to cherish historic honor and promote fine traditions. Zhang Zhen emphatically pointed out: We should carry forward and develop the traditions. First, we should understand what our army's traditions are. Every division, regiment, and company has its own glorious history. We should very properly screen and summarize them respectively and carry them forward. Proceeding with this understanding, we should also integrate traditions with actual conditions in an effort to facilitate new development in old traditions and add new contents to the traditions under changed circumstances. At a Red Army regiment and a military unit where the late Wang Jie was attached when alive, Zhang Zhen held conversations with grass-roots officers and men on ways to continually promote fine traditions. He said: While conducting army building in the new historic era, we have encountered many new circumstances and issues. To resolve them, we should, on the one hand, arm the minds of officers and men with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his thought on army building in the new period. This is a basic requirement. On the other hand, we should also carry forward and promote our army's fine traditions. He urged cadres at various levels to set an example in every aspect, to take the lead in promoting the fine traditions, and to pass on the cherished heritage of the people's army from generation to generation. Zhang Zhen urged the broad masses of commanders and soldiers to particularly uphold the distinctive political character of waging hard struggles under the new circumstances at present. He pointed out: Although the economy has developed and living standards have been improved, we cannot discard the tradition of waging hard struggles. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics requires that several generations of people arduously perform pioneering work. Even after China has become strong and the people have become rich, we will still need the work style of continually waging hard struggles. During his tour in north Jiangsu, Zhang Zhen also conducted thorough investigations and research in units including military schools and academies, logistics departments, and military subdistricts. He also made a special trip to Huaian to pay respects to and visit Comrade Zhou Enlai's old residence and memorial hall.
