On 4 May, we celebrated the Day of National Dignity. May is the month when the rainy season begins. May is the month of mothers. It is the month in which we are holding this Sandinist Congress. When we proposed this Special Congress, we did it with the certainty that it will serve to consolidate and unite Sandinism around its program and statutes. This way the people will be able to count on a Sandinist Front that is united around revolutionary principles and programs. This is part of a process in which ideas have been presented with complete freedom. This has been a rich process because of the many proposals advanced at local assemblies and forums. This is a process in which self-criticism is necessary, because this process is being conducted in the fraternal, constructive, and revolutionary way in which we are obligated to conduct it. We are certain that the FSLN will emerge from this special session with strengthened democratic unity. Under these circumstances, we will be promoting internal changes that will enable us to promote changes in favor of the entire nation. In this way, we Sandinists will be returning to the people, who are our fountainhead and raison d'etre. In a world subjected to the neoliberal offensive that is proclaiming the end of history, trying to bury the noble ideals that moved mankind to search for a more just, free, and equitable world, the people are resisting, the people are not surrendering, and the people are achieving victories, such as the one secured recently by the heroic people of South Africa. The people want changes. This necessarily means seeking new paths and alternatives to face neoliberalism. An example of this is the resistance of the heroic people of Cuba, subject to an illegal policy of U.S. imperialism, which violates the human rights of all its people and which maintains the blockade and embargo against our Cuban brothers. The people of our America also are resisting. They are resorting to the most extensive forms of struggle. This includes the Haitian people, who see how their democratic aspirations have been shunned. In the Middle East, the Palestinians are increasing their efforts to fully recover their territory, and the people of Libya and Iraq are resisting the effects of a blockade imposed by hegemonic interests. In the face of neoliberalism, the struggle for the survival of mankind and the struggle for the environment are objectives that are being strongly defended by the people in both the North and South of our planet. In a world that demands changes to save mankind, we Sandinists must update and therefore enrich our program. We must promote organizational transformations and therefore enrich our statutes. We must strengthen the leadership by opening the doors of our organization to everyone who may voluntarily want to adhere to our principles and programs. By strengthening the leadership in the rank and file, we would be strengthening the leadership of the organization and we would be returning to the people. To do this, it is necessary to integrate Nicaragua's young people and its women. The front has been a factor for change in Nicaraguan society, which allowed us to ascend from a guerrilla column that in 1963 carried out an incursion in Bocay to become a national and popular insurrection which, on 19 July 1979, overthrew the Somozist dictatorship. While in the government, we always promoted initiatives and worked for the strengthening of a de jure state, despite the war the U.S. Administration of Ronald Reagan launched against us. This earned us the respect and admiration of people from around the world and nurtured solidarity with Nicaraguans in the most remote places in the world. Our revitalized thoughts made democracy possible and led to profound changes -- agrarian reform, the literacy campaign, and the defense of sovereignty. This open-mindedness allowed us to defend at the proper moment the privatization of state enterprises in favor of workers, retired Army and Government Ministry officials, and demobilized Resistance people. This open mindedness also led to the autonomy law in favor of our Atlantic coast brothers, and today we must acknowledge the autonomous nature of the FSLN in the autonomous northern Atlantic and southern Atlantic regions, just as the companeros from the coast have proposed in recent assemblies and congresses. Now we have to put our imagination and our initiatives to the test to overcome the errors we have undoubtedly committed and to create plans to work for new and better forms of organization to recover the trust and credibility of Sandinists, both with and without credentials, and together with them, we must work to win the confidence of the Nicaraguan people as we defend their interests, carry out daily efforts, and work to recapture the government in the 1996 elections. By doing this, we would be returning to the people. The current neoliberal government has led the country to economic stagnation, unemployment, and the disintegration of the Nicaraguan family and society. In the face of a profound crisis like the one burdening the Nicaraguan people, the front represents a factor of national stability and hope for a change. The reconstruction of the country and a national program concerned with the people will be possible only with the participation of all national economic, social, and political forces. No sector in the country will escape the destructive impact of neoliberal policies. This is why as soon as this Special Congress concludes we must again take the initiative to implement a national unity program. We must also seek support for the workers who demand a new labor code. We must seek broad agreement to demand respect for Laws 85, 86, and 88, which benefit more than 200,000 families, to secure the legalization and registration of these properties, just like the properties that have been transferred since 1990 as a result of the privatization process, which has benefited popular sectors. We have to support the bonuses law to grant satisfactory compensation to claimants when the law supports their claims, including U.S. citizens. Therefore, U.S. citizens and Nicaraguans who took U.S. citizenship will have to submit to Nicaraguan laws. There can be no exceptions. The government has the obligation of defending Nicaragua's self-determination rights and reject foreign pressure. We Sandinists must support the workers, the peasants, coffee producers, ranchers, the producers of basic grains, and all sectors that have been affected and are demanding that the government change its economic policy to create conditions in favor of economic recovery, production, and the creation of jobs. We Sandinists must work for the modernization of the state through the constitutional reforms being reviewed by the National Assembly. We Sandinists must promote a broad national movement for a long-term social and economic program that, with the support of all the Nicaraguans, might make possible a national solution to the crisis and bring about the arrival of true peace and stability. In our pluralist and democratic Nicaragua, there have been two elections -- the one in 1984 and the one in 1990. On these occasions, the Sandinists' respect for the will of the people was tested. The outcome is that we peacefully turned over the government on 25 April 1990. National elections are scheduled for November 1996, and we Sandinists must better prepare ourselves for the elections by first assuming a policy of self-criticism that will allow us to listen to one another and remedy our differences on time. We have made many mistakes. After the defeat in the elections, different groups emerged and then moved in their own directions. This created even more contradictions. Not everything was well done even though people were full of goodwill and were concerned about the problems of the nation. To achieve victory in the 1996 elections, it is necessary to resolve our internal matters by updating our programs and bylaws. We have to take on the appropriate revolutionary discipline. We have to show fraternity and respect for one another and for the people. By going back to the people and by holding an electoral reform debate that can promote national unity, the Sandinists are going to achieve victory with the Nicaraguan people's vote in the 1996 elections. Brothers, to achieve the objectives demanded by Nicaraguans in this historic period, we have to reclaim Sandinist ethics and morale. We have to reclaim the values that have supported the great causes of humanity, solidarity, honesty, humility, and respect for the poverty in which our people have been living. These are the values we have to rescue in order that the Sandinists can face the venom toted by the neoliberals inside their bags that are chock-full of jaded values such as individualism, selfishness, and the save-yourself philosophy. We have to undergo a deep test of self-criticism that can shake up our consciences. We cannot tolerate more abuses and violations. We need to come out with our heads held high and with our souls in intact to defend the rights of the people. Sandinist brothers, Nicaraguan brothers: We have tried to give the best of our lives to the defense of freedom, justice, and the sovereignty of the Nicaraguan people. We -- men and women together -- met one another along a path originally marked by our General Sandino. The National Directorate of the FSLN assumed the commitment of those who were willing to wage a profound battle. Many brothers fell with the silence of heroes, who not only said they would die for the fatherland, but actually did die for the fatherland. Among those who fell were Carlos Fonseca, Santos Lopez, Jorge Navarro, Silvio Mayorga, Luis Humberto Cruz, Casimiro Sotelo, Julio Buitrago, Oscar Turcio, Ricardo Morales, Jacinto Hernandez, Filemon Rivera, Jose Benito Escobar, [words indistinct], Eduardo Contreras, and Carlos Nunez. Following the difficult times of the Somoza dictatorship and the defense of the revolution, the members of the FSLN National Directorate, men of flesh and bone, making correct and incorrect decisions via both our vices and virtues, and yet full of revolutionary love and passion, we have tried to do our best for the people. We have tried not to betray ourselves or to surrender. We have decided to continue fighting until we achieve a free, just, and peaceful fatherland -- a fatherland of which our General Sandino dreamed and for which our heroes and martyrs spilled their blood. Long live the unity of the FSLN! Long live the unity of the Nicaraguan people! Sandino lives! The struggle continues! Free fatherland or death! [applause]
