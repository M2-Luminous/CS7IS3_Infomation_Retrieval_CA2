President Charles Gankay Taylor said Ambassador Gordon-Somers had misinformed the NPFL that the expanded ECOMOG was to have been deployed in Maryland County. This, he said, led the NPFL to send a team of senior military officers to Maryland to receive the ECOMOG troops, only to realize that the troops were not coming.
