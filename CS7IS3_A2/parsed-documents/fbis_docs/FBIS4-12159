The clerics' regime which is known to be a dictatorial, tension-generating one is constantly seeking to purchase various kinds of weapons so as to continue its evil actions, and it is expending astronomical sums for this purpose. In the past few years, the clerics have formulated and implemented extensive programs to expand their armed forces for the purpose of suppressing the discontented people in the country, and to continue their efforts to create tension abroad in the past few years. These programs required enormous outlay. What has transpired on this issue so far is that right from the outset, the clerics' regime allocated nearly $40 billion for this program and on the basis of the agreements, a large part of the sum has been used and this program is expected to continue in the future. At present, the clerical regime is seeking to implement the last stages of its military program. In the past five years, the officials of the Islamic Republic signed a $10 billion agreement for the ordnance purchases from Russia, a $3 billion agreement with the DPRK, and have completed a $5 billion transaction with the PRC. In addition, the clerics' regime is pursuing an ambitious scheme to acquire a nuclear bomb and it is expected to implement this scheme in the next few years. For this purpose, it has initiated (?preparations) and is not stinting on any expenditure in this regard. The regime's megalomaniac policy of generating tension does not take into consideration that it has already spent large sums of tens of billions of dollars from the country's budget for the purchase of miscellaneous weapons and is still pursuing this policy. It is also motivating and encouraging various hardline and Islamic fundamentalist groups in other countries which demands even more expenditure on the part of the regime. The clerics have displayed particular generosity in this regard and have spent freely for this purpose. The training of agents and the establishment of terrorist networks in most of the countries of the world by the clerics' regime also entails massive expenditure. It is obvious that to meet these costs, the clerics' regime had counted on their oil income to a great extent and this income has declined considerably at present. In view of the fact that the reduction of the oil income has not affected the regime's military program and its policy of generating tension, and as we can perceive, the clerics continue to pursue their policy of fanning discord and arming their forces more than ever. Even if Iran is an affluent country, one can foresee that in the not so distant future, it will become a backward country and will bring the people face to face with difficult conditions. With the slump in oil prices on the international market and a concomitant budget deficit of 20 percent, the rate of inflation soared to nearly 30 percent per month. It is for this reason that the regime is unable to pay its installments and interest on the $28 billion worth of foreign debts. In brief, the regime's purchases of ordnance and military equipment continues unchanged but the oil income has dwindled. There is no doubt that eventually, such a situation will be to the detriment of the people in the future. At present, more than two-thirds of our people are living on or even below the poverty line. The regime is only extending long term promises of future prosperity for resolving these problems and is asking people to be patient and bear with them, instead of providing some solutions. In general, the erroneous policies and conduct of the regime has disrupted the lives of the people on the one hand and with the implementation of its military program on the other, it has created other (?problems) for the outside world, which will transform Iran into a center of even greater tension and crises in the region in the future which will have unforeseen consequences.
