The move could affect the faltering stock market as 2 trillion yen worth of postal insurance funds are set aside for stock investment through a special account. The special account lends such funds to the Post Office Life Insurance and Annuities Welfare Corp., which comes under the Postal Ministry's jurisdiction. The corporation in turn places the funds with trust banks for stock investment. The Postal Ministry has been negotiating with the Finance Ministry to allow it to invest in the stock market directly through the special account because a stock market slump makes it difficult for the corporation to pay back the interest on the borrowed money without selling assets held in stocks. The special account lends postal insurance funds to the corporation for 10 years and the corporation places the money with trust banks for five years and is required to pay the interest every year on the money borrowed before August 1992. The postal insurance funds lent by the special account to the corporation totaled 1.4 trillion yen in fiscal 1991, 1.67 trillion yen in fiscal 1992 and 2 trillion yen in fiscal 1993. The corporation, for its part, had losses totaling 44.6 billion yen in fiscal 1992, forcing it carry over a loss of 10.3 billion yen into fiscal 1993 although it tapped 34.3 billion yen in reserves against possible losses. Postal life insurance is administered by the Postal Ministry and nearly 70 percent of the funds are placed with the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau as a major capital source for public works projects.
