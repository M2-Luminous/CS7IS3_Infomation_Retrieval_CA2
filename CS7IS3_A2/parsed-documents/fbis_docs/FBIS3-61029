For the first time, all their work has been based on the branch wage agreement of the Federation of Trade Unions of Armed Forces Workers and Office Employees, the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, and the Russian Federation Ministry of Labor, which was announced by the defense minister in Order No. 197 in 1993. How has it been carried out, and what has it done for Army and Navy civilian personnel? Let us attempt to tally some of the results at the end of the year, a year that has been difficult from an economic standpoint, especially for workers paid from the budget. For the sake of objectivity, it must be said that the agreement has worked well even in these difficult conditions. Despite the financial difficulties, the Ministry of Defense found ways to improve labor remuneration and material incentives. Repeated appeals to the government made it possible to increase the wage rates up to 50 percent and to earmark up to half of the annual wage fund for bonuses. Benefits were introduced for education, health, and cultural workers living in rural areas; pay was introduced for civilian specialists on alert duty; regional wage regulation was improved, and supplementary bonuses for uninterrupted service were increased. And after these decisions were adopted at the government level, the documents did not spend months circulating in ministry corridors, as used to be the case, but were quickly sent to the units by telegram. It should come as little surprise that they were received rather enthusiastically by labor collectives, especially Order No. 129 and Order No. 130, which the defense minister issued in the first quarter. But closer to the end of the first six months, it became clear that efforts to keep up with price increases were not succeeding. And Russian presidential Edict No. 842 of 3 June, "On Certain Measures to Curb Inflation," essentially blocked section three of the branch wage agreement. The issues dealt with in that paragraph (payment of leave entitlements, insurance, exemption of Defense Ministry organizations from the added-value tax, and other measures that significantly improve the workers' material, social, and consumer-service situation) were submitted to the Russian Federation government for consideration and resolution. In July 1993 prices, these measures required almost 2 billion rubles. The treasury didn't have the money for these things, and it still doesn't today. Meanwhile, the situation is critical. And if Army and Navy workers and office employees have not held mass strikes like the miners, this is due solely to their high degree of conscientiousness and to their special legal situation, which does not allow such actions. Veterans remember how even during the war years, financing was provided monthly. But today, money is distributed only as it becomes available. Funds might be distributed several times in one week, but more often there is nothing to distribute. And how can you ask a person whose wages haven't reached the subsistence minimum lately and, moreover, haven't been paid on time, to give his work everything he's got? But this has to be done during this of time personnel shortages in order to somehow maintain the forces' vital activities. Throughout this period, the Federation of Trade Unions of Armed Forces Workers and Office Employees did not sit around doing nothing. "We tried to call the attention of the national leadership and the Ministry of Defense to the emerging situation," said Federation Deputy Chairman Vladimir Volkov. "In addition, we took part in setting norms, exercising our right of legislative initiative. Very many difficulties, unfortunately, stem from the uncertain legal status of civilian personnel in the Armed Forces." Of course, the most difficult situation obtains in the near foreign countries, where financial problems are many times more acute and the status of civilians working in military units is altogether unclear. When a Russian citizen went to work, for example, in the Western Group of Forces, he knew every last term of his contract. But what about in the near foreign countries? What are the rights of citizens of republics that do not belong to the CIS but in which Russian military units are stationed, if they work in these units? To start, we should at least clarify the social and legal status of Russian Federation citizens in Russia, since they are pursuing careers with the Armed Forces voluntarily and under contract. By analogy with the Law "On the Status of Servicemen," the executive committee of the Federation of Trade Unions made such attempts with the support of the Defense Ministry. But a kind of impasse has arisen here too. To expect that the Federal Assembly, after its election, will be able to consider such a law in the foreseeable future is simply unrealistic, for it will inherit many other urgent matters--as well as hundreds of other laws that have already undergone various kinds of preliminary study--from the Supreme Soviet, and all these things will have to be considered. The only realistic option is to change the corresponding paragraph in the branch agreement and to ask the government to confirm the Statute on Benefits for Civilian Personnel of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, in accordance with the Law "On Defense." The Federation of Trade Unions, in conjunction with the Defense Ministry, is currently studying this question. This step is of fundamental importance in and of itself, since the civil rights of Army and Navy workers and office employees are restricted, albeit less so than those of military personnel. And so it is necessary to offset this with certain benefits and advantages. Many readers who bring such complaints to the newspaper emphasize that what bothers them is not that they aren't getting something, but the fact that, in principle, they are deprived of the right to establish a claim to anything. For example, defense minister Order No. 285, which has regulated housing issues in the Army and Navy ever since 1975, states explicitly that workers and office employees are to be provided with apartments at their place of residence. In other words, they do not appear to have the right to even dream of getting housing at their place of service. In the new conditions, such a relationship between a worker and his employer, in the form of the Defense Ministry, is hardly justified -- especially considering the fact that the Defense Ministry has one million civilian employees today, and they have a very strong influence on the state of affairs in the forces. With the cutbacks in the Armed Forces, in accordance with defense minister Order No. 295, which took effect this year, they are permitted to substitute in the forces for 40 officer positions and for more than 200 positions normally held by warrant Army and Navy warrant officers, extended-duty servicemen, senior sergeants, soldiers, and seamen, and to hold such important positions as leading research associates, test engineers, designers, chief designers, chiefs of apartment-operation services, chiefs of aircraft maintenance services, and others. According to some estimates, the number of workers and office employees could grow by 15 percent in the next few years, and they will play an increasingly important role in strengthening the country's defense capability. This means that we must work to solve their problems too -- to come up with funds, to improve the legal foundation, and to observe mutual agreements more strictly. This was the subject of a recent meeting of a trilateral commission that discussed progress in implementing the wage agreement. A decision was taken to extend the agreement to 1994. The deadline for assembling and reaching agreement on amendments and changes in the document based on the past year's experience and on all outstanding problems expired today. * * * Note: Major-General Viktor Rudik, chief of the labor and wages administration for Russian Armed Forces civilian personnel, reports that by decision of the Russian Federation Council of Ministers of 7 December 1993, No. 1268, the monthly wage rate for category-one of the uniform wage rate for budget-sphere workers was set at 16,000 rubles as of 1 December. Based on this, the wages of Defense Ministry workers and office employees, in accordance with Russian Defense Minister Order No. 130 of March 8, 1993, is being doubled.
