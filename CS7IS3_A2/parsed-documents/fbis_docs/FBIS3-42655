According to revised but still not final data which was released by the Northeastern Geological Committee, last year the oblast turned over to the state 28,561 tonnes of gold (29,156 tonnes in 1992). During the 11 months the Severovostokzoloto produced 22,502 tonnes (25,262 tonnes in all of 1992). Gold mining cooperatives and new gold-producing structures which do not belong to the Severovostokzoloto produced 4,773 tonnes (3,894 tonnes). According to Vladimir Banin, deputy head of the Magadan Oblast Administration, there are grounds to believe that not all of the metal produced last year has been turned over to the state yet.
