PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva also favors this idea. Oliveira believes that to close the current Constitution revision process now and reopen it in 1995 may solve the impasse of the Constitution revision work. "I believe it is a solution that might satisfy the people if the most important amendments are not approved by 31 May," Lula said. Lula, who attended a demonstration against the end of the monopolies in the oil and telecommunications industries in Salvador, believes the political atmosphere does not favor the constitutional revision. "The PT not only supports the postponement of the work, but also thanks God that the congressmen have had a little bit of good sense to understand that the revision process cannot continue under the current circumstances," Lula added. [passage omitted] After the dedication of the Sarah Hospital in Salvador, Oliveira nonetheless admitted there are two obstacles to Tavola's suggestion: the amendments that already have been approved and the 31 May deadline approved by the Constituent Congress. But Oliveira believes the issue should be taken to the Federal Supreme Court based on the fact that the temporary Constitution measures that authorized the amendment process did not include a deadline for finishing the revision works.
