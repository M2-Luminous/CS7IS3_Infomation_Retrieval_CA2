In view of the prime minister's reservations, there is doubt that the Peres-'Arafat meeting, scheduled for 28 April in Cairo, will indeed take place as planned. The final decision regarding the date of that meeting has been put off until after Rabin returns from Russia on 28 April. [passage omitted]
