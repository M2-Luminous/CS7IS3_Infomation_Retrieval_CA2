Latvia and Russia signed a framework agreement in April on Russian troop withdrawal together with a package of additional treaties, including one on the social protection of retired Russian military living in Latvia. Estonia so far has refused to make any concessions to Russia over the issue of the retired military, which has become a major reason for the current deadlock in the talks between the two countries. Nugis in his remarks said the agreements signed between Latvia and Russia in no way influenced the relations between Estonia and Latvia. He said Estonia honors the right of Latvia as an independent country to sign whatever agreement it wishes. But he added that the signing of the treaties in Moscow had had a certain negative impact, leaving Estonia to some degree isolated. The parliament speaker stated that Estonia is not going to make any concessions to Russia over the military pensioners' issue, because such is the government's "firm position and the people's will." He also said any such concessions would contradict the country's legislation and have an effect opposite to what is wished as to the country's demographic situation. [passage omitted]
