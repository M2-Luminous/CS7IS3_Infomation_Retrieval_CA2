The wargame, which involves some 23 warships and no less than 2,000 marines, is conducted yearly by the navy and that it has nothing to do with the islands' dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia, Western Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Suratmin of Indonesia told reporters here after seeing off the troops and warships heading for the wargames. Suratmin also made a stress that the wargame is not a show of force. Accompanied by the wargame director naval Commodore Widodo A.S., Suratmin stated the the naval exercises are basically aimed at improving the navy's operational ability in using the fleet's integrated weaponry system. Asked about the designated site for this year's wargame, he said the navy has several times used the location as its site, particularly for its amphibian landing group force. The final activity of the wargame will be marked by the landing of the amphibian force on the island on March 29 which will be witnessed by Defence and Security Minister General Edi Sudrajat and the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, Gen. Feisal Tanjung. For the first time, three non-military ships, namely a tanker of the state-owned Pertamina oil company and two ships of the Sea Transportation's Directorate General are being deployed in the wargame. The participation of the non-military ships is considered as the initial stage of the implementation of the "Wawasan Nusantara", an archipelagic concept, and the "Hankamrata", a public security system which involves the whole national potentials. The 23 warships participating the wargame consist of frigates, corvettes, patrol boats, minesweepers, submarines, tankers and landing ship tanks.
