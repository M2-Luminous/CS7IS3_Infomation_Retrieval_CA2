FR940214-2-00081 FR940214-2-00050 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Forms Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget Agency Clearance Officer: John J. Lane, (202) 942&hyph;8800. Upon Written Request, Copy Available From: Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Filings, Information and Consumer Services, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Revisions Rule 203&hyph;1 and Form ADV_File No. 270&hyph;39. Rule 204&hyph;1_File No. 270&hyph;41. Rule 204&hyph;3_File No. 270&hyph;42. Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), the Securities and Exchange Commission has submitted for OMB approval proposed amendments to rule 203&hyph;1 and Form ADV, rule 204&hyph;1, and rule 204&hyph;3 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (``Advisers Act''). The amendments pertain to disclosure by investment advisers that sponsor ``wrap fee programs,'' services under which investment advice and brokerage services are paid for in a single ``wrap'' fee. The proposed amendments to rule 203&hyph;1 and Form ADV would require sponsors of wrap fee programs to prepare and file with the Commission new Schedule H to Form ADV discussing important information about the wrap fee program. It is estimated that approximately 300 investment advisers would be required to amend their Form ADVs to include Schedule H in the first year after the schedule's adoption, and that each adviser completing Schedule H would incur six burden hours in its preparation. The increase in burden resulting from this amendment will be reflected in the burden associated with rule 204&hyph;1. In addition, it is estimated that each year approximately thirty investment advisers will be required to complete Schedule H as part of an initial application for registration on Form ADV, and that each adviser required to complete Schedule H would incur six burden hours in addition to the time currently necessary to complete Form ADV. This increase in burden will be reflected in the burden associated with rule 203&hyph;1 (Form ADV). The burden hours associated with rule 204&hyph;1 are likely to decline after the amendments' first year. In future years, each adviser amending its Form ADV would merely need to make any necessary changes to its existing wrap fee brochure. The Commission estimates that the changes will take significantly less than six hours necessary to prepare the brochure initially. The amendments to rule 204&hyph;3 would require an adviser to deliver its Schedule H to prospective clients of the wrap fee program, and offer to deliver it annually to existing clients of the program, in lieu of the disclosure document required by the rule to be delivered to the adviser's other clients. Because the amendments to rule 204&hyph;3 would merely require the delivery of a specific wrap fee disclosure document to certain clients in lieu of the delivery of a more general disclosure document, the Commission estimates that the amendments to rule 204&hyph;3 will not increase the burden on advisers in complying with the rule. General comments may be directed to Gary Waxman at the address below. Comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with Commission rules and forms should be directed to John J. Lane, Associate Executive Director, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, and Gary Waxman, Clearance Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Paperwork Reduction Act numbers 3235&hyph;0049; 3235&hyph;0048, and 3235&hyph;0047, Office of Management and Budget, room 3228, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20543. Dated: January 24, 1994. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3318 Filed 2&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;M
