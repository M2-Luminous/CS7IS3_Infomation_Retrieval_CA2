In the view of the security authorities, the banned Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK, is not interested in a more serious conflict with the German authorities. "The PKK has succeeded in putting the Kurdish problem in the limelight again," a high ranking official told FOCUS, "now they are trying to gain ground on the political and diplomatic stage." This includes congresses in other West European countries, organized by camouflage organizations or suborganizations of the PKK and staffed with renowned scientists and politicians. "One cannot speak of giving the all-clear," the official continued. There is no indication at all that the PKK is retreating from its double strategy -- constantly alternating between attacks and diplomatic efforts. The security authorities still have problems with the strictly closed cadre structures of the PKK -- and the power of the functionaries to mobilize crowds in the shortest possible time. The fact that demonstrators do not always come voluntarily is shown by latest findings of the Augsburg police about the highway riots last week: Even Kurdish children were forced under threat of physical violence to get on the buses for Augsburg.
