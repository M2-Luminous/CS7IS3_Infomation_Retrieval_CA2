You were born at the end of the war. Do you remember your first Victory Day? [Radetskyy] I remember how mother was preparing for this holiday. She baked patties and laid a festive table. The entire family was assembled. They remembered the strenuous war years. As a matter of fact, 9 May has become sanctified. So much blood was shed, so many people died, and so much property was burned down! Almost every Ukrainian family suffered. At that time nobody asked who did what during the war -- everybody did everything for the common cause and defended his fatherland. Besides, my father, a participant in the war, told much about the fighting at the front. His elder brother commanded a regiment. Our family has always held this day in esteem. I am sure that the present changes in Ukraine must not change the attitude toward veterans and toward the heroic deeds on all the fronts against the fascists. The people fought against an enemy who had come to enslave us. Today our veterans deserve more attention from the state and a better life. I have instructed deputy defense ministers, chiefs of central administrations, and commanders of the armed services and of Ukraine's Armed Forces districts to take care of communal graves and monuments and to greet the veterans. Let us be frank, we have not created suitable conditions for their lives. This is our common holiday, a day that we tried to bring nearer as much as we could. [Motornyy] How will the holiday be marked by the troops. [Radetskyy] On 9 May, we will hold solemn ceremonies, evening roll-calls, we will march with songs and bands, and, of course, fire the salute. This year, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of Ukraine's liberation and next May the 50th anniversary of victory. A special badge to mark the 50th anniversary of Ukraine's liberation has been designed. There will also be a medal. At present, our administration for personnel and mobilization must compile lists of veterans. We must do everything in order not to overlook anyone. Our ministry is trying to see to it that the veterans get their pensions on time. I will personally greet all the Heroes of the Soviet Union and holders of the three grades of glory. Incidentally, in the capital alone, there reside more than 150 Heroes. An order has already been issued for Ukraine's Armed Forces servicemen to visit the hospitals. Young soldiers will visit and greet veterans -- soldiers and officers. [Motornyy] What is your attitude toward the Soviet Army's combat and military patriotic traditions? [Radetskyy] Whether we want it or not, there exists the history of the former USSR, no matter how hard some people try to erase it. We have actually grown out of that history. It is the history of our fathers, grandfathers, and great grandfathers. Not everything was bad there. We must know about this and draw conclusions from that history. People have become used to extremes. First the monuments are erected, and now we want to destroy them right away. Leave them alone, so that they can remind us of those who made mistakes or committed crimes against their people. So that they will never be repeated. We must now have great respect for those who fought for Ukraine's independence in the ranks of the Soviet Army and for those who liberated the homeland in the ranks of the Ukrainian Insurrection Army. In my opinion, it is still difficult to assess the events that happened half a century ago. We must find out who did what and where during the war and after it. We must thoroughly study history and the archives. Today we must pay tribute to those people who fought for the liberation and independence of the Ukrainian state. It is up to history to sort out on whose side and how they did it. Time is the best teacher. Now about traditions. We must look upon them in a somewhat broader way -- not only during the times of the former USSR. We will go back to the Bohdan Khmelnytskyy period. Patriotism was always appreciated, and the defender-warrior was held in esteem. Thus, everything that was good must be taken on by the Ukrainian Army and everything positive must be used, multiplied, and developed. Everything negative must serve as a lesson for the future. We must not repeat the mistakes of previous generations. We must change the people's mentality. Take [writer Aleksandr] Solzhenitsyn. He asserts in IZVESTIYA that Ukraine and Belarus cannot exist separately and that they must be within Russia. However, the United States and Canada can peacefully coexist. Why can we not coexist with Russia, Poland, Belarus, or Moldova? [Motornyy] At this stage of building the Ukrainian State, we are in very bad need of modern armed forces that can defend the Ukrainian people. What are the components of our army's combat readiness? [Radetskyy] From the former Soviet Union, we inherited three military districts, the fleet, the Air Force, and the air defense. Earlier, it was fashionable to reform the army [allusion to former defense minister Morozov]. Namely, reduce or increase the amount of military technology or personnel. At present, we must not engage in reforms, but build our Armed Forces with a view to the future. Not a single state can exist without an institution of armed forces. It is one of the major guarantees of security for every country. Two important issues were discussed at a recent committee of the Defense Ministry. The first concerned the plan for building the Armed Forces for the period between 1994 and 2010. The second dealt with the training of personnel, in particular, officers. The thing is that, during the transitional period, we not only sustained material losses; there also were shortcomings in the training of personnel and specialists, and in methods. I believe that modern Ukrainian Armed Forces must not be large, but must be mobile, flexible, and equipped with up-to-date combat technology. They must be led by well-trained specialists. At present, we are raising the question of a mixed principle of bringing the army up to strength -- compulsory regular service and service on a contractual basis. This is cheaper for the state. It is better to deal with specialists who are in perfect command of tanks, launchers, or radar stations, than with young people who have just come from institutes of higher learning, collective farms, or factories. For a year and a half to two years, the soldier will only just master the complex technology. When will he actually serve?! Of course, in order to build a contemporary army, we need a strong economy. It is precisely the economy that determines everything, and in particular the combat readiness of the Armed Forces. [Motornyy] Vitaliy Hryhorovych, despite our poverty, do the Armed Forces get proper attention? [Radetskyy] Despite the difficult economic situation in Ukraine, we feel concern about our defender-warriors. It is pleasant to realize that the president, the government, and the main thing -- the Ukrainian people, simple laborers -- understand this. The numerical strength of our personnel has been specified. Ukraine's Armed Forces have three armed services -- ground, marine, and airborne defense. Of course, we do not receive funds and fuel in the way that we would like to, the way that it was done before, when gasoline flowed like a river and there was enough money. However, fuel and uniforms are being supplied in sufficient amounts, there is decent medical care, and officers are getting their salaries. Unfortunately, sometimes there are delays. There occur problems that do not even depend upon the minister of defense or upon the Cabinet of Ministers. Our army now has well-trained units and formations capable of defending sovereign Ukraine. It is precisely for that purpose that the Ukrainian Army exists. Of course, it would be better to have an army that would even today be perfectly well equipped with weapons and technology on full combat readiness.... On the eve of Victory Day, I want to report to the Ukrainian people that we are doing everything for the army to be able to do its direct duty -- the defense of Ukraine. Incidentally the Ukrainian Army enjoys a high rating among the population -- only the church is ahead of us. This has been confirmed by independent studies. Therefore, that tasks that the army is facing will be carried out with dignity. I have become convinced that the army needs strong, courageous, and tough people, who are well trained both morally and physically. Sports occupy a leading position in it. Quite soon, soldiers will be examined for the winter term. In particular, everybody will be examined for physical fitness -- from soldiers to the defense minister. We will examine all the soldiers, the warrant officers, the officers, and the generals. [Motornyy] What is your personal attitude toward sports activities? [Radetskyy] In the past, I went in for boxing and the military triathlon. The minister of defense starts his working day at 0730 in the morning and finishes at 2100 or 2200. That is an everyday practice. I also work on Saturdays. I sometimes even go to work on Sundays. Not because I fail to complete my work on weekdays. Simply, it is quieter on days-off -- nobody calls you to various meetings. With such a workload, one simply cannot survive without sports. [Motornyy] Among the readers of MOLOD UKRAYINY, there are many veterans of the great Patriotic War, the Ukrainian Insurrection Army, soldiers of the Armed Forces, and future defenders. What would you like to wish them on the eve of Victory Day? [Radetskyy] We have always been MOLOD UKRAYINY's well-wishers (I am not saying this because its correspondent is sitting in my office). Your newspaper has always been loyal and understanding with regard to Ukraine's Armed Forces. It has never relished the shortcomings that we have, but perceived them as the concern of the entire society. I am very grateful to journalists for their support of the army. Of course, we must be criticized, but in a just manner. Taking this opportunity, I want to express my personal gratitude, as well as that of the military board and the entire officers' corps for their concern about the Ukrainian Army. I wish journalists and readers of MOLOD UKRAYINY lasting health and success in the building of Ukraine! I congratulate you on Victory Day!
