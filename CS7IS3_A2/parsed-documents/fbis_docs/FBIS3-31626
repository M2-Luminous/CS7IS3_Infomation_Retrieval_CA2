The problem exists, and its essence is that NATO adopted this decision without consulting us, the foreign minister of the Russian Federation said in response to a question from Czech radio. [Begin recording; Kozyrev in Russian fading into superimposed Czech translation] Thus the ball is in their court. We favor a joint course of action and our choice [volba] is thus absolutely clear. But this has nothing to do with the lasting East-West division. I think that the concept of all spheres of influence in the sense of superpowers enjoying a dominant position is a remnant of the past. If we talk about spheres of interests, I do not conceal the fact that we have an interest in having good relations with the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia and that we perhaps even have special interests. But we respect all countries. You certainly understand that distant countries, with which we have never had close contacts, are one thing; but our contacts with the Czech lands are the closest possible. When I was speaking today to a professor of Russian at Charles University, he confirmed to me that there were so many people interested in studying it that students had to compete for places. We are pleased about this, and this is that special interest I spoke about--to preserve our cultural and spiritual relations. [end recording] However, the interpretation of some people, who say that Russia intends to dominate, dictate, and issue permission or bans, is absurd. This all is the past, Andrey Kozyrev stressed in his interview with Czech Radio. He went on to say: [Begin Kozyrev recording] The division of the world into blocs, the West and the East, is also the past. This is why I am striving to search for ways that would not preserve this division. The unification of Europe is the CSCE's final aim, expressed in every [CSCE] document, involving both us and you. And it is necessary to make further progress. I discussed this with the [Czech] president and the [Czech] foreign minister. It is necessary to think in specific terms. To be more specific, a CSCE meeting at the highest level will take place at the end of this year. In my view, this is the forum where decisions aimed at achieving this target should be made--instead of going the opposite way, toward some sort of crusade. The truth is that some demons, smelling of mothballs and emerging from graves, have been attacking us in an attempt to gain power over us. Some people speak about crusades, now at the end of the 20th century. Others speculate about a division of the world, for various reasons, into East and West. [end recording] In reality, we are living at the end of the 20th century, when the topical issue is a united Europe, the Russian foreign minister repeated and stressed. [Begin Kozyrev recording] This is a specific job. I am aware of the fact that many people do not like this because it involves ideas and day-to-day work. This is the most difficult process of dialogues, talks, and consultative meetings, acceptance of other views. You want one thing and your partner proposes something a bit different. Such day-to-day work is something you have to take into account. On the other hand, single-minded judges do not need to listen to anybody; they say what they want. This is why, for many cheap politicians, this is the activity they like most from a psychological point of view. On one side you have a concept, on the other a declaration. I am in favor of the former variant and this is also the purpose of my visit: not to look for disputed points and subjects but, instead, to look for progress towards a united Europe. As far as this is concerned, my talks with President Havel were very constructive indeed. He is a man who is also searching. He is prepared to listen and formulate ideas. To make statements to the media about insuperable differences is something different; it is a way to score political points on the domestic political scene. [end recording]
