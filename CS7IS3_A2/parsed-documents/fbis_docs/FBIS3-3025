"Macro-controls over the banking sector, however, should be distinguished from government mandates to banks," said Wang Chuanlun, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and an economics professor of Chinese People's University. To have macro-control means, the professor said, the government must establish and improve various kinds of financial markets in a systematic way. First to be established, Wang said, is a market for short-term inter-banking lending and borrowing, to be followed successively by a bill discount market, a market for the trading of treasury bonds, a market for the trading of enterprise bonds and shares and a mortgage loan market. In the meantime, he said, the existing foreign exchange market should be improved. For the central bank, he said, the main function is to maintain the value of the Chinese yuan and determine its exchange rates with other currencies. In converting existing banks into purely commercial banks, he said, the first thing to do is to determine their assets through careful auditing. It is necessary, he said, for the government to decide establishing some "policy" banks. But the government should have concrete decisions on who exercise control over such banks, where their founding capital should come from, and who will bear their future risks and losses.
