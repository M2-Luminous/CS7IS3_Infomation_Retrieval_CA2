"I am pleased to say that the Russian leaders promptly responded to my letter and expressed their concern over the latest aggravation of the conflict in Abkhazia," Shevardnadze told the Georgian news agency in response to the appeal made public by the Russian leadership on March 26. According to Shevardnadze, "the Abkhazian forces recently started a large-scale offensive in the Abkhazian mountains, resulting in scores of killed and wounded on both sides, notably women and children." He said that "especially dangerous were also new attacks on Georgian villages on the banks of the Inguri River" as a result of which 200 families from the village of Okurcha, Zugdidi District, had joined the thousands of refugees. Shevardnadze warned of the possibility of a new escalation of the conflict and added, "We support the Russian proposal on resuming the talks and are prepared to join them in Moscow very shortly." He was convinced that Russia "was capable of exerting active influence and playing a positive role in resolving the Abkhazian problem, notably in resolving the most painful issue - the return of over 300,000 refugees."
