Thoughts Inspired by the Results of the `Lima-93' International Naval and Aerospace Exhibition"] [Text] Dozens of arms exhibitions are held in the world every year. It is symbolic that the largest of them (the Abu Dhabi exhibition of arms and military hardware) was held at the beginning of 1993, while the second most important one (the "Lima-93" international naval and aerospace exhibition on the Malaysian island of Langkawi) marked the end of the year. For Russian defense industry workers both exhibitions were landmarks and were even unprecedented, above all because practically all our leading enterprises, scientific research institutes, and design bureaus engaged in designing and producing weapons were represented there for the first time, along with their latest products, including those stemming from conversion. It was these exhibitions that gave specialists an opportunity to judge the place that Russia holds on the world arms market and how successful our attempts have been to counter such arms suppliers as the United States, Britain, and France in a very fierce competitive struggle. In recent years Russia, in the grip of political confrontation, has lost many of its priorities, including those in the sphere of arms production and the arms trade. Since 1990 we have seen an almost fivefold reduction in arms exports. Market laws are particularly severe in this specific sphere of trade: Russia has reduced arms sales, and other countries have sharply increased production and at once filled the vacuum. The United States today controls more than 50 percent of world arms exports. So under these conditions the Russians' decision to participate so extensively in exhibitions was justified politically and economically, although to a considerable degree it was also risky. Russian defense industry workers -- above all, the organizers of our exhibit -- felt the tough pressure from competitors back during preparations for the exhibitions. Tribute must be paid to the specialists of the "Oboroneksport" Russian State Foreign Economic Association for Exports of Military Products and Services who, working in close contact with representatives of the Ministry of Defense, made a thorough study of the regions where exhibitions are held and of the interests of potential buyers. The best of what we have was shown both in the Emirates and in Malaysia. The S-300PMU-1 and S-300V, Igla, and Tor-M1 antiaircraft missile complexes and systems, the Piranya and Triton small and miniature [malyy i sverkhmalyy] submarines, and the Ka-50 combat helicopter were the real sensation of the exhibitions. The aviation section of the Malaysian exhibition was probably the most interesting. Some 300 major aviation companies presented their products -- everything that holds leading positions in the aviation world. The Russian exhibit appeared highly impressive against this background. Whereas our country demonstrated just one Ruslan and one MiG-29 fighter at the previous exhibition in Malaysia, we took four MiG-29's, two Su-27's, and also the MiG-31 long-range fighter-interceptor to "Lima-93." At the same time all the aircraft and airmen arrived straight from the ranks, as it were -- from combat air units -- and had not made any special preparation for the exhibition. Under a blazing sun (up to 40 degrees in the shade) our military engineers and technicians prepared the MiG's in just two days, exceeding all existing norms. The demonstration flights began right after the official opening of the exhibition, and our military airmen participated in each of them: Colonels Aleksandr Kutuzov and Vladimir Bazhenov, Lieutenant Colonels Boris Grigoryev, Vladimir Gryzlov, and Aleksandr Lichkun, and Majors Aleksey Sherstnev, Andrey Makarenko, and Aleksandr Katashinskiy, displaying brilliant skill in very complex aerobatics figures and eliciting the admiration of onlookers and specialists and the envy of foreign colleagues. "Selfless work by airmen with excellent hardware." This is not my assessment -- this was what the foreign press wrote about our airmen. Among the conversion output of defense enterprises specialists and businessmen showed special interest in the passenger surface-effect vehicles developed by the Central Design Bureau for Hydrofoils (Nizhniy Novgorod), in the underwater excursion craft created by St. Petersburg's "Rubin" Central Design Bureau for Marine Equipment, and in helicopters and launches which can be used for sea patrols, rescue operations, and services to island resorts. It is only to be regretted that for purely economic reasons these exhibits were shown in the form of models and photographs and not in real life. Incidentally, all the recreational vessels were sold out at the previous "Lima-91" exhibition before it ended. Journalists expect sensations from exhibitions. The Emirates' purchase of a large consignment of French Leclerc tanks was named as the sensation at "IDEX-93 in the United Arab Emirates, and at the "Lima-93" exhibition it was the contract to supply Malaysia with eight F/A-18 fighters, whereas the contract with Russia, which has long been in preparation, to supply the Malaysians with 18 MiG-29's was not signed. In my view the reasons for this are not commercial but purely political. This is particularly obvious in the context of the results of the conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Organization held in Seattle before the exhibition itself. We know that the ASEAN countries are the fourth largest source of imports to the United States and stand in sixth place among America's export markets. In 1992 the volume of U.S. trade with them amounted to $60 billion, while U.S. investments in these states topped $16 billion. The Americans held the conference with great pomp, making it their main aim to turn APEC into a disciplined organization capable of ensuring the expansion of trade and investments in the Asia-Pacific region. The first major obstacle to face them on this path was the refusal by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed to participate in the Seattle meeting. The main reason for the boycott was the reluctance to turn APEC into a means of U.S. domination over the countries of Southeast Asia. In the opinion of experts, Malaysia's purchase of U.S. fighters is a kind of goodwill gesture or an attempt at reconciliation with the United States. According to other assessments, Malaysia deliberately acquires military hardware from different countries, so "limiting these countries' opportunity for dictating terms and influencing Malaysia's policy." The contract with Russia for MiG-29's is still at the elaboration stage. "There is only a small holdup," Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed assured journalists, "and the champagne can already be ordered." I would like to hope that the skill of the Russian military airmen and the quality of our combat hardware demonstrated at the Malaysian exhibition will be a weighty factor in the competitive struggle with Western aircraft companies and a good argument in favor of signing the contract. But its birth pangs demand a thorough analysis and exacting assessments. The BROOKINGS REVIEW, published by the Brookings Institution in Washington, carried an analysis of Russian arms exports. It describes with heavy irony the history of the preparation of the MiG-29 contract. It reports, in particular, that representatives of 18 different intermediary organizations, each of which claimed to have the right to sell these aircraft, visited Malaysia within a short space of time. The competition that developed among the Russians created chaos and substantially undermined their positions in the negotiations. Until recently "Oboroneksport" was the head organization with the right to sell Russian weapons. With offices in 40 countries, it supplied abroad almost 90 percent of all the weapons exported by Russia. Recently the "Spetsvneshtekhnika" GVK [expansion unknown], the Main Administration for Cooperation and Collaboration, and "Promeksport" have been trading in weapons. Other organizations, including the manufacturing plants, have also sought the right to sell weapons, frequently competing but more frequently hindering each other in the conclusion of contracts. Shortly before the opening of the Malaysian exhibition the Russian Federation president signed an edict setting up the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company for Exports and Imports of Arms and Military Hardware on the basis of "Oboroneksport," "Spetsvneshtekhnika," and the Main Administration for Cooperation and Collaboration. The ink on the edict was not dry before a mighty wave of criticism crashed down on it in the press in full accordance with our Russian traditions. A group of very famous arms producers even proposed suspending the president's edict. Be that as it may, a desire to instill order in the arms trade and to elaborate a state concept of military exports can be seen behind the new presidential act. Only it is important that all the innovations do not end in an elementary shakeup of the former systems in order to satisfy somebody's ambitions, and that the tremendous experience accumulated by "Oboroneksport" over the 40 years of its existence and the unique cadres it has reared are fully employed when the new mechanism is created. We have only just realized the importance to Russia of arms exports and learned to ignore the preaching about the immorality of the arms trade which only recently was issuing both from the pages of the press and from parliamentary rostrums. I remember how Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation minister of defense who headed the Russian delegation at the Abu Dhabi exhibition, was forced to explain to our own Russian journalists that we do not seek to sell weapons to just anyone to be used in combat operations of an offensive nature or in order to upset the balance of forces in a region. We offer military output in strict accordance with international laws for defensive purposes. "Commerce will not conflict with politics but will ensure the achievement of Russia's political and economic ends." It is not only the destinies of millions of working people in the military-industrial complex and our economic revival that depend on whether our country returns to the world arms market and on how successful our arms business is -- the fate of Russia itself also depends on this.
