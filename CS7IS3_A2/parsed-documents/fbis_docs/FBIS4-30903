The valid Czech-German treaty, which forms the basis of mutual relations, certainly does not settle everything, but supposes that many questions felt by some people as a burden, will be solved or "dissolved" in the European framework, Vondra said. He stressed that the word "Sudeten German" had not been pronounced at all during the one-hour meeting. As for the compensation of the Czech victims of the Nazi regime, Vondra said that any dramatic progress in the issue could be hardly expected in 1994, the year described in Germany as a "superelection" one. He said he believed it was necessary to cultivate Czech-German relations and strive for progress feasible and acceptable on both sides. Some steps taken recently by the Czech Foreign Ministry and those envisaged by the government are aimed to support these tasks, Vondra added. As an example he gave the humanitarian gesture (financial support) towards the Czech citizens affected by the Nazi occupation, which can a little bit ease the "artificially raised tension". "It is only necessary that Czech-German relations are good, and that nobody expects what cannot be expected in the nearest future, and that the relations are not somehow impaired due to the excessive and sometimes also unfeasible expectations," Vondra stated. Stercken said the Czech Republic should have a clear idea of what it could do to ensure its interests, including those in relation to the European Union (EU). He said he accepted it with understanding that the Czech Government had not yet applied for EU membership, as everybody knew that the time would come when the Czech Republic would meet conditions for admission. He would be glad, he said, if Germany became the fourth country to ratify the agreement on the Czech Republic's association with the EU. Bundestag should do so in the nearest future. Stercken said he favoured "gradual association".
