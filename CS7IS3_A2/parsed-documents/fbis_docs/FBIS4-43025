Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that in general, there was consensus and unanimity on almost all issues. He also said that the government will take the necessary measures to deal with the developments as they are outlined. There is no reason for concern, he said, and added that the Greek Cypriot side has not subsided and will deal with every possibility. It is possible, he said, that Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis will go to New York in the coming days. Following today's National Council meeting, President Glavkos Kliridhis briefed Greek Ambassador Alexandros Sandhis on the decisions made in order for the latter to convey them to the Greek Government. When they arrived at the presidential palace this morning, the political party leaders were asked to comment on reports that the UN secretary general will submit a supplementary report to the Security Council. Democratic Rally Chairman Ioannis Matsis said it appears that pressure continues on the UN secretary general, and some do not want to abandon the effort to lead us where we do not want to go. Socialist EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis said that if the UN secretary general submits a supplementary report, it will mean that he has given in to pressure. Democratic Rally Chairman Spiros Kiprianou [title as heard] said that if reports are correct, it would be a new attempt to help out the Turkish side. AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] General Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias said that he had no doubt that there was an attempt to keep the confidence-building measures on the negotiating table so that the two sides could meet each other at some point. He added that yesterday's decision by the National Council on the confidence-building measures was correct, and that the issue is now whether the Greek Cypriot side will remain firm in its decisions. [passage omitted] Liberal Party President Nikolaos Rolandhis issued an open letter to President Kliridhis in which he expresses the view that the National Council has made a serious -- as he put it -- mistake in rushing with excessive speed to take a position on the UN secretary general's report before the Security Council's decision. Rolandhis also said that it was a mistake for the National Council to close the book on the confidence-building measures, and called on President Kliridhis not to reject a proposal for the return of part of Famagusta if Denktas accepts, even now, the 21 March document.
