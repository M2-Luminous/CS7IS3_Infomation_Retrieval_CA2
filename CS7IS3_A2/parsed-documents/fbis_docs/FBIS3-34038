A paper article here today said that any fair observer would feel astonished over any attempt to move around this reality with the object of procrastination in lifting the embargo or employing the sufferings of Iraqi people in cheap compromise and blackmail leading to materializing rejected political purposes that go contrary to the Iraqis' right in acquiring independent well. [sentence as received] The Iraqi paper referring to statements by some on the necessity of building confidence and the suspicious calls to delay the lifting of the sanctions until the conditions of this confidence were established, said that such statements and calls fall within manoeuvres of the United States aimed at involving others into such designs and preventing them from viewing right and maintain them within the aggressive American objectives that contradict legitimacy and the principles of right and justice. AL-THAWRAH said that confidence building between Iraq, the Security Council and the U.N. Special Committee for the sake of ending the injustice sustained by the Iraqi people could be reached through an understanding and an objective and fair outlook away from all evil purposes and motives. The paper pointed out that that needs from all concerned parties recognizing that Iraq had done all what it could to realize its obligations and pledges. The Iraqi paper further said that confidence building could not be established through manoeuvering or attempts to jump over realities or neglecting the sufferings of the Iraqi children, women and elderly. This could not also be achieved in lagging behind this international party or that who had accepted to become false witness in one of unprecedented humanitarian and ethical scandals in modern history. AL-THAWRAH concluded by saying that the United States and its satellites do not want to see realities or to have the embargo imposed on Iraq ending and therefore, the Security Council is required to take the initiative of implementing its obligations and putting an end to this flagrant breaching of all legal, just and humanitarian principles.
