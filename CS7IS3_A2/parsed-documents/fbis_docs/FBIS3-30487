It said the January 28 incident occurred after a confrontation between an American UN soldier and a plainclothes policemen, during which the latter was insulted despite having made known his profession. In an ensuing brawl involving some 20 UN troops and Skopje police, witnessed by several passersby, a shot was fired but caused no casualties, according to the paper. It did not say who had been responsible for the shot. UN military police then intervened to end the scuffle, after meeting resistance from U.S. forces, according to Vecer. Macedonian and United Nations officials, embarassed by the affair, refused to comment on the report, other than to say that the incident was under investigation. An estimated 1,000 UN troops, 315 Americans and 700 from Scandinanvian countries, have been deployed in Macedonia to prevent the republic from getting caught up in the conflict raging elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia.
