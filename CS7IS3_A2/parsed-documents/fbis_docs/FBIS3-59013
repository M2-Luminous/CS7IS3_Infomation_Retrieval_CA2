The president of the Commission mentioned the following: - Customs union. Mrs. Ciller outlined her country's efforts to complete union by the deadline that has been fixed (1995); - The EC/Turkey financial protocol, which is still deadlocked. "I have an idea about how to break the deadlock," said Mr. Delors; - Cyprus. "I think that if we find a solution for Cyprus, many of the obstacles now in our path will be removed, to Turkey's advantage," commented Mr. Delors. He added that the EC observer to the UN negotiations will only have the task of "keeping us updated on the negotiations"; - The Kurdish problem. "The Prime Minister explained her analysis of the situation and the efforts she is making to make the country more democratic and decentralize decisions. She hopes to promote a more active democracy enabling all citizens to participate in public affairs," said the president; - Former USSR. The southernmost countries of the former USSR were discussed. Mr. Delors commented: "It was very interesting for us to benefit from the experience of Turkey, which provides considerable aid for these countries." Mrs. Ciller then took part in an enlarged meeting with her minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Hikmet Cetin, and European Commissioners Sir Leon Brittan and Hans van den Broek.
