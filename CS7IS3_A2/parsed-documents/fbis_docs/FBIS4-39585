An appeal to the North Ossetian president, which came to ITAR-TASS from the Ingush permanent mission in Russia today, says that if the hostages are held any longer, the forum of public organisations reserves the right to hold up traffic from North Ossetia to the territories of the Stavropol, Kuban and the Don region as of June 11. Other protest actions and sanctions will be taken in future, the appeal said. Representatives of the north Caucasian people and Cossack troops from Russia's south come out for strict implementation of the Russian president's decree of May 30, 1994, including in part concerning the immediate release of hostages, the appeal said.
