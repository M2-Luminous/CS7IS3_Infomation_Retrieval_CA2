Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the cabinet today decided to keep the closure in effect until after Independence Day and to discuss its duration and magnitude in its meeting next week. The cabinet also consented to import 18,000 foreign workers: 15,000 in construction and 3,000 in agriculture. They will begin working within three to five weeks and will be issued six-month work permits. It was also decided to subsidize the employment of 4,000 foreign workers in agriculture, including 2,000 who are already working in this sector. The cabinet decided to set up a team to examine the plan to employ high school students and soldiers in agriculture until the foreign workers arrive. The prime minister said in the meeting that we should rid ourselves of our dependence on laborers from the territories, a dependence which forces us to decisions which endanger the security of the citizens.
