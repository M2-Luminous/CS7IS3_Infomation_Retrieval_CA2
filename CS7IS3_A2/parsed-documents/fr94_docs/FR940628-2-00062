FR940628-2-00062 FR940628-2-00050 Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental Take Permit for a Residential Development in Brevard County, FL AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Brandon Capital Corporation (Applicant) is seeking an incidental take permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The proposed permit would authorize for a period of 2 years, the incidental take of a threatened species, the Florida scrub jay, Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens, incidental to construction of the Villages of Tramore, consisting of 20 patio homes and associated infrastructure on 3.78 acres (Project). The Project is located along State Road A1A south of the city of Melbourne, in the Coconut Point area of Brevard County, Florida. The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP) for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office address below. This notice also advises the public that the Service has made a preliminary determination that issuing the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding of No Significant Impact is based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no sooner than 30 days from the date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). DATES: Written comments on the permit application, EA, and HCP should be received on or before July 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the application, HCP, and EA may obtain a copy by writing the Service's Southeast Regional Office, Atlanta, Georgia. Documents will also be available for public inspection by appointment during normal business hours at the Regional Office, or the Jacksonville, Florida, Field Office. Written data or comments concerning the application, EA, or HCP should be submitted to the Regional Office. Please reference permit under PRT&hyph;791241 in such comments. Assistant Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1875 Century Boulevard, Suite 200, Atlanta, Georgia 30345 (telephone 404/679&hyph;7110, fax 404/679&hyph;7081). Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 6620 Southpoint Drive, South, Suite 310, Jacksonville, Florida 32216&hyph;0912 (telephone 904/232&hyph;2580, fax 904/232&hyph;2404). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dawn Zattau at the Jacksonville, Florida, Field Office, or Rick G. Gooch at the Atlanta, Georgia, Regional Office. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total estimated population is between 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the State of Florida, it has been estimated that the scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the last 100 years. The scrub jay survey provided by the Applicant indicates that one family currently uses the site and surrounding suitable habitat areas. The Applicant proposes to impact a portion of this family's territory. Initial construction of roads and utilities and subsequent development of individual homesites may therefore result in death of, or injury to, scrub jays incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat alteration associated with property development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat. To minimize and mitigate the impacts of the loss of 3.78 acres of scrub jay habitat, the Applicant will purchase 7.0 acres of scrub habitat known to support the scrub jay, deed the property to Brevard County, and provide a management endowment of $7,500 to ensure management of the site in perpetuity. Other measures proposed by the Applicant include siting of individual building footprints to minimize additional scrub habitat alteration, and protection of active nests, if discovered, during the nesting season. The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted, consideration of management of surrounding publicly-owned lands as mitigation in lieu of offsite purchase, and no action. Dated: June 20, 1994. James W. Pulliam, Jr., Regional Director. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15594 Filed 6&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;P
