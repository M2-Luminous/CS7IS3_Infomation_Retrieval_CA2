In general, the floor was taken by members of the parliamentary opposition -- Syamdzyanava, Novik, Dzeyka, Navumchyk, and Holubew. They sharply criticized the current political situation in the republic. Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb reported that the Supreme Soviet Presidium had received proposals to include certain other issues on the agenda. For example, draft legislation on archives, which was proposed by People's Deputy Aleh Trusaw, was included on the agenda. The issue of science and technical activities, on the other hand, did not receive the required number of votes and was not included on the agenda, as well as certain other issues. People's Deputy Ihar Demyanchuk approached the microphone and proposed to include on the agenda the issue of violating human rights in the Republic of Belarus. However, the issue was not included, because only 66 people's deputies supported this. Belarusian Attorney General Vasyl Shaladonaw came forward with a proposal to strip People's Deputy Syarhey Antonchyk of parliamentary immunity and bring him to administrative account. One hundred eighty eight people's deputies voted to include this issue on the agenda. Therefore, the issue will be addressed at the current session. People's Deputy Uladzimir Novik suggested that the financial credit policy of the Republic of Belarus be discussed first. This was the course of the morning session. During the recess, I held an interview with People's Deputy Inesa Mikhaylovna Drabyshewskaya. [Begin recording] [Rutkowski] It was not a coincidence that the issue of implementing the Chernobyl program was also excluded. Inessa Mikhaylovna, what is your opinion on the attitude of people's deputies toward resolving problems of Chernobyl? [Drabyshewskaya, in Russian] I was really dumbfounded when they excluded the debate on implementing the Chernobyl program, because I live in the Chernobyl zone, and I was elected to serve as an advocate for this program. We know that the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster is evident in our oblast, with regard to the rate of diseases among adults and children, the deterioration of people's immune systems, and the rate of birth defects. The number of cases of oncological diseases increased by 6 percent last year, including among children. [Rutkowski] What, in your opinion, are the reasons behind this specific attitude of people's deputies toward the Chernobyl problems? [Drabyshewskaya] The Chernobyl problem is one of the most important economic problems. There is no money to implement this program. [Words indistinct] another, strictly political issue. The legislative body violated the law, having misinterpreted it. [Rutkowski] Do you have in mind Syarhey Antonchyk? [Drabyshewskaya] In this case this concerns Antonchyk, Drabyshewskaya, Kamay, and all people's deputies. This become a precedent. This precedent should be discussed by the legislative body according to a law that is called the rules. [end recording] Now, I am talking with People's Deputy Stanislav Stanislavovich Shushkevich [former Supreme Soviet Chairman]. [Begin recording] [Rutkowski] Stanislav Stanislavovich, with what opinions and feelings did you come to today's session, and what is your assessment on the political situation in the Republic? [Shushkevich] I came to the session to work. The point is whether we will discuss economic issues. I do not know if we are going to address them first. If these issues are not discussed, other things will not have any sense. Let us say frankly that the government is unable to manage the state, and that its goal is to give up our state to Russia under any conditions. We must resist this, because there are enough people in Belarus who are able to lead the state, and we must make room for them. The elections must be held. I believe that it is a felony to delay the elections until November. [end recording] At the end of my report I will add that people are gathering at Independence Square and in front of the House of Government.
