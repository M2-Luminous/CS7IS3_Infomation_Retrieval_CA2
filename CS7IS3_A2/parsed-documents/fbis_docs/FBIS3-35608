It discussed the economic problems of the Urals territories and also made a decision to create the Assembly of Ural Deputies or, as it is unofficially being called, the Urals Senate. At a final press conference Eduard Rossel came out with a statement on the creation of the Assembly of Urals Deputies. At a request from KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent he explained that parliamentarians of all Urals regions are associating not to strengthen opposition to the president's course but to undertake "day-to-day parliamentary work." Observers point out, however, that the Urals Assembly has chances of becoming a serious political force in the federal parliament, capable -- relying on the support of the regional association -- of influencing both the government and the president. Touching on the question of possible ratification by the federal parliament of the constitution of the Urals Republic, its former governor Mr. Rossel said that this question is not so urgent. Nonetheless all the requisite documents have been sent to the State Duma. To deal with a number of regional problems, Mr. Rossel reported, a special commission is being set up under the Russian president which will also include members of the Association for Economic Cooperation of the Urals Republics and Regions. Among the statements made by representatives of the Urals regions the most attention was drawn to the report by Vladimir Yelagin, head of the Orenburg Oblast administration: He said that the spring sowing campaign may not be held in the oblast, which currently supplies grain to 64 regions in Russia. The reason is the lack of funds: The government has not as yet settled the old debts, and hopes for credits is very small. The council session decided to submit to the government 12 economic programs for the development of the Urals, including on conversion, communications, agriculture, and also on improving the financial settlements system. Special consideration was given to the prospects of producing optical fiber communication facilities. As Anatoliy Barulin, chief designer at a defense institute, told KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent, the Urals enterprises undergoing conversion are capable, for instance, of controlling the market for modern communications means in Russia. Thus, the meeting in Chelyabinsk has demonstrated the regional leaders' serious intention to increase the political and industrial influence by the Urals lobby in Moscow.
