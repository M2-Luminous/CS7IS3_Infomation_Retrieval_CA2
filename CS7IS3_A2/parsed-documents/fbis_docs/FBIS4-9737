The announcement was made at the closing of the Fourth Mapuche Tribunal held by this organization, which also was attended by especially invited Mapuche Indians from Argentina. The Mapuche organization also decided to ask for the immediate revision of the land treaties signed by various Chilean governments and it also questioned the government policy regarding the Indian population. Council President Aucan Huilcaman announced that the process "for recovering the land" will be resumed in the next few weeks. Huilcaman added: "Before occupying the land we will show the documents proving that the recovered land really belongs to the Mapuche." In 1992, Mapuche Indians belonging to the All-Lands Council peacefully occupied some land in the Ninth Region, from which they were evicted by police. On orders from then-Interior Minister Enrique Krauss, more than 100 Indians were tried for "illegal association" and "illegal takeover of land" and some were imprisoned. There are about 1 million Indians in Chile, of which about two-thirds are Mapuche. During the government of President Patricio Aylwin (1990-1994), Congress approved an Indian law culturally recognizing the ethnic groups that live in Chile and establishing a series of mechanisms for their social and economic development. The law also created the National Land Fund to help contribute to the recovery of some of the land taken away from the Indian population or to purchase new land.
