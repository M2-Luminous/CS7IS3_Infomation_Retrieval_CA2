One of the conspicuous ideas is that, while improving economic results, we should accelerate economic development. In his talks during an inspection tour to southern China, he pointed out: "Those blessed with conditions advantageous to development should not be obstructed. In areas where conditions permit, local development should proceed as fast as possible. Nothing is to be feared so long as we stress efficiency and quality and develop the export-oriented economy." He also pointed out: "In developing China's economy, we should strive to reach a new rung every few years. Of course, this should not be interpreted as encouraging an unrealistically high speed. We should be down to earth and stress efficiency to realize steady and coordinated progress." When hearing reports on the Sixth Five-Year Plan, he pointed out: "We should attach importance to improving economic results and not blindly pursue growth in output value and output." On two occasions when hearing reports on the economic situation, he stressed: "We should not stress only product quantity but should first stress quality. The key to expanding export sales lies in improving product quality.... Otherwise, the long-term, sustained, and stable development of the economy will be out of the question and the economy will eventually wither some day." "In industrial production, especially the production of export products, the focus is on improving quality and placing quality first." We can thus see that there are conditions, preconditions, or basic requirements when Comrade Deng Xiaoping stresses the need to accelerate economic development. These conditions, preconditions, or basic requirements are efficiency, quality, export orientation, and the maintenance of stable and coordinated development or, what we usually call economic results in a broad sense. Therefore, when considering the issue of accelerating economic development, we must place the fundamental starting point on improving economic results: "Shifting the economic work as a whole onto an orbit based on improving the economic results." At present, China's economic work still falls far short of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's aforesaid demands. This finds expression in the following four principal aspects: 1. The economic results are still relatively poor. In recent years, China's total output value of industrial production has been growing at an average annual rate of over 10 percent, reaching over 20 percent in certain years, but the number of enterprises operating at a loss and the total amount of losses have kept on rising. In the first 11 months of 1993, the four principal performance indicators, i.e., the product sales rate, the ratio of profits and taxes to capital, the cost-profit ratio, and the rate of circulating fund turnover, were all lower than the levels during the Seventh Five-Year Plan. This situation of high speed and poor efficiency shows that China's industry has not changed its extensive operation of highly efficient mobilization but inefficient use of resources. 2. Product quality has not been improved considerably. Despite much efforts to improve quality, there have been little results. Not only have the grade and level of many products not been raised but the production of shoddy products has continued in spite of repeated prohibitions. What is more serious is that there have been frequent cases of fake and shoddy products, especially fake medicines, insecticides, and chemical fertilizers which harm the state and the people. The quality of a country and a nation is eventually reflected in its material products; the economic results of an enterprise also come directly from its products. Without high quality products, how can we get good economic results and improve the quality of people's lives? 3. The growth in export earnings has been less than satisfactory. According to statistics, in the first 11 months of 1993, the country's total import and export volume rose by 16.5 percent over the corresponding period in the previous year. Total import volume grew by 27.8 percent while total export volume by only 6.2 percent, a disparity of over 20 percentage points. We should affirm the tremendous achievements in opening up to the outside world but we should not overlook the problems in developing an export-oriented economy, especially in increasing foreign exchange earnings through exports. If we fail to increase export earnings, this will in turn restrict our efforts to open wider to the outside world. We must attach great importance to the economic results in developing an export-oriented economy--export earnings. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed this out as far back as in 1985. He said: "We have just started to turn the economy in the special economic zones from domestic-oriented to export-oriented and, for this reason, we still do not have many good products for export. As long as Shenzhen fails to do this, it has not passed the test and cannot prove that its development is sound." Naturally, we cannot say that Shenzhen and many coastal areas have not passed the test till now. However, as far as most localities and enterprises are concerned, they have not yet passed the test or at least have not passed the test satisfactorialy. 4. The economic structure is still irrational. Imbalances in the economic structure have always been a major problem obstructing China's sound economic growth. It is also a fundamental crux affecting the improvement of economic results. Although we have made constant adjustments, we have not been able to get rid of the interruptive and ill effects of an imbalanced structure. Today, the irrational conditions in product mix, industrial structure, and the enterprise organization pattern are still quite serious and are tending to worsen in some respects. The chief manifestations are: Infrastructure has obviously lagged behind in national economic development; basic industry has lagged far behind the processing industry; within the processing industry, goods in great demand are extremely undersupplied while goods for which there is no consumer demand are extremely oversupplied; and the level of enterprise specialized and socialized production is low. According to surveys, in recent years we have been able to meet only about 80 percent of demand for power supplies, 60 percent of demand for railway transport, and only one-third of the demand for some major bottleneck aspects [zhu yao xian zhi kou 0031 6008 7098 0455 0656]. In light of the irrational economic structure, in a talk with comrades in charge of the State Planning Commission in 1982 Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "In our overall economic development strategy, energy and transport are focus points as is agriculture." He also pointed out: "If we really want to engage in construction, we should build some key projects. It will not do if we do not have some key projects.... We would rather cut back on local projects, especially some ordinary processing industrial projects." In December 1986, he again stressed that "we can only take this path." It now seems that we should take this path even more unswervingly. What should we do to improve economic results? Aside from deepening reform, we should rely on scientific and technological progress and improvement in the quality of laborers. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has a series of expositions on this count. At the National Conference on Science in March 1978, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Contemporary natural science is being applied to production on an unprecedented scale and with unprecedented speed. This has given all fields of material production an entirely new look. With the same manpower and the same number of man-hours, people can turn out scores or hundreds of times more products than before now. What has brought about the tremendous advances in the productive forces and the vast increase in labor productivity? Mainly the power of science and the power of technology." In 1988 Comrade Deng Xiaoping again made a highly theoretical condensation of the primary transformation role of science and technology in contemporary productive forces and socioeconomic development from a new angle of view. He pointed out: "Marx said that science and technology are productive forces and facts have proven that his remark is quite correct. As I see it, science and technology are primary productive forces." Precisely because he has a profound understanding of the tremendous role of contemporary science and technology, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed: China cannot develop without science. It must rely on science, technology, and education. In line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's aforementioned ideas, the 13th Party Congress explicitly put forward the need to "place the development of scientific, technological, and educational cause in first place and shift economic construction onto the orbit of relying on scientific and technological progress and improving the quality of laborers." It should be soberly noted that promoting scientific and technological progress and improving the quality of laborers is an arduous, complex, and gigantic project which requires hard and protracted efforts on our part. At present, further efforts should be made to solve the following three issues well: First, uphold the principle that economic construction must rely on science and technology and that the latter must be geared to the former. Science and technology should give priority to promoting economic construction and improving economic results; vigorously strengthening the integration of science and industry, of science and agriculture, and the integration of science and trade; and quickening the pace of turning scientific and technological achievements into real productive forces. We should attach importance to the technological renovation of existing enterprises and improve the economic results of stock assets by improving and developing production technology, optimizing the allocation of incremental assets, and improving the economic results of stock assets. Second, attach great importance to education, especially the training of in-service workers and staff members, to improve the quality of laborers. While affirming the vigorous development of educational undertakings, we must also squarely face the problems that exist. Viewed from the current situation, the many problems criticized by Comrade Deng Xiaoping have not been resolved and some have even taken a continuous turn for the worse. Take for example, the remuneration of intellectuals. The leaders of some localities and units spend a lot of money on new sedans but they do not guarantee the basic wages of teachers. The phenomenon of stressing formality and going through the motions in training in-service workers and staff members is also conspicuous, leading to a relative drop in the quality of workers and staff members in many enterprises. For this reason, we should keep firmly in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instruction that "education should be firmly grasped," put in a lot of time and energy in realistically solving the existing problems, and speedily raise the quality of laborers. Third, energetically study and take for reference advanced foreign technology and managerial expertise and follow a new path of mastering and assimilating imported technology. In the past few years, we have continuously broadened the scope of studying and taking for reference advanced foreign technology and managerial experience but we have not attached sufficient importance to the work of mastering and assimilating what we have imported. We have spent a lot of money importing equipment, even advanced equipment, but we have not done a good job of mastering and assimilating what we have imported and some equipment has not been applied in production for a long time. Although we have introduced a lot of advanced managerial expertise, we have mastered little, with some being pigeonholed or laid aside. This trend should be rectified as quickly as possible. When importing advanced foreign technology and managerial expertise in future, we should conduct scientific demonstrations and make the correct choice. We should consider not only their advanced character but, more importantly, their suitability. Genuine efforts should be made to closely integrate their introduction into the country with their mastery and assimilation and we should be good at turning other people's know-how into our own. In short, improving economic results is a crucial issue which has a bearing on whether or not we can increase our comprehensive national power, raise the people's living standards, and build up our capacity for sustained economic development. This should draw the close attention of the whole party. Conscientious efforts should be made to rectify the tendency of regarding speed as superior to efficiency and unswervingly take the development path of stressing quality and efficiency to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu, kuai su, jian kang 2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256 1660] development of the national economy.
