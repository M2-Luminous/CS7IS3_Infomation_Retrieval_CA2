The office's chief information officer, Dr. Suparman Sh [Master of Law], in a talk with newsmen here also dismissed as untrue suggestions that it was conducting the enquiry "under pressure". "What we are investigating now is a pure penal case and there is no political intrigue behind it nor are we being pressured by anyone," he said. However, he said he could not guarantee that the case would remain a pure penal case. "Nobody can be sure that the case will remain so," he said. Suparman also refuted media reports criticizing the Attorney General's Office for allegedly not being very objective in deciding who had to be subjected to questioning in connection with the Bapindo credit scam. "We are not discriminative in our investigations. If to date we have detained only two persons this is merely in accord with the evidence collected so far," he said. Since the inquiry of the case began the Attorney General's Office has detained two persons, namely E.T., chairman of GKG [Golden Key Group] group of companies and Sup, former deputy head of Bapindo's Kuningan branch office. A number of other persons often mentioned in the media as being most probably involved in the case, have so far not been arrested. Suparman said in conducting the inquiry into the Bapindo bad debt case the Attorney General's office was sticking strictly to the penal code (KUHP), other relevant laws and regulations as well as banking laws. He called on the public to observe self-restraint in making comments on the on-going investigations of the case, saying that comments not based on precise knowledge of the matters at hand would only mislead society. Meanwhile E.T. was today again interrogated by Attorney General's Office investigators. On Tuesday Kusno Aksan, a top management officer of three companies owned by E.T., was questioned by Attorney General's Office agents as a material witness.
