"Everybody may do everything which is not forbidden by the law," Tothova said today at a press conference of the "shadow cabinet" of the HZDS leader and former premier, Vladimir Meciar. She said she considered it highly moral that the HZDS was preparing its own potential of experts, and recommended other parties to follow suit. She said she expected the HZDS to be represented in the government after the autumn elections. Although polls have shown a decline in the HZDS's popularity, the movement still enjoys the highest confidence of voters (27 percent), and has great election ambitions. On Wednesday [18 May], PRAVDA rescinded the contract with the HZDS for its "not keeping to the advertising rules." The full-page advertisements worth almost 2.5 million crowns ($80,600) will not be published any longer. Besides the conditions of public competition, they also included attacks against Slovak President Michal Kovac and some members of the present cabinet of Jozef Moravcik.
