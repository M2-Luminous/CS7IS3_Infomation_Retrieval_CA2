This joint French and Bulgarian project was an initiative of J. Stamenov, director of the Sofia Nuclear Research Institute, and J.-P. Carbonnel, head of research at the CNRS [French National Center for Scientific Research] responsible for this project on behalf of the French Environment Ministry. The implementation of this project is the concrete result of the French Embassy's wish to come to the assistance of Bulgarian science. From 19 to 25 September, a summer university made it possible for research workers from the two countries to discuss the results of an initial field campaign to monitor the ecology of the Musala mountain range and consider future cooperation. For example, Meteo-France [French Meteorological Office] will supply two high- mountain meteorological stations, and the University of Franche- Comte will supply a complete set of equipment for continuously measuring radon in water. Moreover, the various Bulgarian laboratories involved will be linked up by a computer network, thanks to funding from the French Foreign Ministry. In order to optimize coordination of the cooperative efforts, a scientific interest grouping (GIS) will be set up this month in Paris.
