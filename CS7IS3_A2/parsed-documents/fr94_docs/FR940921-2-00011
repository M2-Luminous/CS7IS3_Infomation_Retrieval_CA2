Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements September 14, 1994. Commissioner of Customs, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229. Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on February 1, 1994, by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. That directive concerns imports of certain cotton and man-made fiber textile products, produced or manufactured in Pakistan and exported during the twelve-month period which began on January 1, 1994 and extends through December 31, 1994. Effective on September 22, 1994, you are directed to establish a limit for cotton and man-made fiber textile products in Categories 342/642 for the period beginning on July 28, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994 at a level of 66,266 dozen 1 . Textile products in Category 342 which are exported on and after July 28, 1994 are not subject to the group limit. 1 The limit has not been adjusted to account for any imports exported after July 27, 1994. For the import period April 29, 1994 through May 19, 1994, you are directed to charge 200 dozen for Category 642 to the limit established in the directive dated May 13, 1994 for Categories 342/642 for the period beginning on April 29, 1994 and extending through July 27, 1994. Imports charged to the limit for Categories 342/642 for the April 29, 1994 through July 27, 1994 period shall be charged against that level of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balance. In the event the limit established for that period has been exhausted by previous entries, such goods shall be subject to the level set forth in this directive. In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that this action falls within the foreign affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). Sincerely, Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23316 Filed 9&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DR&hyph;F
