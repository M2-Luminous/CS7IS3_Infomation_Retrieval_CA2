According to an information released yesterday by OUEST-FRANCE, a French UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] soldier shot a Serbian sniper on 25 December who was terrorizing people in Sarajevo. "It was the first time it happened," commented Colonel Traqui, the commander of the French detachment in Sarajevo. "In the past, we fired shots even though the targets had neither been located, nor identified. (...) After multiple acts of provocation, we thus showed our exasperation." It is in this context that the French Government will take advantage of the upcoming NATO summit on Monday [10 January] to try to compel the Atlantic Alliance -- and most of all the United States -- to commit itself more actively in the settling of the crisis in former Yugoslavia. The feeling of irritation expressed by the military heads of UNPROFOR -- which was shown by the anticipated departure from Sarajevo of Belgian General Francis Briquemont -- has been largely supported in France by the political leaders. Foreign Minister Alain Juppe expressed the hope on Tuesday that the NATO summit would provide a "new initiative." Governmental circles indicate that the stake will be to have the United States stop "beating about the bush" and show a "real will to act." In this context, Defense Minister Leotard would like "the United States to intervene and help us so that this war does not extend to the whole of Southern Europe." In concrete terms, French officials think an initiative that would bring all the belligerents to a real negotiation implies an active participation of the United States in reinforcing UNPROFOR, at all levels -- either diplomatic or political. The 26,000 UN troops stationed in former Yugoslavia, and chiefly the 12,000 who are in Bosnia, are incapable to fight against the probable attacks by the warring sides next spring. The security zones, such as Tuzla and Srebenica, are about to be blocked by the Serbs who deny access to them whenever they want to. It is becoming more and more obvious that a total withdrawal of the UNPROFOR will be envisaged if the UN ground forces are not considerably reinforced (which implies a U.S. participation) with a possible shift to air raids and renewed diplomatic pressures on the belligerents. The French officials consider this solution as being "the worst" of all and do not want to be the only ones to take the responsibility. With the first contingent (6,000 troops) of Blue Helmets on the spot, France has done much in trying to solve this crisis which it also considers as a test for the future of the stability in Europe. Signs from London and Ottawa seem to indicate that France is about the only country to believe that a withdrawal is not unavoidable. In the worst case, the French Government -- which is not too hopeful that the American "wait-and-see" attitude will turn into a "will to act" -- will have to realize that NATO is helpless; in the meantime new negotiations on former Yugoslavia will start in Geneva in a few days.
