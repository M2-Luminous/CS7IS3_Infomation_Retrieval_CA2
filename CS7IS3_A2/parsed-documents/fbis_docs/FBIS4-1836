Cannes organizers demanded that the ROC delegation change its name to "Taiwan, China," under pressure from Beijing, a GIO spokesman said. The GIO strongly condemned the move and said the organizers are politicizing the TV industry, which it said should remain a commercial activity. The GIO in turn has decided to dispatch only representatives of the three local TV stations to participate in the 1994 festival, because they are "civilian" operators. In the past, the ROC delegation has been comprised of representatives from the GIO, from Taiwan's public television station, and from the mass media. Beijing in the last several years has intensified efforts to downgrade the ROC at the festival. Last year, Beijing demanded that the organizers remove the ROC flag representing the Taiwan delegation. In mid-March, the Cannes organizers demanded that the ROC change its promotional pamphlet title from "Taipei TV Group, ROC" to "Taiwan."
