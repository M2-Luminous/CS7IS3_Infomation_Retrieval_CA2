The famous Senator Larry Pressler, whose amendment is being used mercilessly in Pakistan for the last two years and who is a living example of U.S. narrow mindedness, unfairness, anti-Muslim attitude, and swindles, was also there. The peculiarity of this law is that while dozens of countries in the world have nuclear bombs, it is implemented only against Pakistan. India has nuclear weapons as does Israel. Russia has nuclear weapons as do many European countries. However, the United States did stop economic or military aid to any of these countries while demanding that they roll back their nuclear programs, open up their nuclear installations for inspection, and sign a unilateral agreement on nuclear nonproliferation. All these conditions under the Pressler Amendment apply to Pakistan only. Why? Just because Pakistan is a Muslim country! Since Israel, Russia, and India are not Islamic nations, the United States does not impose these strict rules on them. Does not this create enmity toward Muslims and, according to the favorite U.S. definition, make the United States a fundamentalist itself? However, the United States stubbornly continues to accuse Pakistan and other Islamic countries of fundamentalism. These countries just love their national independence and want the world to respect them. Mr. Larry Pressler was asked at the Islamabad press conference why the Pressler Amendment was implemented only against Pakistan. Is it not unfair to single out one nation in the world and accuse it? Mr. Larry Pressler spat out the truth in his response. This is part of the usual U.S. policy which is not admitted to at the diplomatic level. Mr. Pressler said that during the 1980s there was information in the media that an `Islamic bomb' was being made and its technical knowledge could be transferred from one nation to another. Yes! This is the real fear and all these efforts are being made to stop it. Campaigns are launched against Muslim countries. They are surrounded after being accused of fundamentalism, and they are being deprived of their rights in the international brotherhood like second-class members. Their national autonomy is challenged at every step. At times, Iran is accused of terrorism and at other times the Sudanese government is censured by calling it a military dictatorship. They ask why General Abdul Bashir is experimenting with establishing an Islamic form of government? Plans to divide up Sudan and create a Christian country from within it are approved so that anti-Islamic forces could use this place as their base. The establishment of Muslim rule following the democratic process in Algeria is being objected to because the Islamic Salvation Front might come to power using the slogan of an Islamic form of government. The United States, which opposes military dictatorship in Sudan on principle, becomes a champion and supporter of a military dictatorship that is against democracy there. When Pakistan takes the path of self-dependence in defense, its efforts at self-dependence are opposed and labeled as efforts to make the Islamic bomb. It is threatened with being called a terrorist nation, its elected government is overthrown under a conspiracy, and a government headed by persons of its own liking is installed there. The Islamic world never called these actions Christian fundamentalism. Instead, we used political definitions and called it American colonialism. We did not denounce it using some religious terms. As soon as Larry Pressler told the truth and explained the real reason behind the Pressler Amendment, Senator Brown, the other senator present in that press conference, denied the idea of an Islamic bomb by saying that there is no such thing as the Islamic bomb. The United States is just trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and is not doing that because of a preference for any religion. It is not focusing on Pakistan; it tries to check nuclear weapons anywhere in the world where it knows they exist. In our opinion, Mr. Brown's explanation was an effort to cover up. The U.S. policy is not what Mr. Brown tells us; it is what Mr. Pressler has explained to us. Pakistan has to accept Mr. Pressler's definition of U.S. policy because the law is based on Mr. Pressler's definition, and not on the one that follows the policy explained by Mr. Brown. If Mr. Brown's definition was correct and the United States is not just trying to stop the Islamic bomb, it would have put similar pressure on dozens of non-Muslim countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America that have become nuclear powers during the last two decades. No restrictions were imposed even on India under the Pressler Amendment. Israel, South Africa, Brazil, and European nations have the full freedom; pressure is being put only on Pakistan. Mr. Pressler argues that Pakistan's bomb could get into the hands of Iraq or Libya any time. This is a product of a prejudiced Jewish or Christian mind. They are worried about proliferation of weapons from one country to another, but they do not remember that it was the United States itself that had installed those missiles loaded with nuclear weapons in many places in Europe under the NATO agreement. These missiles are capable of putting more than half the world to the sleep of death in one second. The senator, from a country that has been planning this dangerous game of weapons of massacre for the last 40 years and is credited with dropping the only two atomic bombs deployed in history on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, killing hundreds of thousands of people, should be embarrassed when he states that Pakistani bombs could reach Iraq or Libya and cause world's destruction. The United States should first wipe out the stigma of the largest massacre of human life in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. This U.S. attitude is making the Muslims angry. The results will not be good. No country remains victorious or vanquished forever.
