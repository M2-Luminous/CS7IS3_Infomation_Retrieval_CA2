Yonezawa was selected on the second day of the party's convention without a vote since he was uncontested. The No. 2 post of secretary general was assumed by Kansei Nakano, a veteran party member of the House of Representatives. Ouchi, health and welfare minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, stepped down from the party chairmanship under pressure from rank-and-file party members and supporters. They have been disgruntled by his high-handed move to create a new parliamentary group, "Kaishin," without participation from the Social Democratic Party (SDP), then the coalition's largest bloc. The SDP consequently walked out of the grouping just after Hata was elected prime minister, depriving the coalition of majority support. At the convention, Yonezawa acknowledged the party's growing distrust of its main coalition partners, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party], as well as ire toward the SDP. He made clear he wants to keep the DSP within the coalition to counter the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest opposition force, while suggesting alliance talks with SDP lawmakers. "There are also people within the SDP who can be our friends," he said. He took critics against Shinseito and Komeito to task, calling them "emotional."
