As far as I recall this is not the first time in the past 18 months that someone at the very highest level has assured the Army: Attempts to economize at the expense of servicemen's social protection will be prevented. On this occasion it was the Finance Ministry which had proposed scrapping free medical services for reservists and retired servicemen, the compulsory insurance of officers' property, interest-free loans for military college graduates to help them settle in and for officers to build houses and cottages, and the one-off grant equivalent to 20 times the [monthly] salary for those discharged into the reserve (a figure of five times the salary was proposed instead). Prior to this, in the days of Boris Fedorov, the finance department was hatching a plan to tax servicemen. A month or two earlier, the Finance Ministry, in league with the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Communications, tried to amend the list of benefits contained in the Russian Federation Law "On the status of servicemen." In other words, instead of making the benefit mechanism really effective (and at the moment it is just muddling along) the men from the ministries decided to abolish it entirely. No matter what you say, some civilian departments still suffer from an irresistible urge to "raid" the military for funds. That urge is so irresistible that you get the definite impression that the Finance Ministry's specialists are pinning all their hopes of curbing inflation on the Armed Forces alone. Clearly the minds of the financiers refuse to work in any other direction. Meanwhile the talk about the taxation of superprofits remains to this day mere talk. Of course, the functionaries have no intention of economizing at their own expense: The state apparatus is burgeoning, as the president has already said a number of times. Meanwhile, as usual, the press and television are already hinting to the slow-witted where they might find the source of all our woes: It is planned to spend ten times more on defense than on medicine and education, they say.... In journalists' commentaries virtually all the items of budget spending were slightly overshadowed by the sum of spending on defense. However, if you read the budget carefully it is not difficult to see that in comparison with 1993 it has not increased at all. But the tasks with which life is constantly confronting the Russian Army cost the Defense Ministry a pretty penny. Perhaps the subject of the debate itself -- benefits -- will become immeasurably small because there will be nothing with which to finance the Armed Forces' combat readiness. No one is disputing that costs in the Army can and must be cut. For example, they can be cut by introducing new, more efficient but less energy-intensive systems of armaments and hardware. Doubtless the scientists could make a contribution here without this having an adverse effect on the Army's combat readiness. By not stinting on the automation and computerization of the Armed Forces today we would surely achieve a substantial saving tomorrow. The investment of the necessary resources in scientific and technical research for the needs of defense would, in the very near future, undoubtedly result in the reduction of the numerical strength of the Army and positive structural changes. Paradoxical as it may seem, economizing is a costly exercise. And that is particularly true when applied to the defense of the state. For some reason it is constantly suggested that we should cut costs in the Army at the expense of the serviceman's family budget. Let us leave aside the immorality of the very approach of giving benefits with one hand, taking them away with the other. Such "reformist" methods will hardly enhance within the Army the prestige of contract relations with the state. It is a good thing, of course, that this is understood by the top officials in the government but it is strange that it is not understood by statesmen of ministerial rank. Yes, military men do not sow or reap and it is not immediately obvious where the revenue section in the defense budget actually is. Nevertheless, there is a revenue section if you recall the Russian soldiers' peacemaking missions in Tajikistan, Georgia, the North Caucasus, the Dniester region, and finally in the former Yugoslavia. Such is the reality: In our troubled world the state's ability to protect itself and its interests still counts for a lot. The Army is ensuring peace in Russia today without firing a shot or engaging in a cheap display of muscle flexing and is doing all it can to establish peace outside its borders. Surely even the most convinced pro-marketeer must recognize that stability in the country, without which the normal course of the reforms is inconceivable, has been ensured to no small extent by the very existence of combat-capable Armed Forces which enjoy prestige in the world. Admittedly one feels embarrassed about having to state such banal truths. I do not believe that the financiers were pursuing any political interests when they put their anti-army initiative to the government. But even on their own the rumors unquestionably produce a political effect. It is no coincidence that Viktor Chernomyrdin let slip a phrase about forces trying to bring the Army into conflict with the president and the government. The very fact that such proposals have appeared from the Finance Ministry is alarming. They did not succeed today but what about tomorrow? Surely people are right when they talk about the need for the adoption of a law on criminal liability for non-implementation of the articles of the defense budget and for any delays in financial operations affecting the combat readiness of the troops. The Army's life and well-being must be defined by the Law and by the Law alone, least of all by the will of individual officials even those of the very highest rank. As for the "package of military laws," I should like to hope that if ministers or parliamentarians recall them again it will only be to improve them and make them more efficient and effective and able to operate in full and without exception. In that respect there is much work to be done. At the moment, however, when the military man joins his detail, takes up combat positions, or goes on alert duty at sea he must be confident that when he returns he will not be worse off than when he started. Just as the young man contemplating the future from the threshold of military college today must know exactly how and in what form the state will evaluate his decades of impeccable service. When speaking about the situation to which the Finance Ministry has brought us today, people in the Army say: "They're just sending smoke up the chimney, they're making themselves busy by pulling apart dumplings!" There is nothing wrong with the soldiers' sense of humor; the important thing is that there should be nothing wrong with the sense of responsibility of the departmental arbiters of people's fate.
