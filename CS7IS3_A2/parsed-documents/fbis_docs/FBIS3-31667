Zlenko, on a two-day visit to Slovakia is accompanied by Minister of External Economic Relations Oleh Slyepichev, Economics Minister Roman Shpek and Health Minister Yuriy Spizhenko. Zlenko and Moravcik discussed bilateral relations, Ukraine's possible joining the Central European Initiative and ethnic minorities' issues. "We can say that we hold close or identical views on all the issues discussed," stressed Zlenko who will inaugurate the Ukrainian Embassy in Slovakia. "In creating future Europe, we have many common interests such as solution to the ethnic minorities' issues," Moravcik said. Slovakia favours resolving the minorities' issue on the basis of individual rights, while it refuses the collective rights for the minorities, including the right to self-rule, as advocated by Hungary. Zlenko said that there was no problem with Ukrainians working "illegally" in Slovakia now. He added that the situation should be settled in a legislative way in the future. There is no problem with the "autonomy for Subcarpathian Ruthenia," which is being "artificially created," Zlenko said. The expansion of the Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland) by Ukraine was not discussed, Moravcik said.
