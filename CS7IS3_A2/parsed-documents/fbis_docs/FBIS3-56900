Mamedov had been the organizer of Mikola Bahrov's presidential election campaign in the Crimea. As we have already reported, as the result of a terrorist attack -- in which still-unidentified assailants opened fire on Mamedov's house -- 11 people, including two of Mamedov's children, were wounded, two people were killed, and Mamedov was taken to the emergency room of a local hospital in extremely critical condition. Surgeons removed several bullets and grenade fragments from his body, which he had tried to use as shield to protect his children. Surgeons did everything possible, but, to our great regret, neither two operations nor modern methods of treatment could bring this kind and talented man -- the father of seven children -- back to life. Ukrainian Radio expresses its sincere sympathy to the family and friends of the deceased.
