As the most important task, the draft of the chairman's statement calls for reforming the structure of industries that can create new jobs. The United States is poised to set forth a macropolicy for creation of more jobs at the employment ministerial talks, and Japan, with a huge trade surplus, will certainly be pressed to expand its domestic demand at the talks. Japan plans to seek the understanding of other nations by presenting plans for reform of the industrial structure, but the possibility has emerged that both Japan and the United States will confront each other over the employment issue. Among the industrialized nations, with the exception of Japan, the jobless rate has increased since around 1990 and unemployment has become a social issue. The jobless rate is falling in the United States and some other industrialized nations, but four industrialized nations of the Group of Seven [G-7] industrialized nations still suffer a high, double-digit jobless rate. For this reason, the United States has proposed that the G-7 industrialized nations hold the employment ministerial talks to discuss wide-ranging ways to resolve the unemployment issue. The draft of the chairman's statement points out that it is necessary to reform the industrial structure in order to raise the flexibility of the labor market and to create new jobs. The draft of the chairman's statement notes that, to that end, promoting the wide use of new technology through the information revolution, strengthening education and training to adjust to new technology, and liberalizing trade are indispensable. Reflecting the view of the United States, which maintains the macropolicy, is a prerequisite for reforming the industrial structure. The draft of the chairman's statement explicitly indicates that reform of the industrial structure is effective only when it is supported and supplemented by the macropolicy. At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the United States expressed strong discontent with Japan, contending that Japan's policy centering on tax cuts is inadequate to stimulate the economy and cut its surplus. This is a factor responsible for the breakdown of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. At the employment summit, the United States plans to emphasize the need for the macropolicy and that the employment summit will unavoidably focus its debate on the issue of Japan's surplus. It is highly possible that other nations will ask Japan to implement the macropolicy which will expand domestic demand, claiming "Japan's surplus is depriving other nations of employment opportunities." Japan plans to avoid being criticized over the macropolicy by stressing its posture to work on reform of the industrial structure. Japan intends to explain to other nations the contents of plans to reform the industrial structure which have been compiled by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and to urge other nations to work on reform of their respective industrial structures. The plans cite such industries as housing, information, communications, environment related, medical, welfare, and other domestic-demand-oriented industries that are expected to grow in the future, and stresses the need to upgrade the existing infrastructure, to promote deregulation, and to raise funds smoothly to develop those industries.
