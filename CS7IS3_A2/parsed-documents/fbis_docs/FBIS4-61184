The statement was made in a Monday interview with local radio by the Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze. He said that the appointment of Lieutenant-General Vardiko Nadibaidze to the post of Defence Minister last week began a new stage in the life of the army. Nadibaidze used to be deputy commander of the Russian army group in Transcaucasia. In the interview the Georgian leader said new professional approaches are necessary and that was the reason for proposing Nadibaidze to the post of minister. According to Shevardnadze, the general is an experienced specialist and good organizer who is perfectly familiar with the principles of forming an army as well as with weaponry. Independent experts in Tbilisi see a link between Shevardnadze's statements about the need to build an efficient army and his recent declarations that though giving preference to peaceful political methods of settling the Abkhazian problem the leadership of the country does not rule out a military solution. During his recent visit to west Georgia Shevardnadze expressed hope that the painful problem would be settled finally within two or three months. He accounted the possibility to the improvement of relations with Russia and to help from the international community. IF Note: Meanwhile, a personal envoy of the Georgian head of state Aleksandr Kavsadze has categorically denied the charges of the Abkhazian authorities that the Georgian government connives with provocative actions of Georgian saboteurs in Gali region. He declared that Georgia remains a supporter of a peaceful and honorable settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia.
