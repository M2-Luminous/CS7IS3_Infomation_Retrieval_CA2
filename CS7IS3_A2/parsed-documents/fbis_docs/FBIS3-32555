Two issues focused their discussions: the country's fiscal situation and the review of the 1994 national budget. Following this meeting of nearly the entire cabinet, its members held their first formal news conference, which was coordinated by Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, minister of the Central Information Office. The finance minister said that the 1994 expenditures budget of 1.43 trillion [currency not specified] was estimated in April 1993 and was based on petroleum revenues of $15 per barrel. The price of the crude is currently $12.5 per barrel. As a result, they were forced to reestimate revenues. Thus, this Council of Ministers approved a 10-percent reduction in spending as part of a tax reform program that will soon be presented to the Congress. This should reduce the budget deficit by 2 percent of GNP and should reduce inflation. [Finance Minister Julio Sosa] "We tried to study a reduction in the operating costs of autonomous services, of funds for personnel under contracts, and of planned allotments for, among other things, the purchase of vehicles, although this might seem unimportant. These things seem unimportant, but they add up to rather large amounts. This is obviously part of the fiscal austerity program announced by the president of the Republic. We also considered -- and this was amply discussed -- the need to carry out infrastructure projects included in the current budget but that must be reduced through a regime of concessions." Meanwhile, and also on economic issues, the development minister announced an upcoming meeting to which all sectors involved were invited to reach a voluntary agreement to stabilize prices and prevent an escalation in the cost of living. [Development Minister Luis Palacios] "The idea is to urge all economic sectors to try to reach a voluntary agreement to lower inflation." Another issue that focused the attention of journalists was internal security. In this regard, the interior minister reaffirmed that the government will guarantee full respect for human rights and peaceful protests. He clarified, however, that it cannot continue to allow masked men to lead them. To put an end to this, he will meet with student leaders. The minister added that public order requires a firm, vigorous, and sustained attitude, not just repression. The justice minister commented on the overlapping duties of the police. He announced a redefinition of the duties of these groups to maximize their efficiency. [Justice Minister Ruben Creixems] "Venezuela is a democratic country. It has a system that aspires to life in a legal state. The country's Constitution and its laws define public order and enshrine principles of personal safety. Thus, police authorities must be subject to the Constitution and the law. We must eliminate once and for all in Venezuela that inadmissible principle that one must shoot first and investigate later. "I think that the interior minister, the defense minister, the governor of Caracas, and I will hold interesting meetings to somewhat define the scope of various police forces' duties, because at times it appears that all are in charge of everything. And when all are in charge of everything, they might think that somebody else is handling a particular issue. To the extent that jurisdictions and duties are specifically defined and to the extent that the issues of organization and security pertaining to the police corps are settled, one will then be able to assign specific responsibilities in cases of violations or able to reward those corps that have performed in an outstanding manner." In the opinion of the education minister, the problem is not the disturbances that the students could stage but the poor quality of the education they receive. Thus his goal is to improve quality: [Education Minister Antonio Cardenas] "I am very worried that our children and teenagers are spending nine years in basic education and are leaving without mastering their mother tongue, without knowing how to read and write correctly, and without being able to express their ideas correctly. I am even more worried that some of them -- unfortunately not a majority -- go through secondary, diversified, and professional education; reach the university and graduate; and leave the university still with serious deficiences in the use of their mother tongue." The journalists also asked questions about the orientation of our foreign policy. The foreign affairs minister said there are three key issues: maintaining the excellent level of our relations with neighboring countries and with the United States, fully articulating integration processes, and improving Venezuela's image: [Foreign Affairs Minister Miguel Burelli] "It is possible that now that the crisis is being resolved it will be recognized that Venezuelan institutions were so good that they endured the commotion created by those military coups and the trial of the president of the Republic. No country on the American continent has been able to resist this kind of thing. Thus, instead of having that bad image, we should have been recognized as a country with formidable political institutions." This cabinet meeting also approved the reorganization of the Ministry of the Secretariat. A commission headed by the incumbent minister was established for this purpose. It must present a report within 15 days. The media was also told that henceforth the Council of Ministers will meet on Wednesdays at 1030. The journalists were advised about changes in the news reporting procedures and were urged to cooperate as much as possible to ensure the best coverage of all Palace events.
