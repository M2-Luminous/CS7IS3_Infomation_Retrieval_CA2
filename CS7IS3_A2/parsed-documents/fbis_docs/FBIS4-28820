They said the new system is to apply on an experimental basis to ministry-controlled public works projects, beginning fiscal 1994, which started April 1. The present system, which awards a public works contract to the lowest bidder, contributes to bid rigging and unfair price competition, critics say. The new system gives overall numerical ratings to bidders, including noise and vibration control measures and designing, in addition to the bidding price, the officials said. The government had earlier used a bid evaluation system based on technical standards and cost in choosing successful bidders for supercomputer supply contracts.
