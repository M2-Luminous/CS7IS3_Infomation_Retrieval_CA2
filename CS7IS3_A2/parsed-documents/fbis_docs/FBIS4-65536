Even these figures could be overly optimistic, however. While the DIMARSO DE MORGEN poll, published a few days ago, still gave the French-speaking Socialist Party (PS) 31.2 percent (with 19.3 percent for the Social Christian Party (PSC), this could not have taken into account the effect of the recent Hainault scandals, which were all the more traumatic since they hit the federation assumed to be the most solid and disciplined in the party. In the north, the previously dominant Flemish Christian People's Party (CVP) was still on around 21.9 percent while the Flemish Socialist Party (SP) stood at 15.2 percent. Another global survey on Belgium by THE EUROPEAN gave the PS 24 percent and the PSC 23 percent. This would give the coalition 47 percent, and therefore less than the critical threshold. Of course, in principle these elections are about renewing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, and are not a pronouncement on the national level. However, the political leaderships are under no illusions: The effect of a debacle would be considerable. How could the government "hold on" for almost a year and a half, to the end of this legislature, knowing that the coalition could not be reestablished? How could the coalition parties resist, during this long period at the end of their reign, the temptation to lay the ground for the future with a top secret wooing of blues or greens? Just as revealing of the underlying fragility is the extent of the speculation surrounding the chances of [Prime Minister] Dehaene's team surviving if its great helmsman were to succeed [European Commission President] Delors.
