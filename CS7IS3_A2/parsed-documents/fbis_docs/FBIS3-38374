A section of the party wants to remain with the Democratic Alliance [AD] and is criticizing the decision of [Giorgio] La Malfa to take the party toward the position of [Mino] Martinazzoli [Italian Popular Party secretary] and [Mario] Segni [Pact for Italy leader]. Guido Dell'Acquila reports: [Dell'Acquila] The four-leaf clover of the AD and the ivy leaf of La Malfa do not thrive in the same kind of soil. La Malfa's decision yesterday to join Segni and Martinazzoli split the party in two and was also greeted negatively by the AD--the organization to which some notable Republicans continue to belong. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Do you consider anyone who joins the left-wing slate to be outside the Republican Party? [La Malfa] Of course, if the Republicans join a certain slate, then whoever joins another slate, or campaigns for another slate, is obviously travelling down a different road. [end recording] [Dell'Acquila] Even if Bruno Visentini is keeping quiet for the time being, Giorgio Bogi is not. He is part of the AD, and he wants to remain there. [Begin Bogi recording] I understand perfectly well that standing on the same slate as opponents is not a reconcilable antagonism. However, in this particular case, we will continue to be part of the AD as Republicans. [end recording] [Dell'Acquila] Giuseppe Ayala, the notable independent deputy, is also abandoning La Malfa. [Begin Ayala recording] I am one of the founders of AD. I have always believed in the organization, I continue to believe in the organization and I will always believe in the organization. I am sorry that the Republican Party is no longer involved, or at least not all of the party. Let us see how many republicans remain, in my opinion there will be many. [end recording]
