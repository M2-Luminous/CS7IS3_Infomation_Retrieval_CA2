Today, we interview Zoltan Kiraly, head of the list of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party [MSZDP]. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Perhaps one of the clearest characteristics of the MSZDP program is the extending of the government's role and responsibility to welfare areas. With the approach of the elections, many big parties are also trying to obtain votes by promising more social care. [Kiraly] Indeed, social democratic values are also present in the programs of almost every political party. Even the major political forces in Hungary cannot avoid speaking against poverty, the steady deterioration of the real value of pensions, and unemployment. However, I do not see anything bad in this. I think that the more people speak of social democratic values, equal chances and justice, the more can be implemented. However, all these values appear in the MSZDP program much more markedly. In the struggle against unemployment, we would like to implement a policy of state investment protection that does not only rely on the development of market requirements and the good intentions of the entrepreneurs in creating new jobs. This policy also tries to create jobs by means of large-scale state investment. Our program speaks more markedly than any other about government responsibility to maintain the real value of basic pensions by adjusting them to inflation and providing state guarantees. We believe that education should be free of charge, from elementary school to college and university education. It is the obligation of the state to provide the fullest possible equality of chances in this area. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] How would the MSZDP find funds for all this? [Kiraly] The spreading of the welfare network requires much greater efforts and financial resources than many people thought. It has become clear now that the present government policy can no longer continue, namely increasing value added tax, income tax, and social security payments. We firmly claim, and we are not alone in this, that a review of Hungary's debt repayment has become inevitable. Negotiations must be initiated with the World Bank, the IMF, and representatives of governments affected by our debts. We succeeded in getting some kind of a debt repayment delay at the end of the 1980's. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] You repeatedly criticized this government's privatization efforts. Actually, do you have reservations about the allegedly mistaken privatization process, or is the privatization itself unacceptable for the Social Democrats? [Kiraly] There are considerable differences between our program and those of other parties regarding the change of property. We are interested in a broad change of property. In our view, this process has a moral part and also one that points to the future, one that provides the foundations of a bourgeois society. Privatization cannot be limited to even 1 million citizens. Privatization should affect broader social strata. Millions of employees and pensioners would like to get to at least 60 percent of the state property in one way or another, and the remaining 40 percent could go to local government bodies, universities, and colleges. It is possible to find a way to assert the principles of fairness and justice. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The coming elections will have a major effect on the future of social democracy in Hungary. [Kiraly] If we can make it into Parliament in any form, we are already on the first step on the road leading there. I am convinced that our presence in Parliament will provide a stable point for the MSZDP in the political arena on which the party can rely. In the four years ahead of us, it is possible to lay the foundations for this party to have a chance of governing since the 1988 elections.
