The Arab and Islamic nation is celebrating two happy occasions: The blessed 'Id al-Adha and the return of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian authority to their land. Your Excellency President 'Arafat: Congratulations to the Palestinian people on these two occasions. Perhaps we should start with a word to the struggling Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic nation. ['Arafat] First, I thank you very much for giving me this good chance to speak through the Voice of the Arabs, the voice of the Arab nation, in these blessed and holy days. Within hours, God willing, Muslims will pray on 'Arafat Mount [in Mecca] and we hope that prayers will soon be held, God willing, in holy Jerusalem, the first of the two qiblahs [direction in which Muslims turn to pray] and the third of the holy shrines, the city to which Prophet Muhammad, may God's peace and prayers be upon him, journeyed, and the cradle of Jesus, peace be upon him. As we mark this occasion, the Palestinian police force has entered Jericho and Gaza, from which the Israelis fully withdrew hours ago. Gaza and Jericho became the first liberated Palestinian territory over which the Palestinian flag was raised. And it is the first over which Palestinian authority is being exercised since the beginning of this century. This signifies much and indicates many things, not only on the political, national, and pan-Arab levels, but on the level of history and the region as a whole. I must note the good efforts of my brother President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, who, using everything in his power, helped us to advance this process. The blessed efforts of President Mubarak and my other brothers in Egypt were crowned by the agreement we signed in Cairo under his patronage and supervision. [Abu-al-Majd] The main question now is: When can the Voice of the Arabs speak with Your Excellency in Jericho, the land of Palestinian authority now, so that we can all rejoice in your return and you can assume your duties among your kin and in your homeland? ['Arafat] Soon, God willing. We hope that in June we will contact you either from Gaza or from Jericho and I will speak through the Voice of the Arabs, which is dear to me and to all your mujahid Palestinian brothers. [Abu-al-Majd] Many tasks await you. You must have prepared plans and programs to carry out these tasks in Gaza and Jericho first. Can we hear of these tasks and plans, which are designed for the wellbeing of the Palestinian people? ['Arafat] We have received 38 tasks, that is, the responsibilities in Gaza and Jericho. Now we are assuming between five and seven other responsibilities in the West Bank and, God willing, we will begin talks immediately after 'Id al-Adha on all the arrangements concerning the West Bank. We hope the talks will be held in Cairo. You must be patient with us. I am sure my brothers in Egypt tolerate us. But, after all, this is what you expect from brothers. [Abu-al-Majd] Naturally we were pleased to see the Palestinian people retrieve their rights in Cairo, Egypt, a country that loves Arabism and the struggle for its nation and bears the burden of its causes. You met Israeli Foreign Minsiter Shim'on Peres in Oslo recently and reports indicate that you agreed to pursue negotiations on implementing Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip, the Jericho area, and later in the West Bank. What are the most important tasks that you are expected to assume in the West Bank and when will the... ['Arafat, interrupting] There are at least five to seven tasks concerning basic fields, such as education, health, tourism, social affairs, work, culture, taxes, and possibly some security issues. Then we must agree with them on redeploying their forces outside cities and populous areas on sites to be agreed upon on 15 July. This is a very important point. [Abu-al-Majd] When will the Palestinian elections take place within the framework of the National Authority? ['Arafat] Following the Israeli forces' redeployment and withdrawal from residential areas in the West Bank after their complete withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, we are supposed to initiate measures for elections on our Palestinian land, God willing. [Abu-al-Majd] What are the features and dimensions of the future Egyptian-Palestinian political and economic cooperation from the security, national, and pan-Arab points of view? ['Arafat] Let me tell you something. This Palestinian body cannot but be connected with its Arab nation, especially the loving brothers in Egypt and Jordan, its two close neighbors. We are linked with the Arab nation. Our true supporter is the Arab nation. It was no coincidence that the political negotiations were held there and the handover of authority and the entry of forces into our liberated land began from these places. It is no coincidence that the Egyptian experts provided us with great help in the economic talks, because we needed this Egyptian expertise as well as the expertise of our Jordanian brothers, who supported and extended help to us through their experts. Nothing can happen except through our agreement and reliance on this warm Arab lap on every level. [Abu-al-Majd] The international community has promised to give you 2 billion [currency not specified] over five years after the launch of Palestinian self-rule. And we know that the Gaza Strip and Jericho are suffering a severe lack of economic potential, especially when it comes to the infrastructure. Have any of these promises been made good or is there at least a contingency plan to begin ... ['Arafat, interrupting] We have submitted a snap contingency plan worth $590 million to the World Bank. The donor parties are scheduled to meet on 1 June to look into this plan, which was agreed upon in principle in the previous Paris meeting. We need a concerted effort, not only with the World Bank and donors, but with all our friends and brothers, because what we need is great, very great. Don't forget that all our infrastructure has been destroyed by the Israeli occupation and we must start from scratch in every area. This is a great effort and it requires huge resources but we are confident that our Arab nation and friends throughout the world together with the Palestinian people's resources can prove themselves and confront all these important responsibilities that we shoulder. "And we wished to be gracious to those who were being depressed in the land, to make them leaders (in faith) and make them heirs, to establish a firm place for them in the land" [Koranic verses]. [Abu-al-Majd] When will the names of the Palestinian Authority members be announced? ['Arafat] We have announced 17 names. God willing, we will announce most of the remaining names within a week at most. This is because we will leave some names unannounced until the picture becomes complete. We might announce another three or four names. God willing, the first meeting of the National Authority, that is, the first Palestinian ministerial meeting, will be held next week. Portfolios and responsibilities will be distributed during this meeting. [Abu-al-Majd] Will the meeting be held in Jericho or Tunis? ['Arafat] It could be held in Jericho or elsewhere. [Abu-al-Majd] But will all the PLO institutions move with you to Jericho or will some remain in Tunis? ['Arafat] Only the political department will remain abroad. The remaining institutions will gradually move inside. [Abu-al-Majd] Why the political department? ['Arafat] Because the Palestinian National Authority is represented in foreign relations by the PLO. It cannot establish diplomatic representation except through the PLO. [Abu-al-Majd] Discussing the Arab situation, we do not forget the regrettable events in Yemen. These events naturally affect us all. What is your view of the situation in Yemen and will you undertake an initiative to solve this crisis? ['Arafat] I have been in constant touch with my brothers the Yemeni leaders in the past 48 hours. I have left my telephone number with my brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih so that he will contact me as soon as possible. We will do our best to stop the bloodbath in Arab Yemen. [Abu-al-Majd] While we are on the phone between Cairo and Tunis, we ask Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to address the Arab and Islamic nations. ['Arafat] I want to remind my brothers of something. Once, a Soviet leader asked me: After you leave Beirut, where will you go? I told him: To Palestine. God willing, my brothers and I will go to Palestine. "On that day the believers shall rejoice. With the help of God, he helps whom he will. And he is exalted in might, most merciful." [Koranic verse] Verily, God told the truth. [Abu-al-Majd] At the end of this interesting dialogue with Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine, we say: Thank you very much. Thank you. ['Arafat] My good wishes, thanks, and congratulations to my brother struggling President Husni Mubarak and to the Egyptian people and to my brothers in the whole Arab nation.
