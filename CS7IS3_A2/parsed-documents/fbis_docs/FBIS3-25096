There has been no progress at the negotiations this afternoon. The mediators and observers met with Jorge Valentim, but it produced nothing. It has been reported that, so far, UNITA has not reacted to the document issued by the mediators and observers entitled General Principles on National Reconciliation. Most of UNITA's negotiating team is still in Cote d'Ivoire. Only Jorge Valentim is in Lusaka. UN Special Representative Blondin Beye is also in Cote d'Ivoire and might return on 9 February. This morning the government team met with the mediators and observers. According to a source, the meeting reviewed the document issued by the mediators and observers in what could be described as the government's first reaction. The source says that, in general, the government agrees with the views of the mediators and observers and has not proposed major changes to the document. A number of questions still need to be addressed -- namely, when will the UNITA negotiating team return and what will the working agenda in Lusaka be tomorrow? Analysts say it is unlikely that the talks will be productive while Beye and UNITA's negotiating team are absent.
