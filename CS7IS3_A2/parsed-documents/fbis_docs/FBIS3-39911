The PvdA [Labor Party] minister says that the compartments between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Development Cooperation and Defense should be removed, because the world is a global village crying out for an integral approach. If Pronk is looking for an illustration to prove he is in the right, then he has to look no further than Netherlands policies on the crisis in Bosnia. While the "Sarajevo formula" has gained an almost magical ring to it at the Foreign Ministry, thanks to the success of the NATO and UN ultimatum, it is in fact reticence which is steadily gaining the upper hand at the Defense Ministry under the influence of the deployment of the reinforced airborne battalion in turbulent eastern Bosnia. It is very understandable that Foreign Minister Kooijmans wants to use the momentum from Sarajevo to progressively set ultimatums in other parts of Bosnia which cannot easily escape the stranglehold of the civil war. It is less understandable that he should choose the town of Mostar as the next test case for the determination of the international community. Unless the aim is to keep up the pretense of impartiality and balance, because Muslims and Croats are fighting in this town. The understanding for Kooijmans' crusade in political circles in The Hague ends there. Mostar is not among the six areas which were designated as safe havens for Muslims by the United Nations last year. Therefore a new resolution would be necessary to set a military ultimatum, which would virtually certainly run up against a veto from Moscow. After the Russian diplomatic success of last weekend, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev has warned that Moscow has little enthusiasm for a repeat of the Sarajevo formula. It is a cast-iron law in international diplomacy that the countries which shout the loudest must be prepared to put words into deeds. In the case of Bosnia the Netherlands has nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, in relative terms it makes the biggest contribution to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. But Defense Minister Ter Beek repeatedly emphasizes that The Hague, with its promises to the United Nations of some 3,000 troops, has reached its ceiling. As far as he is concerned there can be no possibility of sending more Netherlanders to Mostar. Moreover Sarajevo has revealed the limited possibilities of UNPROFOR. Even the "soft" UN option of 7,600 UN troops for the six safe areas to be protected is a long way from having been reached. For this reason, the commander of UN troops in Bosnia, General Rose, was forced last week to call in reinforcements from other parts of the former Yugoslavia to monitor the withdrawal or disabling of Serbian tanks, artillery, mortars, antiaircraft artillery, and multiple rocket launchers. Because several hundred Russians were not able to carry out this task alone, Jordanians came from Croatia and Malaysians from Bihac. Dozens of observers were even used. But two British companies from Vitez were also brought in. They were exactly half the battalion of British infantrymen who are supposed to offer protection to the humanitarian aid convoys of the Belgian/Netherlands transport battalion in central Bosnia. This is an area where there is strong fighting and the area where some 440 lightly armed Netherlanders are operating. Last but not least, another reason why the Defense Ministry and Parliament have reacted sceptically to relief of the Herzegovina capital is the position of the Croats. Countermeasures from Zagreb are definitely not to be ruled out if the international community were to turn against the Croatian troops who are determined to make Mostar the capital of Bosnian Croatia. The hundreds of thousands of refugees are not the only Croat "trump card." From the harbor of Split, they manage what could be called the lifeline of the Netherlanders who are to be stationed in central Bosnia (Lukavac) and eastern Bosnia (Srebenica and Zepa) during March. The closure of the Dalmatian coast would have disastrous consequences for the successful running of the entire UNPROFOR operation in Bosnia. Last March the United States decided to drop food over eastern Bosnia using Hercules transport planes. The Foreign Ministry felt the Netherlands really ought to participate as well and that the Defense Ministry would just have to use F-27s and Orions. From the humanitarian point of view everything favored this; the only problem is that every royal airforce Fokker or Orion crashes every time a door is opened when it is airborne. A year later the lack of coordination between The Hague's foreign and security policies is again taking its revenge.
