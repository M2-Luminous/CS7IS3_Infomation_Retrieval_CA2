(2) Tell the requester that we must give the submitter of the data the opportunity to comment before the Air Force decides whether to release the information. (3) Give the submitter a reasonable period of time (no more than 30 calendar days) to object to release and provide justification. (4) If the submitter does not respond, write that you have not received a reply, tell the submitter of the decision to release with the reason and give the expected release date (at least 2 weeks from the date of your letter). (5) If the submitter objects, but the Air Force disclosure authority considers the records releasable, tell the submitter before releasing the data. Include in the letter a brief explanation and a release date at least 2 weeks from the date of the letter. (f) Exemption 5_Inter- or Intra-Agency Records. Intra-agency or inter-agency memoranda or letters that, according to recognized legal privileges are not routinely released to a party in litigation with the Air Force or DoD. If such a record or part of such a record would be made available routinely through the discovery process in the course of litigation with the agency, release it. In the discovery process, litigants get from each other information relevant to issues in a trial or hearing. if the information is only made available through the discovery process by special court order, then it is exempt. Release factual records or parts unless the information is privileged or otherwise exempt. Generally, release a direction or order from a superior to a subordinate, though contained in an internal communication, if it forms policy guidance or a decision, but is not a discussion of preliminary or other matters that would compromise decision making. Consult your SJA about whether Exemption 5 material would be routinely available through the discovery process. Here are examples of exempt information. (1) The deliberative process privilege_those parts of records with internal advice, opinions, evaluations, or recommendations that reveal Air Force or DoD deliberations. (2) Those nonfactual parts of Air Force personnel evaluations of contractors and their products. (3) Advance information of a speculative, tentative, or evaluative nature on such matters as proposals to buy, lease, or otherwise acquire and dispose of materials, real estate, facilities, or functions, if such information gives private personal interests an unfair competitive advantage or impedes legitimate governmental functions. Generally, you cannot use this privilege to withhold factual information. However, you may withhold facts when they are so interconnected with deliberative information that disclosing facts necessarily discloses the Air Force's deliberative process or when facts and deliberative information are so interconnected that separating them would be uninformative or redundant. (4) Official reports of inspection, audits, investigations, or surveys on safety, security, or internal management, administration, or operation of the Air Force. (5) The attorney work product privilege_records an attorney prepares, or supervises the preparation of, in contemplating or preparing for administrative proceedings or litigation. (6) The attorney-client privilege_confidential communication between an attorney and client. For example, a commander expresses concerns in confidence to his or her judge advocate and asks for a legal opinion. The legal opinion and everything the commander tells the judge advocate in confidence qualify. (7) Unlike deliberative process privilege, you may withhold both facts and opinions in attorney work product or privileged communications.
