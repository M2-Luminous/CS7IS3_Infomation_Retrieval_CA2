The responsibility of the artist is to remake the soul of a nation. Otherwise all that blood would have flowed in vain, all that suffering would have been borne in vain. Dear Jin Zhong [6855 6988], How are you? Cai Yongmei [5591 0737 2734] called me a couple of days ago to ask whether or not I could write a piece to mark Mao Zedong's 100th birthday. I agreed right away and thanked her for going out of the way to invite me to write an article. After two days, however, I realized I had trouble coming up with something; I had nothing new to say. Besides, I am dying to get started on my long novel. I am too dumb to do more than one thing at a time. Fiction-writing is my specialty. Moreover, a couple of ideas crossed my mind lately, which is all the more reason why I should concentrate. Only Art Distilled From Suffering Is Valuable When it comes to suffering, China bears a close resemblance to Russia. Both peoples have been plagued by disaster. The only difference is that a host of artists have chronicled their misfortunes, thus transforming them into the treasure of the nation, even of all mankind. Tolstoy's War and Peace and Anna Karenina, Sholokhov's And Quiet Flows the Don, Pasternak's Dr. Zhivago, Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture," Liabin's The Boat Tracker on the Volga, Gogol's Dead Souls... (the list goes on and on) all strike a responsive chord in our hearts. Why? Because it is the suffering of a nation, the spirit of a nation. Suffering is more than just suffering. Once transformed into art, it takes on a spiritual value, ultimately distilled into the indomitable soul of a nation and capable of moving and inspiring future generations. We have probably suffered more than the Russians. But our suffering has not been written about. No truly great work (whether literary, artistic, musical, or dramatic) exists to chronicle the Taiping Rebellion, the 1911 Revolution, the civil war, the war of resistance against Japan, the Great Leap Forward, or the Cultural Revolution. The only thing we have to show for our 8-year war of resistance against aggression, for instance, is the "Yellow River Cantata," mediocre in quality and communist in flavor to boot. For us Chinese, therefore, suffering means simply suffering. If our suffering is not remade through art, if the soul of the nation is not recast through art, then the blood would have flowed in vain and suffering borne in vain. Why? That would be for literary historians to figure out. Contemporary artists like us must start with ourselves. Myself and perhaps 99 percent of modern Chinese writers may not necessarily come up with anything remarkable. But if we all work hard, we are bound to produce something great. Nationalism: The CPC's Lone Card In this sense, modern history is over as far as artists are concerned, not chronologically but figuratively. The final collapse of the communist system and the ultimate demise of one-party autocracy are no longer in doubt. No matter what the CPC leaders do, history has turned a new page. What remains to be figured out is how to rebuild life faced with the painful legacy of totalitarianism. In the case of intellectuals and artists, the task is to remake the soul of the nation. Truly my heart does not seem to belong in real-world politics any longer, but is centered on the future. I keep thinking: What should we do with the vast spiritual wasteland? It seems that without the effort of several generations, it would be extremely hard to heal the spiritual and moral scars left behind by Mao Zedong's autocratic system. What can I do in the great undertaking of national reconstruction? I want to write, I want to do justice in words to the suffering, to the glory of human nature that shone forth amid the suffering, to the land. To be able to do that is the vocation and rare privilege of a writer. The centenary of Mao Zedong's birth should be commemorated. The reason is that although he has died, he continues to hurt the people of this world. While still alive, many a time did Mao Zedong, self-consciously and with a deliberate air of casualness, talk about being denounced posthumously. Had he examined his conscience, in fact, he would have realized he was bequeathing to us a backward, impoverished and autocratic China, conditions that would not cease to exist upon his death. Take the recent campaign for the right to host the Olympic Games, for instance. In the glistening tears of the Chinese people, I shuddered to rediscover the defunct spirit of the era when we practiced self-imposed isolation, when we "relied on our own effort and worked hard for the prosperity of the country." I could still recall the wave of nationalist fervor whipped up in our hearts by the artificially manufactured enemies of "imperialism, revisionism, and counter-revolutionaries," by the false idea that somebody was hell bent on subjugating China, and by the notion that we must be "ready to fight at all times." When they successfully exploded an atomic bomb or carried out a satellite experiment, we celebrated wildly through the night. Only years later did we realize that the kind of nationalism fired up by Mao Zedong was bogus; what was real was his ambition to be a world leader. Today, the ideology of communism has collapsed. Just about the only card that Deng Xiaoping has left to play to incite the masses is nationalism. Things have gotten this bad. Still Mao Zedong continues to live and one can hold on a little longer by copying his tricks. Passing of Mao Zedong's Era Irreversible In another sense, Mao Zedong, having passed into history, is gone beyond the point of recall. It is in this sense that Mao Zedong and his era are being mocked. When overseas exiles get together, they often burst into song, saying tunes of the Mao Zedong era because they have no other songs to sing, given the all-embracing monopoly of communist culture. Some songs remind us of our youth, wild and full of suffering. In fact, in the case of some songs, just singing them is an act of mockery; we inject a vaccine into a human body only after it has ceased to be toxic. Only after the myth has been exploded can songs like "A Golden Sun over Beijing" and "Nannei Wan" become mockery. Now that his halo has faded, God died. We should add this point when we discuss "Mao fever." This is true of so many things. Look at a thing from another angle and it means something yet more profound. Take, for instance, the fact that everybody on the mainland today is going into business and shunning politics. You can interpret this phenomenon in any one of a number of ways, all of them plausible. But may we not also call this the broken heart which has lost the courage to live? Long have the people become disillusioned with tinkering with the political system within the framework of one-party dictatorship. Complaints being heard everywhere, popular feelings running high... those are the signs that there is still hope. When you hear silence all round, the dynasty has truly run out of luck. I have not written anything for KAIFANG for a long while. This time I promised to do so only to go back on my word subsequently. I could only write and apologize in the hope that Jin Zhong and the other friends would forgive me. The curtain has gone up on the battle by the Hong Kong people to defend press freedom. The best is yet to come. The exiles in Princeton and myself deeply admire the editors and reporters who fight for freedom once press freedom is finished, so is everything else. Fortunately Mao Zedong has become part of history; the current trend cannot be resisted. At worst this will be nothing more than a brief and farcical setback in modern Hong Kong history. A few days ago Situ Hua [0674 1778 5478], Liu Huiqing [0491 1979 0615], and others were in Princeton to attend an international conference on Hong Kong. Before they departed for home, we all got together at Liu Binyan's [0491 6333 7159] house and had a good time, talking about Hong Kong, its people, its future. The friend who gave them a ride to the airport was not familiar with the way to the freeway, so I led the way. When the freeway came into view and it was time to part company, we could not stop to bid farewell because the flow of traffic was so heavy. So I blew my horn to salute them and as a way of saying goodbye. To my surprise I beeped my horn four times, a faux pas in a country where people drive in silence. The reason is quite simple. I have deep feelings about Hong Kong and its people. Best wishes, Zheng Yi, Princeton, 31 October.
