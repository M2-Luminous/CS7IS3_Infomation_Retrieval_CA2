But Karsten Klepsvik, Oslo's representative to the International Whaling Commission, said he did not believe that the issue by itself would sink Norway's application to join the Community. The whaling issue, along with Norway's efforts to protect its fishing waters and high agricultural subsidies, has emerged as a leading obstacle in efforts to finalise the EC membership negotiations by March 1. "I do not believe (whaling) will be the only outstanding issue which will decide if we enter the EC or not," Klepsvik told journalists, adding that the issue would not be resolved quickly. EC officials say the negotiations with Norway are harder than with Sweden, Austria and Finland, which have also applied to join the EC by January 1, 1995. But the 12 EC countries have not yet agreed on whether to insist that Norway honour a Community ban on all whaling, in accordance with an International Whaling Commission (IWC) embargo in 1985, as a condition for EC membership. Diplomats said France, Spain, Britain and the Netherlands were particularly militant in enforcing the IWC whaling ban, and that EC public opinion was strongly against whaling. Klepsvik warned that it would be difficult to persuade Norwegian voters to accept EC membership if this meant an end to whaling. Whale meat is considered a healthy delicacy in Norway, where about 300 tonnes is eaten each year. According to the latest public opinion survey, 53 percent of Norwegians are against membership of the EC and only 33 percent in favour. Norway resumed commercial hunting of the minke whale, a mid-sized baleen whale weighing up to 9,000 kilograms (about 20,000 pounds), last year after a suspension of nearly six years. The officials said Norway restricted the number of whales caught last year to 296, and was likely to impose a similar quota this year. "There will be no over-exploitation," Norwegian whaling academic Lars Walloe said. The officials said just 33 vessels were authorised to hunt the minke whale, and that large-scale factory ships and the hunting of all other types of whales had been banned in accordance with the IWC embargo. The Norwegian officials said that minke whales in the northeastern Atlantic numbered around 87,000, that their population was recovering from a 1950's dip, and that they did not face the same extinction threat as other whales. But the ecological organisation Greenpeace said these figures were unreliable, particularly since they had been based on sightings by Norwegian whalers. "It's a bit like asking the wolf to fence off the flock," Greenpeace official Andy Ottaway said. Walloe said whales were no more intelligent than other large mammals such as elk or reindeer, and no more deserving of protection on moral grounds. He added that the minke whales were killed as humanely as possible. Government inspectors are present on all Norwegian whaling boats. Walloe said the minke whales were hit by grenade harpoons, which killed 50 percent of their victims instantaneously and 90 percent of them within 10 minutes. The Norwegian habit of clubbing baby seals also runs counter to EC sentiment. The Community has a ban on all seal imports.
