FBIS4-47695 "drafr084_cs94018" FBIS-AFR-94-084-S Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Tampering Suspected in Eastern Cape Township Tampering Suspected in Eastern Cape Township MB3004181094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1729 GMT 30 Apr 94 MB3004181094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Port Elizabeth April 30 SAPA -- Thirty-one ballot boxes from KwaZakhele township in Port Elizabeth were isolated pending further examination by police on Saturday [30 April] on suspicion of electoral fraud. No finality on the charge of tampering has materialised. Both the police and the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] have urgently requested the attorney-general [AG] to travel from the judicial capital of Grahamstown to Port Elizabeth to make a ruling. The ballots from these boxes will not be counted until the attorney-general reaches a decision, even though provisions for counting are contained in the Electoral Act. Police liaison officer Col Chris Maritz claimed this week IEC officials had broken the seals off "several" ballot boxes and were scrutinising the ballots. The IEC has repeatedly denied the allegation, though its officials have remained reluctant to comment until their own investigations were complete. A statement on the progress of the inquiry is expected to be released within the hour. The National Party's [NP] premier candidate in the Eastern Cape, Dr Tertius Delport, formally requested the IEC on Saturday night to declare the ballots contained in the 31 boxes null and void. Dr Delport said the NP regarded the KwaZakhele votes as invalid. African Christian Democratic Party regional elections head Ross Bradder said his party would abide by the AG's decision. A declaration of the votes as null as void would not necessarily be in the interests of a free or fair election, however. "For the people who voted in good faith, their voice to the nation is being ignored in that case. "It is unfortunate that this has occurred because we believe the election in the Eastern Cape has generally been run in a peaceful and correct way." Ballots from a second Port Elizabeth suburb may be suspect, Mr Bradder announced later. One ballot box from the Bethelsdorp area was separated from counting on saturday when officials at the central counting station noted it might have been resealed. A discrepancy in serial numbers was spotted, said Mr Bradder. IEC comment was not immediately available.
