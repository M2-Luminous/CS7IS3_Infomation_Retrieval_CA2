The spokesman described the contention as baseless and fabricated. In a report released by the special representative of the human rights commission at the UN last Friday, the Islamic Republic of Iran was again declared as the violater of human rights due to such cases as execution and crushing of drug smugglers and launching a drive against social evils. It is also been claimed in the report that there exists a large number of political prisoners in Iran and religious minorities are harassed. Since 1948 when the principles on observance of human right were formulated at the UN there has now elapsed nearly half a century. During these years fervent efforts have been made so that the world nations may have access to some broad based principles devoid of political discrimination and observations. This was aimed at making them check any infringement of their rights. Hence today nearly all the world states duly accept the principles in observing the human rights and also respect them. This acceptance is also for the reason that the UN as the greatest world body is recognized as the only forum, which basically should be the body for considering world issues specially for defending the rights of human beings at global level. But in reality such attention to human rights has so far been payed in a different manner. It is now for many years that western states and governments which have risen to covertly or overtly confront the Islamic revolution in Iran over the past fifteen years, have been using human rights as a weapon against Islamic Iran. At the onset of the Islamic revolution's victory, the Islamic republic of Iran viewed with respect international and human rights organizations similar to other world bodies. But acts of the UN human rights commission soon showed that the term human rights is merely a forced motto in the contemporary world. Also the statements and reports of this commission, prior to have been effected by domestic realities of world states, are the outcome of the exigencies of domineering world policies. This precisely points to the conditions which are now faced by us. It is indisputable but any move in safeguarding humanitarian criteria of human rights will be possible only when those involved with human rights issues at the international level approach the subject without considering political aspects and conservative outlook, but they act in a totally impartial manner without taking sides with their typical cultural values. They should also refrain from using the issue of human rights as a political weapon.
