According to estimates, as a result of accidental and in many cases intentional exhausts there are now over 3.5 million artificial objects and particles in the circumterrestrial layer of outer space. Such a cosmic ``debris'' presents a danger to astronauts as well as to spacecraft. Passive methods and active methods of cleaning outer space of this debris are now being investigated. Removal of debris fragments by active methods requires use of devices which detect particles and impart either energy or momentum to them so as to ensure their deceleration and descent from the orbit. This problem can be solved in a cardinal way, namely by vaporization of fragments with the aid of high-energy systems. Such a system may be a spacecraft which carries an electric reaction engine which propels it, a nuclear power plant which supplies power to the engine, and a laser set which imparts energy to a particle in space. Under consideration is the possibility of using for this purpose a spacecraft which carries a nuclear power plant consisting of a heat emitting reactor-converter and a built-in laser set with nuclear pumping /1/. The basal nuclear power plant has the following main technical and technological characteristics /2/: 1. Use of heat emitting fast-neutron reactor-converter with a moderating reflector and with an emitter shell formed by tungsten single crystals. 2. Use of a high-temperature cooling system with lithium as the coolant. 3. Transmission of the heat ejected during the thermodynamic cycle through the surface of a cooler-radiator consisting of sodium heat exchanger tubes. 4. Use of only one structural material, a niobium alloy, throughout the entire nuclear power plant. 5. Layout of the nuclear power plant based on the radiation path principle, with use of shadow-type radiation protection. One envisages a compound reactor regulation system consisting of rotating cylinders inside the lateral reflector in addition to control elements and protective devices ensuring radiation safety directly inside the reactor-converter core. Inside the core is also located a protective nuclear safety system consisting of devices which absorb neutrons and ensuring nuclear safety in all emergency situations, these devices being withdrawn from the core into their functional orbit only before the power is turned on. The nuclear power plant is both started and cooled by a startup cooling system which ensures economical melting of lithium in the tubes by the heat coming from the reactor-converter during startup. An array of laser cells is mounted in the lateral reflector of the heat emitting reactor-converter, its electric power rating being 150 kw. The reactor generates both the voltage necessary for sustaining the discharge in the discharge chamber of the CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and the neutron flux used for boost-excitation of the active laser medium. Each cell is a discharge chamber, a 700 mm long cylindrical tube 110 mm in diameter, its geometrical axis coinciding with optical axis of the laser. The electrodes are disposed along that optical axis and produce a transverse discharge, perpendicular to the direction of gas flow. The active medium is a CO[.sub]2[/]-N[.sub]2[/]-He mixture driven through the discharge tube, its temperature and pressure at the inlet being 500 K and 4500 Pa respectively. A laser set with an exit beam power of 15 kw requires 10 such cells inside the lateral reflector. The cells can be cooled either by an independent cooling system or by a cooling system combined with the cooling system for the protective shields. It is also feasible to use a cooling system withe heat exchanger tubes. Design estimates indicate that the mass of such a nuclear power plant with an electric power rating of 150 kw will not exceed nine tons. Estimates regarding the effectiveness radius of such a power plant indicate the following. Inasmuch as most of the artificial objects in outer space are made of aluminum and are within the 0.1-10 mm size range, they require correspondingly 0.00023-200 kJ of energy for vaporization. Owing to divergence of the laser beam, the intensity of radiation reaching the surface of a particle will depend on the distance to that surface. The intensity of radiation incident on a particle is FORMULA The intensity levels (watts) of incident radiation from a 15 kW laser, depending on the radius of a particle (cm) and on the distance to a particle (km), are listed is the Table. The numbers in parentheses represent the time (seconds) needed for vaporization of a particle: FORMULA Evidently such a system is very effective at least within the 10-30 km range of distances. Such systems operate now in radiation-safe orbits within the 800-2000 km range of altitudes, where most of the mass of debris fragments is located. The rocket-carrier ``Proton'' puts a spacecraft with a dry mass of 11.2 tons into a circular orbit at 800 km altitude, whereupon the nuclear power plant on the spacecraft is turned on so that search for and vaporization of particles can begin. The spacecraft then moves from 800 km to 2000 km altitude and back to 800 km altitude with an only small change of the orbit inclination angle, propelled by the 150 kW electric reaction engine with xenon as the working medium. It takes the spacecraft about 960 h to make one such sweep and, with a 5-6 tons supply of xenon, it can make 40-50 sweeps during its 5 years long life. Complete removal of fragments within the 800-2000 km layer requires 8-10 such spacecrafts. Spacecraft for Cleaning Circumterrestrial Space Layer of Debris Fragments Bibliography 1. F.M. Arinkin, G.A.
