The fact that he starts from presenting his own person, with his (social) classmates, or with his party colleagues, and that he does not show the least interest in the life of the majority of the people is his own business. However, this attitude cannot leave indifferent those many who are threatened from two sides at once. One side is represented by the fact that, to reach his goal -- the one that he has clearly and openly declared, namely, to bring back former King Mihai to the throne -- Coposu and "his group" will do all they can to provoke early elections. And if they win those elections (that is what he believes) the Constitution can be changed and the ex-king, who is exiled to Versoix, will be able to return to Romania, and might even drive under the Arc de Triomphe in a jeep similar to the one that U.S. General Patton was driving during the debarkation in Normandy... It is obvious that early elections can be provoked only by a crisis. But, we are quite aware of what a crisis means and we are sort of fed up with it. However, the change of the Constitution will have to have the approval of the electorate. This is the only note of optimism (for us) in the tenebrous threats voiced by the PNTCD leader; it is difficult to assume that the Romanian people, who spoke out for the Republic in 1991, would willingly change their options in 1995 on the alleged ground that there is no leader -- certainly except for the ex-monarch -- who can currently polarize the sympathy of the electorate, as Coposu affirms. It is true that a great part of the electorate does not know what the monarchy meant and might be seduced by the much-publicized slogans according to which the monarch would "save" Romania. The other side -- and unfortunately for Coposu, this side is much larger -- knows what the ex-monarch really meant for our country. Thus, as far as the popular vote (we cannot help it, the expression defines the reality) is concerned, it cannot be really changed. The more so since, while revealing such an obvious lack of competence that for a moment we almost thought that we are facing a trick that we cannot figure out, Coposu also threatens us, apart from reinstating the monarchy, with the implementation of the much-publicized integral restitution of property (restitutio in integrum). This means that such an extraordinary polarization will take place in Romanian society, and will result in such a gap between the rich (a few) and the poor (the majority) that not even the liberals, who are known for having a cure to all ailments, will be able to fill it up. The integral restitution of all the goods that in one way or another have become state property, usually through violation of the law, would mean repairing an error by committing a much greater error. We are not referring only to a few million tenants who will see themselves thrown out in the streets, and peasants who will return to the state of serfdom, although nobody is entitled to play with the fate of these people. We are talking about the complete destruction of the work carried out by millions of Romanians for scores of years, who created factories out of small workshops, blocks of flats on empty lots that were left untended, and holiday resorts at the seaside or at the mountain, in one word a patrimony for which we have all made great efforts, but less those who, willingly or unwillingly, stayed far from the homeland and who -- when Coposu's dream comes true -- will not hesitate to come and claim their properties. The distinguished PNTCD president seems not to have taken all this into consideration. Moreover, he believes in a favorable response to the intentions he clearly expressed: the restoration of the monarchy and "restitutio in integrum." The insistence he has displayed to fulfill this "credo" makes us believe that the PNTCD leader wishes no longer to be part of the parliamentary opposition. Maybe he finds the ... street more comfortable. In any event, by militating for the return of big lands to past landowners or their current successors, Coposu has proved again -- as if it was still necessary -- how "close" he is to the soul of these people whom we call peasants and through whose efforts Romania has always managed to get out of any impasse. Coposu added the "chance" of his unequivocal speech to the common sense of this peasant, who has always known whom his friends are. His speech will be "sanctioned" accordingly, even if it will not happen so soon. As far as the road from Republic to monarchy is concerned, we do not even bother to try to convince Coposu that for the immense majority of Romanians this is inconceivable. But one should grant him what is rightfully his! That is, we must recognize Coposu's "merit" and make thinner with every passing declaration, like the aforementioned one, the not very large group of his own camp. Through this monarchist zeal, Coposu is the best advertiser of the form of government that currently prevails in our country, that is, the Republic. In other words, Coposu is campaigning for the Republic without being aware of it...
