These pieces of news are good. But there is also news to prick up one's ears. The food products certification department of the Eastern Siberia Center of Metrology and Standardization has warned Irkutsk residents that it is dangerous to drink Chinese vodka with hieroglyphics on a white and red label (it contains 30 times the maximum norms of fusel oils, 10 times the maximum norms of aldehydes, and 37 times the maximum norms of ethers), to eat canned stewed beef from Mongolia (which is spiced with toxic chemicals), to use tomato paste produced by the Soyuzvneshkooptorg, or to treat oneself to Rakovaya Sheyka Chinese candies. It is not yet know whether everyone has followed this advice.
