Then he is happy. The media echo which appears to him "predominantly positive" concerns a far-reaching decision. The previous day, the Free Democratic Party presidium promised to remain faithful to its coalition partner also for the future legislative period--a decision made for the chairman's sake. "This was very clearly my initiative," says the lawyer who has been leading the Liberals since last June; and that is certainly true. As a last step, he had tied his "foster father," Hans-Dietrich Genscher, into the plan of quick determination. Although the FDP leadership team will make the formal declaration only on Monday in Bonn's Thomas-Dehler House, the honorary chairman already trumpeted the news on the previous weekend: "If the SPD [Social Democratic Party] presents itself as the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] with a red shawl," he asks at a land party congress of the Mecklenburg-West Pomerian Free Democrats in Binz on the island of Ruegen, "why should we not stay with the original?" At this point, Genscher and company have long been aware that a turnaround in coalition strategy would hopelessly overtax the bourgois-conservative Kinkel. Probably a fitting assessment. And the Swabian [Kinkel], fussy about his reputation, basically sees it the same way. After the "blow of liberation" has been secretly agreed upon, a party chief emerges at the Ruegen Baltic Sea spa who inspires the delegates at least somewhat. He will now make his "handwriting" clear and "roll up his shirtsleeves." He will need to. Since the botched elections in Lower Saxony and Schleswig Holstein, the 57-year-old administrative lawyer from Hechingen is in a bad position. Barely 10 months ago, Genscher still had praised him as the "personified confidence-building measure" for his party. But that no longer counts. The Liberal chief feels affronted by harsh judgments by political thinkers who are quite favorably disposed toward the FDP's cause. Recently, political scientist Arnulf Baring called him to his face "an amateur actor at whom the country is beginning to laugh." He may have used the wrong tone, but he reflects the basic mood of his sympathizers: Klaus Kinkel, who during his years as a civil servant enjoyed the reputation of a competent careerist, is increasingly seen as flustered. Naturally, such accusations outrage him. "One has to stand still for that," he reacts quiveringly, while in his Bonn ministerial office he hits his crossed legs with the edge of his hand. What has he perpetrated that he, who "kept himself free of all scandals," is thus losing respect? "I am no flighty airhead," the party chairman defends himself, pointing to his solid character--and that is precisely where the misunderstandings crop up. Where the press, for instance, subjects the confused top politican to harsh criticism in the current nonstop election year, Kinkel feels himself persecuted "as a human being." He is being "mercilessly reviled." But in truth, there is another part of his nature, the lover of power who, if necessary, is not very squeamish. In his role as chief of the Foreign Office, after all, he has managed to enlarge the European house "with a sledgehammer" (DIE ZEIT). Does it bother him that, after "summoning" the French ambassador in Bonn, the Paris LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS huffily spoke of a "rugby player?" "No, what's that all about?" He, as the foreign minister of an enlarged Germany, must not be seen "as some half-hearted fellow." But the task of representing the chancellor's fatherland in the world is one thing--a fundamentally different one is the difficult job of taking in hand a miniparty disintegrating into innumerable particles. And Klaus Kinkel knows that. "As Foreign Office chief, no one bests me," says the FDP chief, thereby acknowledging that his effective power [as party chairman] is still limited at present. Hence the leader of liberals tries to copy the foreign minister move by move--his forward push in the coalition decision is to him the first proof of that. Because now they are going to really get started. The FDP, roars the speaker in Binz so that his cheeks grow red with fury, must "finally become less accommodating, must give offense...we have been too goody-goody!" After the weeks of inner tension, now a kind of political convalescent presents himself who calls for the offensive, also on subject matters. Resolutely, as if the Count [Lambsdorff] were still sitting at the head of the table, the Lambsdorff heir propagates a clearcut lobby strategy. The nets are cast to lure small- and medium-sized business in particular. The key word "elite" appears in almost all of Kinkel's "guidelines." Since it is a matter of survival, the liberal gymnast tickles the old reflexes back to life. In his opinion, for too long the FDP has catered also to those "who don't vote for us anyway"--so let there be an end to it. The Free Democratic identity invoked by Kinkel now again unabashedly limits itself to taking the side of the "better and more industrious" people in the country. May the CDU and SPD, which he calls "tankers," get stuck in society's "pack ice": He, the helmsman of the "smaller and nimbler ship" tries to steer his own clientele out of the danger zone. "If I Should Really Have No Luck At All..." But his "struggle" to regain for the FDP a profile which at present is "somewhat blurred," at the same time shows the characteristics of artificiality. For the sake of power sharing, he is about to prescribe for his party the former support corset of an exaggerated economic liberalism, and pays for it the price of damaging his self-image. That has demanded of him to date to also see himself as an "advocate of the weak." "That is a fundamental contradiction," he says a bit wearily, "with which I have to live," and at such moments one feels the burden pressing on the chairman. He not only considers it important to somehow be all things to all people. This educated citizen with a tendency toward brooding meditations also wants to claim for himself being at home in all emotional situations. Kinkel as a show-off superstar, and Kinkel in the pose of the delicately strung thinker: "I personally," he says, braced by visits to the grass roots, "have strong nerves," and puffs out his athletic chest--only to change to a bitterly plaintive tone in the evening of the same day. There, he experiences himself "as rather helpless in a problematical constellation." That he did not push himself forward when it was a matter of finding a successor for the party chairmanship is sufficiently well-known--but he must emphasize it time and again. In Saxony's Zwickau, the almost incidental question as to how he assesses the present rather negative image of the FDP is already enough to set him off. "Yes, yes, yes," drawls the one so addressed, and he obviously feels himself attacked: He, "Kinkel," has spent nights "sitting up in his bed until he finally became party boss." Can such a one succeed in not only lifting his atrophied and emaciated liberals over the 5-percent hurdle, but also in keeping them in the government? Had the foreign minister, recently flying home from Russia above the clouds, not felt the situation of party chairman Kinkel to be rather unfortunate? "If I really should have no luck at all...," he complained at the time. The early presidium decision in favor of the alliance with the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] thus also takes into account the mentality of the FDP's top man. An unreliable customer, plagued by scruples, tending toward ambivalence, and unsure in the core of his role-playing, is to be stabilized. This may not be a "blank check" for Kohl and his Christian Democrats, as the blue-yellow rival pope Juergen Moellemann denounces it--but at least Kinkel would hardly have been capable of action without this agreement. Strategically not very flexible, the FDP boss had for weeks considered any other solution as an imposition. At the beginning of the election campaign, someone like Kinkel simply is incapable of, on the one hand, defending the joint government work, "and then simultaneously justifying leaving it." Win or lose, is now his motto. If he has slipped up, "the fault is rightfully mine." Since the partner has now been decided in principle, he wants to practice the art of "distinctive profiling." The magic word, autonomy, is to be filled with life--a maxim, however, so far only anchored in theory. It would be in favor of the chairman's logic to now encourage his party to make a decision in the election of the federal president free from coalition calculations. But for that he still lacks the courage. He sees himself "on a testing ground, trying to keep the outfit together." From the onset of his commitment as the liberal guiding figure, the vacillating Swabian has been under suspicion of not being able to make powerful counterdesigns in the ruling bourgeois bloc. Irmgard Schwaetzer's mocking term, "FDP appendage," upsets him; the chief is enraged by Moellemann's constant needling that the alliance should have been cancelled, at the latest over the elderly care insurance. Has the party lost its contours because the chairman, as he is being told more and more, is drowsing in fear of the overwhelming chancellor? For Klaus Kinkel, all that is "pure bunk." Anyone who wants to conscientiously probe his share in Bonn's power, should "ask fat Kohl himself how difficult I am for him." A politician is fighting for his reputation. He, "Kinkel," says Kinkel, appearing strangely guileless, "in truth is much more unpleasant than most people think."
