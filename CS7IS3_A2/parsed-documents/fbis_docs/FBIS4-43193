The arrested people have been detained in Tirana prisons for the past two months. The international human rights organization is demanding to know whether the six detainees had lawyers during the entire period of their interrogation, particularly during the questioning by interrogators. According to Amnesty International, during the month of May only one of the six detainees was visited by a lawyer, and no lawyer was present during questioning. Finally, Amnesty International expressed concern over reports it received that when the six people were arrested the police searched the Omonoia offices and houses of members of the Greek minority in Gjirokaster, Delvine, and Sarande without search warrants. There have also been reports that members of the Greek minority were threatened by the police during interrogation about possible contacts with these six arrested people.
