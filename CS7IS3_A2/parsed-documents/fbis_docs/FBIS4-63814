FBIS4-63814 "drsov101_a_94014" FBIS-SOV-94-101 Daily Report 25 May 1994 RUSSIAN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS `Decline' of Black Sea Fleet Examined `Decline' of Black Sea Fleet Examined LD2305174994 LD2305174994 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian at 0725 GMT on 22 May 1994 broadcasts the 30-minute "De Facto" program. Correspondent Oleg Vakulovskiy explains that the May edition of "De Facto" was to have included an item about the Black Sea Fleet, and a camera team was sent to Sevastopol. In the light of recent events it was decided to devote the entire program to the subject of the Black Sea Fleet. In his introductory remarks, Vakulovskiy says that the Black Sea Fleet has always been Russian or Soviet. Its warships are currently flying the red flag, even though the Soviet Union no longer exists. This expedient has been adopted because the fleet is now under the command of two presidents pending its division. Vakulovskiy points out that such a division, however desirable, will be very difficult. The Black Sea Fleet and the city of Sevastopol have been in a unique position for a long time, he says. No other fleet has ever been commanded by two presidents. No other port has ever hosted two navies. Both sailors and warships are suffering, Vakulovskiy says. He recalls that the Black Sea Fleet had scuttled itself twice before, in September 1854 and in June 1918, and says it seems likely that history will repeat itself in the 1990s. Vakulovskiy interviews Captain Valeriy Zubkov, the commander of the antisubmarine warfare, ASW, escort ship Smetlivyy: He asks: "What is the job of your ship?" Zubkov says: "The main function of this ship is to seek out and destroy submarines and to protect naval formations." Vakulovskiy then asks: "Is your ship the only one needing repair at the moment?" Zubkov replies: "No, the ship is not the only one needing repair, but she is the only ship on which repairs are currently being carried out. In fact, the repairs are in full swing and nearing completion. Dockside testing is under way at the moment. The ship is preparing for sea trials. I hope that this will be completed in the near future. Vakulovskiy asks: "Why has she been under repair for eight years? Is this normal?" Zubkov says: "No, it is not normal for a warship to spend so long at the yard. Because of the collapse of the Union, probably, the target time for completion has been postponed four times. The fleet is aging -- dying, basically. If things carry on like this, there will probably be nothing to share out in a year's time. Almost 60-70 percent of the ships we now have, have had the interval between overhauls extended. These problems are not being tackled. Even keeping the ships in dock is a problem. A number of ships that are supposed to be under repair are stuck here. But it is bad for the crews too. Even those ships that are capable of putting to sea, do so less often. The crews are, naturally, becoming rusty. Training in port cannot take the place of practical work at sea." After interviewing Lena Kolomiytseva, a local radio journalist who witnessed last month's seizure of premises belonging to the 318th reserve division of the Black Sea Fleet, Vakulovskiy interviews Zubkov about strategic changes taking place in the Black Sea. Zubkov says: "Ships are putting to sea much less often. Above all, warships are virtually unable to meet the objectives of combat service. No vessels are on duty in the Mediterranean at the moment. Naturally this affects the readiness of crews and the skills of warship commanders. Here too trips to sea have been substantially curtailed. This also affects crew training levels." Vakulovskiy adds that ships were putting to sea only rarely. If they did leave port, it was not for months as before but for a few days, in order to save fuel. Capt. Zubkov goes on: "Any vacuum will be quickly filled. Warships of allied navies, of the United States, used not to enter the Black Sea. But last year a NATO naval squadron of nine warships sailed into the Black Sea. Inexorably, NATO warships are taking over the Black Sea theater. Turkey is also filling this vacuum by developing and improving its Navy, by deploying new warships, new types of weaponry." Vakulovskiy recalls that a few years ago a warship of the Black Sea Fleet, "Bezzavetnyy," rammed an American missile cruiser, the "Yorktown," which had entered Soviet territorial waters and refused to leave, even after a warning. In those days the very fact of a violation of territorial waters was an extraordinary occurrence. There were few U.S. vessels in the Black Sea then. Now there are far more. Igor Korsakov, an analyst employed by the Black Sea Fleet, adds: "Because of the geopolitical changes that have taken place in the world in recent years, following the collapse of the CIS [as heard], Turkey's policy in the world as a whole and its regional policy in particular has, naturally, changed. Turkey used to be a counterweight, in many respects, to Russia or the Soviet Union. Now Turkish policy is to expand its influence on many countries of the Black Sea, including those on the southern border of the CIS. Vakulovskiy asks: "Which countries?" Korsakov says: "Romania, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Turkic-speaking countries of the CIS." Vakulovskiy says: "Azerbaijan?" Korsakov replies: "Yes, Azerbaijan. The Turkish Navy now consists of about 200 warships, including 17 diesel submarines, 12 destroyers including two guided missile destroyers, four frigates including two guided missile frigates, 41 assault craft, 33 minesweepers, and a large number of large and small patrol boats, including those designed for minesweeping. NATO experts say that in the very near future the Turkish Navy will be a match for Russia's Black Sea Fleet on the Black Sea." Vakulovskiy asks: "What is your expert assessment -- that was a NATO assessment." Korsakov says: "I cannot divulge these assessments." Vakulovskiy then asks: "But in your own personal view, are the NATO experts close to the truth?" Korsakov replies: "I think they are very close to the truth. In the next few years Turkey will become an even stronger naval power." Offering his views on the decline of the fleet, Admiral Aleksey Kalinin, former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, says: "When I handed over the fleet in 1985, the ratio of strength between us and our closest neighbor, Turkey, was about 2.5 to 1 or even 3 to 1. In 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, it was 2 to 1. Now, after two years of confusion and chaos, this screw-up, it has fallen to 1:1. This ratio will continue to deteriorate, I am afraid, if things go on this way." Kalinin concludes his contribution by saying: "For more than two years I have been saying -- both in the press and at various meetings, reporting to both presidents and to delegation leaders -- that there can be only one solution to this problem. This solution is very simple. Since they have declared themselves to be independent states, Russia and Ukraine should conclude a treaty on an all-embracing alliance. This treaty should stipulate that there will be a single maritime defense area in the south for which the Black Sea Fleet is responsible. It must be preserved." The program is illustrated by extensive footage of warships, in varying states of repair or disrepair, in port at Sevastopol or leaving port. Some of the vessels shown are rusting hulks or wrecks.
