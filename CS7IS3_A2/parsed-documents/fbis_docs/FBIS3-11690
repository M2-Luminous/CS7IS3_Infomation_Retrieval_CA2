The strike called by the labor centrals ended up as a set of sporadic demonstrations. The Sao Paulo subway began operating this morning at 0700, two hours later than normal. A demonstration by bus drivers and ticket collectors caused a traffic jam on Celso Garcia Avenue, one of the most important avenues in eastern Sao Paulo. In downtown Sao Paulo, retired bank employees protested ironically, asking for donations for the deputies who increased their own salaries. Sao Paulo industrial belt metalworkers blocked the Anchieta highway, which joins Sao Paulo and the sea coast, in protest against the Volkswagen truck factory. In the afternoon, bank employees, chemical industry workers, and taxi drivers staged a motorade along Paulista Avenue. In Brasilia, public servants march along the ministries' esplanade. The police guard was reinforced. The march ended with a demonstration in front of the Finance Ministry building.
