During those three sessions, it has become abundantly clear that the present leadership and the opposition have different approaches to these matters. President Aliyev and his team stress that "only the former leaders of Azerbaijan bear the responsibility for bringing Russian forces in Baku which led to over 100 deaths and many hundreds wounded among the peaceful population". In connection with this, the following names were recalled: Abdurahman Vezirov, the former First Secretary of Communist Party of Azerbaijan; Ayaz Mutalibov, ex-Chairman of the Council of Ministers and then Azerbaijani President; and Vagif Huseynov, ex-Chairman of KGB of Azerbaijan. The opposition deputies see the present leadership as "trying to conceal Moscow's policy towards Azerbaijan". First Deputy Chairman of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan [PFA], Ibrahim Ibrahimli said that "the present-day leadership's hearings are politically motivated". The present-day leadership fights with their political opponents, ex-President Ayaz Mutalibov and the leaders of the PFA. According to Ibrahimli, "the military June uprising in Ganja in 1993, like the Russian troop invasion into Baku on January 19-20, 1990, is the handiwork of one and the same force". The opposition deputies reminded us that "69 volumes of the inquiry concerning the January events" are in Moscow and Russia is not hurrying to give t?em back. According to the opposition, "one cannot objectively assess the developments of January 20, 1990 without examining those and other missing documents". No final resolution has been adopted at yesterday's session. The deputies voted for the creation of a special Commission into the Investigation of the Events of January 20, 1990. Parliamentary hearings dealing with this topic will be continued.
