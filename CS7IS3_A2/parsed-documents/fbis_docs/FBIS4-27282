His comments came amid mounting criticism of a report issued last Friday by the ministry which presents net revenue estimates for fiscal 2000 after ongoing 6.2 trillion yen tax cuts and an increase in the consumption tax to between 7 percent and 10 percent in April 1997. The consumption tax is currently levied at 3 percent. The estimates were just mechanical calculations for the government's Tax Commission to promote "quantitative," instead of simply abstract, discussions, Fujii told a news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. "If requested to offer additional estimates, we must consider doing so," he said, noting the report does not include any policy implications from the ministry. Against this backdrop, Fujii said the report omitted all items that need policy decisions such as correction of unfair tax systems and administrative reform. The report, submitted at the request to the Tax Commission and the ruling coalition parties, drew the criticism that it failed to include a tax hike to under 7 percent, a natural tax revenue increase, or possible effects of fiscal and administrative overhauls. It also met criticism by setting conditions for redemption of stopgap bonds in 10 years and financing an expected increase in welfare spending entirely by way of the tax hike. The stopgap bonds are to fund the three-year time lag between tax cuts and the hike. After reviewing the report Friday, the ruling coalition government asked the ministry for further estimates, including a consumption tax hike of between 4 percent and 6 percent, a "natural" revenue increase, and a 20-year maturity for the stopgap bonds, a ministry official said. Some members of the advisory panel to the prime minister also urged the ministry at a meeting last Friday to brief them on estimates for a consumption tax hike to 6 percent, panel members said. Referring to the delayed official signing of a merger by three second-tier regional banks, Fujii said that it stemmed from "clerical problems," adding there will no change in the merger planned for January, 1995. Kita-Nippon Bank, Tokuyo City Bank, and Shokusan Bank said Monday they will postpone the signing slated for Tuesday because of a backlog in paper work. But labor unions have voiced strong opposition to the move, posing a threat to the planned January merger. This would be a big blow for the Finance Ministry, which is positively backing such a merger to revitalize the banking industry. Fujii said, "we believe the merger will benefit the region's economy."
