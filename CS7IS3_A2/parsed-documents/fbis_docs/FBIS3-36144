Russian Presidential Administration Launches Perestroyka"] [Text] The new Constitution has once again raised the question of authority. The Fundamental Law requires that it be concentrated primarily in the hands of a president. The president, apparently, does not object. Still, can this objective be achieved without a strong and qualified staff -- at least as qualified as, say, the government's? After the successful adoption of the Constitution there has been only one answer to the question: the presidential staff should be brought "in line." They say that at least two reorganization plans competed in the Kremlin lobbies. The author of the first plan was Viktor Ilyushin, the second one was drawn up by Sergey Filatov. As soon as Sergey Filatov gave up his deputy seat to stay on in his office, however, it became clear that it would be he who will evidently head the presidential administration's perestroyka. At present not only has Sergey Filatov prepared a plan for this restructuring, but certain provisions of it have already been implemented. Yeltsin, however, has yet to approve its general concept. So, what is it that Sergey Filatov is going to propose to the president? In the first place, he suggested that the president's information support should be dealt with in a more thorough fashion. To this end, two analytical centers -- for general policy and for socioeconomic policy -- will be merged into one. It is not yet clear who will head the new center. One thing is clear, however: Neither Anatoliy Rakitov, nor Petr Filippov, who headed the former analytical structures, are considered among candidates for the new post. The single analytical service will bring together all information flows: government and Federal Assembly documents, reports from the ground, and also mass media publications. At the same time the so-called "situation room," in which information will be processed by special software, will start operating. Aside from the information service, a center for drawing up presidential programs (possibly under Nikolay Malashev) will be set up. It is also proposed to expand the powers of the service in charge of relations with the territories and the control administration. There is a plan whereby the control administration will set up its local branches. Another service will deal with parties and public organizations. It cannot be ruled out that it will be set up on the basis of Georgiy Satarov's Sociopolitical Center. A structure on international problems is also in the works. To all appearances, the president will want to increase his own control over personnel in various echelons of power, including through setting up appropriate services within his administration. But for the time being these are only blueprints... But why has Yeltsin not okayed them yet? The president has already approved the post of his representative at the Federal Assembly and appointed Aleksandr Yakovlev to the office. The first step "to bring the staff in line" has thus been taken. What remains is to wait for the next one.
