The demand for financing is less than that, and the Finance Ministry wants to come up with the necessary money primarily by issuing government bonds. As the Hungarian News Agency [MTI] reports, starting in March, each month new government bonds in the value of Ft15-25 billion will be issued. The issue will generally take place in the first week of each month. As a result, this year public government bonds will be issued in the value of Ft250 billion. The law allows the issue of Ft300 billion. Of this amount, Ft69.2 billion will be used to service credits and to renew government bonds that are due to expire. Thus, the issue of medium and long-term bonds in order to finance the deficit will amount to Ft180 billion. Starting in April, foreigners will also be eligible to buy government bonds, for forints. The issue of treasury bonds will continue according to the previously established system. The sale of interest-bearing treasury bonds will take place in the third week of each month, after a week-long registration period, and the amount issued will depend on the demand. Treasury bonds to the population will continue to be sold by designated branch offices of the National Savings Bank [OTP] and the Budapest Bank. Issue will be determined by demand in this case, as well. Every Wednesday an auction of 30-day discount treasury bonds will be held, at which the advertised amount is expected to be Ft6-10 billion. Every other Tuesday, an auction of 90-day discount treasury bonds is planned, where the advertised amount will be Ft8-10 billion. On the last Thursday of each month, an auction of 180-day discount treasury bonds will be held, at which bonds will be offered in the value of Ft10-15 billion. Finally, every other month, on the last Friday of the given month, an auction of 360-day discount treasury bonds will be held, where Ft15 billion will be offered.
