Ozawa indicated his intention to continue to seek a cooperative relationship with Watanabe in the future on the condition that Watanabe leaves the LDP. He said: "Allying with the LDP runs counter to our spirit (and our ideas upon forming Shinseito). However, I still hope to act with him if he secedes from the LDP." In criticizing the idea of "forming a coalition between the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan" while excluding Shinseito, which is an idea that once cropped up in the process of establishing the next administration, Ozawa stated, "This concept lacks the right recognition of the times." In warning these parties, Ozawa said: "This is nothing other than a suicidal act. Why do they want to do this?"
