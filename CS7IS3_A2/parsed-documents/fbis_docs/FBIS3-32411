At the same time, the minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] stated that in the past year there has been a atmosphere of tranquility on both sides of the fence separating the national territory from that occupied by the foreign military base. The second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba referred to the madness of and provocation by those who attempt to leave the island through Caimanera. He pointed out that this was madness because they have to cross a densely mined field on both sides of the fence. He added that this constituted a provocation and an unwitting act of treason against the national security of Cuba, because armies which are not friendly have been deployed on both sides of the fence. Raul made these declarations on visiting (Elmis Brooks Chivas) of the border patrol brigade, who is hospitalized at the military hospital in Santiago de Cuba. The 22-year-old soldier lost one leg as he tried to rescue a group of people crossing a field mined by the Yankee base in an attempt to leave the country illegally. During the visit, Raul was accompanied by Juan Almeida Gomez, who read the agreement designating (Brooks) a member of the Cuban Revolution Veterans Association. At the same hospital Raul visited Simon Despain, a civil worker of the FAR who also lost a leg while carrying out technical work on the same border in Caimanera.
