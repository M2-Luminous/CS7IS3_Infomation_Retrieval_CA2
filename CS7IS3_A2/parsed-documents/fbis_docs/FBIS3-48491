This is a precondition to holding the third round of talks between North Korea and the United States for resolving the nuclear issue. In order to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, the United States has insisted upon, first of all, the continuity of IAEA inspections; second, making North Korea accept inspections of its two unreported facilities at the third round of talks; and, finally, leading North Korea to abandon its nuclear policy through its internationalization. Meanwhile, North Korea has tried to improve relations with the United States and other advanced capitalist countries to overcome difficulties in maintaining its own system. Towards that end, North Korea has tried to use its nuclear card to the utmost in optimizing relations with the United States and other advanced capitalist countries to the most of its abilities. Given these conflicts of interest, unless North Korea changes its policy fundamentally, the North Korea-U.S. talks will likely be prolonged and North Korea's denuclearization will only be possible through North Korea's "perestroyka" [previous word in English]. Therefore, the short-term and tentative way to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue is to make every effort in negotiations to conduct thorough nuclear inspections, and the long-term and ultimate way is to make North Korea realize that embarking on a "road of internationalization" is a better way to maintaining its system than embarking on a "road of chuche-orientation" by formulating an international assistance program. It is almost impossible for the current North Korean political leaders to abandon the "road of chuche-orientation" because this would mean the collapse of their system. However, insisting on the road of chuche-orientation in a world of internationalization, will only invite the danger of the collapse of the North Korean system. Therefore, to lead North Korea to pursue the maintenance of its system by carrying out a policy of internationalization, we must contemplate the formation of an international assistance program at some appropriate time in the future that can make North Korea see that in reality, "perestroyka" will help boost its system. When our government's initiative and close cooperative system with the United States, Japan, and other advanced capitalist countries and international agencies results in an assistance program to accelerate North Korea's "perestroyka," we will then be able to realize our dream of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.
