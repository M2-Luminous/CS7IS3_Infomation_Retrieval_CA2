The document was reached through an agreement among all parties participating in the dialogue. This national document covers the following important issues covered by the political forces dialogue: The accused in disorder cases: The document calls for firm measures to arrest fugitive suspects in cases of assassinations, assassination attempts, and highway robberies, and in other security violations. It also calls for immediate legal and public trials for those arrested in order to implement legal measures and penalties against the accused without delay. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee opposes any leniency or hesitation on the part of the competent forces to take firm legal measures against those involved in terrorist acts. It affirms the need to expeditiously issue the regulations governing the carrying of firearms, ensure compliance with them, and review the current law to make it tougher in order to limit arms carrying, arms proliferation, and arms trade, and to make sure that there are no camps or centers for terrorist training as well as to take the appropriate measures regarding this. Regarding the security and military aspect, the document affirms the need to remove all checkpoints inside and outside the cities, whether these checkpoints are affiliated with the Interior Ministry, Defense Ministry, or both ministries. The Interior Ministry will be responsible for defining the places in which security interests require security points, provided that it cooperates with the Defense Ministry to define the joint military and security checkpoints. The document also calls for general reconciliation among tribes to stop Yemeni bloodshed. In accordance with this reconciliation, no acts of revenge will be taken, and anyone who takes revenge will be considered an outlaw. The competent state organizations will take firm legal measures against these outlaws and will define the cases -- which would prompt revenge -- which took place before the date on which the declaration was issued. The military units -- which were stationed in the outskirts in some areas in the Governorates of Ta'izz, Lahij, Abyan, Shabwah, al-Bayda', and Ma'rib -- will be redeployed in areas agreed upon by a technical committee from the Armed Forces. No military patrols will be deployed in the cities, or along the roads. The police will be in charge of this in accordance with security requirements. An intelligence organ will be established in accordance with the law that will define its structure, tasks, and powers to safeguard national sovereignty. The document calls for discussing the methods to end the unofficial armed presence, including the distribution of weapons to citizens under any pretext. Any such act will be considered a crime. It calls for reorganizing the Ministry of Interior in a way that the various security units, including the central security forces, will be incorporated into it, so the ministry will have control over them. It calls for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities, and their redeployment during a period not exceeding two months in accordance with a consolidated central plan to reposition, merge, and reorganize them. It also calls for a commitment not to move any military units or troop or equipment reinforcements, to suspend the implementation of military exercises, and to confine the military police's role to that of keeping the security and promoting the discipline of military units. The military police will be prevented from carrying out any activity or patrols which conflict with the duties of the public security. Any manifestation, or measure, or conduct which would suggest distinction or preferential treatment among the armed forces personnel will be banned. The officers and soldiers of the armed forces will be prevented from intervening in the affairs of both citizens and local authorities. They will also be prevented from carrying out any activity in their workplaces that would conflict with the functions of the judicial and executive authorities. Recruiting, arming, and mobilizing military units, militias, the Border Guard, the Popular Guard, and similar units will be halted, and the units recently formed will be disbanded. With regard to assessing the relationship and defining the powers, the document stresses the need to embody the Constitution, laws, and by-laws in practice; to spell out the tasks and powers the Presidential Council, its chairman, and its vice chairman will enjoy in the course of the performance of their constitutional duties; and to reconsider the duties and prerogatives of the Presidential Council Office accordingly. The disbursement of public funds outside the purposes defined in the general budget's current expenditure and development expenditure will be banned. There is a need to abide by the powers defined for disbursement. The powers regarding disbursement for senior state officials will be defined. With regard to the bases of building a modern state and its bodies, the dialogue committee affirmed that the major task lies in building the state and repairing the problems from the previous phase. Our experience since the formation of the Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990 has shown that the way of running state affairs has been an obstacle to the merger of the two former regimes and to building a united state. With regard to the organization of the central authority, the document explained the following: The House of Representatives is the legislative body of the Republic of Yemen, and it is elected by the people through secret, free, and direct balloting. The Constitution defines the House's powers, duties, terms of membership, and its means of nomination and voting. The Consultative Council comprises an equal number of members representing the local administrative units. These members are elected by the governorates' councils. The Constitution defines the number of members from each and every administrative unit, membership terms, and the method of nomination and voting. The document also defines the tasks and powers of the Consultative Council. The document states that the presidency of the state constitutes the sovereign power of the state and is composed of the Presidential Council, which includes five members elected by the House of Representatives and the Consultative Council together. The House of Representatives elects a president and a vice president from among its members. The term of membership of the Presidential Council has been set to two electoral terms. The document also identifies the powers and tasks of the Council as set by the Constitution. It also defines the tasks and powers of the president, the vice president, the Presidential Council members, the government, and the judiciary. With regard to local government, the document affirms that it must be based on a new administrative configuration of the Republic of Yemen, revoking the existing administrative structures and units through which the country will be fully merged and all manifestations of partition will disappear. The document of pledge and accord also defines the powers of local administration, which shall be based on direct and free elections. It also defines financial, administrative, economic, social, security, educational, health, and social services. In the field of rebuilding and reorganizing the armed forces, the document considers the reorganizing of the armed forces one of the major issues. The armed forces shall be affiliated directly with the government. No side shall be authorized to form a military or semi-military force. A general plan shall be prepared to rehabilitate, merge, and reorganize the armed forces. In the field of education, the document stresses the need to unify school curriculum. The document urges the formation of a higher national security council and the identification of its tasks. The document also stresses the need to reactivate the central audit and control bureau as a body that is independent of the executive power. It shall be directly affiliated with the legislature. In the field of economy and financial organization, the document sets a number of steps aimed at abiding by a general state budget that defines expenditures and revenues and nourishes the economy in all fields. The document urges abidance by the current Constitution until it is amended, providing that an action shall be carried out to make constitutional amendments within a period of three months and not exceeding five months. The document stresses the need to give the government all powers and not to interfere in its work in order to enable it to execute its tasks. The government shall set timetables to accomplish the set tasks within a month. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee shall supervise and follow up the implementation of the decisions stipulated by the Document of Pledge and Accord between the parties to the dialogue of political forces to establish a modern Yemeni state. Regarding the necessary security arrangements and conditions to sign the agreement and begin to implement it, the document stipulates that a committee should be formed comprising the parties to the dialogue.
