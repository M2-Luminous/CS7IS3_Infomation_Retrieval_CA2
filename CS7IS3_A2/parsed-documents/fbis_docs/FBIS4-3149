During the conference, the spirit of the national work conference on propaganda and ideology was relayed; the experiences gained in implementing the tasks adopted at the provincial work conference on radio and television broadcasting were summarized and exchanged; and the issues of how to have the radio and television departments reinforce their vitality in the course of establishing the systems of socialist market economy as well as successfully conduct propaganda activities and develop radio and television broadcasting undertakings were emphatically discussed. During the conference, the participating comrades contended that the provincial work conference sponsored in November 1993 on radio and television broadcasting was a grand gathering of unprecedented size in the province's history of radio and television broadcasting development. The spirit of the provincial work conference in this regard has begun to promote or is promoting the development of radio and television broadcasting undertakings in the province. Although only six months have been over after the provincial work conference in this regard, the work to implement the spirit of the work conference has won initial success and a favorable and encouraging trend in the work has taken shape. The leading bodies of party committees and governments at the prefecture-city level have generally listened to the report given by the radio and television broadcasting department and formulated actually feasible measures for stabilizing the broadcasting organs at the county level, consolidating the rural broadcasting network, and carrying out propaganda management. Some units have also made great and important moves. For example, the Suifenhe city party committee and people's government summarized in a timely manner their experience and lessons gained in this regard; restored the operation of some city radio and television broadcasting organs that had been once revoked according to their local reality; and enhanced the systematic management over the radio and television broadcasting front. Such acts conducted by them have evoked strong repercussion among the radio and television broadcasting departments throughout the province. It was emphatically pointed out at the conference that radio and television broadcasting departments at all levels are facing a severe test. They should not only do a good job in being the mouthpiece of the party, government, and the people, but also steadily deepen their self improvement. This requires them to always regard as a guiding principle the socialist theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to do a good job in guiding public opinions and setting people's minds at rest. In conducting the propaganda work, they should consciously uphold the principle of applying the scientific theories to arming the people; applying correct public opinions to guiding the people; adopting lofty spirit to educate the people; and using the outstanding works to encourage the people. They should truly achieve in being really helpful and refraining from adding turmoil to society, playing the main melody and refraining from creating noise, paying attention to social benefits and refraining from forgetting the righteousness while seeing the interest, observing the propaganda discipline and refraining from going their own way, presenting concrete facts and refraining from being pretended, and vigorously grasping implementation and refraining from indulging in formalism. They should also make contributions to realizing political stability, social peace, and economic development in the province. It was pointed out at the conference that radio and television broadcasting departments are facing so many difficulties of which, the prominent one is the strained situation in funds. They should continuously seek more support and investments from the state on one hand and concentrate their efforts on tapping internal potential on the other hand by deepening their self improvement and upgrading the quality of personnel's contingent and propaganda work so as to truly provide for the people rich, colorful, and healthy nourishments for the mind, which can encourage the people to make progress. At the conference responsible comrades from the provincial radio and television broadcasting department and the radio and television broadcasting bureaus of various prefectures, cities, and fronts voiced their opinions on their future work of carrying out propaganda management, developing broadcasting undertakings, conducting technical management, and of building spiritual civilization.
