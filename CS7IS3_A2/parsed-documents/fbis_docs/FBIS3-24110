According to the premier, this year became the most difficult period for the national economy. Because of the permanent blockade, the volume of used resources fell at least by a factor of four, and the level of production of electric power also decreased. Last year Armenia, contrary to its desire, did not end up in the ruble zone, which also had an extremely negative effect on all aspects of life. The continuing confrontation in Karabakh and Azerbaijan's continuous efforts to draw Armenia into the conflict also had a serious effect on the economy. In this connection, the prime minister noted that today Baku is trying in fact to initiate a so-called war of resources, and this is compelling Armenia to devote increased attention to the formation and reinforcement of defense structures and to take the path of intensive building of the army, bringing its armed forces to the level permitted by international agreements; moreover, both in the sense of numbers and from the aspect of material-technical equipping. "If we were spending as much on defense today as at the beginning of 1992," declared the premier, "the standard of living in the republic would grow by 75 percent immediately." Despite these extremely unfavorable factors and regularly arising circumstances of force majeure (explosions in gas pipelines, and sabotage in various other infrastructures connecting Armenia with the outside world), the republic was in principle able to maintain the gross national product practically at the former level. While having less resources in 1993 by a factor of four and producing less electric power by a factor of three, Armenian enterprises were able to provide more than 90 percent of the production of the 1992 level. In addition, in Bagratyan's opinion, it is a positive fact that a steady growth trend was observed in the course of the whole year--production seemed to be adjusting itself more and more to the conditions that were developing. This also became the reason for a phenomenon that was rather unexpected for many: According to the year's results, Armenia looks even better than the average for the CIS. In the words of the premier, galloping inflation was successfully reined in, and this slowed down somewhat what started to be a rapid drop in the standard of living of the people, as well as in the exchange rate of the national currency. Bagratyan is convinced that it was necessary from the very beginning to introduce not a fixed and firm rate of exchange of the dram, but a "floating" dram, which would have prevented the emergence of negative tendencies and would not have permitted the development of a shadow economy. In the words of the premier, it was precisely the correction of this error recently that made it possible to noticeably stabilize the dram, which today looks almost like a "super-hard currency," especially in comparison with the Georgian coupon or the Azerbaijani manat. The premier also assessed as positive the fact that Armenia had finally become a member of the international community of developing countries. In addition, he emphasized that in this regard it is not necessary to experience any negative emotions and that there should be no psychological bias against the term "developing states," since it was only recently that Israel and Singapore, whose economic potential needs no comment, were removed from the group of developing states. The most important problems that the premier mentioned as requiring resolution this year are the formation of the budget, perfection of tax policy, and stiffening of control over exports. As before, the situation is being influenced by the so-called Georgian problem, specifically, the delivery of commodities on the territory of the neighboring country. Just today, 5,000 tonnes of butter and 25,000 tonnes of rice belonging to Armenia were held up on the territory of Georgia. The usual difficulties with the delivery of grain arose, and the government is expending enormous forces and energy to ensure that purchased and already paid for foodstuffs are finally delivered to consumers. Moreover, Armenia today is forced to apply enormous efforts to ensure Georgia regularly receives its quota of gas. It is only this that makes it possible to hope that something will also get to Yerevan. There is no doubt that the war in Karabakh will continue to have a negative influence. "It is hoped," noted Grant Bagratyan, "that the complete failure of the winter campaign will be proof for Azerbaijan that it is impossible to solve the Karabakh problem through force." However, whatever is decided in Baku, whether to finally sit down at the negotiating table or to continue the war nevertheless, while at the same time counting on a war of resources--we are prepared for both variants in the development of events. To the question of how the premier assesses the fact that the present government may soon break the record for remaining in power, Bagratyan noted that there is still a full month before a record is achieved, and that hasty statements should not be made. The ministries were permitted to work for a relatively long period, but it is not worth envying them, inasmuch as the members of the government have exhausted themselves mentally and physically. "If it were up to me, I would send all of them on a vacation of about six months. The people have earned this," declared the premier. Responding to a question concerning the prospects for a renewal of the work of the Armenian AES [nuclear power station], Grant Bagratyan emphasized that the negotiations conducted on this score in Moscow were quite beneficial. And today the Armenian side does not see any obstacles now to signing an agreement on converting the AES into a joint Armenian-Russian enterprise. The signing of such an agreement can be expected in the very near future. Moreover, Armenia hopes that the decision being prepared by European structures regarding the problem of nuclear power engineering in the CIS countries will also be positive, and in such an event it will be possible to hope for the extension of credits on the part of West European states.
