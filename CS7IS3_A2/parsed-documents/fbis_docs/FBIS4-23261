"The safety of the UN troops is very high on the agenda," military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante said as the two went into talks. UN spokesman Abdul Kabia said one attempt had been made to deliver food in Kigali, which is under siege by Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), but the UN vehicle came under fire. "We do not know who shot at it," Kabia said, adding that nobody was hurt in the incident. All UN humanitarian operations, including the distribution of food, otherwise remained halted for the day, pending guarantees of safety from the warring parties, UN sources said. The UN mission in Rwanda suspended relief operations after a Senegalese army captain was killed Tuesday when a shell apparently fired at government army positions by the RPF exploded near his car. The United Nations had earlier Tuesday continued to evacuate hundreds of civilians caught up in the bloodshed to safer positions behind the lines respectively of the mainly Tutsi rebels and the Hutu majority government forces. UN officials refused to specify where Dallaire, a Canadian, and Kagame, were meeting on Wednesday, saying only that it was "somewhere in Rwanda". Up to 500,000 Rwandans are estimated to have been killed since the beginning of April, while half a million others have fled abroad. Hundreds of thousands of people are internally displaced. The Senegalese officer was the 12th UN soldier to lose his life in Rwanda.
