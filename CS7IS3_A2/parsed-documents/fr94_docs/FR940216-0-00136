FR940216-0-00136 FR940216-0-00010 The environmental benefits of the reformulated gasoline program depend on EPA's receipt of accurate and verifiable reports from regulated parties, and EPA's ability to review the data possessed by the regulated community that underlies the reports, or in the alternative, EPA's ability to seek civil, criminal and professional sanctions against domestic corporate officers and professionals engaged in maintaining records or submitting reports and audits to the U.S. government. However, in the case of foreign refineries, EPA does not have the authority for oversight of the record keeping and reporting process that is equivalent to EPA's authority over domestic refiners and possible sanctions are not equally available to ensure accurate reports by foreign parties. Again, EPA believes it unlikely that all foreign governments desiring to import reformulated or conventional gasoline to the U.S. would either consent or be able to provide adequate assurance of foreign reporters' amenability to EPA legal process. The integrity of the reformulated gasoline program is also affected by EPA's ability to verify the baseline that applies to each batch of gasoline produced domestically or imported. The baseline of a gasoline batch establishes the standard against which compliance for that batch will be measured. In the case of gasoline produced domestically, baselines are set at the refinery; any gasoline produced at a refinery and intended for the domestic market is subject to that refinery's baseline. As a result, tracking of gasoline to its refinery-of-origin is not necessary in the case of domestically-produced gasoline. If foreign refinery-specific baselines were applied to imported gasolines, however, it would be necessary to identify the refinery-of-origin for all imported gasoline. This type of identification often would be very difficult or impossible. At the time gasoline arrives by ship at a U.S. port of entry, the gasoline has no inherent quality that would identify either the refinery at which the gasoline was produced or the baseline that properly applies to the gasoline. The only mechanism available for correlating any imported gasoline with the refinery-of-origin is the paperwork that accompanies the gasoline. EPA's ability to verify the accuracy of such paperwork is extremely limited. Gasoline produced by a foreign refinery may trade hands or be intermixed with other product several times before entering the United States. EPA lacks the ability to accurately and readily determine the refinery-of-origin based solely on the documentation of fuel transactions and shipments through myriad distribution parties and routes outside the United States. If foreign refinery baselines were allowed, EPA would have no recourse other than to rely on the import paperwork that is supplied by the importer for purposes of identifying the baseline applicable for imported gasoline. EPA would have little or no means of detecting, documenting, or proving any cheating in the form of misstating the refinery-of-origin and thereby the applicable baseline for imported gasoline. EPA would therefore lack the ability to monitor the compliance of foreign refineries with individual baselines. Accordingly, EPA has determined to abide by its proposal to focus regulation of foreign gasoline on domestic importers of product over which EPA does enjoy enforcement jurisdiction. Domestic refiners and importers are subject to unannounced compliance inspections by EPA. Foreign refiners, by virtue of their sovereign protected status, are not equally subject to unannounced inspections. Again, the environmental and public health benefits arising from an austere compliance monitoring program are not as readily available with respect to foreign refiners. Domestic refiners and importers are subject to a panoply of enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with the Clean Air Act. EPA may seek civil or criminal penalties or injunctive relief within the U.S. judicial system and be assured that judgments will be enforced. Judicial remedies are essential to EPA's enforcement of a regulatory program in which significant economic incentives exist to produce non-complying product. However, U.S. judicial jurisdiction may not fully and easily extend to foreign refiners. EPA's ability to exercise enforcement measures against foreign refiners is uncertain, at best. For example, in an EPA motor vehicle recall administrative action against a foreign automobile manufacturer, the manufacturer argued EPA lacked jurisdiction and refused to accept service or comply with administrative discovery requirements in a manner that would not be possible by a domestic automobile manufacturer. Accordingly, EPA has determined to focus its regulatory authority on domestic importers of foreign gasoline which are amenable to U.S. legal process. In summary, EPA has considered all proposed baseline-setting alternatives for foreign gasolines to the final rule and has determined that the rule issued today is necessary to protect the quality of U.S. air and public health. Further, the baseline setting scheme promulgated today is the least restrictive scheme available to ensure that the goals of the Clean Air Act are achieved. EPA is aware that the baseline approach adopted today for foreign refiners is the result of EPA's concerns over a variety of technical and enforcement issues related to the importation of gasoline.
