On Wednesday [2 February], the Federal Council gave this coordination task to a body which has existed since 1989 -- the Interdepartmental Committee for European Integration. This committee is jointly chaired by Secretaries of State Kellenberger (foreign affairs) and Franz Blankart (foreign economic affairs). In matters of bilateral negotiations, Mr. Kellenberger will be given the power to decide. No other name was being discussed, Vice Chancellor Achille Casanova said in reply to a question. In reply to another question, Mr. Kellenberger said that it would be entirely possible for him to take on this task in addition to his work as head of the political department of the DFAE (Federal Department of Foreign Affairs). Moreover, he plans to rely on the Office for Integration, which remains and which will prepare the mandates for negotiations. In cases of disagreement within the committee, Mr. Kellenberger will be able to decide. But he will also be able to submit the matter to the Federal Council through his two direct heads, Mr. Delamuraz and Mr. Cotti. The Federal Department of Public Economy will conduct bilateral negotiations in the economic sphere. In this connection, Secretary of State Blankart will regularly consult the Consultative Commission for Foreign Economic Policy and the Commission of Customs Experts. With regard to the strategy for negotiation with the EU, the Federal Council will inform and consult the foreign policy commissions of the two houses, as a new article of the law on relations between the councils stipulates. Created in 1989, the Interdepartmental Committee meets at least once every three months. It will continue its work of analyzing relations between Switzerland and Europe. For this general mandate, it will continue to be chaired by Mr. Kellenberger and Mr. Blankart in turn.
