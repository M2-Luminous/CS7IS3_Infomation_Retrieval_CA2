The report quotes New Majority-Change 90 lawmaker Ricardo Marcenaro Frers as saying: "Peru will receive the largest amount in Latin America, and this shows that the United States recognizes the Peruvian Government's efforts to move forward and reverse, in only three years, the crisis we were experiencing." The report then quotes PPC, Popular Christian Party, lawmaker Mario Ocharan as saying that the U.S. decision was made because Peru "is putting its economy in order." Finally, PPC lawmaker Alexander Kouri says the U.S. decision is very positive for Peru because the country received the largest amount in all of Latin America. In its 12 March issue, the same newspaper carries on page A6 a 500-word editorial entitled "Support for the Peruvian Government and People" on the same subject. After reporting the aid announced for Peru by the U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, Alexander Watson, the editorial says: "If we go by Watson's statement, this is not only an economic benefit that will certainly be decisive in the antinarcotics effort and the fight against poverty, but also a clear expression of political support for the Peruvian people and government. The visit to Peru by the commission headed by Alexander Watson himself has served to make the real Peruvian situation known to the higher U.S. decisionmaking levels." After elaborating on the results of the U.S. mission's visit, the editorial concludes: "Therefore, we welcome the scheduled aid, but above all, we welcome the example of democracy and effort by the Peruvian people, the majority of whom support their government."
