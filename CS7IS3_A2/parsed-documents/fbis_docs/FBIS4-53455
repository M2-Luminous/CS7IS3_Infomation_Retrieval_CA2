FBIS4-53455 "dreas097_a_94025" FBIS-EAS-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Murayama on SDPJ's Policy on Diet, Coalition Ties Murayama on SDPJ's Policy on Diet, Coalition Ties OW1805121294 OW1805121294 BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Newstar Television Network in Japanese at 1145 GMT on 8 May carries, during its weekly "Sunday Project" program, a 20-minute live interview with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), by freelance commentator Soichiro Tahara. Murayama is at the "ABC Studio" in Osaka. "Insider" magazine chief editor Hajime Takano and Kyoto University Professor Masaaki Kosaka also interview Murayama. At 1145 GMT, Tahara asks Murayama about Justice Minister Nagano's resignation over his remarks on the 1937 Nanjing massacre. Murayama says: "This is a matter of course." He adds: "We cannot say the prime minister has no responsibility for the confusion caused by Nagano's remarks. In that sense, we would like to ask the prime minister about his stance on the issue." Asked about cooperation with Hata's coalition government, Murayama says he has the impression that the Hata administration is taking a different view from the Hosokawa administration, noting recent remarks by ministers of the Hata cabinet. He says: "If the Hata administration promotes the reform line which it took over from the Hosokawa administration, we will cooperate with them on some issues. However, if the nature of the administration changes, then our position may be different." Asked about SDPJ's stance as an opposition party, Murayama says his party needs to take the initiative in developing the political situation and promoting reforms to meet public expectations. Tahara asks whether the SDPJ will be bound in the future by agreements reached among the previous coalition parties on the eve of the formation of the Hata cabinet. Murayama replies: "We should fulfill our engagements with the people. However, since these agreements were reached during the tenure of the coalition administration, we will not be bound by them regarding our former position as a ruling coalition party. From this viewpoint, the SDPJ will take its own stance on the issue." Discussing the tax issue, Murayama says that the consumption tax should be abolished and the issue of indirect taxes should be newly discussed in the process of tax reform. At 1157 GMT, Takano asks Murayama about cooperation with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). In reply, Murayama says: "At the present, we have no ideas regarding the formation of an LDP-SDPJ alliance." He also rules out the possibility of the SDPJ returning to the coalition at present. Tahara asks: "With what kind of LDP can the SDPJ cooperate?" Murayama replies: "The LDP needs to sweep away its corrupt structure; to cut off the comfortable ties existing between politicians, bureaucrats, and businessmen; and to pursue politics in a democratic manner from now on." He also notes the need for discussions with the LDP regarding its views on the Constitution and what the state ought to be like. Asked about the next general election, Murayama says: "I think the next election should be held under the new election system. However, if the administration's policies come to a deadlock and there is no choice but to dissolve the House of Representatives, elections under the current system will be inevitable." He says: "Because the draft budget was drawn up with our cooperation, we will cooperate with the coalition in passing the budget through the Diet. However, we will form free and unbiased policies on other issues." At 1203 GMT, Kosaka asks for Murayama's opinion on what the latter believes the important issues in reform are. In addition to political reform, Murayama cites measures to prevent political corruption and the reform of Diet functions. Takano questions the Hata administration on its stance regarding the right to collective self-defense. Murayama says: "We would like to firmly question the Hata administration on its stance regarding this issue and the Constitution at an interpellation at the Diet session." Tahara asks Murayama: "What do you think of the remarks by Foreign Minister Kakizawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai that an appropriate legislative measure should be taken in connection with North Korea's (DPRK) suspected nuclear weapons development?" In reply, Murayama stresses that it is inappropriate to create a situation in which North Korea is forced into isolation from the international community. He adds: "All countries concerned need to help persuade North Korea on the nuclear issue. It is important for concerned countries to make efforts to see to it that dialogue between North Korea and the United States is smoothly put back on the right track. I think the Japanese Government should stick to its stance of seeking a solution through dialogue." Finally, Tahara asks Murayama whether the SDPJ intends to form a parliamentary group to confront the group "Kaishin," which has led to the SDPJ's secession from the coalition. Murayama replies: "We have no such idea at present. However, we would like to closely cooperate with Sakigake and other forces which hold views similar to our own."
