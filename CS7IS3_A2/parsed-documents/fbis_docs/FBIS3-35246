Addressing the Human Rights Commission in Geneva yesterday, he said that the Indian occupation forces are resorting to the most brutal means to crush the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people for their right to self-determination. He said that the Indian forces during the last four years have badly trampled the basic rights of the Kashmiri people. Dr. al-Ghabid said that the continuous curfew in occupied Kashmir has crippled the people's life. He said that the ICO at its summit and foreign minister-level conferences has repeatedly appealed to peacefully resolve the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN resolutions. The leader of the Pakistani delegation at the Human Rights Commission, which is meeting in Geneva, has said that Pakistan has made persistent efforts to hold purposeful talks with India on the Kashmir issue, but India never responded positively to the Pakistani proposals to resolve the Jammu and Kashmir problem. He said this while addressing the ICO meeting in Geneva yesterday which reviewed the draft resolution on the Jammu and Kashmir issue. The meeting was held after the the ICO secretary general's address to the Human Rights Commission. He said that Pakistan wants a resolution which calls for sending a fact-finding mission to occupied Jammu and Kashmir to assess the grave situation there. The Islamic countries' ambassadors expressed serious concern over the serious violation of human rights in the occupied Kashmir. They noted that although a number of resolutions were adopted at the ICO ministerial and summit meetings, but there was no improvement in the situation. The ambassadors lauded Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto's address to the Human Rights Commission.
