Nazarbayev's speech at Columbia University, in which he set forth Kazakhstan's stand on problems of the world order, development and democracy, became the feature event of the day. He stressed that Kazakhstan, like any other young state, seeks to protect its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, to create conditions for the formation of a market-based economy, the strengthening of democratic institutions and the maintenance of harmonious inter-ethnic relations, and to ensure national security. Speaking about Kazakhstan's foreign policy, Nazarbayev pointed out that its priority goal is the creation of a zone of confidence and good neighbourly relations along the whole parameter of its borders. "I have always been and continue to be an advocate of historically formed relations of friendship, cooperation and mutual understanding on the whole territory of the former USSR republics and I have consistently supported the idea of economic integration of the CIS member states," Nazarbayev said. So far as Kazakh-American relations are concerned, their essence is reflected in the charter on democratic partnership, signed in Washington, the Kazakh president continued. He said the Clinton administration was actively encouraging large-scale American private investments in the Kazakh economy. The U.S. Asian society gave a reception for the Kazakh president on Wednesday night. Today Nazarbayev flies home to Almaty via Paris, where he is planning to meet French President Francois Mitterrand.
