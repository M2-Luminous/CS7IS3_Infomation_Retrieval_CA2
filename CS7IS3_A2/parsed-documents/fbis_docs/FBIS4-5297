Because most companies are cutting their investment in equipment, the ratio of foreign-made products will drastically increase this fiscal year. The Tokyo Electric Power Company is planning to spend 59 billion yen to purchase foreign-made goods, and this amount is almost 200 percent higher than that spent on this sector in 1993. Also, the Chubu Electric Power Company, which spent 20.9 billion yen in purchasing foreign-made equipment in 1993, intends to spend an additional 5-10 billion yen on equipment in 1994. These decisions are partly because of the companies' intention to cooperate in easing trade frictions, but their primary objective is to lower investment costs through purchasing cost-effective foreign products. Last February, the Tokyo Electric Power Company invited foreign companies to place bids to supply a generating turbine for the Yukawa hydraulic power plant (in Nagano Prefecture). The company intends to increase its purchases of larger general-purpose equipment from foreign companies. Moreover, the core parts of nuclear reactors and gas turbine generators -- for constructing the No. 6 and 7 reactors of the Kashiwazaki-Kariba nuclear power plant (in Niigata Prefecture) and the No. 7 and 8 generators of the Yokohama thermal power plant--will be imported. The parts will be purchased from the United States because General Electric (GE) possesses advanced technology in these fields. The Chubu Electric Power Company will also purchase GE-made gas turbine generators for the No. 3 generator of the Kawagoe thermal power plant. Other electric power companies intend to increase their imports of general-purpose goods such as optical fiber cables, transformers, and power-transmission wires because these products are expensive in Japan.
