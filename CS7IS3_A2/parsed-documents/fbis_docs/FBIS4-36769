[Al-'Anani] The climate now is far better that it was a year or two ago, especially compared with what it was like following the Gulf war. We think Jordanian-American relations will develop so as to clearly advance Jordanian interests. We would like the United States to become convinced that our political positions have sometimes been misrepresented and our demands distorted. We hope the Americans will also appreciate that Jordan -- which sets store by its independence, unity, national pride, people, and, above all, its leadership -- is qualified to engage such a great power as the United States in a dialogue that ensures the dignity of all sides. This is because we are aware that the United States is now the major player on the global scene and that it wields influence in many of the areas that also affect us. An improved political atmosphere between our two countries will impact Jordan positively.
