The decision implemented a new Customs interpretation of section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1304). Under the decision, packages of imported frozen produce will be required to be marked with their country of origin on the front side of the packaging in specified types and styles. However, the decision's section entitled: ``Previous Decisions Affected'' should have made clear that HQ 735085 (June 4, 1993) was being modified accordingly.
