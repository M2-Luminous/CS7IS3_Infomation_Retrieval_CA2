FR941219-2-00023 FR941219-2-00017 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No. RP95&hyph;33&hyph;001] Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company; Notice of Compliance Tariff Filing December 13, 1994. Take notice that on December 9, 1994, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company (Williston Basin), tendered for filing in response to the November 30, 1994, Letter Order issued in the above-referenced docket, Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 243 to Second Revised Volume No. 1 of its FERC Gas Tariff. Williston Basin states that in the November 30 Letter Order, the Commission rejected Williston Basin's proposed deletion of certain language in First Revised Sheet No. 243. Williston Basin states that on the apparent assumption that the only change contained in First Revised Sheet No. 243 was the deletion of that language, the Letter Order rejected the entirety of the sheet. However, it states, that sheet also contained changes that were necessitated by the changes made to the tariff sheets that were accepted by the Letter Order. Williston Basin states that it is resubmitting the tariff sheet in question with the previously stricken language included along with the changes necessary to conform Sheet No. 243 with the accepted tariff sheets. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before December 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
