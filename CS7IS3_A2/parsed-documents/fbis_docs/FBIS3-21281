Both have set up their official lines. They hope that Arjun Singh will not dissect those. Arjun Singh had told a legislator who is angry at the Digvijay Singh cabinet that Digvijay Singh was not obeying him. Still, if he has to choose between this legislator and the chief minister, he will have to pick the chief minister. This legislator is the same as that had helped Arjun Singh openly in his anti-Rao campaign. Digvijay Singh is concerned with freeing his image from Arjun Singh's shadow. However, this freedom cannot fit in Arjun Singh's politics. Therefore, we can assume there are many possibilities and concerns embedded in this separate stand. On the other end, Madhav Rao Scindia's close associates maintain that all this a staged drama and deep down in his heart Digvijay Singh is still with Arjun Singh. Not only the nominations of his cabinet members but also their appointments to different departments were decided by Arjun Singh. They give the example of Scindia-supporter Mahender Singh in support of this argument. It is said that Digvijay Singh had promised him the position of minister of industries, however, later gave him the education portfolio. The industries department went to Arjun Singh's brother-in-law Rajender Singh. The chief minister reportedly told Mahender Singh that Arjun Singh wanted an able minister in education department so that this department works according to his wishes. The directors of the new equation in the cabinet say that Rajender Singh has access to Arjun Singh. They should have further asked why did Arjun Singh make such a close relative a minister. Those who are legislators now can become ministers. They have to keep in mind who supported whom in the past. Both Digvijay Singh and Kamal Nath were also with Arjun Singh. Digvijay Singh's appointment as chief minister had affected Madhav Rao Scindia most. Digvijay Singh and Mr. Scindia are from the same region--Gwalior-Chambal. Close associates of Kamal Nath say that Mr. Scindia had told Kamal Nath that either he should become the chief minister or endorse him (Scindia). Later Kamal Nath was told that only Digvijay Singh would be appointed as the chief minister. Mr. Scindia had the Punjab government airplane waiting for him. However, the opportunity for him to go to Bhopal never came. The supporters of this mother-son due say that while they both--Vijyaraje Scindia and Madhav Rao Scindia--may appear to oppose each other, they care for each other's political interests. Mrs. Scindia, while she was living in Gwalior, did not address even one public meeting during the vidhan sabha elections. However, she visited Digvijay Singh's constituency several times. Anyhow, Madhav Rao Scindia, instead of becoming uneasy by this development, is considering it an act of fate at this time. The supporters of Arjun Singh's "theory about backward groups" see Madhav Rao Scindia clearly covered under it. They say that Mr. Scindia would be considered belonging to a backward group according to Madhya Pradesh criteria. Arjun Singh had floated Mr. Scindia's name before he used Subhas Yadav's name for chief minister's position. Mr. Digvijay Singh himself does not hesitate expressing his disagreement over this backward theory' with Arjun Singh. In an answer to a JANSATTA correspondent's question while returning from Chandamota to Bhopal, he had said that a lot had been written about his relationship with Arjun Singh. "Arjun Singh and I think alike. We both have the same ideas about the problems in Madhya Pradesh. We have worked in politics together for 16 years because of the similarity of our ideas, and not because of our personal relations. However, I do not agree with his comment that only a member of scheduled castes, aborigines, backward classes, and minorities can serve those groups. Mahatma Gandhi did not belong to any of these groups, however, he served these groups more than anyone else." Mr. Digvijay Singh says that these groups need social justice. It is important to win their trust to take strict action if they are subjected to unfair treatment. He is also keeping in mind why the legislators belonging to scheduled castes, aborigines, and the backward groups elected him the chief minister even though they all were consulted individually. He was asked why had he mentioned Kamal Nath's name in the context of his being elected chief minister, but had never mentioned Arjun Singh's name. Digvijay Singh asked, "What is the purpose of mentioning Arjun Singh's name in Chhindwara?" When asked if it was true that Scindia was upset with the cabinet, he replied, "He has been very cooperative." We asked him, "Before becoming the chief minister, you had said that the prime minister should apologize to the Muslims." Digvijay Singh's reply after becoming the chief minister was, "That is in the past. It is not necessary to repeat it now. The prime minister has already expressed his regret." Digvijay Singh does understand the difference between regret' and apology.' Digvijay Singh explained his policy over the communalism issue. "I have told the police and administrative officials not to hire any person who has any connection with a communal group or is involved in communal activities to any government committee. The social positions of such persons is enhanced if they are allowed to associate with high-level government officials. Additionally, we ignore secular persons this way." When asked if the government officers would not cause problems by labeling a person of being communalist, he replied, "Sometime, little rocks are also ground with the wheat. We just cannot avoid it." Madhya Pradesh' chief minister, Digvijay Singh, has already established his priorities. He wants to hold elections of local governments and panchayats before June. After that, he will appoint a 90-member legislative commission. He says about it that all orders will be issued through the cabinet members. At present, he wants to expand or revise his cabinet appointments. One of his priority is to supply kerosene oil in villages at controlled rates. When he had asked the villagers in his meetings about the price of kerosene oil, he was told they bought it at 7 to 9 rupees per liter. He also said that patwaris and gardawars [civil servants] will go to villages to process land sale and transfer documents. The villagers have told him in one of his meetings that they have to pay as much as 1,000 rupees in bribes for preparing transfer documents. He had called Ashok Awasthi, then-tehsildar of Machagora, to the stage and asked him to explain himself. He sent him back and told him to straighten out the situation within three months or he will have to straighten him out himself. The chief minister said about these announcements that these will not burden the state treasury; just have to make the system more effective. He has announced opening a 30-bed hospital in each development district and providing free electricity for an engine of up to five horsepower to every farmer before 1 February. Both these promises are included in the Congress (I) election brochure. Mr. Suresh Pichauri, the state Congress (I) general secretary, replied to a JANSATTA question, "We had discussed the financial aspects of this plan after meeting three times before we included it in our state brochure." He made an important announcement in Pandhurna about appointing public commissions at district levels. He has made the announcement to make a survey of unemployed educated young people and offer either a job or unemployment benefits to those with family income of less than 6,000 rupees. The people have become more hopeful with these attractive announcements. He understands also the political results if these hopes are not fulfilled. Since he was appointed the chief minister only five weeks ago, only the future will tell how these promises are kept. The chief minister announced in Machagiri, "Kamal Nath and I will make surprise visits to one or the other village without telling the officials and take action against those who are making problems." This shows his desire to continue his association with Kamal Nath. His cabinet members know the meanings of these announcements. When the chief minister himself recognizes him as the king-maker, why should the minister hesitate in praising them falsely and opening up the government coffers for them? That was apparent during their two-day trip. However, behind political friendships, there are fears about political enmity also.
