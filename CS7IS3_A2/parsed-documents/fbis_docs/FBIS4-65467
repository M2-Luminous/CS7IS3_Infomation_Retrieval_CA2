He has just sent Rocco Buttiglione [Italian Popular Party, PPI] a letter expressing concurrence as regards strategy for the next few years: "All we have to do is follow through what we have already been doing." The overtures to "the pope's philosopher" come on the eve of a conference announced by the secessionists from the Pact (Michelini, the newly appointed Minister Tremonti, and former magistrate Stajano), who also share Buttiglione's position. They were also preceded by a heartfelt appeal the day before from Gerardo Bianco, who called for a joining of forces with Segni, starting with the European election campaign. [Inwinkl] What is your reply to the former DC [Christian Democratic Party] floor leader? [Segni] I should like to point out that I founded the Pact as a liberal-democratic group providing an alternative to the Left: An tolerant platform in the European mold against the dominant Catholic-communist culture. I repeat that we were not born to form the Center: We were born to oppose [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Occhetto. [Inwinkl] In that case, your reply to Bianco is negative. [Segni] I have to turn Gerardo down. Our alliance with the PPI harmed us in the general election. They still have pieces of the old regime in their ranks. This has once again proved to be the case in Sardinia in the last few days, preventing us from drawing up joint lists for the 12 June regional elections. The party is being pushed in different directions: There are those who want to join up with Berlusconi and those who are looking leftward. The price of these contradictions will be schism. We have already given enough. [Inwinkl] Will you go into opposition on your own? [Segni] Joining up with the PPI would mean laying more gifts in Berlusconi's lap. It would be the same if I made a deal with the PDS. This assessment, moreover, is confirmed in a recent interview that [PDS Deputy Secretary] Massimo D'Alema granted LA VOCE. Berlusconi has already had enough presents. Make no mistake about it, we are not an opposition on the left of the new government. We lay claim to the liberal-democratic values and policies that are not to be found in the forces that won the election. [Inwinkl] But the polls failed to support you. [Segni] We did not give the country the feeling that we represented something new. People believed in Berlusconi. Well, we must now compete with him, prove that we have greater credibility and consistency than the Freedom Alliance. As I have said, we are being placed at the center of the political spectrum merely because that is how we are seen, not because this is the image that we wish to project. Indeed, it is because we are not a centrist body that, knowing its liberalist tendencies, we sought a deal with the League. [Inwinkl] The overture failed. What do you think of [Northern League Secretary] Bossi now? [Segni] If Bossi had not nipped that deal in the bud, Berlusconi would not have entered the fray, and we should not now have Fini's ministers to contend with, as even a number of left-wing journalists have acknowledged over the last few days. Bossi chose another ally, and now he risks being eaten alive, even though he has scored a success in the formation of the government, with Maroni at the Viminale. But it is only a tactical victory. [Inwinkl] So let us talk about the government. What is your assessment? [Segni] I was the only one who questioned the appointment of the owner of Fininvest. In this connection, I believe the PDS was wrong not to take a strong line on this matter with Scalfaro. The lineup that has now been fielded confirms our worst fears: Berlusconi's employees and the exponents of neofascism. But apart from all this, there is another factor that has surprised me. [Inwinkl] What is that? [Segni] What I would call Berlusconi's "dorotheization" [referring to a former Christian Democratic faction]. From a man like him, I did not expect the long negotiations, the reinstatement of the Cencelli manual [power-sharing system], the recycling of notables from the First Republic, all in all, an immediate adaptation to the rituals and figures of the old system. [Inwinkl] Gerardo Bianco criticizes you for your decision to head the lists of candidates for the European elections in all five constituencies. He calls it "Gaullism on a rather modest, rather comical scale." What do you say to that? [Segni] Bianco is making friendly criticism. I took this step to give the lists a distinguishing political mark once Berlusconi and Fini had done the same thing. [Inwinkl] Deputy Segni, once you were running for prime minister, and now you find yourself almost alone in parliament. Other promoters of the referendum movement, which changed the rules and course of Italian politics, have ended up in the shadows, from Barbera to Scoppola. Does this merely confirm the adage that every revolution devours its own children? [Segni] It does not surprise me. The fact of the matter is that we are still in a confused stage of transition from the First Republic to the Second. When things have settled down, a new governing class will emerge. I hope and believe that we shall see those who contributed to victory in the referenda entering the fray once more, even though they will not be on my side: Anyway, that was a cross-party movement. [Inwinkl] Do you have any more referendum initiatives in mind? [Segni] First of all, I shall sign and give my support to the motion in favor of a referendum against the Mammi Law [on media monopolies].
