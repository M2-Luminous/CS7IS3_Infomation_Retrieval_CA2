This is in spite of IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's warning that the elections will lead to the destruction of the Zulu nation and his repeated calls for them to be postponed. Released on Wednesday, the survey by Data Research Africa Ltd and the Human Sciences Research Council [HSRC] in February, showed 52.1 per cent of IFP respondents said they disapproved of an elections boycott, and 54 per cent said they would "definitely vote". "Only one IFP voter in 14 was adamant they would not vote," said the survey conducted among 2,601 respondents of whom 389 were white, 500 Indian, 100 coloured and 1603 black. "We took particularly painstaking efforts to achieve a proper rural representation," said the researchers. On party choice, the survey showed 44.1 per cent of black respondents supported the African National Congress, and 21.3 per cent were behind the IFP. Among all races the ANC scored 36.7 per cent support, the IFP 18.1, the National Party 13.9, the Democratic Party 2.3 and the Freedom Front and Pan Africanist Congress 0.8. "Don't know" responses scored 10.5 per cent, followed by "won't say" 8.4 and "won't vote" 8.2. Perceptions of who was to blame for violence drew a 27 per cent response pointing to the IFP and 23.1 per cent blaming the ANC. Expectations of the post-election future followed earlier survey patterns with "general gloom among the non-African minorities contradicted by the euphoric views of the African majority". But, the surveyors noted: "The election in Natal is fraught with contradictions, ironies and sheer tragedy." "The situation is dominated by the IFP's electoral boycott. As recently as July 1992, an HSRC survey showed the IFP leading the ANC in Natal by 37 per cent to 23 per cent, but in only two years the IFP has slipped from this leadership position to a clear second place."
