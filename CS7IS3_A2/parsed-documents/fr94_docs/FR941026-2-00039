FR941026-2-00039 FR941026-2-00023 [OPP&hyph;00394; FRL&hyph;4917&hyph;1] Interim Policy for Particle Size and Limit Concentration Issues in Inhalation Toxicity Studies; Notice of Availability Agency: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Action: Notice of availability. Summary: EPA is making available to all interested parties, an Interim Policy for Particle Size and Limit Concentration Issues in Inhalation Toxicity Studies which deals with several of the most controversial issues encountered in inhalation toxicity studies. It offers recommendations regarding aerosol particle size, limit concentrations in acute studies, revised Toxicity Categories, inhalation chamber selection, and reporting of analytical concentrations for formulations. Dates: The Interim Policy is effective October 26, 1994. Addresses: Copies of the Interim Policy for Particle Size and Limit Concentration Issues in Inhalation Toxicity Studies , identified with the docket control number ``OPP&hyph;00394'' can be obtained by mail from: Public Docket and Freedom of Information Section, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Supplementary Information: Toxicity Guidelines for inhalation studies were issued in 1982. Since then, numerous inadequacies have been identified, particularly with regards to aerosol particle size and limit concentration requirements. In 1991, EPA's Health Effects Division (HED) requested public comments on its Inhalation Guidelines. These critiques, combined with numerous interviews with inhalation toxicologists, demonstrated these issues to be universal concerns. HED evaluated the state of the science with particular emphasis on the physical and biological realities of performing inhalation toxicity studies. The results of this investigation led to an Interim Policy which considers four major areas of controversy: 1. Particle size requirements for aerosol products. 2. Limit concentration for aerosols, gases, and vapors in acute studies, and revised Toxicity Categories. 3. Selection of appropriate inhalation chambers. 4. Reporting of analytical concentration for formulations. The Interim Policy was presented to a Science Advisory Panel on December 15, 1993, for comment. The Final Report of the Joint FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel and Science Advisory Board Meeting states that, ``The Panel concurs with the Agency's recommendations and further that these guideline revisions reflect the current state-of-the-art for inhalation toxicity tests which are consistent with aerosol toxicology.'' Rather than waiting for a comprehensive revision of the inhalation guidelines, EPA has chosen to disseminate the Interim Policy at this time because its recommendations have significant impact on the performance of studies and regulation of pesticide products.
