FR941110-2-00028 FR941110-2-00009 Comments Regarding COP and CV Comment 27: Timken argues that NSK reported interest expenses for COP net of interest income, but NSK did not demonstrate that this income stemmed solely from short-term deposits or normal operations. Timken contends that the Department should recalculate NSK's COP based on gross interest expenses, or in the alternative, recalculate the interest expense factor to exclude long-term interest income based on a supplementary cost response in which NSK segregated short-term and long-term interest revenue. NSK agrees with Timken's contention that the submitted COP figures incorrectly included an interest expense net of all interest income. NSK suggests that the Department should recalculate the interest expense factor based on the supplementary cost response figures. Department's Position: The interest-expense factor should reflect only short-term interest income attributable to the normal production of the merchandise within the scope of the order. We have reviewed NSK's data for this claimed adjustment and are satisfied that the firm attributed the reported interest income only to the production of merchandise within the scope of the order. We did not find evidence on the record to suggest that some portion of the claimed interest income is attributable to the production of other merchandise or associated with long-term deposits. Therefore, for these final results we have recalculated NSK's interest expenses based on a NSK's supplementary COP response, wherein NSK segregated short-term and long-term interest income. Comment 28: Timken argues that the Department's deduction from CV for home-market selling expenses is overstated for NSK. Timken contends that the Department calculated selling expenses by applying reported factors to CV to determine the amount of selling expenses to deduct from CV, which already includes selling expenses, rather than applying those factors to COP. NSK argues that CV is a proxy for price, and that since the selling expense factors reported were calculated as a percentage of total sales, these factors are correctly applied to CV. Department's Position: We agree with Timken in part. To avoid overstating the home-market selling expense adjustments, and given that we have the home-market unit prices, we have applied the reported selling expense factors, expressed as a percentage of unit price, to obtain a yen amount for the expense. We then deducted the resulting amounts from CV.
