Strangely enough, this is not because it is no longer necessary, but because it is so necessary that it has become unsustainable. Researcher Dario Machado Rodriguez, director of the Center for Social, Political, and Public Opinion Studies [Centro de Estudios Sociopoliticos y de Opinion] told EL SOL DE MEXICO that surveys and studies carried out among the population show, among other things, that products should no longer be subsidized by maintaining the so-called ration book. Consensus indicates, however, that subsidies should be granted to people or families with lower incomes or experiencing a particularly difficult social situation. "It is my opinion that the general subsidy offered by the ration book should gradually disappear. ``At the same time, salary policies should change. I believe it is essential for these measures to include a wage reevaluation, from which to establish some sort of differentiation system. But this must be accomplished gradually, not in one single blow.'' Machado pointed out the contradiction "between the policy of egalitarianism implemented by the revolutionary process and the inevitable nonegalitarian solution" to solve the crisis. He explained that this is a basic problem that has been examined during the meetings of the Parliaments in the Workplace. According to the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), there have been about 80,000 such meetings. He added that "the meetings allow us to better understand the crudeness of the possible solutions and the realistic approach the situation requires, in addition," he stressed, "the will to apply these solutions gradually and not as a shock treatment." Machado, a 1977 political science graduate, has worked as the Center's director for eight years. As a leading researcher, he specializes in social issues. He said the people have stayed abreast of the situation, especially since the discussions at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba last year and later at the National Assembly of the People's Government. "Our investigations show that the meetings in the workplace have created an interest that has been increasing ever since their inception. The debate itself, the goal of which is to collect ideas, has generated enthusiasm and reaffirmed the people's trust in their right to participate in the consensus building process. In addition, I believe it has allowed people to express their expectations regarding economic measures, which billowed after the first measures were announced in June 1993." Machado pointed out that two months after the possession of dollars was deregulated, the expectation was that the situation would improve. Self-employment had an 82 percent approval rating, while 73 percent of those polled said that it would create new jobs and 72 percent believed that it would help reduce excess currency by establishing taxes on income. About 58 percent of those interviewed said that cooperative production revenues are a good short-term initiative, while 73 percent said the basic production units would increase food supplies and 80 percent believe they would help attract people to work permanently in agriculture. "Other studies indicate that basic achievements in education, health, and social security should not be affected because no one should be left out in the cold. As a rule, however, there should be no other similar egalitarian distribution." With the exception of these three basic guarantees, the socialist principle that preaches "to each according to his ability and to each according to his work should apply," he said, "because there is no other way of offering sufficient incentive to get people to produce. It is, therefore, essential to structure an economic system to guarantee equal pay for equal work." Official sources admit that since the crisis worsened, egalitarianism -- the highest expression of which is the ration book -- has increased absenteeism and the lack of motivation in the workplace.
