Estonia, in particular, is interested what conclusion Yeltsin and Clinton will reach on the issue of the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia. As a more general issue, it is important for Estonia what position the United States takes with respect to Russia's foreign policy. Malk reminded how several countries neighboring Russia had painfully reacted when Russia announced the concept of so-called near abroad in its foreign policy. He said it was now extremely important whether or not the U.S. president was going to raise the issue at all and if the president was also to voice his position on the issue. If Russia's foreign political course is aimed toward taking part in strengthening the European security and communicating with its neighbors according to democratic principles, the Moscow summit may give a new impact to the implementation of NATO's "Partnership for Peace" plan, Malk said. "But if Russia takes the attitude that she has quite different rights and that she has the right to prescribe certain actions to others -- in their relations with NATO, for instance -- then things are naturally quite different," Malk said.
