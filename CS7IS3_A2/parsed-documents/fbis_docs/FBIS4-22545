[Pynzenyk] Speaking frankly, these sorts of attacks have always been made against me in Parliament. But no matter how strange it is, the directors who once did not understand and did not have any concept, support me today, for example in the question of free conversion. At first, some leaders decided in this way to remove hard currency. Life showed that it did not. Then it began to be removed, when their director-colleagues in the government introduced a fixed rate, against which I, a "theoretical economist," spoke. Perhaps it will again seem to some that I theorize too much. Today when it is said to me that the army is on hunger rations, I can easily show that it is not a problem of the army but a problem of the budget policy in general. If, let us say, the budget is made up of income from production, then first of all it has to turn to where there is no production. There is also no formation of income. Thus, it has to go to science, education, culture, art, public health, and defense, and to support the poor. But if we give this money from the budget back to production, and then what is left to the army, we will always be in a pitiable situation. So it turns out that it is not only a problem of the army but of the state's budget policy in general. There is significantly less deducted for the army in the budget for this year, than some budget loans to certain commercial and government structures, which do not have to take part in the distribution of the budget. [Tarchynets] It would be desirable to know why this is happening. [Pynzenyk] I think this is a misunderstanding. The basic incompetence of people, who "grew up" in the old system, when the government took care of everything. Production above all. When it took everything and did everything. And it wishes to continue doing this for the future. I do not say that it is necessary to give the army as much as it wants. But there must not be a situation in which officers and soldiers are not paid their wages for December and January, and in which our army, in a fundamental way, cannot realize its military preparedness. We are not so poor that these structures, this system, cannot be financed. It is enough, let us say, to remove from the budget just one section which is not needed there--and we will have funds for the army and for other budget areas. [Tarchynets] It is understood that the army does not live only on wages. Its vital activity and combat readiness is a complex matter. So plans for military preparedness should also be well supported. Our Armed Forces have to have modern arms. [Pynzenyk] Today, we will not reach the level at which we once had a military-industrial complex. But 40 percent of the economy of Ukraine was connected with the military-industrial complex! Now certain defense enterprises are being converted. But it is not entirely a good thing, when, for example, a plant which made powerful rockets begins to produce saucepans... [Tarchynets] Recently, an effective phrase by Shaposhnikov, the former Minister of Defense of the former Soviet Union, spread in the Russian press, that soon Ukraine's aviation will become a great winged museum on the ground... [Pynzenyk] In fact, we proposed some ways to resolve this problem. For example, today we have many aircraft that are "grounded." We do not even need them. There were buyers for them. It was necessary to sell them and buy some other arms, which we lack for the military preparedness of our army. Everyone trades in arms. Ordinarily, the trade is made following international norms. There are several structures where it is necessary not to begrudge pennies. It is necessary not to begrudge paying customs officials, energy structures, and tax inspectorates, because they are the support for normal economic restructuring. If we begrudge paying a customs official, he will look for illegal earnings or, more precisely, bribes. Whoever begrudges paying his own army is nourishing a foreign army. [Tarchynets] I agree with you. And now I am expressing, perhaps, the wishes of the wide circle of future voters. All are interested in learning about the basic directions of your economic program. What do you, as an experienced professional and parliamentarian, wish to do, and are able to do, to improve the life of the people? [Pynzenyk] Our state can become unique. I believe that Ukraine could begin its rebirth from the point that people could begin to live better. This would be different from the other states which came out of the crisis. For example, Poland began reforms right away, and things got worse. For us, things got worse without reforms. Thus, the first serious steps could provide the first improvements. These steps require a month or two. I will explain how this can be achieved. Today in Ukraine, a very major shadow redistribution of incomes is taking place. The incomes of the majority remain in the hands of a very small group of people. All this is not the result of reforms, but the reverse--of blocking them, basically thanks to the insane putting of huge additional sums of money into circulation. Let us look at this real life example. Let us say that I wish to earn something today. This is very easy and, unfortunately, legal. I buy televisions for one billion, using a loan. Over a year, prices rise 60 times. In a year, I sell them for 60 billion. People buy them for 60 billion. And I return to the loaning agency one billion plus six billion in interest. The difference, 53 billion, goes into the pockets of individuals. It is very easy to stop this. One decision is made: the bank of Ukraine stops issuing money. Cash becomes cheaper only as a result of inflation. And when speculative processes in the intermediary area disappear, people will stop saying that it is, in general, necessary. There will not be insane profits. The problem of the depreciation of people's savings will also disappear. So that when I put cash in the bank, I will have to pay for this no less than what results from inflation. And I will not think about where to hide money since it will be more expensive tomorrow. I know that if I deposit it, in a month I will be able to buy more, not less. And the main thing is that the terrible shadow redistributions of incomes will stop. Another direction: if today the commercial sector is quickly transferred to private property, our people will only win. Why? I will explain. An item is bought, it stays in stock. And prices grow constantly. A question arises: who gets the differences in the prices (between what it was acquired for, and the current ones)? If this were my store, I would sell for the normal price. But the store is not mine, and I bought some liquor a year ago somewhere for 200 coupons, and today it costs 60,000, then who gets the difference? I get it! How? Someone comes in and offers me a bribe: sell it, he says, for the price at which you bought it. And on paper it really cost me 200 coupons... The one who gave me the bribe gets the second difference. Here the remedies are the same: speedy privatization. What would I do for privatization? I would put vouchers into people's hands. Today, a voucher is valued at approximately 25 million karbovantsy. Average families, which are made up of four to five people, could get 100 to 150 million karbovantsy. One will want to buy a share in a store, a second, a share in a plant, a third, to open his own business, a fourth to obtain land or an apartment. Whoever needs the money can sell the vouchers. This is not small change, and now it is necessary to begin a mass scale, almost a powerful privatization. I would also change in a major way the sphere of export-import policy. When someone says that it is necessary to save the state from being looted, then as a rule, it concerns the defense of official, even personal interests, but not state ones. The state is wealthy when it sells something. No one gives us oil, or gas, or wood. The problem is not one of where to buy: in Russia or in America... It is necessary to earn. But for this it is necessary to "produce" something to export. And of course, at the present rate for the karbovanets, which is artificially set by the national bank, export becomes unprofitable. A fixed rate could be introduced, but a so called over devaluated one. For example, 50,000 karbovantsy to the dollar. I would stop the printing of new money. We would have a new situation, which we still have never had. First, export would become very profitable. Second, we would have a stable rate, with which we could exchange, sell, or buy dollars or Russian rubles. There is one more point: then people would begin to flee from dollars. Why flee? If I save 100 dollars today, I will earn 10 percent annually. In a year, I will have 110 dollars. But if I sell 100 dollars and save the coupons, then I will earn 10 percent per month for the coupons. In a year I will buy more dollars than under the first variant. We have over 10 billion "greenbacks" in hand. They can become an internal source for investment in the Ukrainian economy. [Tarchynets] We have, it seems, come to an interesting problem. Please tell us whether the programs or proposals which you have made in the government and Parliament have found support, and whether you yourself agree with what was proposed to you and us? And finally, what led to your own decision to quit? [Pynzenyk] The paradox lies in the fact that we often have made good decisions, but forgotten them the next day. The classic example is our budget. It has to be by law. And no one dares to go against it. But on the next day, someone somehow refines it, in fact, not Parliament. Who takes a delicate morsel for himself, first of all? The "bison" who have access to decision making on the budget. And you, and the army, are left out. For example, something is not indexed for you. So if we confirm the budget, then a sum (and no more) can go into the economy. Since otherwise the budget areas are left without funds. The problem of reforms is not that we do not know what to do. The real problem is that we do not have a harsh political will. Democracy is good when there is knowledge. And just the reverse, when there is no knowledge, there cannot be talk about democracy. Democracy also is suitable only for making decisions. After this, there comes the dictatorship of performance and harsh control over the performances. I think that a person who does not perform a task has not justified society's faith, has played a trick on it, and must be immediately forced from his position. Why did I leave the government? Of course, I could have done this much earlier. I knew that working in it would not give me authority. But I thought: as long as I can force through even one good decision, or hinder even one bad one, I do not have the right to leave the governmnet. It was painful to be stopped on the street by people upset by prices. Today, true, the situation is a little different. A great many people in Kiev that I do not know greet me... This is one of the decisions, concerning prices for agricultural production, taken behind my back. My signature is not on this document. And it, the decision, very much got inflation going, and harmed people, especially the poorest ones. But the main thing is that it did not help the countryside. Just the opposite; it pushed it again to its knees. The people who made this decision did not understand anything. This was one of the reasons I quit. A second one. Let us say that few people know, that for three months I fought in the government against the currency rate established at that time. I thought that while I was a member of the "team," I did not have the right to take this outside the cabinet; I have to fight for changes. And when I did not manage to stop or change the decision, I thought that from then on, I did not have the right to remain in the government. And in fact, if you now ask any director of an enterprise--a state one, a private one, or ask a banker: what did the most harm to the Ukrainian economy? They will tell you this very decision--the introduction of the fixed rate. When the previous decision was in effect, which we had agreed on in the government, from April to September of last year, the flow of dollars, marks, and Russian rubles into Ukraine increased ten times. The collapse came after the September decision, after the introduction of the fixed rate for Ukrainain currency. [Tarchynets] And what happened with the Ukrainian voucher, about which so much was said, but we still do not have it? [Pynzenyk] I just spoke about this. We do not have a voucher as such, we have an open account. But this is very awkward, since people do not know about this account. Only 600,000 people have used it to this point. It is necessary to put vouchers into people's hands. I want to talk about one more thing. We are now working on the privatization of an auto plant in Zaporizhzhya. Some of the stock will be sold for these Ukrainian vouchers, and it will be possible to acquire them. It is only necessary to watch for the announcements in the press. A Canadian firm has agreed to prepare the vouchers themselves, for 800,000 dollars. I think that this is not such a large sum when we are needlessly wasting millions of dollars. It is necessary to do this more quickly, and let people decide the fate of their own certificates. [Tarchynets] We were promised long ago that the hryvnya would be introduced. The rumor was spread that therefore money will not be given... [Pynzenyk] This is not a method of struggle but a method of making people bitter. Steps cannot be taken which cause the people's distrust. So it goes! Wages are figured for people, but they are in general not paid. I think that such things are impermissible; this is not connected with putting extra money into circulation; you just decrease the quantity of non-cash money and issue coupons. I would not reform money today, since we have a national currency. And when I look at the programs of certain deputies, this is the impression: either I do not understand anything, or they, perhaps, do not understand a thing. We have our own national unit of money. And if I had at some point to work with the "team," I would want to show the many "economists," especially in Kiev, that the coupon will be "firm" and will "stand..." And then we will simply seize it. Since it is awkward to use a whole heap of paper. Then, let us say, instead of 10,000 coupons we will give people one hryvnya. But we will give them to everyone. And I would continue the open currency reform, and would not hide it. We have no reasons to confiscate money. Some have the illusion that it will be confiscated from rich people. This is more than an illusion, because none of the rich have money in coupons. They have it in property or in dollars. But if one wishes to rob invalids, and poor people, the question comes up: what are we robbing them for?! We have 13 trillion karbovantsy in the hands of the population. If this is divided among 52 million people, this would just be 240,000 karbovantsy each. The problem is not in the name of the money. The policy concerning it must be different. I have one very unusual coupon. On it is written "dollar..." But it did not become stronger because of this. It will become stronger when money is in a very large deficit. And this will happen when, first of all, the printers are stopped... [Tarchynets] I do not know what the truth is in this, but I have somehow been told, that in the time of huge inflation for our neighbors (in Poland) wages were paid either daily, or weekly... And they somehow knew what to do, and were saved. [Pynzenyk] It is not thanks to this that they knew what to do. Our people also are adapting themselves. I know some who are getting rather small wages, but at the beginning of every month buy five dollars for themselves, for example. So in dollars the money does not depreciate. But this is dangerous, abnormal, since when there are inflationary expectations, people flee from money. It is necessary for people not to adapt themselves to conditions of inflation; it is necessary to fight with inflation. Our inflation is unique. I will try to explain. Some think, that in our case it is linked with a lack of goods... Nothing of the kind! Our production (outside of consumer goods)has fallen by 25 percent over two years. This means that for this reason prices could increase by 40 percent, but they have reason over a year by six thousand times. What is the reason for this? The printers have not stopped. An insane amount of money is in circulation. More precisely, this basically concerns not ready money, but non-cash emission. But if there are no more goods, this additional money will only overflow into prices. The question could come up: "You say it is good... Why did you not do this?" And remember how many decisions have been made in session about the emission of trillions? In fact, the national bank, without a decision by the government, in March made an emission of almost a trillion, which then undermined the stabilization of prices which had begun. We already had a stable rate, and in relation to the ruble that rate of the coupon even increased. Inflation itself is one of the reasons for the flight of currency out of the country. Imagine a situation: I am exporting, and dollars remain in the West. But I cannot begin production. I can "pressure," especially, let us say, if I am still a deputy: let us have an emission. Needs for raw supplies and resources cover the reckoning of credit for me... This must not be. If there are no emissions, then either I will return the dollars here, or a plant goes bankrupt, and then an investigation begins. Documents are checked, and it appears that production was sabotaged, and the dollars are not returned. Articles of the Criminal Codex might be applied. In fact, criminal responsibility has been introduced for concealing currency outside the country (two to five years in prison).
