Some 40 percent of country's total workforce are now under a contract system. This was disclosed at a news conference here today by Liu Guanxue, a spokesman of the central government's Labor Ministry. Liu predicted that the framework for a brand-new labor system suitable for the country's socialist market economy would take shape in five years. According to the spokesman, the government's major achievements in reforming the labor system lay in the fact that all sorts of enterprises throughout China have got expanded autonomy in hiring people, especially in the distribution of wages. Liu said that almost all the workers employed in recent years have been subjected to contracts, adding that the market mechanism is playing a decisive role in the distribution of wages. In China the idea of selecting freely a job meeting one's own interest and needs is prevailing. A job offered by the government is not necessary a life-long job. On the other side, work units enjoy greater freedom to select their employees. He noted that more than 2,000 enterprises across China have been singled out as pioneers in the change to decide their own wage levels, adding that the practice will be introduced to the whole country. The spokesman said that China has set up more than 17,000 job introduction agencies to help jobless people find work. The agencies nationwide have found jobs for more than eight million people annually in recent years. In addition, the country's labor markets in different types have become the main channel for providing job opportunities for jobless people. To expand the labor system reform, Liu stressed that the government was pooling efforts to tackle "bottlenecks" affecting this reform, such as the country's under-developed social insurance system, loose management and the heavy financial burdens for the government and the enterprises. According to the spokesman, the Labor Ministry will introduce a reform package for the social insurance system. It is aimed to establish a unified social insurance system, with unified insurance payment rates and unified insurance treatment, regardless of the ownership modes of enterprises and their employees' status. The insurance fund is to be shared by all under unified arrangements. The spokesman said the Labor Ministry will grant enterprises the right to lay off redundant personnel. This will first be tried out in groups of pilot enterprises, he added. Liu stressed that enterprises, once relieved of the burden of massive numbers of redundant workers, would find it easy to take up the labor system reform.
