The transport of goods, raw materials and semi-manufactures via the roundabout east-west corridor has resulted in a drastic rise of business costs and, according to FYROM businessmen, will require an additional 40 million U.S. dollars by the end of the year. As a result, an increasing number of companies are facing bankruptcy, while others have been forced to halt production. The ban on transit through Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) was introduced in April 1993, when the U.N. sanctions imposed in late May 1992, were tightened. The Greek authorities closed their border and imposed a trade embargo on the FYROM last January after some E.U. countries recognized it as an independent state. Athens strongly opposes the FYROM being recognized under the name of Macedonia, explaining that this name is closely linked with the Greek history and that it indicates FYROM's territorial claims. The anti-Yugoslav blockade has so far cost the FYROM three billion U.S. dollars. Two million U.S. dollars have been earmarked for the "south wing" of the so-called customs corridor, i.e. for the widening of two bottlenecks at the border crossings Deve Bair (to Bulgaria) and Chafa San (to Albania). That, however, has only dimmed the essence of the problem. Shipping agents in the FYROM are aware that the corridor through Bulgaria and in particular the one through Albania cannot be compared to the routes towards Europe via Serbia. Although the distance between the border crossing Chafa San and the Albanian port of Durres is only 148 km, trailer trucks need over nine hours to cover that section because it is in a very bad condition. Moreover, they are in constant fear from road bandits or police "controls." The port of Durres, which gained in popularity after the Thessaloniki port was shut down to goods from the FYROM last February, is unable to meet all requirements. While transport charges in the world amount for 5-12 per cent in produce costs, the transport of FYROM goods to Europe via Albania and Bulgaria hikes up these costs to as much as 50 per cent.
