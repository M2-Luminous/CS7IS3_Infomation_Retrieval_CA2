The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the East Coast Low Control Area in the vicinity of Nantucket, MA. The intended effect of this action is to allow aircraft executing the Runway 6 Back Course Instrument Approach at the Nantucket Memorial Airport, Nantucket, MA (ACK) to remain in controlled airspace at lower altitudes. This change would allow air traffic control to avoid unnecessary vectoring of aircraft using the Runway 6 Back Course approach to keep those aircraft in controlled airspace. Since approximately 22% of aircraft arriving at ACK use the Runway 6 approach, this change would result in improved air traffic control services to over 6,000 aircraft per year. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designations for Low Control Areas are published in Paragraph 6007 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Offshore Airspace Area designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) Is not a ``Significant Regulatory Action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
