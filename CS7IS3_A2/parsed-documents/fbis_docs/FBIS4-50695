Executives of 14 banks authorized by China's central bank to trade in hard currency are meeting here to summarize the experiences since the two-tier exchange rates were merged at the beginning of 1994. According to these executives, the yuan has been quoted at 8.70 against the U.S. dollar since then. They agreed that the stability of the yuan has provided a stable financial environment for China to expand trade and economic cooperation with other countries. Such stability has also made it possible for Chinese enterprises to improve management, China to gear its economy with the economy of the world as a whole, they said, adding that it also encourages more overseas firms to invest in China. They cited a big increase in exports as another success in the reform of the foreign exchange system. For example, exports shot up 18.7 percent in the first quarter of this year over the same period in 1993. Developed areas in China reported an even bigger increase in exports during that period. They agreed that another success was that the inflow of hard currencies exceeded selling and state foreign exchange reserves are eight billion U.S. dollars more than in early 1994. In April, banks designated by the central bank to deal in hard currency registered an inflow of hard currency totalling 7.31 billion U.S. dollars and sold 4.18 billion dollars, leaving a surplus of 3.14 billion dollars. Also in April, 2.69 billion U.S. dollars and 2.4 billion Hong Kong dollars changed hands in the Shanghai-based foreign exchange trading center. The operation of inter-bank hard currency trading markets has created a mechanism under which exchange rates are set according to market demand, they said. That will enable the central bank to intensify its macro-economic control, they added. The executives also noted that sufficient hard currency was traded in swap centers to meet the needs of foreign-funded businesses. In April, such businesses sold a total of 135 million U.S. Dollars and 64 million HK [Hong Kong] dollars in 19 swap centers all over the country.
