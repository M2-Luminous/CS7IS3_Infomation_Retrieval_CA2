After returning to the competent judicial authorities to ascertain the validity of the circulated and published reports, rumors, leaks, details, names, accusations, and fabricated scenarios, the Lebanese Forces were assured they were false. Hence the appeal to the mass media to beware the risks involved in falling for misleading falsification campaigns being launched against the forces and other spiritual and partisan quarters. They stress that the mass media should shoulder their nationalist responsibility in such critical circumstances by refraining from publishing any reports or information unless they are issued by the competent judicial authorities who have the legal authorization to comment on the progress of the ongoing investigations. If such assaults continue against Lebanese Forces' officials and individuals, the forces regret that they will be compelled to take the legal action necessary to preserve their rights, particularly moral rights, against anyone who indulges in falsification, distortion, and libel campaigns or false accusations.
