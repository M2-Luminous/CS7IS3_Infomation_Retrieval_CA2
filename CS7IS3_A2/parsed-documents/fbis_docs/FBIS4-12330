The league's assistant secretary general for political affairs, 'Adnan 'Imran, told AFP: "It is premature to talk of lifting the boycott because the reasons which motivated this legitimate measure have still not disappeared." And he said those trying to pressurise Arab countries would do better to "concentrate their efforts on ensuring the success of the peace process." The Arab League agreed in Cairo last month to postpone a debate on whether to ease the trade boycott of Israel, amid anger over the Hebron mosque massacre in which a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers in February. The decision ignored a US campaign aimed at lifting the indirect boycott on foreign firms doing business with Israel following the signing of the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord in Washington in September. Oman and Qatar had also pushed for easing the boycott, Arab diplomats said. Ministers from the 22 member countries agreed to consider the boycott imposed over four decades ago at a session later in the year. "We are waiting for the day when the Israeli occupation ends and that will lead to a lifting of the boycott," according to 'Imran, a Syrian. Damascus, one of the four Arab parties in the peace negotiations with Israel, has steadfastly opposed lifting the boycott until Israel withdraws from all Arab lands captured in the 1967 war. 'Imran said all Arab countries agreed on the need to bring peace to the Middle East. 'Imran, who was attending a meeting of the Arab Towns Organization here, also condemned the recent defence agreement signed between Israel and France which ended a 30-year freeze on military cooperation. "We hope France will revise its policy especially as Arab states hope to reinforce their friendly relations with this country." And he warned Paris should not count on Arab support "if it aligns itself with Israel, supplying it with the means to bring war and destruction." He added that the Arab League was stepping up efforts to restore Arab solidarity badly shaken by the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, when Jordan, Yemen and the PLO were accused of backing Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. Arab-Israeli peace talks suspended since the Hebron massacre are due to resume at the end of April.
