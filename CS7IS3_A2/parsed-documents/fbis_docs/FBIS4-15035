Some 30 servicemen of special units of the Ukrainian National Guard and the Ukrainian Interior Ministry arrived in the base this morning on board the plane of the deputy head of the Ukrainian armed forces general staff, military sources in Sevastopol told ITAR-TASS. The servicemen settled at the Slavutich ship of the Ukrainian Navy Department. Another 500 special unit servicemen settled at the Nakhimov navy school in Sevastopol. The Black Sea Fleet Command is ready to put the fleet on the alert in case of a conflict. There is no reports about movement of Ukrainian troops stationed in the peninsula. According to the Russian military, the Ukrainian troops stationed in the Crimea increased from 18,000 to 51,000 men within the past two years. Well-informed sources told ITAR-TASS Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov failed to return to the Crimea at 1800 today as it was planned since Turkey closed its skies to the presidential plane without any announced reasons. Meshkov is expected to return to Simferopol at 0100 on 6 April. In the opinion of observers, the developments are not accidental. A decree of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was made public in the absence of Meshkov to announce the introduction of a post of Kravchuk representative in the Crimea, which was followed by the arrival of the Ukrainian military officials and special units. Observers think President Kravchuk may explore the ground for the introduction of a special rule in the Crimea and subordination of Yuriy Meshkov to his representative.
