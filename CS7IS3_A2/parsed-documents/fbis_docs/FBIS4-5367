Talking with Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Han praised Beijing's role in trying to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis. He asked Beijing to persuade Pyongyang that nuclear development will not succeed and to bring its ally into the international fold, ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said after the 40-minute meeting. Former Foreign Minister and Deputy Premier Wu, saying his country had tried to help before and would continue its efforts, nevertheless explained that Beijing's scope of influence was limited. But he promised to urge North Korea to work for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, the spokesman said. Wu came to Seoul Sunday on an eight-day visit at Han's invitation. He predicted improvement in inter-Korean relations and urged persuasion through patient dialogue, Chang said.
