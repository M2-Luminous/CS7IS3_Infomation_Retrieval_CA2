His lawyer Sergey Belyak has prepared a "new set of suits" to protect the honor and dignity of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, says a report of the Liberal-Democratic faction's press service circulated here today. In the opinion of Zhirinovskiy, the newspapers SEGODNYA, KURANTY and IZVESTIYA are guilty "of spreading German media's fake report on alleged reception of Honecker money by the Liberal-Democratic Party". The lawyer is sure each newspaper will have "to pay at least 200 million rubles". The reason for the action against Chubays is his accusations of Zhirinovskiy of fascism. The report says the last straw was Chubays' interview with the ARGUMENTY I FAKTY newspaper.
