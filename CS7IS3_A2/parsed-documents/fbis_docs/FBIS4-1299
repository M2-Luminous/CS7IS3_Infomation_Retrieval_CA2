This information was announced by the deputy minister of law and order, Mr. Gert Myburgh. [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen] The security situation in our country is critical, and I believe that the levels of violence have overtaken any level at which one can have an election and later say the election was free and fair. It is a pity, because we have been hoping all along that we could have constitutional peace with all the groups before continuing with the process. [Afrikaner Resistance Movement member Fred Rundle] It is not our people. I do not know who it is. You must remember that there are literally hundreds of organizations which, just like ours, do not want to fall under a communist government. And these people -- it can be any one of these people. I do not know who it is. [end recording] The Democratic Party has expressed condolences with the next of kin of those killed in the bomb blasts. The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] has said the attacks follow a pattern as the targets have been groups of black people or offices used by liberation groups. The party has asked voters to vote for the sake of peace and wisdom.
