Shumeyko to sign it. Deputy Petr Romanov, who voted against, sent his undelivered speech to the editorial office. The problem of choice has always faced and will always face each and every one of us, and very often we have to choose between loyalty and honor. The ancients used to say: "Loyalty cannot prevail over honor." Unfortunately, we sometimes forget this piece of wisdom, as we have in the Federation Council. I recall with shame our meeting with the prime minister. Instead of demanding from him an account of what had been done, of what the government intends to work on, and of the help it needs from us, we began vying with one another in expressions of loyal sentiment. First, we spent time deciding, with a most serious expression on our face, where best to seat our cherished guest, then, with utter inappropriateness, we burst out with applause in response to his proposal to abolish public holidays. As if this will solve the problem when the country is already working a three- or four-day week. You get the impression that many of us are more concerned about loyalty to the regime than the honor and dignity of the Federation Council and its accountability to the people and history. And today, in the process of working on the agreement, you get the impression that we have been away from Russia for a couple of years and that now this treaty is for us the light at the end of the tunnel. But no, these are the lights of an oncoming locomotive, the driving force of which is supplied by the awakened working class and peasantry. In the last century a classic author uttered these remarkable words: Politics is the concentrated expression of economics. I think these words would sound more appropriate now if reversed: "Economics is the concentrated expression of politics." In other words, the economy we have is nothing but the fruit of the political actions of the current leadership of the country. It is now necessary to talk about and include on the agenda the following item: The political crisis of the regime and, as its consequences, the collapse of the economy, the collapse, that is, rather than a temporary stoppage of the economy. We should all appreciate that if the political conditions are not changed, no changes will be achieved in the economy. Therefore we must not sign the treaty because: first, it brings political stability to the president and government, guarantees of loyalty to them and security, and trust in the authorities; second, the treaty does not bring economic stability to Russian producers, the regions, and Russia; third, the president and the executive branch avoid giving any guarantees on their own part. Such guarantees could be: a) the swearing of an oath of allegiance to the new Constitution by the president; b) a clear and unambiguous rejection of any attempts whatsoever to violate the Constitution by the president and government; c) the consideration by the Federal Assembly and possibly by referendum of the basic principles of the reforms under way with the aim of fashioning a course which would be supported by the overwhelming majority of the population. I would very much like the work of the First Russian Federal Assembly to be remembered by the people in the same way as the reforms of Petr Arkadyevich Stolypin or the results of the postwar restoration of the national economy. I conclude this speech with the words with which I began it: Loyalty to the regime cannot prevail over honor, especially when it is the honor of the Russian parliament.
