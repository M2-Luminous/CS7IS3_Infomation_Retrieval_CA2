Government Minister Marcelo Santos has not rejected the possibility of the government using a mobilization decree in the case of public disorder during the strike. The government minister called on the United Workers Front [FUT] to execute the strike peacefully to avoid endangering the people's safety. Santos said the national strike is absurd, and he noted that it does not affect the government but the country's production sectors and the workers. Two government spokesmen have reported there is no going back on the price measures. Regarding the unconstitutionality suits filed with the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal by several political parties, the government minister said he will defend the gasoline price hike within the extent of the law. He said the government will not derogate the price hike decree just because there are people demonstrating in the streets. Finance Minister Cesar Robalino has stated it is not possible to modify the fuel price increase, and if someone in the government suggests it, he will oppose the motion. Labor Minister Alfredo Corrales has said the government is studying the possibility of increasing workers' salaries in general. National Congress President Samuel Bellettini announced that the National Congress will call on the economic front to explain the legal basis for the fuel price hike. Meanwhile, FUT leader Juan Andrango said today's preventive strike has gained strength because it demands cutting back the gasoline price increase. Andrango told Radio Quito this morning that the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal must suspend the fuel price increase, and he warned that if it does not, the strike will be maintained indefinitely. He said there will be an empty pots-and-pans march next week and an Indian demonstration demanding higher salaries. Labor, Indian, peasant, and student organizations representatives met and formed a grand front to coordinate the preventive strike. Today's strike will be followed by bigger protests of indefinite length, including another Indian uprising. Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, said this criminal and reckless measure has harmed everyone. He urged all sectors to join the struggle as the only remaining alternative. Yesterday, there were street demonstrations throughout the country. Demonstrations cause extensive traffic jams, trouble for the people, and property damage. The police arrested 16 adults and 53 minors in different parts of the country. Chambers of commerce have appealed for peace and talks as valid alternatives to overcoming the problem. The industrialists regret that the government's failure to put public finances in order has resulted in the adoption of measures that negatively affect the various economic sectors. This morning, Quito Chamber of Commerce President (Nicanor Calixto) told Radio Quito that the private sector is worried about the high cost of fuel because this negatively affects the national economy. (Calixto) criticized the president of Congress for calling for protests throughout the country and favored Finance Minister Cesar Robalino going to Congress to explain why the government has implemented this measure. Meanwhile, Social Christian Party Deputy Heinz Moeller thinks the strike is a valid method for protesting the exorbitant fuel price increase decreed by the Duran-Ballen administration. He criticized the labor minister for saying there is an environment of unruliness in the country.
