First, I would like to explain my view on the international situation. Now that the Cold War structure has collapsed, the world is exploring the new framework of peace and prosperity. The exploration, however, has a long way to go and the way is rocky. The present international community, which is in transition, is faced with uncertainty and unpredictability and has many tasks to accomplish. In the world economy, North America's economy is robustly recovering, but many other nations are suffering from recession and serious unemployment. As for regional conflicts, the first step has been taken toward sustained peace and reconstruction in Cambodia. Signs of settling the conflicts in former Yugoslavia and Somalia, despite concerted efforts by the international community, are still not visible. North Korea's suspected nuclear development and the possible proliferation of weapons of mass destruction following the breakup of the Soviet Union are threatening world safety. Such global issues as poverty in developing countries, the global environment, population, and refugees are getting serious. In this way, the international community is continuing to sail without a destination in these dramatically changing waves. I believe, however, that the international community will find a beacon to guide its voyage and the beacon is beginning to show the path we will have to follow. The beacon is a target that the international community will have to pursue through cooperation and collaboration and the target is to create a world where people can live in peace and prosperity. The international community has increasingly expected help from Japan, which has built today's prosperity in peace while pursuing the target. Japan should meet the international community's expectations and take responsibility for creating the framework of world peace and stability. To those ends, Japan's foreign policy is being asked to play a more aggressive role. [applause] Next, in line with the principles I just stated, I would like to outline major policy tasks with which Japan will have to grapple. Worldwide economic stagnation and unemployment have resulted in an increase of protectionist moves and intensifying economic frictions. To build a fluent and prosperous world by preventing them, it is necessary for many other nations to promote policy coordination. It goes without saying that Japan, which accounts for about one-sixth of the world's GNP, has a responsibility to play a great role. The Uruguay Round was successfully concluded last December after undergoing difficult negotiations and I believe the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round is a victory for the principle of free trade, the principle of open trade mutilateralism, and international cooperation. Faced with various difficulties, Japan was engaged in negotiations until the very end, and Japan insisted, to the maximum extent, on its rice position. Japan's decision to accept an agricultural negotiations accord, including the establishment of a special exception of comprehensive tariffication, contributed to the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Japan decided to accept the agricultural negotiations accord with great pains from the standpoint of making its due international contributions. A cabinet ministers' meeting to sign the final documents is set to be held in Morocco and we are making full preparations for signing relevant agreement documents. I would like to ask the Diet to speedily ratify those agreement documents. Japan will work to maintain and strengthen the multilateral trade structure that is the basis for the prosperity of not only Japan, but for the rest of the world by scrupulously implementing the results of the Uruguay Round in the future. Japan's economy remains unpredictable and Japan still runs a huge surplus. With this economic situation in mind, last month, the government announced a package of 15.25-trillion-yen economic stimulus measures which call for income tax cuts, an expansion of domestic demand, and the promotion of deregulation to revitalize the economy. I believe that promoting reform of the economic structure by steadily implementing the package and securing sustained economic growth led by domestic demand will contribute to the establishment of harmonized economic relations with foreign nations and the stable development of the world economy. As for deregulation in particular, it will serve to improve the quality of life for the people. I think that the government, therefore, needs to make further efforts for the deregulation. As foreign minister, I have felt keenly growing worldwide hopes for peace since I took office. In response to those hopes, Japan will have to do what it can do to fulfill them. North Korea's suspected nuclear development is a threat to the peace and safety in Northeast Asia and is a major challenge to the nuclear nonproliferation efforts. It has been decided that the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] will conduct inspections at declared nuclear sites in North Korea. Progress in U.S.-North Korea talks will hold the key to clearing up North Korea's suspected nuclear development for the time being. Japan for its part will persistently urge North Korea to completely withdraw its decision to pull out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), completely implement an agreement reached with the IAEA, and come to agree with South Korea to announce a joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula while keeping close contact with such concerned nations as the United States, South Korea, and China. From its position of seeking reinforcement of the multinational framework and the mechanism for preventing proliferation of mass destruction weapons, Japan supports continuation of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. We are also playing a positive role in negotiations to enact a multinational ban on nuclear testing, which aims to further disarmament efforts by nuclear power nations. Japan will also maintain its cooperative policy for those working to abolish nuclear weapons stored in the former Soviet Union. The Japanese Government signed the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] last year, and is seeking the Diet's early approval of the treaty. Japan will also strongly support Ukraine's efforts to dismantle its nuclear weapons. To cope with the recent proliferation of both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons, it is necessary to review and reinforce multinational trade control systems. Japan will positively engage itself in international discussions on this issue. Disregarding such efforts by Japan, some foreign media have recently raised, without any grounds, questions about Japan's nonnuclear policy. As the only victim of nuclear weapons, Japan adheres to its triple nonnuclear principles [not to manufacture, possess, or import nuclear weapons], and its use of nuclear energy is limited strictly to peaceful purposes. So, I would like to emphasize again that Japan will never develop nuclear weapons. It appears regional conflicts in former Yugoslavia and Somalia have been caused by ethnic and religious antagonism and it will be very difficult to settle them; however, the international community is patiently dealing with the problem. In particular, Bosnia-Herzegovina is still suffering bloodshed. Japan will continue its efforts to obtain peace, in conjunction with the United Nations and the individual nations concerned. In February, the government hammered out a package of policies for former Yugoslavia consisting of more humanitarian aid, economic assistance to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the reorganization of diplomatic establishments in the region. In addition to diplomatic efforts and economic cooperation, Japan has promoted personnel assistance to settle regional conflicts through participation in UN peacekeeping operations in such nations as Angola, Cambodia, and Mozambique. Participation in UN operations in Cambodia have cost our nation great sacrifices of life; however, we consider that Japan's presence made a big contribution to Cambodian peace. We would like to express our sincere condolences to those who were killed in helping to achieve that. As part of Japan's assistance to peace efforts in Central America, Japan is planning to dispatch election monitors to El Salvador later this month. With ethnic and religious conflicts increasing in number, it is important for us to offer counsel for those in trouble. We would like to promote contributions which are suitable for Japan to make. Under our definition, a humane world is one in which people can enjoy prosperity with the guarantee of freedom, democracy, and human rights. At present, reform efforts are being promoted to help the large number of people who favor democracy and a market economy. This is a great trend of history, and Japan will continue to offer positive support for the trend. While some developing nations are making incredible economic progress, most still suffer from poverty and hunger. We strongly believe the economic and social development of these nations is a necessary prerequisite for peace and prosperity in the world. To achieve this, we should consider not only economic assistance, but also comprehensive approaches which include the promotion of trade and investments. Japan's assistance to developing nations is the most important pillar of its contribution to the international community, in the sense that this is the way we can best make good use of our experience in economic development. Last June, the government hammered out the fifth midterm objective of official development assistance [ODA] programs under which Japan will offer from $70 billion to $75 billion over the five-year period starting in the fiscal year 1994. In view of Japan's desire to play a role in this field despite the current severe economic situation, the government has proposed ODA spending of 1.634 trillion yen in the fiscal 1994 budget plan. Based on the government's ODA guidelines, we would like to obtain the understanding of the Japanese public, and the appreciation of aid-receiving nations for our peace and development-minded aid policy. Throughout last fall and this winter, Japan has taken the chair of international conferences on development in Cambodia, Mongolia, Indochina, and Africa. Japan is, thus, playing a leading role in multinational frameworks to support development, democratization, and economic reform in developing nations. We would like to maintain Japan's initiative in this field. Global issues such as environment, population, AIDS, drugs, and refugee problems are serious concerns to the entire world. It is urgent for developed and developing nations to cooperate in solving these problems. In this regard, Japan intends to actively assist developing countries in solving environmental issues. Also, when the prime minister visited the United States in February, he announced Japan's plan to spend $3 billion, or about 300 billion yen, over the next seven years to assist developing nations in resolving population and AIDS problems. The International Conference on Population and Development is scheduled to hold its session in Cairo in September. Population problems are closely related to environment and development. Japan has been actively promoting efforts to contribute to the success of the meeting. For example, it sponsored a meeting of a wise men's conference on population and development in January. Now that relations of mutual dependence between countries have become deeper than ever, it is imperative to strengthen international cooperation to resolve the issues I have just mentioned. Because the current international situation is severe, it is essential for Japan, the United States, and Europe to take the lead in promoting policy cooperation to tackle global issues. Japan intends to continue efforts to strengthen policy cooperation among Japan, the United States, and Europe on such occasions as summit meetings. Even under a new international situation, Japan's basic diplomatic policy of maintaining close, cooperative relations with the United States based on the security pact will never change. Japan-U.S. relations have become more and more important for ensuring peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Prime Minister Hosokawa visited the United States in February to hold the third summit meeting with President Clinton. Although the two leaders failed to reach an accord on the bilateral framework trade talks, they agreed that the disagreement should not affect bilateral cooperation in solving political, security, and global problems. Concerning the framework trade talks, I myself visited Washington one day earlier than scheduled to coordinate opinions on objective criteria and numerical targets. I met with Vice President Gore, State Secretary Christopher, Treasury Secretary Bentsen, and Trade Representative Kantor and eagerly negotiated with them to reach an agreement. However, unfortunately, the two sides failed to find a common ground on trade issues and decided to have a cooling-off period for the time being. Meanwhile, the two leaders discussed international affairs relating to North Korea, China, and Russia in their summit meeting, and their discussions reflected the breadth and depth of the current relations between Japan and the United States. Also, the two nations formulated an action program to promote cooperation in resolving global issues such as environment, population, and AIDS problems. During my recent visit to Washington, I also met with newly appointed Defense Secretary Perry and shared the same view with him about the importance of the Japan-U.S. security system. Japan-U.S. relations are currently in a tough phase over economic problems. While working for maintaining and deepening overall Japan-U.S. relations, I am determined to make all-out efforts to seek a breakthrough in the deadlocked economic and trade relations as early as possible to solve pending issues, thus further strengthening the Japan-U.S. partnership. The European Union has entered a new phase of unification after the EU Treaty went into effect. It is more necessary than before for Japan to build relations with the EU on a firmer foundation. Based on the Japan-EC joint declaration issued in 1991, the government will further deepen relations with the EU as partners who share the same sense of values. Also, beyond economic and trade ties, the government will promote dialogue and cooperation with the EU to solve various problems common to the international community. Amid drastic changes in the international community, there are many favorable factors in the Asia-Pacific region. The region has achieved remarkable economic development under relatively steady growth rates. Under these favorable circumstances, various forms of intraregional cooperation are being promoted in the region. In the political and security fields, an atmosphere for holding dialogue throughout the region has been rapidly growing in recent years in line with our conventional proposal. An ASEAN regional forum is scheduled to be held this year for the first time. In addition to member nations of the expanded ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting, China, Russia, and other nations will attend the forum where foreign ministers will exchange opinions on political and security issues concerning the entire region. I believe that it is important to create a sense of security among various nations within the region by promoting transparency concerning every nation's policies through such a forum. The Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference exists as a framework for economic cooperation within the region. An informal APEC economic conference, which was held in November last year, made great achievements. For example, a future prospect for intraregional cooperation within the Asia-Pacific region as well as a direction for future cooperation were indicated at the conference. Holding the belief that intraregional cooperation in the political, security, and economic fields will contribute to the peace and prosperity of the international community as a whole, Japan hopes to take the initiative in promoting such cooperation in the future to turn the region into the very fountain of peace. China is expected to become a more important entity not only in the Asia-Pacific region but also in the international community. Relations between Japan and China have been developing in a favorable manner. During my visit to China in January, I held meetings with President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and Qian Qichen, vice premier and concurrently foreign minister. I had frank and meaningful exchanges with them on bilateral issues as well as on international issues about which the two countries are concerned. Moreover, during Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's recent visit to Japan, I took the opportunity to have a meaningful exchange with him while keeping my visit to China in mind. Japan intends to build future-oriented relations between Japan and China as well as a bilateral relationship which will result in world contributions, and intends to further deepen cooperation between the two countries. Japan also intends to continue to cooperate with China in promoting its policy of reform and opening up. The Korean peninsula constitutes an unstable factor in the Asia-Pacific region in view of North Korea's suspected nuclear development. Although negotiations between Japan and North Korea on normalizing diplomatic relations have been suspended, the government intends to tackle the issue while cautiously watching North Korea's future moves. Under the circumstances, our relations with neighboring South Korea, which shares the common values of freedom and democracy, are increasing in importance. President Kim Yong-sam is expected to visit Japan as a state guest in late March. Our government will exert efforts to develop a broad, future-oriented bilateral relationship of cooperation. In Indochina, a new government elected through free elections came into existence in Cambodia. Vietnam and Laos are also implementing liberal economic reforms. Japan proposed the organization of an Indochina development forum to deal with the development of the whole region, and this forum is scheduled to be held in the second half of this year. We intend to promote international cooperation in the future through this forum and other venues. Democratization and economic liberalization have also gone a long way in Southwest Asia. Japan will assist such efforts, and work on nuclear nonproliferation in this region. The United Nations is expected to play a very important role in world peace and stability. Further strengthening the functions of the United Nations is an urgent task. This year, a working level meeting will be convened on the reorganization of the Security Council, and wide-ranging discussions are expected both in Japan and in foreign countries. Japan, as a nonpermanent member of the Security Council, has exerted earnest efforts in the past two years to work for the building of a more peaceful world. Today, there is increasing demand by international public opinion for Japan to play an even more active role in the United Nations. In response to such expectations, I believe Japan should assume whatever responsibilities it can. In promoting international cooperation, Japan's relations with other major nations and regions are important. President Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October was a very important visit that laid a new foundation for promoting relations between Japan and Russia. Parliamentary elections were held last December in Russia following the President's visit to Japan and President Yeltsin reshuffled his cabinet last January. The Russian situation still remains uncertain and Japan needs to closely watch Russia's future domestic situation. In Japan-Russia relations, Japan sent election monitors to Russia when the parliamentary elections were held. Both Japan and Russia held working-level talks in February this year and they also resumed the meeting of the working group on the conclusion of a peace treaty. In this way, the two countries have been engaged in brisk political dialogue. At the private level, Japan, the United States, and Russia held the first round of the tripartite talks in Tokyo. Thus, Japan and Russia have held a broad-ranging dialogue. Under these developments, I will visit Russia this month. At a series of meetings with Russian leaders, I intend to reiterate that settling the territorial dispute and then completely normalizing diplomatic Japan-Russia relations will be important not only to the two nations but also to securing the peace and security of the Asian-Pacific region. I also intend to point out that it is important for Russia to continue its reform policies for democratization, market economy, and cooperative diplomacy which is conducted on the basis of law and justice. I plan to confirm with Russian leaders that as long as Russia continues those reform policies, Japan will aggressively support those reform policies. Last September, Israel and the PLO agreed to issue a declaration on self-rule in Israeli-occupied lands and I myself attended a historic signing ceremony in Washington. Israel and the PLO have since worked to put the declaration into effect. Thanks to the efforts of the United States, Israel and Syria have held serious peace negotiations. Japan is committed to providing $200 million in aid over the next two years to stabilize the life of Palestinians. Of the amount, it has already announced plans to provide $50 million. Aid from the international community is indispensable for promoting peace and stability in the Middle East. Japan will strengthen political dialogue with nations in the region and participate in multilateral talks on Middle East peace. It will continue to assist Palestinians. In the Latin American nations, the market economy has been making steady progress and structural poverty remains a task to be tackled. Japan will continue to assist those nations' reform efforts. In Africa, presidential and parliamentary elections were held last year in some nations and thus political reform is making a headway. Many nations are gripped by unstable domestic situations and they have difficulty overcoming their economic problems. Japan will continue to assist political and economic reform efforts by those nations. It also will assist those nations through bilateral and multilateral frameworks. To keep the world in peace and stability, it is necessary to build a relationship of trust and deepen mutual understanding among nations. In a bid to deepen other nations' understanding of Japan, Japan will strengthen publicity activities and work to promote international exchanges. Last year, Japan hosted an international conference on Angkor Wat. It will aggressively cooperate with developing nations to preserve mankind's tangible or intangible cultural relics and promote their cultures. Science and technology are the key to opening the future. It is important for Japan to steadily promote international cooperation to share them with other nations. With the international situation still remaining unstable, the number of Japanese who carry out activities abroad is growing, and this is increasing the number of Japanese who are involved in accidents and crimes abroad. The government will strengthen measures to ensure safety for those Japanese. The government also will redouble its effort to speedily airlift back home Japanese who live in countries where civil wars or coups occur. As I stated, in order for Japan to accomplish diplomatic tasks, it should respond properly to the dramatically changing international situation and conduct flexibly its diplomacy with a long-term perspective. I intend to work to strengthen preparedness for the conduct of Japan's diplomacy. But it is only possible to conduct our diplomacy with the people's support. I intend to continue to work to win people's understanding of Japan's diplomacy. I am in charge of conducting Japan's diplomacy at this time which is very important to the future of the international community and I feel awed at my duties. I would like to solicit further cooperation from my fellow dietmen and the people. [applause].
