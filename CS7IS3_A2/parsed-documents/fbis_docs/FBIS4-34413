The president officially informed Defense Minister Division General Rafael Angel Montero Revette to advise the promoted officers. The president decided to promote three officers regarded as born commanders to the rank of division general, as they were described as military men who will be remembered as commanders. Nicolas Valencia Vivas, an AMV [Military Academy of Venezuela] artillery branch graduate of the 1967 Lino de Clemente Class, is currently the chief of the Army's General Staff. He previously served as Army Intelligence director and commander of the 61st Infantry Brigade stationed in Apure State. He is a Iaeden [Institute of Higher Studies for National Defense] graduate. He also held the post of commander of the Jungle Battalion stationed in Luepa, Bolivar State, and is a lawyer. Pedro Hernandez Guevara, an AMV artillery branch graduate of the 1965 Lino de Clemente Class, served as commander of the 52d Jungle Brigade stationed in Puerto Ayacucho; commander of the Jancito Lara Self-Propelled Group [Grupo Autopropulsado Jacinto Lara] stationed in Valencia, Carabobo State; commander of the 155mm Armored Brigade; director of the Army Higher School; commander of the Ayacucho Artillery group; deputy director of DIM [Directorate of Military Intelligence]; and is currently the Army's logistics commander. James Patro Navas, an AMV infantry branch graduate of the 1968 Pedro Maria Freites Class, was born in San Cristobal, Tachira State. He served as commander of the 1.1 [as published] Task Forces at the service of Cufan [expansion not known]. The president appointed him commander of the Paratroopers Brigade and of 4-F [not further identified] later on. He is currently the commander of the 4th Army Infantry Division stationed in Maracay, Aragua State. The following rear admirals were promoted to vice admiral: Jesus Briceno Garcia, current regional personnel director of the Defense Ministry, and Oscar Morales Martinez, Venezuelan Navy School director and Navy personnel commander. F-16 and Mirage pilots with well-known military records will be the new Venezuelan Air Force [FAV] division generals. Jose Agustin Borges Blasco is an outstanding and highly respected pilot. He is a jet bomber, transportation, and fighter pilot. He graduated from the AMV Aviation School in 1967 with the rank of lieutenant major of the Teofilo Zambrano Class. He was born in San Juan, Caracas, and was raised in Catia. Since his days as a cadet he distinguished himself as a test and training pilot in all the FAV weapons systems. The only aircraft he has not flown is a helicopter. He is a graduate of Washington's Inter-American Defense College. After Division General Maglio Montiel Arguello, he is the Mirage fighter pilot with the most flight time in the country. Montiel and Borges escorted the Mirage squadron upon its arrival in the country from Nellis Air Force Base in the United States after participating in the Red Flag maneuvers with F-16 airplanes. The two pilots flew for the president during the FAV's anniversary on 9 December, a few days after the 27 November uprising, when it was reported that U.S. pilots flew those airplanes. Borges is currently commander of FAV Air Operations. Juan Antonio Paredes Nino is one of the country's most distinguished fighter pilots. He helped pioneer the F-16 weapons system. Since his time at the Military Aviation School, he stood out as an excellent pilot. It was always said that "Paredes Nino was giving orders from school." He is the son of former Defense Minister Fernandez Paredes Bello, an FAV division general. Expectations were that at least one general of the 1968 class would rise to the rank of division general. Those expectations were based not only on merits but on knowledge about what has happened in the other branches. The president, however, dispelled those notions. It did not happen. The president did not expand the number of slots. He promoted two generals who were sure bets to the rank of division general. There was no surprise. The promoted officers are: Julio Cesar Pena Sanchez, current FAC [Armed Forces of National Cooperation] inspector general, and Euro Luis Rincon Viloria. Rincon Viloria comes from Zulia State and graduated from the Efofac [Armed Forces of Cooperation Officers Training School] as a member of the 1967 Taguanes Battle Class. He served as deputy director of the FAC Higher School, Core [National Guard Regional Command] 5 chief of general staff, Training and Environmental and Natural Renewal Resources Protection School director, and commander of the 51st Mobile Destacafac [expansion unknown]. He served as Core 6 commander as well as commander of the Apure Garrison stationed in San Fernando. He is currently the FAC chief of General Staff.
