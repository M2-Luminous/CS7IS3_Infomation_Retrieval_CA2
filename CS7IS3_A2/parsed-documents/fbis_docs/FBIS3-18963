The municipalities have realized that they cannot continue to expand as they did in the late 1980's, and the public sector has had to cut back on its bureaucracy. But the recession has also given rise to problems -- among them high unemployment and the still growing public debt -- that we will leave behind us for the next generation. That is the opinion of Pekka Parkkinen, a researcher at the State Economic Research Institute (VATT). Parkkinen has produced a forecast under the title "What the Generations Have Inherited in Finland," and his view of what we will leave to coming generations is mainly favorable. The spiral of indebtedness can be interrupted, all the talk about a huge deficit in the pension fund is exaggerated, and the national wealth we will leave behind us totals far more than 1 trillion markkas. Moreover, the next generation will have received a solid education that, thanks to its parents, society has paid for. Education and research are the most important things we can bequeath, and they constitute a sector where we must not economize, Parkkinen says. But he refuses to call himself an optimist, claiming instead that his view of the future is realistic. The biggest threat to the future of the Finns is not to be found anywhere within our country's borders. It is not the national debt or unemployment: The threat comes from the East. Unrest in Russia is the thing that would have the most negative influence on Finland's future. "Our own problems we can take care of, but global problems such as environmental pollution or widespread war are things we cannot manage," says Parkkinen. Declining Debt The foreign debt has been regarded as one of today's major problems, but Parkkinen points out that if exports continue to rise as they are doing now, that problem will be solved relatively quickly in the private sector. Foreign loans will make it worthwhile to finance investments yielding at least as much as the interest on the foreign debt, Parkkinen believes. But most of the foreign debt contracted by the state has been used to finance bank subsidies, unemployment benefits, and other public transfers of income. And the national debt will continue to grow if economic growth turns out to be around 2 percent per year, Parkkinen believes. According to him, an optimal growth rate would be 4 percent, since it would then be possible to halt the growth in the national debt by the turn of the century. Otherwise, it is impossible to predict how long the debt will continue to rise and how much it will rise. The debt is a problem that the next generation will have to contend with and that it will have to pay. Parkkinen believes that Finland's national economy will continue to grow satisfactorily during the rest of the 1990's. Company profits are rising, and that in turn is leading to new investments, which in turn create new jobs. Faith in the future is returning, and people are gradually venturing to borrow and to use their money again -- many people need a new home or a new car. There will be a favorable chain reaction. Idle Citizens But not even new industrial investment can create enough new jobs. Unemployment will continue to be a problem, Parkkinen emphasizes. We must do what we can to avoid creating a generation that has never gotten accustomed to working -- a group of idle citizens in society that people who work will have to pay for. On that subject, Parkkinen sees an opportunity in an integrated Europe and the European Economic Area agreement. They will give our well-educated young people a chance to enter the Central European labor market, stay there a few years and increase their capital, and then come home richer both spiritually and materially a few years later. True, there is an obvious risk that many will stay in Central Europe, but the open labor market provides a good opportunity, he feels. "There is no instant solution to the unemployment problems. We will have to make further cutbacks in the public sector, and when agriculture is slimmed down for the EU [European Union], there will also be unemployment in that sector." No Pension Bomb But even though the large age groups will gradually enter the pension age, and even though the public's unemployment problems will remain, Parkkinen does not believe there is a "pension bomb." With the national economy growing by a couple of percent annually, there will be enough money to pay pensions, although it means that the working population will have to pay higher pension contributions. But wages will also be higher in the future, he says. What a small country like Finland must safeguard in all situations is research and education, and in that respect, Parkkinen believes that we have intelligent and farsighted politicians. If we cut back too far on education and worsen its quality, we can say good-bye to all favorable development. One factor over which we have no control is environmental pollution on a global scale. Parkkinen says he is not worried by Western industrial production's influence on the environment, but at a time when the industrialized countries are reducing their discharges of pollutants, discharges of "greenhouse gases," for example, are increasing in the Third World. "Each generation leaves behind an environment that is poorer in natural resources than it was before, and what we have right now is a steadily deteriorating environment." Parkkinen points out, however, that he feels that Finnish ecology is well managed. He feels that globally, reducing environmental problems will require a kind of development aid for the environment. Pekka Parkkinen's view of the future we will bequeath to the next generation is rather positive. He says, however, that the farther into the future one tries to see, the harder it becomes.
