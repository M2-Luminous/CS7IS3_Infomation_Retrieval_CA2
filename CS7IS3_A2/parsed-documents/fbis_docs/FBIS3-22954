They said that "Brigadier General Salih Munsir al-Suyayli, governor of Aden and member of the YSP Political Bureau, ordered the expulsion of the northern members of central security from Aden to the north and the arrest of those who were planning to carry out the attack on al-Bid's aircraft."

They added that "the Iraqis, who came from the northern governorates, confessed that their mission was to damage a number of military aircraft belonging to the army in the south and to hijack two planes to Iraq."
