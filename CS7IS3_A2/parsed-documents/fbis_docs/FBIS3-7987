We interviewed Peter Zwack and Lajos Kupcsok on this issue. [passage omitted] [Bodnar] How would you characterize the Entrepreneurs' Party? [Zwack] We mainly wish to deal with economic issues. I would like to remind people that in 1990, before I became a party chairman, I suggested to [former] Prime Minister Jozsef Antall that an economic top ministry should be set up; today, the need for this is recognized by many people. It is very important for a government to be able to approach issues from their practical side. [Bodnar] What makes your party liberal? [Zwack] Not the fact that it is said to be liberal. From the beginning, the goal of our party is to be more than the party of 600-700,000 small and medium size entrepreneurs, we also want to open to the intelligentsia and others. [Kupcsok] I would like to mention two factors about the term liberal. One is that we want to reduce the state's intervention in the economy to the minimum and what is left should be operated with great deliberation. The other is that we reject all kind of racial, religious, or national discrimination. Ability and work, these our the two standards. [Bodnar] You are member of the so-called Liberal Bloc together with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], and the Agrarian Federation. What justifies the establishment of this bloc? [Zwack] We feel that a new Hungarian political culture has to be established; to solve the problems, we need cooperation instead of discord. The liberal bloc can be suitable for this. I think it is important to mention that, at first, the Entrepreneurs Party made an agreement with the Fidesz in October 1992, then with the SZDSZ, and the Agrarian Federation only joined us afterwards. Getting to government is the clear goal of the bloc. We feel that the government coalition did not fulfill the hopes of a large part of the population. Therefore, a change is needed. We firmly believe that socialist governing would not be advantageous for the country. It is very dangerous that a significant section of the population yearns for the "good old days," not knowing and not feeling the catastrophic consequences of this. In our view, however interesting the Bekesi program is, it is impossible to implement it. By its nature, a socialist economic program is distributive and, unfortunately, there is nothing to be distributed. This liberal center bloc is capable of establishing the conditions for an economic boom if it succeeds at the elections. I do not want to make false promises, we need everything but these. In my view, the situation is very difficult, putting the economy back on its feet will take many years of work, but the processes have to be speeded up. [passage omitted] [Bodnar] What relationship do you have with the government coalition? [Zwack] I am sorry that many people think I am against the government, this is a big mistake. I have many good acquaintances in the government and neither I nor the party are anti-government. As a matter of fact, only stupid people are against the government. I have problems with certain members of the government, and this will always be so, it unfortunately cannot be changed. I would be ready to extend my hand to them, but these people are unwilling. We have problems with certain -- mainly economic -- decisions of the government, and that it deals too much with ideological issues that are clearly damaging for the country. It might be enough to refer to the Csurka affair, the statement on the 15 million Hungarians, and the media war. [Bodnar] What are your views on your party's election chances? [Kupcsok] I very much hope that we will get into government and then we will be part of the government coalition. However, even if we do not get into legislation, we will be much stronger than now because we belong to the Liberal Bloc, therefore, even as a nonparliamentary party, we could help the next government much more effectively.
