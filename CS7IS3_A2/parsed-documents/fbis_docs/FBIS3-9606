Croat-Moslem conflicts in the south of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and in its central parts continue despite the agreement signed by representatives of these two peoples to form a federal state in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was signed in Washington on March 18, under strong pressure from the United States. Members of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) on Saturday morning set fire to a nursery school in Mostar, said a Moslem army statement. Five civilians were wounded on Friday in mortar attacks by ustashi, as the Sarajevo Radio reporter called the local Croat troops. The command of the 4th corps of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army (the Bosnian Moslem army) has rejected explanations by Croats that some 'extremist elements of the HVO' are violating the truce. Moslem units in the fronts in the wider region of Serb-controlled Doboj in northeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, continued offensive actions, this time against both Serb defence positions and villages, the information service of the First Krajina Corps of the Bosnian Serb army said on Saturday Morning. Bosnian Serb troops on Saturday managed to repulse an infantry attack by the Moslems northeast of Serb-controlled Teslic in northern Bosnia. An attempt by a Moslem subversive-terrorist group to penetrate deep into Serb territory in this part of the Teslic front was successfully thwarted, and two Moslem infantry attacks on the southern and southeastern sectors of the Trebava front were repulsed. Moslem forces on Saturday also launched mortar attacks against Serb villages on the right bank of the river Bosna. Strong Moslem attacks using mortars, anti-aircraft and infantry weaponry were recorded in the night between Friday and Saturday from their positions some 20km northwest of Zvornik, a town in northeastern Bosnia which is on the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Bosnian Serb troops returned strong fire to protect their positions. There were no casualties on the Serb side, the sources said. Moslems attacked Serb positions in the area of Konjic, Foca and Cajnice (southeastern Bosnia) with infantry and anti-aircraft weaponry from the wider region of Gorazde, the information service of the Herzegovina Corps said on Saturday.
