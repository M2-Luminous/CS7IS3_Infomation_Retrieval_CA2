"Full membership in the European Union is an absolute priority of Vienna's foreign policy at the moment," Mock said. Austria wants to share the responsibility for maintaining security in the European Union "in a very restless Europe" as an equal member. Austria's commitment to human rights became apparent during three major events in 1993. Vienna was the venue of the first Christian-Islamic Conference, the United Nations Human Rights Conference, and the first summit of the Council of Europe heads of state and governments. In spite of different views, the Human Rights Conference contributed to "strengthening the controls in enforcing human rights," Mock said.
