According to officials at the No.4 Institute of Surveys and Design of the Ministry of Railways, 529 of the 1,440 engineers and technicians involved in the surveys and design are women. The institute, based in this provincial capital of central China's Hubei Province, is responsible for the overall design of the trunk railway line linking south and north China. Some 125 woman engineers and technicians have been appointed as leaders in charge of professional designing -- about half of the leading technicians for the design of the whole Beijing-Kowloon Railway line. Chen Dajing, a woman engineer in her 50s, worked 448 extra hours last year, completing the design of 22 bridge culverts and re- checked the designs for 19 other bridge culverts, fulfilling her set task six months ahead of schedule. According to engineers in charge of the construction, China will use 105 items of new technology and equipment in the construction of this north-south trunk rail line, which are expected to greatly increase work efficiency and ensure the quality of the railway project.
