Potala Palace, which was built more than 1,000 years ago, is famous as the palace at the highest altitude in the world. Being the crystallization of the wisdom of the Tibetan people and the gem of Chinese culture, Potala Palace is the key object of protection by the state and the Tibet Autonomous Region. The safety technology and the security project is a new item in Potala Palace's full-scale repair and maintenance project, which has been going on for the last five years. The project includes an automatic system to fight fires, an automatic burglar detection system, a television monitoring system, and a command and communications system. The equipment is all technologically advanced by international standards. After the completion of the project, the screens in the control center will show the safety conditions throughout the palace, and the systems will perform the automatic fire fighting and burglar detection functions. It has been learned that the safety and protection project in Potala Palace is costing approximately 3 million yuan, and it is expected that it will be officially put into operation in early August.
