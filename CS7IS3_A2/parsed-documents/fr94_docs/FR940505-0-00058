FR940505-0-00058 FR940505-0-00016 The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;06&hyph;09␣Teledyne Continental Motors: Amendment 39&hyph;8895. Docket 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;12. Applicability: Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) (formerly Bendix) magnetos new and rebuilt TCM Model SC&hyph;20, Part Number (P/N) 10&hyph;500XXX&hyph;X series; Model SC&hyph;200, P/N 10&hyph;600XXX&hyph;X series; and Model S&hyph;1200, P/N 10&hyph;349XXX&hyph;X series, magnetos with Serial Numbers (S/N) J2793XXX(R) through J3193XXX(R), K0193XXX(R) through K3093XXX(R) and L0193XXX(R) through L2293XXX(R) inclusive, with capacitor, P/N 10&hyph;349276, with date code 93&hyph;40 or 93&hyph;42. In addition, all TCM Model SC&hyph;20, P/N 10&hyph;500XXX&hyph;X series; SC&hyph;200, P/N 10&hyph;600XXX&hyph;X series; and S&hyph;1200, P/N 10&hyph;349XXX&hyph;X series, magnetos that have capacitor, P/N 10&hyph;349276, identified with date code 93&hyph;40 or 93&hyph;42, installed after October 27, 1993. Also, any TCM or Bendix magneto regardless of serial number that was fitted after October 27, 1993, with capacitors P/N 10&hyph;349276, sold as individual replacement parts with date code 93&hyph;40 or 93&hyph;42. These magnetos are installed on but not limited to reciprocating engine powered Beech, Cessna, Maule, Mooney, Piper, and Robinson aircraft. Note: The ``X'' represents numbers in the P/N and S/N that have no significance in determining applicability: Only the first five digits are needed. The ``(R)'' at the end of the S/N indicates a rebuilt magneto. The absence of an ``(R)'' indicates a new magneto. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent possible injury or death to ground personnel due to a non-grounded magneto, accomplish the following: Note: Warning: Do not move propellers by hand on engines that may contain affected capacitors until the inspection procedures required by this airworthiness directive (AD) are completed. Ground personnel should avoid the propeller arc. (a) Within the next 10 hours time in service after the effective date of this AD, inspect affected magnetos for the presence of capacitor P/N 10&hyph;349276, in accordance with the Detailed Instructions, paragraphs 1, 1.1, and 1.2 of TCM Critical Service Bulletin (CSB) 641, dated February 1, 1994, and, if necessary, replace with a serviceable part as follows: (1) If the capacitor is marked with a date code other than 93&hyph;40 or 93&hyph;42, reinstall the capacitor in the magneto and metal stamp the letter ``E'' in accordance with the Identification paragraph of TCM CSB641, dated February 1, 1994, to show compliance with this AD. No further action is required. (2) If the capacitor is marked with either date code 93&hyph;40 or 93&hyph;42, replace with a serviceable capacitor of the same P/N but with a date code other than 93&hyph;40 or 93&hyph;42, and metal stamp the letter ``E'' in accordance with the Identification paragraph of TCM CSB641, dated February 1, 1994, to show compliance with this AD. (b) Prior to installation, inspect uninstalled capacitor, P/N 10&hyph;349276, and replace, if necessary, with a serviceable part, in accordance with the Detailed Instruction, paragraph 2.1 of TCM CSB641, dated February 1, 1994. Note: TCM Critical Service Bulletin CSB94&hyph;1 dated February 1, 1994, and Lycoming Service Bulletin 517 dated February 25, 1994, refers to this subject.
