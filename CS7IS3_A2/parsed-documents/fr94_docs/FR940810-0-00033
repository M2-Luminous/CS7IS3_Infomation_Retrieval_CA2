ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency is granting an exemption to the Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone nonattainment area from applicable oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) requirements found in the Clean Air Act (Act). Approval of the exemption would apply for various NO X including adoption and implementation of regulations addressing general conformity, transportation conformity, inspection and maintenance, reasonably available control technology, and new source review. A NO X exemption request was submitted by the State of Michigan on November 12, 1993. A subsequent letter dated May 31, 1994 clarified this earlier submittal. This request is based on the fact that the Detroit-Ann Arbor area has not monitored a violation of the ozone standard for a 3-year period; 1991 to 1993. Given this monitoring data, Michigan may petition for an exemption from the NO X requirements based on a demonstration that additional reductions of NO X would not contribute to attainment of the ozone standard. The rationale for this approval is set forth in this final rule; additional information is available at the address indicated below. Elsewhere in this Federal Register , EPA is proposing approval of, and soliciting public comment on, this requested SIP revision. If a comment, or a notice of intent to comment is received on this direct final rule by August 25, 1994, EPA will then use this rulemaking as a proposed rule. Comments received will be addressed in a separate final rulemaking. Unless this final rule is commented upon, no further rulemaking will occur on this requested State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision. This shortened comment period and expedited effective date is needed to follow provisions found in the Act which require EPA to either grant or deny exemption requests within 6 months of receipt. Although this notice may not be published within the timeframe specified by the Act, it is EPA's intention to try and publish as close to the 6 month deadline as possible. DATES: This final rule will be effective September 9, 1994, unless notice is received within 15 days of this publication that someone wishes to submit adverse comments. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Carlton T. Nash, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), EPA, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604&hyph;3590. Copies of the request and the EPA's analysis are available for inspection at the following address: (It is recommended that you telephone Douglas Aburano at (312) 353&hyph;6960 before visiting the Region 5 office.) EPA, Region 5, Air and Radiation Division, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604&hyph;3590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Douglas Aburano, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), EPA, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 353&hyph;6960. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On November 12, 1993 the State of Michigan submitted a petition to the EPA requesting that the Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the requirement to implement NO X RACT controls pursuant to section 182(f) of the Act. The exemption request is based upon monitoring data which demonstrate that the ozone standard has been attained in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area for a 3-year period; 1991 through 1993. II. Description and Analysis of State Submittal The NO X RACT petition was submitted in accordance with section 182(f) of the Act and a May 27, 1994 John Seitz memorandum entitled, ``Section 182(f) Nitrogen Oxides (NO X ) Exemptions_Revised Process and Criteria.'' According to this memorandum and a December 1993 EPA guidance document entitled, Guideline for Determining the Applicability of Nitrogen Oxides Requirements Under Section 182(f), NO X RACT and NSR requirements of section 182(f) do not apply if additional reductions of NO X would not contribute to attainment of the NAAQS for ozone. In an area that did not implement the section 182(f) NO X requirements, but did attain the ozone standard, it is clear that the additional NO X reductions required by section 182(f) would not contribute to attainment. In its submittal, the State included data from ozone monitors for the most recently recorded years, 1991&hyph;1993. These data showed that over this 3-year period a violation of the ozone standard was not monitored in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. This is the main criterion by which EPA judges 182(f) exemption petitions based on monitoring data. Given the fact that the Detroit-Ann Arbor area has not implemented the section 182(f) NO X requirements and has submitted adequate monitoring data showing no violations of the ozone NAAQS over the last 3 years in the area, EPA finds that the State submittal is approvable. Under the May 27, 1994 John Seitz memorandum and the December 1993 section 182(f) NO X guidance referenced above, the section 182(f) demonstration cannot be approved if there is evidence, such as photochemical grid modeling, showing that the NO X exemption would interfere with attainment or maintenance in the area petitioning for exemption or in any downwind areas. No such evidence exists. III. Final Action The EPA is granting the Detroit-Ann Arbor section 182(f) exemption petition based upon the evidence provided by the State and the State's compliance with the requirements outlined in the Act and in EPA guidance. However, it should be noted that this exemption is being granted on a contingent basis; i.e., the exemption will last for only as long as the area's ambient monitoring data continue to demonstrate attainment of the ozone NAAQS.
