NATO's National Armament Directory gave the green light for a study into the feasibility of the new program. The report must be submitted on 8 October to the Conference of National Armament Directors [CNAD]. Shortly after this, the Defense Planning Committee [DPC] will convene on a ministerial level, as Friedhart Sellschopp, head of the NATO Division of Ground Armaments, confirmed. In March last year, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner launched the concept of a new ground reconnaissance system which had to complement the AWACS air control system. The National Armament Directors of the member states were handed the task to explore the possibilities of a coordinated reconnaissance system. In June, 10 of the 16 member states began the preliminary technical studies into the ground reconnaissance system AGS [Alliance Ground Surveillance] under the leadership of Canadian Richard Oldford and German expert Friedhart Sellschopp. At the moment, two teams led by Belgian military commander Werner Gevers are preparing the final report. Although no precise figures about the cost price are known yet, Friedhhart Sellschopp is talking about billions of dollars: "One airplane alone costs 300 million dollars." The financial means should come from the participating states that receive substantial orders for their own industries in exchange. Smaller states like Belgium should not have to pay more than 10 percent of the cost price according to Sellschoop. Sellschoop says that the reconnaissance program must be given the highest priority. "The numerous crisis in different regions have emphasized the importance of crisis management. With the new ground reconnaissance system, any movement of enemy troops can be watched 24 hours a day. From Brussels to Antwerp, the most insignificant motion of a car can be detected. The information will be available to all member states so that each country can make the appropriate decisions immediately on a sovereign basis," the NATO expert says . The military circles are speaking of a "revolution."
