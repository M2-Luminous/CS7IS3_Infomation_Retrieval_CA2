Particularly noteworthy is the analysis of ARS fragments of DNA of cell organelles and plasmids as a possible means of engineering potential plant vectors. The work reported here represents the first time mitochondrial plasmid-like DNA of cotton has ever been identified and described. The mitochondrial DNA was isolated from etiolated cotton shoots via differential and equilibrium ultracentrifuging in a CsCl-Hoechst 33258 density gradient. Electron microscopy and electrophoresis in agar gel showed that the mitochondria of G. hirsutum L. (108-F) contain, in addition to the principal high-molecular-mass DNA, two mini-ring DNA of 6.5 and 2.4 kbp. The plasmid-like DNA was found to contain no appreciable traces of nuclear or plastid DNA.
