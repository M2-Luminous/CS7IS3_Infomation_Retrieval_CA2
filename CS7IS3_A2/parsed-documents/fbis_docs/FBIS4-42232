Rather, the high deficits in financial policy and the enormous state expenditures and tax quotas are putting a lasting strain on recovery. The bank loans to the public budgets are still expanding more quickly than those to domestic companies and private persons; this also inflates the money supply. The unbalanced situation of financial policy overstrains monetary policy. "I, too, am very worried that this might lead to potential inflation." This was said by Professor Dr. Reimut Jochimsen, president of the North Rhine-Westphalia Land Central Bank, in discussions with journalists. At the same time, Jochimsen expressed the hope that the difference between interest rates for short-term and long-term loans achieved meanwhile will stimulate the formation of monetary capital and will thus dampen the growth of the money supply. The opportunity for the discussion was provided by the results of the latest Land Central Bank study on the situation of in the land's most important industrial branches, which were presented and commented by Jochimsen. The poll shows that the economic situation in North Rhine-Westphalian industry is improving thanks to strong increases in foreign orders and stabilized domestic business, which has recently improved tremendously. Only 3 Percent Remain Pessimists Compared with the reference period in 1993, at the lowest point of the recession, the volume of orders to companies in the processing industry has increased by 2 percent during the first quarter of 1994; for the first time since the beginning of the downward slide in autumn 1992, the comparison with the previous year is positive again. In particular, the mood has changed in the largest German land. Only one-third of the polled companies describe the current business situation as "bad"; in the two preceding polls of autumn and spring 1993 this was stated by about half of the companies. The other two-thirds assessed the situation as "good" or "satisfactory." Four out of 10 companies expect a further improvement in the next six months; only about 3 percent expect a further deterioration of the situation. Steel Boom as in the Past? In particular, the steel industry is experiencing a strong upswing, it received one-fifth more orders than a year ago; here the sudden recovery of demand in road vehicle construction is having an effect. As Jochimsen stressed, steel production has almost achieved the level of summer 1992, before the beginning of the recession. Price increases are announced and already implemented. Following the structural changes, Jochimsen no longer rules out that the first bottlenecks in capacity might soon be felt in the steel industry. The plans for changes in the European steel industry, which failed half way through, can also be interpreted in this manner. Since road-vehicle construction, which benefits, among other things, from the economic recovery in Great Britain and in the United States and from the expensive yen, a key industry of German economy is starting to move again, the stimuli should soon be felt also in other sectors, Jochimsen added. Machine-building is also gradually overcoming its worst crisis of the postwar period. The same goes for the electrical industry. Here, however, there is still a lack of domestic demand. Consumer Goods Continue in Shadows The consumer-goods industry continues to lie in the shadows, where, in particular, the continuing structural problems of the textile and clothing industry have an effect, which entails constant shifts of production to cheaper foreign locations. After a slightly lower output last year, the construction sector has moved onto a course of growth again in 1994, driven by the boom in housing construction. Because of the usual lagging behind the orders, industrial output is gaining speed only gradually. The majority of the polled companies does not yet see any reason to declare an end to the current programs for cost reduction and restructuring, even if there are signs of a change in the way of thinking and the current forecasts for unemployment have been revised downward. Jochimsen: "Nothing would be more problematic than if now a more favorable economic development were misunderstood as a structural all-clear signal." Alliances for Asia A special part of the poll referred to the gradually increasing involvement of North Rhine-Westphalian companies in the promising markets in eastern and southeastern Asia, where the land, together with Baden-Wuerttemberg, is trying to pave the way, in the form of the German Industrial and Trade Center in Singapore, which was suggested by the Association of German Machine-Building Enterprises and is supported by Southwest Land Bank and West Land Bank. The companies see great opportunities, particularly in China, without overlooking the political and economic policy difficulties; in view of the dimension of this challenge, market plans and strategic alliances across companies, also with foreign partners, are taken into consideration, Jochimsen stressed. Among other things, North Rhine-Westphalia has started a cooperation initiative with the leading Chinese coal province of Shanxi, which is to open up more the new fields of business for the mining subcontractors represented there.
