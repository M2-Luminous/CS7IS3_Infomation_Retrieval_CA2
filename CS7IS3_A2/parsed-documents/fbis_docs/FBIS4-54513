[passage omitted] You addressed particularly sharp criticism at Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. You say that the policy was implemented by the wrong people and even by war criminals. Who have you been supporting in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which people, and which policy? [Mesic] In Bosnia-Herzegovina we support the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The people of Bosnia-Herzegovina are to choose who will represent them -- Croats and Muslims, and even Serbs who want Bosnia-Herzegovina. We follow this logic: The disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina would make possible the creation of a Greater Serbia. The Greater Serbia, strengthened by the so-called Srpska republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina, would never approve of the separation from Krajina and the areas they are currently holding in order for these areas to join Croatia. That would be practically impossible to do, and Croatia would be maimed. The danger for Croatia would be enormous if a Greater Serbia were created. This is why we want the world to adhere to the principles it advocates, which means that borders must not be changed and that Serbia must return to its borders. [passage omitted] [Announcer] You said that you will be oriented toward the future. In concrete terms, at the moment, how do you see the denouement of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Mesic] Currently the greatest danger is coming from those who want to prevent the implementation of the Washington Agreement. They are very loud and they do not stop short from public appearances. One cannot help wondering what they are doing behind the scenes. They want to prevent the main thing -- the implementation of the Washington Agreement -- by erecting certain barriers, by insisting on some details. [Announcer] Do you see the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina in a federation of Croats and Muslims? [Mesic] Of course. If we start procrastinating now -- on whether a Croat will be the prime minister or the president of the republic; whether this or the other one will hold the position in the first year -- that is completely irrelevant if we want Bosnia-Herzegovina to survive. If it does not happen this year, it will happen next year. One year is a short time. If there is goodwill and a political decision, there will be no problem. However, those who favored a division of Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot implement the Washington Agreement, and this should be stressed. We are in favor of its implementation, which means that we must force them to implement it through our influence. [Announcer] And, finally, what do you expect from the next session of the assembly? Will the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] have a majority? [Mesic] [passage omitted] The balance of power in the assembly has now changed. The relations have changed. Specifically, the HSP [Croatian Party of Right] is not what it used to be and neither are IDS [Istrian Democratic Assembly] and the HDZ. There is a new balance of power. We should sit down and make a gentleman's agreement. We must not consider each other enemies because we belong to different parties. [passage omitted]
