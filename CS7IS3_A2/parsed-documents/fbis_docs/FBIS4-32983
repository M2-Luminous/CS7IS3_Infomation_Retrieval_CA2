After signing the changes, which opened the door to in-depth change of the Political Constitution through a project reached by consensus among the seven blocs, the president sent a letter to Legislative Branch leader Dr. Luis Humberto Guzman. The essence of the presidential letter reads: "I think, however, that it is my duty as president of the Republic and chief of state to say clearly that I have reservations about the legality of these constitutional changes, because they change the procedure for guarantees established by the National Constituent Assembly that allows the regular National Assembly to enact partial changes to the Political Constitution of the Republic." The president added that "this is why I had not yet promulgated these, because my first and most important duty and responsiblity is to comply and enforce compliance with the Constitution of the Republic." SPEAKS OF DANGER The president thinks that "these changes jeopardize constitutional order because they leave the Constitution unprotected and exposed to changes by the parliament as if it were a regular law." But, "aware of the need to ease tension in relations among institutions and to build understanding between these two state branches, I have proceeded to promulgate them, in the understanding that subsequent changes to the Constitution will necessarily be the product of basic political consensus, at least between the state branches, as a guarantee of the feasibility of such changes, to ensure that they receive national approval." Finally, the president pointed out to the chief of the Legislative Branch that "for this reason I will support those changes that serve the homeland or common good above partisan interests or specific situations." Chamorro's decision is historic because this is the first time that changes to the Basic Law have entered into force. This law was approved by the AN [National Assembly] in late 1986 and entered into force on 10 January 1987 during a ceremony at Revolution Square, where 202 articles of the Constitution were signed by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. TIMELY DECISION Legislative sources told us yesterday evening that the presidential decision came right after the expiration of a deadline that the Executive Branch had established for the Political Council of Blocs regarding the sanctioning of the first changes to the Political Constitution. It was reported that the package of changes to the Political Constitution that continues to be secretly held by the Political Council of Blocs will be officially presented to the Legislative Branch within two weeks, at the latest, to comply with legislative procedures, which will necessarily lead to the establishment of a "special commission to change the Political Constitution." This "special commission" must -- within a prudent period -- establish a timetable for consultations on the project that will change a little over 50 percent of existing constitutional articles.
