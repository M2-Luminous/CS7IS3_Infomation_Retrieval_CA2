FBIS4-34269 "drlat117_k_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina _O_Media Notes: Economic Roundup _O_Media Notes: Economic Roundup 94P20890A 94P20890A CSO [Editorial Report] Businessmen Scrutinize Economic Policy The business sector "Group of Eight," composed of the Argentine Banking Association (ABRA), the Argentine Industrial Union (UIA), the Argentine Union of Construction (UAC), the Association of Argentine Banks (Adeba), the Commodity Exchange, the Chamber of Commerce (CAC), the Argentine Construction Board (CAC), and the Argentine Rural Society (SRA), has decided to meet regularly, "at intervals no greater than 30 days, to analyze key aspects of [the Argentine Government's] economic policy and its political and social implications," reported the 12 May Buenos Aires LA NACION. According to the daily, the current Constituent Assembly as well as the 1995 presidential elections are the reasons why this "exclusive" group of "business organizations most plugged into power" has decided to meet more frequently. Key topics discussed at the group's second meeting this year on 11 May were labor flexibility, privatizations in the provinces, and the deregulation of labor union and business sector pension plans. "Without labor flexibility, we won't be able to attack the scourge of unemployment," asserted Chamber of Commerce President Jorge Fiori. According to another report in the 11 May LA NACION, other topics on the agenda were the Argentine Government's social policy, exports, tariffs, and the desirability of lifting the economic state of emergency. "Even though there are issues still pending in the country, economic conditions are no longer uncertain," according to an unidentified leader of the Argentine Construction Board. Banks Seek Reduced Costs Bankers belonging to the Association of Argentine Banks (Adeba) have called for the elimination of taxes and other expenses which "significantly" push up the costs of doing business and thus the price charged for financial services, reported the 13 May Buenos Aires LA PRENSA. The main obstacles to cost reduction cited by Adeba bankers are: --the social security contribution; --the Institute of Banking Social Services (ISSB) contribution, the equivalent of 2 percent of banking commissions and interest. This expenditure, which is equal to 11.7 percent of bank personnel salaries and "eats up" 4 percent of administrative expenses, "must be abolished," insisted the bankers; --the absence of a tax deduction from gross earnings for banking activities in Buenos Aires, where 60 percent of financial operations take place. Such a tax deduction would save 7 percent of bank administrative costs; --physical security expenses, which absorb $500,000 monthly and constitute 2 percent of administrative expenses; --check-holding requirements, which cause high outlays for transfers; --minimum reserve requirements which do not include branch office assets and funds in transit. "Even though the peso system has a 40 percent reserve requirement, in reality it becomes 65 percent of deposits" since the branch office assets and funds in transit are not included, continued LA NACION. Eduardo Escasany, Adeba president and Banco de Galicia head, explained that "the 40 percent reserve is necessary because there is no guarantee on deposits." He added, however, that banks "should work with the additional 25 percent." Study of Provincial Financial Markets The Association of Argentine Banks (Adeba) and the Argentine Industrial Union (UIA) have formed a working group to study the causes of high interest rates in the provinces and their impact on small and medium-sized businesses (PYMES), reported the 13 May Buenos Aires daily LA PRENSA. The goal of the joint commission is to evaluate provincial financial markets and come up with solutions to the high cost of credit which hinders production. Former Economy Minister on Exports Trend While recognizing that Argentina's ratio of exports to Gross Domestic Product (5 percent) is "pitifully small," former Economy Minister Roberto Alemann has predicted that the country will increase exports due to a retooling of businesses, the recovery of the international economy, and better market access following the GATT agreement, according to the 8 May Buenos Aires LA NACION. After suffering with "the worst trade terms of the century" for the past two or three years, Alemann asserted, there would be substantial improvements for agricultural exports. He said it looked like the 40 million tons of grains that Argentina exported in 1993 might bring in $1 billion more during 1994 for a total of $5 billion. As a result of the GATT agreement, he added, Argentina has secured the sale of 11,000 tons per year of special cuts of high-quality meat to the European Union (EU) at a cost of $100 million, as well as an annual 20,000-ton quota from the United States. "Argentina may also benefit from a change in the European Union's meat stocks, which dropped 1 million tons in 1993 to less than 400,000." He explained that if these stocks continue to shrink at such a fast pace, by the end of 1994 nothing will be left, in which case meat prices may improve and Argentina may reclaim its role as a great meat exporter. Alemann concluded that, in general, the outlook for Argentine exports was favorable due to cuts in U.S. and EU subsidies, the reduction of quotas, and prospects for better prices. Regarding improvements for Argentine exports due to conditions inside the country, Alemann pointed to hydrocarbons. "Argentina is already producing around 40 million cubic meters of oil, a large portion of which is exported. The oil pipeline to Chile alone channels exports worth $500 million annually." He also mentioned "the enormous gas field recently discovered off the coast of Tierra del Fuego," another site under study in Salta, and the Loma de la Lata-Santiago de Chile gasline as other good potential sources of foreign exchange. The former minister added that currently there are 40 mining projects under way in Argentina. A $600 million investment has been announced for the Bajo de la Alumbrera site alone, while $100 million will be invested at Salar de Hombre Muerto. "All this production will be exported," asserted Alemann. "Argentina will be a great exporter of lithium and its by-products. For the first time, the country will be exporting large quantities of minerals, among them gold, copper, and silver. We'll have to give this sector a couple of years and the results may be startling." Alemann also predicted that the fishing sector would increase exports by $200 million in 1994. Argentine Businessmen `Prefer Domestic Market' According to Secretary for International Economic Negotiations Jorge Campbell, Argentine businessmen prefer the domestic market, reported the 8 May Buenos Aires LA NACION. In response to repeated criticism with regard to the slow growth of Argentine exports, Campbell explained that the trade balance is not meaningful unless it reflects permanent links that help sustain growth. "If sales are not sustainable over time, businesses, and therefore the economy, will most likely swing back and forth between export production and production directed at the domestic market." He said that one of the difficulties of boosting exports is that production aimed at the domestic market is "still more profitable." One of the challenges facing Argentina, he added, is to reach a point at which it makes no difference to businesses whether they sell to the domestic market or abroad. Campbell concluded that Argentina needs to develop an "export culture" that will contribute to "breaking through [Argentina's] isolation from the rest of the world."
