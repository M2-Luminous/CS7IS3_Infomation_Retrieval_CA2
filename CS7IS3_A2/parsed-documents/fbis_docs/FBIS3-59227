According to exclusive information secured by I MAKHI, the United States was represented at the meeting, which lasted 20-30 minutes, by U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher and high-ranking diplomatic officer Carolyn Huggins and the United Nations by Clark and Gustave Feissel. The UN secretary general's special representative briefed the Americans on his contacts and the problems and difficulties that surfaced and asked the Americans to help and contribute so that the Turkish side will withdraw the conditions set out in [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas' letter and that make discussion of ways to implement the confidence-building measures impossible. The same reliable sources note that Clark and Feissel expressed certainty that the road to begin discussing ways to implement the confidence-building measures will open up if the Turkish Cypriot side withdraws the three basic points from the conditions it set out in Denktas' letter. The same reliable sources said that for this reason and following a demand by the U.S. ambassador, the communique issued after the meeting of the five ambassadors included an explicit reference to the UN secretary general's report to the Security Council dated 1 July 1993. This report noted, among other things, that the secretary general's three documents on the confidence-building measures must be accepted in principle and without conditions by the two sides. The three points that Clark and Feissel noted prevent dialogue from beginning are: 1. Denktas' demand to operate the illegal Tymbou airport at the same time as Nicosia Airport reopens. This is something that will clearly give political advantage to the Turkish Cypriot side, since UN permission to operate the occupied airport will, as a result, constitute recognition of the pseudostate. 2. The "security" points the Turkish Cypriot leader raises and the conditions set out for handing over the whole of the fenced-off area of Famagusta. 3. The "possibility" of Denktas demanding that the United Nations retake the town if he is not satisfied with the measures. [passage omitted]
