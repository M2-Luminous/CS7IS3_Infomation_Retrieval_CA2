The election party congress at the end of February is supposed to proceed with as few ideological skirmishes as possible. Commissions have therefore worked out broad program proposals that present disputed alternatives to a vote in only a few points. A failure, however, was the project "Unity" project in the foreign policy area. After the end of the "Cold War" and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the time has come for a "new foreign policy," states the guiding proposal of the federal board for the election party congress. Instead of the "traditional foreign policy that pursues international policy in the national interest," the Alliance Greens want "a German policy in the international interest." They therefore favor a "concept of radical disarmament and self-integration in reformed international institutions" such as the United Nations and the CSCE. The realpolitik camp of the party has no difficulties with such general formulas that arose under the guidance of Helmut Lippelt, member of the federal board. Differences show up where it is specifically a matter of the future of the Bundeswehr, NATO, and blue helmet missions. This is seen this week in extensive motions for amendments presented by the realpolitik camp for the party congress in Mannheim at the end of February. So far they have been signed, among others, by Achim Schmillen, a scientific associate of the Alliance Green group in the Bundestag, Hamburg realo Krista Sager, Reinhard Weisshuhn from Berlin, and Reinhard Buetikofer from Baden-Wuerttemberg. The signers favor a long-term continuance of NATO. They want to proceed with the disarmament of the Bundeswehr in a less radical manner. In their view, Central and East European states should be offered access to a system for collective security. The "primary objective" of Greens foreign policy ought to be "the improvement of the protection of human rights." From this demand, the authors derive a duty to "intervene in the human rights conditions of other societies and states." Spokesman of the federal board Ludger Volmer, who belongs to the left wing of the party, is counting on a tough fight in Mannheim: "If the motions for amendments are accepted, this ultimately means a reversal of our peace policy." As a result, he fears the expansion of NATO to the east and attempts to have human rights ultimately guaranteed through military intervention. Last year, after vigorous debate, a special party congress of the Greens had spoken out against military intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Achim Schmillen considers the board's motion to me completely inadequate. If the Greens persist in this, the Union and FDP [Free Democratic Party] would present them as a "security risk" in the election campaign for the Bundestag. The guiding proposal of the federal board rejects an expansion of NATO to the east, for this would increase the "danger of a military confrontation." What it calls for is a "political initiative to dissolve NATO." In its place, it proposes the restructuring of the CSCE into a nonmilitary security organization. The Bundeswehr, states the proposal, cannot "be dissolved overnight." Schmillen's motions for amendments, for which he expects the support of the realpolitik land associations in Hesse, Baden-Wuerttemberg, and Saxony, is likewise counting on a "strengthening of the CSCE process" as the basis for a collective security system. The CSCE is "already showing much promise of being able to meet an expanded notion of security that encompasses not only military strength but also the guarantee of human rights, democracy, development, and transparency." The way to a common European perspective on security policy cannot "exlude NATO." In the long term, it is to be brought into the CSCE process as its "security-policy arm."
