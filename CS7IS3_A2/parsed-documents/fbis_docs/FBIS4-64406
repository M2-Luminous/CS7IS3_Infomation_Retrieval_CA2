A study of protective coverage for the jobless published in the central bank's most recent economic bulletin says "Spain's welfare benefits are among the highest in the European Community." The report says that continuing with the present system of benefits "will not eliminate certain general and inherent problems," including the apparent indifference of unemployed Spaniards to finding a job, the onerous fiscal burden the situation imposes on the state, and the high cost to employers of personnel-related overhead. All these tendencies seem to become more pronounced in times of recession, says the bank, which is headed by Luis Angel Rojo. The central bank points out that due to a substantial augmentation of protective coverage during the last years of the economic boom, economic authorities were forced to introduce cutbacks later on. Without expressly arguing for new cuts, the article makes clear that those already made are not enough to dispel uncertainties about the future. In 1992, a decree-law known as the "decretazo" reduced unemployment payments from 80 to 70 percent of prior wage level, at the same time as it shortened maximum duration of payments from one-half to one-third of the time that the worker had been contributing to the unemployment insurance system. Just three months ago, the 1994 budget companion measures included a reduction of the minimum unemployment benefit to 70 percent of minimum wage for jobless persons without dependents, whereas earlier the floor had been set at 100 percent. Moreover, beginning this year, jobless persons have been required to contribute to Social Security [out of their unemployment benefits] and pay income tax on those subventions. But the Bank of Spain argues that unemployment benefits in Spain are still too generous. "The problem lies in having a level of protection that covers the contingency of unemployment without downward pressures to contain costs. In the case of Spain, it does not appear that this critical factor of cost containment has been realized, and maintaining the system is very costly" in this respect, the report asserts. "The high level of unemployment makes it all the more difficult to efficiently manage available resources--inadequate as they usually are--and to keep INEM [National Employment Institute] running on a sound financial basis," the report continues. In the central bank's opinion, the high ratio of jobless to workers "presupposes substantial financing from sources external to the system itself." The report compares unemployment protection in Spain with the rest of the European Union, a comparison that shows systems vary substantially from one country to another. For example, a head of family in Holland may collect as much as 99 percent of his previous salary, and in Denmark up to 90 percent. On the other hand, in Greece the figure is 40 percent and in Ireland only 35 percent, for unmarried persons. In Italy, surprisingly, the portion of prior wage an unemployed person can collect varies from as low as 20 percent to as high as 80 percent. Many countries in the Union have systems in which benefits are determined by a complex calculation factoring in the age of the unemployed person, sectoral agreements, etc., while in some countries the amount of benefit does not even depend on the wage the beneficiary had been paid. In some countries the unemployed pay taxes, and in others they do not. Many countries, Spain among them, vary the amount of benefits according to the size of the jobless person's family. Only Belgium maintains payments from a contribution-supported unemployment insurance fund indefinitely; in other states, insurance benefits are eventually exhausted and replaced--usually by welfare allotments, i.e., payments that bear no relation to earlier contributions to the insurance fund. The report concedes that unemployed Spaniards are disadvantaged in two respects: the minimum pay-in period before eligibility for benefits, and housing assistance. Spain is among the countries that require employees to have worked the longest time before being entitled to benefits from the contributive plan, and it is one of the few countries, along with Greece and Portugal, that provides no housing assistance. Spanish Employers Pay Highest Employee Taxes in European Union Spanish employers pay proportionally more into the national unemployment protection system than their counterparts elsewhere in the European Union. Employers in all Community countries contribute more to the fund than employees, but in the case of Spain the employer contribution is quintuple that of workers (5.6:1, to be precise). This is a much higher ratio than obtains in the countries that followed Spain into the Community--Greece (3:1), Ireland (2.5:1), and Portugal (2.2:1). In Germany, employers and workers contribute equally to the financing of unemployment subsidies. Despite INEM's large deficits, our country's system is not one of the most heavily state-financed. In countries such as Denmark, Ireland, Holland, and France, public subventions contribute more to financing of the system than do employer and employee withholdings, while in the United Kingdom and Portugal, the state's contribution is only just enough to cover any deficit. Of course, Spain is experiencing a higher rate of unemployment than any other Community country--in fact, ours is twice as high as the Community average of slightly over 10 percent. Spain has an additional liability: A relatively smaller percentage of its total population is in the work force, primarily because of the still very limited assimilation of women into the labor market.
