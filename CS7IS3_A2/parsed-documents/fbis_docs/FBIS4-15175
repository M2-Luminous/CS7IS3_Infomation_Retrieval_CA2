FBIS4-15175 "drsov067_u_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Latvia Discussions on Bases Ruled Out Discussions on Bases Ruled Out LD0604200694 Riga Radio Riga Network in Latvian 1900 GMT 6 Apr 94 LD0604200694 Riga Radio Riga Network Latvian BFN [Text] The government of the Republic of Latvia categorically states that it has not agreed, does not agree, and never will agree to the creation of a military base by the Russian Federation, nor to the testing of new armaments and military technology on Latvian territory, and it rejects any possibility of discussion on these issues, says a statement adopted at the extraordinary session of the Cabinet today concerning the decree signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 5 April on the creation of Russian military bases in the CIS states and Latvia. The statement says that the order of the Russian president sharply contradicts the draft treaties prepared by the Latvian and Russian delegations, initialled on 15 March, on troop withdrawal, and the order can be regarded as Russia's unwillingness to sign these treaties. The Latvian Government views this order as blatant bowing to pressure from the reactionary imperialist circles in Russia> It demands an explanation from the Russian Federation concerning this order, and it also demands again the withdrawal, without reservation, of all the Russian troops and military personnel who are illegally on Latvian territory. Latvian State President Guntis Ulmanis also says in a statement that Yeltsin's announcement creates justified fears for the intended meeting of the Latvian and Russian presidents and the possible development of political dialogue. It does not testify to the stability of Russia's internal and external politics, and it reduces faith in Russia as a partner in treaties. In the past few hours Ulmanis has tried to talk with Leonid Mayorov, commander of the Baltic Military District, and the Russian president's administration, but he has received no reply. This proves a certain evasiveness about offering an explanation, the statement says. Latvia will never allow the creation of a Russian military base on its territory, Ulmanis says.
