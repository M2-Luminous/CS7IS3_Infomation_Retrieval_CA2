This acquisition makes the Netherlands company the first foreign company to acquire a share in the Indonesian telecommunications market. PTT Telecom describes the stake in BEC as being of strategic interest. The Netherlands company is predicting further growth on the Indonesian market, from where it intends to expand into Southeast Asia. At the end of last year, PTT Telecom already concluded a cooperation agreement with the Indonesian state-owned telecommunications company Telkom. However, this did not result in any specific initiatives. At the time, B. Verwaayen, a director of PTT Telecom, said that the Netherlands company wanted to participate in the imminent rapid growth in Indonesia. Indonesia has a total of 187 million inhabitants, but has [an average of] less than two lines connected per 100 inhabitants. Telkom wants to increase the number of connected lines to at least 7 million within five years. Bakrie Electric Company is a subsidiary of Bakrie and Brothers, a conglomerate active in the steel sector, plantations, chemicals, communications, and immovables. BEC has more than 121,000 telephone lines (5 percent of the total number of lines in Indonesia -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note). The revenue derived from their operation is shared with Telkom. At the same time, BEC is involved in establishing telephone networks in Jakarta and Bandung, markets which comprise at least 250,000 and 30,000 lines respectively. These networks are being laid and operated by a separate company, Ratelindo, in which BEC owns a 55-percent stake and Telkom a 45-percent stake. Of the 90 million dollars paid by PTT Telecom for its stake in BEC, Bakrie and Brothers is investing 72 percent in its subsidiary. The rest will go to other Bakrie companies, according to Tanri Abeng, the general manager of Bakrie Electronic. [passage omitted]
