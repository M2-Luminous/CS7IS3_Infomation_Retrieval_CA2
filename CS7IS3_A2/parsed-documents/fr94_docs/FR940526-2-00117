The scope of this multi-year engagement has become more comprehensive by virtue of special research projects, seasonal pricings, expanded marketbasket pricings and other efforts. Runzheimer believes that living-cost research is a dynamic process, not a static one, and that fresh research and analysis will enhance further the quality of the survey and the findings. Moreover, we believe that planned, ongoing interaction with OPM will aid the process and improve accuracy. 7.3␣Recommendations As noted earlier in this report, Runzheimer and OPM are researching the issue of including income taxes in the living-cost surveys and analyses. We believe that the research will show that income taxes represent a significant portion of living expenses_a portion that varies from one area to the next. As also noted in the report, Runzheimer recognizes that it applied the same salary levels and CES data this year as it did in the 1990 surveys. We commend OPM for introducing new Federal employment weights and urge OPM to continue with its plans to introduce gradually new CES data and salary levels in future surveys.
