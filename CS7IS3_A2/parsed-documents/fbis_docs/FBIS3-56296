Our observer Yuliy Semenov has the details and is on the phone: [Semenov] Hello again from the Kremlin. The Kremlin is magnificent, as ever, but both presidents and their assistants have other things on their minds, working hard since early morning. Several minutes ago the trilateral meeting smoothly turned into a bilateral one. Documents on the results of the meeting between the three presidents connected with the problem of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament have been signed: a joint statement, which has the status of a treaty, an appendix to it, and letters that the delegations exchanged, setting out their specific views. The essence of what has taken place is that the agreement that has been reached reflects a balance of interests. Each side had to make some concessions, but the final result is a victory for all--a victory for the principle of the non-proliferation of nuclear arms. Two hundred nuclear warheads will be transported from Ukraine into Russia over the next 10 months, and the withdrawal timetable will be agreed on. It is not being made public because it is a working schedule. The United States and Russia extend security guarantees to Ukraine. Great Britain, as is known, has already joined in this. Russia will compensate Ukraine in an equitable and honest way--as Boris Yeltsin put it--for its nuclear fuel, and a proportion of Ukraine's financial debt to Russia is wiped off as part of this compensation. For its part, the United States will substantially assist Russia and Ukraine in the implementation of the accords, and this naturally includes material assistance. All the participants in the meeting have appraised these results as a breakthrough. Replying to journalists' questions following the signing of the documents--a brief meeting took place--Yeltsin said that this was a historic day for the nuclear security of the whole world and for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and was an important step in world disarmament. Bill Clinton's view is that by agreeing to sign these documents and to resolve problems, Ukraine has made its position in the world weightier, having strengthened the security of the United States, Russia, Ukraine, and world security as a whole. Clinton said that the potential for nuclear espionage, terrorism, and blackmail has been diminished. This will make it possible both for Russia and Ukraine to raise their living standards for their citizens. His view is that Ukrainian prestige will grow in the world; more people and states will wish to cooperate with Ukraine, and Ukraine will be altogether better off as a result. Finally, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said that his view was that this step would help strengthen everyone's security and the security of Ukraine in particular, because it was precisely in the U.S. and Russian guarantees--their nuclear umbrella--that Ukraine saw its security. If we are friends with Ukraine [as heard] and Russia, nothing will threaten us. Currently, as I am speaking, the Russian-American dialogue has been resumed--a plenary session of both delegations with all officials present is taking place in the Yekaterinskiy Hall in the Kremlin. A whole package of U.S.-Russian documents will subsequently be signed, to be followed by a news conference, during which we will be given complete information.
