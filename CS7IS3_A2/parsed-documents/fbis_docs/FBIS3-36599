During the meeting Aliyev said that development of political, and economic relations with Russia is of a strategic importance for Azerbaijan. He also said that Baku will do anything to maintain the many sided relations with its northern neighbour. Touching upon the Russia's mediation role in the regulation of the Armenian-Azeri conflict, Geydar Aliyev said, that "Armenian party forwards the unacceptable conditions, and what a shame that Special Russian Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov, in fact, took a pro-Armenian position." In his turn Russian Ambassador said that "Moscow understands the processes happening in Azerbaijan and the positions of our countries coincide in many aspects." Shonia also said that Russian leadership is ready for any cooperation with Azerbaijan. Then the meeting continued behind the closed doors. Meanwhile, as a source at the Russian Foreign Ministry told the Moscow correspondent of TURAN news agency, Moscow began "twisting Azerbaijan's arms" recently, trying to force it to receive the Russian plan for the regulation of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. According to the information available, Russia insists on the acceptance of the plan, presented by Vladimir Kazimirov last week. As reported the idea of the plan is - the parties to the conflict declare cessation of hostilities, then Russian troops are stationed in the conflict zone, and the Armenian forces withdraw from the southern regions of Azerbaijan (Dzhebrailskiy, Fizuliskiy, Agdamskiy). After all this is implemented, the sides will begin the discussion of the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh and the question of the Armenian withdrawal from Kelbadzharskiy region of Azerbaijan.
