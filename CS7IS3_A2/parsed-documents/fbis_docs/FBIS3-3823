Li Peng originally planned to visit the five countries in the summer of 1993, but the visit was postponed for health reasons. It is said that the nationality issue will be the main subject to be discussed during the upcoming visit. The Republic of Mongolia [as published] attaches importance to Li Peng's visit. Senior Mongolian officials will visit Beijing in early April to discuss the arrangements for Li Peng's visit with the mainland Chinese authorities. Although the Mainland Chinese authorities recognize Mongolia's independent status, few senior Chinese officials have visited Mongolia in the past, and Mongolia has always kept a wary eye on China. Li Peng's visit will be the first visit by a Chinese premier to Mongolia, and this is of great significance for Mongolia. In the Cold War period, Mongolia survived amid the balance of the two great powers, the Soviet Union and mainland China. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's influence in Mongolia decreased, and mainland China's influence gradually increased. In recent years, large numbers of Chinese people entered Mongolia, and this gave the Mongolian authorities cause for serious concern, as they feared that Beijing might increase its control over Mongolia along with the increasing Chinese immigrants to the country. On the other hand, Mongolia needs mainland China's cooperation in the field of economic development. For example, the Tumen Jiang Development Project -- which incorporates the joint participation of mainland China, Russia, Japan, and North and South Korea -- will give Mongolia an important opportunity to seek a maritime outlet for its inland economy, and Mongolia has consistently been enthusiastic about the project. Li Peng will also visit four Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. In recent years, radical Muslim movements have been prevailing in various Central Asian countries and have had a major impact on China's Muslim-inhabited areas. There have been increasing conflicts between Muslims and Han people in China, and Chinese Muslims have developed stronger separatist ideas. Reportedly, during his visit, Li Peng will discuss this issue with leaders of the Central Asian countries and will try to seek a way to check communication between radical Muslims in Central Asia and Muslims within China.
