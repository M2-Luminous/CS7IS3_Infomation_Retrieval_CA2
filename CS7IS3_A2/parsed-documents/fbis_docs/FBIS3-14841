The letter was passed over today by presidential adviser Georgiy Satarov. The letter says the deputies used the notion of "political amnesty" instead of the "pardon" term. Referring to the presidential message, Boris Yeltsin also reminded the speaker that civil reconciliation does not mean all-forgiveness and clemency should not run counter to the law and morals. The president offered deputies of the lower parliament chamber to improve the resolution and bring it in correspondence with the constitutional norms. Yeltsin also considers it necessary to elaborate a criterion of politicians' responsibility for their decisions, says the letter.
