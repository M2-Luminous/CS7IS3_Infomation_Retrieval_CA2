To the bitter end? "I am prepared to lay down in front of Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies] in order to get this law passed. I am prepared to enter into an alliance with the devil in order to succeed." Mario Segni has finished keeping Lent. Today, it is his turn to speak, epitomizing the defeated. He has seen his home burnt down, the home which he built with his own hands: the new electoral law, the prime minister's direct election. This was supposed to mark the renewal of democracy. He was supposed to be the new leader. Everything went up in smoke. The [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi bulldozer first knocked him down and then crushed him. The enemy troops even conquered the Sassari stronghold. Now he has to start again from scratch. He has 12 deputies and four senators with him. Little more than nothing at all. [Caporale] From where will you start? [Segni] From TV. From a profound and thorough reform of the broadcasting system. The Mammi law [on broadcasting] is a farce. We need serious rules. Here in Italy we are facing a problem which is the number one problem in terms of maintaining a democratic system. In no other western country is there such a close association between a politician, who is a candidate for the premiership, and a monopoly of private information. [Caporale] Is it only now that you have become aware of this anomaly? [Segni] We were aware of this risk also during the election campaign, but I must admit that we had not realized the seriousness, the sheer extent of the problem. We made a mistake, and the fact that someone like myself, with so many commitments, has no time to watch TV, must also be blamed for this. Can you imagine that until yesterday evening I had never watched TG4 [fourth channel TV news]? It is really a disgrace. It is such a farce that I find it almost incredible. [Caporale] Do you think it was the TV networks that enabled Berlusconi to win? [Segni] Of course, it cannot be denied that they had a decisive impact. Without the TV cameras, Forza Italia could not have become a winning idea. [Caporale] For his part, [Northern League Secretary] Bossi is looking for you to discuss federalism. [Segni] I know people will find it hard to believe this, but nobody has approached me yet. [Caporale] If he does approach you, will you agree to meet him? Considering he torpedoed the agreement that you had just reached with Maroni [League lower house floor leader]... [Segni] He has not yet approached me. If and when he does, I will know what to reply. [Caporale] What? [Segni] Before any other discussion, we must tackle the media issue, including both the press and broadcasting. First we must tackle TV and the newspapers, and then federalism, taxation, and what not. The constitutional review, the reshaping of the state, if they must take place, must be carried out only after democratic rules have been fully restored. [Caporale] What are you proposing? [Segni] I am thinking in terms of a single RAI [state broadcasting company] network, and a single Fininvest network, and no shared interests with the press. It should no longer be possible to get around this by transferring assets to family members. It is shameful that the Mammi law allows this. But, make no mistake, I would like to stress that this aim of ours should not be interpreted as an attempt to get back at Berlusconi. In fact, I would be very glad to hear that Forza Italia also considers this issue an absolute priority. [Caporale] The rules governing the media have become your fixation. Are you perhaps thinking in terms of a referendum? [Segni] I have not yet thought in those terms. Of course, moving in that direction is open to us. [Caporale] In the meantime, we are faced by the government problem. [Segni] We had warned that the Right, just like the Left, was a sum of opposing forces, not a homogeneous alignment. Berlusconi cheated the voters, there is no doubt about it. It was a contrived victory. It was contrived by the TV networks, and handed over to Italians in the form of a ready-made ballot to be placed in the ballot box. These considerations, however, cannot conceal the truth. And the truth is that the Right has won. Of course, I can see the winners already jumping at each other's throats. In fact, they are using bazookas against each other. I am tempted to tell Italians: We had warned you that this would happen. But, at this point, the victors must try to govern the country. Italy is waiting for a government. [Caporale] What if they do not succeed? Will we go back to the polls? [Segni] No, it is madness to dissolve a parliament which must still be built. If this coalition declares itself bankrupt, other avenues must be found. [Caporale] Which? [Segni] It is up to the president of the republic to find them. [Caporale] If Berlusconi fails, would you be prepared to lead a caretaker government? [Segni] No, absolutely not. It is high time for me to say what I think, loud and clear. I did not win, I am outside this race. I will do my job as a deputy, in the opposition. [Caporale] By the way, some people have invited you, in no uncertain terms, to pack up and leave the Chamber of Deputies, too. You, the referendum leader, were flunked by the Sassari voters in your uninominal constituency. You only made it into parliament thanks to the proportional parachute -- meaning the system against which you had fought. [Segni] I have given this some thought too. If I am back in parliament, it is only because our banner won an unexpected success in the proportional ballot. However, you must not forget that the little space we had on TV was only used to publicize the single joint banner with the Popular Party [PPI], the "Pact for Italy." Not a word was ever said of the other banner. To this you must add that we were absent in no less than 10 constituencies, and that we were not given a cent to explain that there was also a "Segni Pact" on the gray ballot. Despite such a catastrophe (in fact, I was sure we would not reach a quorum), our banner, in the proportional round, almost obtained 5 percent of the vote. If we had been present throughout the national territory, we could have easily obtained 8 or 9 percent -- which is the result obtained by the League. This is why I am still here. [Caporale] Will your Pact constitute a separate group from the PPI group? [Segni] We will be an autonomous group, although we will have a consultative pact with the other group. [Caporale] Why is this? Have problems arisen also in the center? [Segni] No, we had decided to move in this direction before going together into the election campaign. [Caporale] Are you concerned that some of your deputies may "betray" you to side with the victors? [Segni] This is not the case, and will not be the case. [Caporale] It is being said that the Pact's tax expert Giulio Tremonti would also find a place in a Berlusconi government. [Segni] I do not believe so, not in the least. [Caporale] Deputy Segni, if you could go back, would you follow the same road all the way? [Segni] This is a difficult question, a whole new interview would be necessary to answer it. We all make mistakes. [Caporale] Are you thinking of the mistake made with Achille Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS]? [Segni] No, despite everything, I believe I was right to say clearly what I thought, and to part company. The PDS has always believed it was the motor, the pivot, the hub. Let us not forget what happened barely a month after the referendum. Already in July, the PDS had reached an agreement with [Rete leader] Orlando and Rete, and was preparing to reach one with Communist Renewal. You can imagine what would have happened in December, after the victory in the local elections. The PDS felt that it was the boss, this is the truth. [Caporale] Does the same apply to Democratic Alliance [AD]? [Segni] The fact that AD has had none of its people elected under their own banner is an indication of its political marginality compared to Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters]. My challenge, our challenge, was something different: countering the Left by means of a genuine liberal-democratic option. [Caporale] You did not succeed. [Segni] But we have all the time in the world to try again.
