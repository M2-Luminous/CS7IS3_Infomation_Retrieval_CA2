FBIS4-37371 "drnes119_c_94002" FBIS-NES-94-119 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Egypt Northern Yemen Envoy on Cease-Fire, U.S. Statement Northern Yemen Envoy on Cease-Fire, U.S. Statement NC2106101294 Cairo MENA in Arabic 0920 GMT 21 Jun 94 NC2106101294 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Cairo, 21 Jun (MENA) -- Following his meeting with President Mubarak today, Yemeni Presidential Council Member 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani expressed his pleasure, noting that he had conveyed a message to President Mubarak from Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on the present situation in Yemen and bilateral ties, which he described as strong and solid. The Yemeni official hoped the Yemeni problems would remain among the Yemenis alone. If foreign intervention stops, we will be better able to solve the Yemeni problems through dialogue, he said, noting that there was a dialogue for nine months before military operations broke out. He added that the Yemeni Government is prepared to continue that dialogue and stop all military operations, provided that the other side stops and abides by the cease-fire. 'Abd-al-Ghani pointed out that the Yemeni Government has repeatedly announced a cease-fire, but the other side has always violated it and not respected it. He reiterated his country's compliance with the UN Security Council resolution, affirming that they are doing their utmost to facilitate the mission of the UN Secretary General's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi. He added that his government has voiced its readiness to cooperate with all the parties in stopping the fighting in the Republic of Yemen and its readiness to sit with the other side in any place in the Republic of Yemen to resolve the present situation peacefully. Asked to comment on the recent U.S. statement on the situation in Yemen, he said: We have always abided by the cease-fire and are prepared to stop fighting immediately if the other side complies. We are also prepared to sit at the negotiating table within the framework of legitimacy and the Republic of Yemen, he added. Responding to a question on north Yemen's position on the presence of UN observers, the Yemeni president's envoy said that the UN Security Council resolution does not provide for the presence of international observers. He said: To spare the blood of the Yemeni people, we suggested to the UN secretary general's envoy the enhancement of the role of the Military Committee that was formed by Yemenis in the past, and which included the Sultanate of Oman, Jordan, and the U.S. and French military attaches in Sanaa. We are willing to expand this committee in order to work for a cease-fire through it. That committee, which is actually in existence, can monitor the suspension of military operations until a cease-fire is enforced, he said. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani thanked President Mubarak and big sister Egypt for its constant efforts to stop the loss of Arab blood and for its eagerness to establish peace and stability in Yemen and the entire Arab region. Asked whether it is possible to hold a referendum on unity in south Yemen, the presidential envoy said that unity was established by popular decision and that such a referendum was conducted under the umbrella of the multiparty system and political pluralism. Noting that the results of the referendum reflected support for unity by an overwhelming majority, he said that "the secessionists are a few who do not represent Yemen and want to impose secession by force." The Yemeni envoy added that it is up to the Yemeni people to decide. Had the Yemeni people not protected unity, it would not have existed in its present form, as represented by the legitimate forces' control over most of the country. He emphasized that these forces are capable of silencing "the rebels" wherever they might be and settling the matter militarily if they want. "But they do not want to shed more blood," he said. In an implicit reference to Aden, 'Abd-al-Ghani accused the other side of striking at vital installations and petroleum establishments. The last thing they did was bombard the trade center in Mocha and the adjacent city, which led to the martyrdom of 17 persons and the injury of more than 30 persons, he said. Commenting on President Mubarak's ideas during the meeting that continued for well over two hours, the Yemeni envoy said: President Mubarak put forward valuable and useful ideas that all focused on stopping the bloodshed and turning to dialogue. I will convey these ideas to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. Stating that he would convey the message fully to President Salih, 'Abd-al-Ghani expressed his optimism that the ideas President Mubarak put forward would have a positive impact in the future. We hope all Arab brothers will help us stop fighting and sit at the negotiating table. They can also help us by refraining from interfering politically in the problem, either by Arabizing or internationalizing the issue, he stressed. Touching on the role of the Arab League, the Yemeni envoy said: We are against subjecting any internal Yemeni affair to discussion at an Arab or international forum, because the League's Constitution does not entitle it to look into the internal affairs of any state. Yemen is a founder of the Arab League and a signatory of its Charter, he said, adding: We have explained that this issue is none of the League's business. We are not belittling the League; we are respecting its Charter, he said, stating that the UN Charter as well does not entitle the organization to look into states' internal affairs.
