Hong Kong Governor Patten said that he wished to return home at the end of his service here by taking off from the new airport. Now, it seems that his wish will probably come to nothing. Unless there is a dramatic solution of the dispute over the political system, or the Chinese side can really handle political and economic issues separately, there will be no chance of smoothly carrying out the new airport project. Even though the two sides are forced to resume talks, nothing will come of it. Kai Tak Airport Was Built Half a Century Ago The present Kai Tak Airport was built 50 years ago, and its facilities and capacity have reached the limit. Last year, Kai Tak Airport handled 24.5 million passengers, exceeding the maximum figure originally set. If the new airport cannot be put to use in three to four years, the load that Kai Tak will have to face will be inconceivable. According to the figures provided by the Civil Aviation Department, a total of 6,700 flights were refused landing at Kai Tak Airport last year, which means 1.4 million passengers were unable to come to Hong Kong. This is absolutely detrimental to the development of Hong Kong's tourism, industry, and commerce. Direct Flight Across the Taiwan Strait Will Ease the Pressure on Kai Tak Airport The Chinese side is not opposed to the construction of a new airport. However, it is politically unacceptable to China if the project is allowed to be completed before 1997 by Britain and the Hong Kong Government, and there may be other factors for consideration in terms of economics and practice value. First, one of the major causes that made the saturation date of the Kai Tak Airport come earlier than expected is that large numbers of Taiwan and mainland passengers are travelling via Hong Kong, who account for approximately 40 percent of all the passengers arriving here. If Taiwan and the mainland can make certain arrangements for direct flights, and mainland passengers can use the Shenzhen airport which is close to Hong Kong and the Macao airport which will soon go into operation as much as possible, the pressure on Kai Tak will be considerably lightened. In a period of time to come, the problems that have hampered coordinated operations of Kai Tak and its nearby airports will be reduced or resolved following the handover of Hong Kong and Macao to mainland China one after the other. So long as the transregional cooperation is smoothly carried out, the saturation point of Kai Tak may be put off for some time, thus providing sufficient conditions for the new airport to be gradually completed after 1997. Moreover, the official completion of the new airport project after 1997 not only will bring honor to Beijing and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Regional Government, but the arrangements for the use of land after Kai Tak terminates operations will be entirely in the hands of the SAR Government and Beijing, as it will no longer be necessary to consult anyone representing the interests of Britain or other countries. With expensive land prices in Hong Kong, the vast area of Kai Tak Airport and relaxation of building's height in the entire Kowloon Peninsula will bring profits up to several dozen billion dollars to the SAR Government. Naturally, the Chinese side will not let the British side concern itself with these considerable profits now when it still administers the territory. The Chinese Will Not Make Concessions in the New Airport Project Taken politically or economically, the Chinese side will not make concessions in the new airport project. Whether Britain and the Hong Kong Government still cherish any illusions about this will be judged by their future actions. Even though both sides return to the negotiation table, they will be nothing more than the nature of putting on performances. Perhaps, those consortia waiting for contracts of project facilities and supplies need more patience. At least, this spectacular and controversial new airport project will not become a reality until after 1997.
