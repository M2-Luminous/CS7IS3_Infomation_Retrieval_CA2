In a statement issued by the permanent secretariat of the Arab People's Congress yesterday, the secretariat condemns this massacre, which embodies the hostility of the Zionist occupation and the destruction of the questionable calls for peace that some Arabs have followed. The permanent secretariat of the Arab People's Congress called on the Arab nation to adopt a serious stance that strengthens the support for the Palestinian Arab people and does not let it be a helpless prey for the imperialist and Zionist forces. The secretariat addressed also a call to the Arab leaders and heads of Arab liberation movements to make immediate and practical moves to support the Palestinian people and express the pan-Arab will and use it to put pressures on the UN and international organizations so that they condemn the enemy and implement international laws to give to the Palestinian people the right to recover all their rights.
