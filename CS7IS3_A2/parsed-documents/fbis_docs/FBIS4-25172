The "Communique on China's Environmental Conditions" issued by the State Environmental Protection Bureau today says: Under the circumstances of a fairly rapid economic development in 1993, environmental conditions were relatively more stable. Environmental pollution and damage to the eco-environment were still continuing. A small number of areas were seriously polluted, whereas pollution in some areas was brought under control. The eco-environment was turning for the better. According to the regulations of the "Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China," the State Environmental Protection Bureau will issue a "communique on China's environmental conditions" for the previous year on the eve of 5 June -- World Environment Day -- every year after 1990. Since the United Nations convened the Congress on Environment and Development, the Chinese Government has paid much more attention to coordinated development of the environment and the economy, adopted the strategies for sustained development, and put forward a series of countermeasures and measures on environment and development. Environmental conditions around the country are stable as a whole. The communique issued today notes: Air pollution caused by smoke from burning coal is still very serious in cities -- it is more serious in winter and spring than in summer and fall, in north China than in south China, and in medium and big cities than in small towns. The discharge of sulfur dioxide and industrial dust has increased to some extent, and acid rain has been found in more cities than in the previous year. In 1993, water pollution found in rivers around the country was a kind of organic pollution. Water quality in mainstreams was better than in tributaries, and rivers passing through cities were more seriously polluted. Over exploitation of underground water was rampant in cities, and the deterioration of the eco-environment of the fishing industry had not been brought under effective control yet. The degradation, desertification, and salinization of grasslands continued, and the volume of mature forest trees which could be logged was shrinking. Concerning the work of environmental protection in 1993, local people's governments at all levels and various departments under the State Council have intensified their work and extensively launched inspections of the enforcement of the environmental protection law under the guidance of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and have made achievements in preventing and controlling industrial pollution. The amount of smoke and dust released into the air in cities remained the same as in 1992. The water quality in mainstreams of big rivers, inland rivers, large-sized reservoirs, underground water in cities, and most offshore waters remained fine. Municipal and public facilities were further improved; progress was made in declaring and registering discharged pollutants; control over dumping at sea was further strengthened. In 1993, people around the country have further enhanced their environmental concepts, and environmental campaigns with the participation of the public were larger and more diversified than in the past. Environmental education was more popularized. The 1993 "Communique on China's Environmental Conditions" is jointly compiled and completed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Public Health, State Statistical Bureau, State Meteorological Administration, State Oceanography Bureau, State Land Administration Bureau, and State Environmental Protection Bureau.
