Yeltsin Has Gone to Sochi Not for Treatment But To Rest and Work"] [Text] The end of March promises to bring yet another burst of activity to Russia's political life. It is planned that a memorandum on accord and peace will have been prepared by that time. No easy task. This fact is probably linked to some extent with President B. Yeltsin's departure for Sochi. If the chronology of all the memorable events of the last few years is traced, a pattern inevitably emerges: Before making important, not to mention unexpected, decisions the president has disappeared for some time from journalists' field of vision and has withdrawn in order to get away from current affairs and work out his plans. This supposition was indirectly confirmed by the president himself during a conversation with journalists at Vnukovo-2 Airport. "For me, leave is a change of work regime," he said. When asked about the state of his health, he replied: "Fine, although I have suffered two bouts of influenza. I am going not for treatment, but to rest and work." Later, replying to an IZVESTIYA correspondent's question as to whether the president foresees difficulties over the drafting of the memorandum on accord and peace, he stated: "An easy solution to this problem is not to be expected -- the spectrum of opinions among political forces is too broad. Nonetheless there is a chance for defining common approaches, which would become the basis for accord. It is possible that leaders of certain power structures, including the prime minister, will come to Sochi to work on this document," he stressed. The president also announced that during his leave he intends to spend time working out a mechanism for implementing the president's message to parliament. "This must be done in such a way that this mechanism's work is scheduled on a month-by-month basis." Chernomyrdin arrived at Vnukovo-2 to see him off with a magnificent bouquet of flowers. It turned out that they were intended not for the president but his wife, whose birthday it is today.
