But she stressed ministers had yet to find any evidence of this. Lady Chalker told the Lords at question time: "Officials are continuing to investigate the allegations published in THE INDEPENDENT (on January 24). "We have no evidence that British mercenaries are fighting for Azerbaijan or that British arms have been supplied to that country." She said Britain continued to support an international arms embargo and could not condone the supply of arms or mercenaries to either side. "If there is any evidence of illegal activity, which I believe this to be, it should be passed to the police authorities for further investigation. "I also believe there is a moral duty on British companies, and we sincerely hope no one will supply either arms or mercenaries to either side of this conflict or of any other."
