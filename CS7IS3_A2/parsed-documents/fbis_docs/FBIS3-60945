Their objective is to strike at political stability in Egypt and try to weaken its economy. They hide behind Islam although they are a misguided group. The majority of the Egyptian people are Muslim and do not need guardians or someone to teach them about Islam. He said that the issue of terrorism in Egypt is different from the issue of terrorism in Algeria, where the terrorist groups succeeded in getting into parliament. But in Egypt the terrorists have failed to get into the People's Assembly or Consultative Council. They have also failed to infiltrate the ranks of the Army, security forces, and large institutions. In addition, the terrorist phenomenon in Egypt is different from that in the United Kingdom, for example, due to the presence of the shadow government and some form of Irish independence from the United Kingdom.
