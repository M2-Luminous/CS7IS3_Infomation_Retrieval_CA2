It was only at 1900 GMT that the office of the Chamber was able to muster the necessary working quorum. Forty-two deputies from the Alliance, plus the socialists, participated together to open the session, BP-FNCD [Parliamentary Bloc of the National Front for Change and Democracy] having decided to return to its old empty-seat policy. Deputy Vital Pierre Francois then proposed reducing the quorum to 39 deputies, which would have relaunched the controversy on the status of those elected on 18 January. After some thorny discussions, the assembly agreed that those 20 contested deputies voluntarily refrained from participating since the signing of the New York pact. The concession, however, was made to list their names on the roll. Clearly, the office of the Chamber of Deputies keeps those contested deputies as a spare solution, which could be useful if and when necessary. Then the key point of this session was addressed, the reason for which the assembly was convened: the development of the political situation and the means of filling the governmental vacuum. The socialists presented their analysis of the situation. According to them, Article 148 is presently inapplicable without the approval of President Aristide. Article 149 is out of date and Article 111 is maladapted. Duly Brutus, spokesman for the socialist bloc, again recommended political compromise and sacrifice as a solution to the crisis. He asked President Monde to immediately consult with General Cedras for the purpose of convincing the Army's commander in chief that he should make the gesture that the international community is expecting of him, meaning to resign. This proposal raised a stir in the room. [passage omitted] Deputy Joseph Lambert, one of the leading lights of the Alliance, proposed a resolution bill inspired by Article 111 of the Constitution, which will give the National Assembly the right to nominate an ad hoc prime minister until President Aristide decides to appoint another head of government. [passage omitted] In reaction to the U.S. threat of military intervention as a solution to the crisis, Deputy Lambert proposed a second resolution bill, declaring the Legislative Palace the place of high resistance against foreign military intervention. This bill added that President Aristide is mandated to consult with the Haitian Armed Forces for necessary measures to safeguard the territory's integrity. If not, he will be accountable for this violation of our national sovereignty. These two bills were not voted on, however, because the quorum was invalidated. President Frantz Robert Monde planned another meeting for this Thursday. [end recording]
