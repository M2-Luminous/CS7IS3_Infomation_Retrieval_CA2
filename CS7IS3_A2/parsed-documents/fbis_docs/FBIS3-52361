AL-JUMHURIYAH's report was identical with that of the Central Bank of Iraq. A responsible source said: "Yes, some countries have released Iraqi assets after receiving the approval of their monetary authorities. These countries are Switzerland, Spain, Greece, and Austria." In response to a question from AL-JUMHURIYAH, the source said that Iraqi assets had been frozen in the banks of several Western, developing, and even some Arab countries. He added that the assets were deposited as current accounts to cover import expenditures and that there were other deposits in U.S., British, and German banks. Regarding new measures for controlling the circulation of the U.S. dollar and other hard currencies in the market or on the street, the source said: On 7 November 1993, the Council of Ministers decided to establish limited companies to work as brokers for buying and selling foreign currencies in order to stop the confusion that has prevailed since the authorities permitted the possession and circulation of foreign currencies in Iraq. The instructions allow the company to use up to 10 percent of its capital for this purpose. During the first stage, these companies will confine themselves to foreign banknotes, rather than dealing with other forms of payment; the dealings will be based on immediate, rather than delayed payment; and the company's commitment to sound dealings and to extending its services to its clients will make the process successful and have positive effects on trade and other economic activities. Asked whether there are new instructions on transporting national and hard currencies in and out of Iraq, the source said that the current measures take into account the current circumstances facing Iraq as a result of the unjust blockade imposed on it and that the lack of foreign currency has affected efforts to meet the needs of the local commodity and service markets. On the instructions of the Political Command, the Central Bank of Iraq has tried to ease the pressure on foreign currency by taking measures to cover basic consumer needs and to increase the demand for the Iraqi dinar on foreign markets, thus affecting its exchange rate against foreign currencies in parallel markets. The following measures were taken: 1. To allow arrivals to Iraq to bring with them the sum of 1,000 Iraqi dinars per person. 2. To allow Iraqis to bring in Iraqi currency from abroad on condition it is declared on foreign transfer form No. 8 and an account is opened with this currency at a licensed bank. Withdrawals from these accounts are not permitted for a two-year period from the date of deposit. These accounts will receive the 15 percent interest rate enjoyed by similar deposits. 3. To allow Arab citizens to bring in their capital in Iraqi dinars for investment purposes in industrial and agricultural projects designated by the Ministries of Industry, Agriculture, and Irrigation. Iraqi dinars brought in for this purpose will be considered as operating capital and expenses for the projects contracted and without any obligation to transfer the profits. 4. In implementation of President Saddam Husayn's directives on 13 July 1992, it was decided to allow citizens to make withdrawals and deposits in their foreign currency bank accounts without restrictions and without their being asked to declare the source of these foreign currency funds. 5. In line with Paragragh No. 4 above, it has also been decided to suspend the provisions on outside transfers that required banks be contacted for selling purposes and for all provisions dealing with the possession of foreign currency. 6. Iraqis who have accounts outside Iraq are permitted to bring these funds into Iraq and open accounts in licensed Iraqi banks or to use these accounts to import basic foostuffs. When AL-JUMHURIYAH asked about the measures to combat inflation, the Central Bank source said that the Iraqi economy during the period preceding the 30-state aggression against Iraq had come close to a balanced economy. But, the aggression and the unjust economic blockade have been a major reason for the spiralling inflation the Iraqi money market is experiencing.
