As the "threat from the north" diminishes after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the GSDF is being forced to reduce personnel, the Ground Staff Office has also focused on the significance of the "effects of the situation on the Korean peninsula," and the "political and economic center of the country" in its review of the strategic role of GSDF divisions stationed nationwide. It has also suggested steps to enhance mobility, including the creation of a new unit of helicopters for personnel transport. Among the 13 divisions stationed all over Japan, the downgrading of the Fifth Division (headquartered in Obihiro City, Hokkaido) and three other divisions to brigades is also being proposed. The above plan is believed to represent the GSDF's position in preparation for the Defense Agency's formal decision to reorganize the SDF within fiscal 1994. Consideration of plans to reorganize the GSDF gathered momentum after former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ordered a review of the 1976 "National Defense Program Outline" last February. The above "outline" worked out by the Ground Staff Office in late April is meant to be a preliminary draft on which to base further discussions. The "outline" states that from the standpoint of national defense, Japan can be divided into "northern Japan," referring to the area north of Aomori Prefecture, "western Japan," consisting of northern Kyushu and the Chugoku region, and "central Japan," comprising the remaining territory. These three regions are then discussed individually in terms of the "territorial issue," "effects of the situation on the Korean peninsula," and the "location of the political and economic center," considering them equally important in terms of national defense. This indeed represents a shift from "emphasis on the north," which entailed giving priority to frontal deployment in Hokkaido, among other things. The "outline" is not premised on any specific threat, and in this sense, it is a return to the philosophy of the "National Defense Program Outline." Partly owing to the difficulty in recruiting SDF members, the Defense Agency has already decided to reduce the size of the SDF from 180,000 to 150,000. As a concrete step to implement force reductions, the present "outline" proposes downgrading the 10th Division (based in Nagoya), the 12th Division (based in Shinto Village, Gunma Prefecture), and the 13th Division (based in Kaita Town, Hiroshima Prefecture), apart from the Fifth Division mentioned above, to brigades. It suggests reducing the size of these divisions from the present 7,000 to 4,000 or 5,000. Brigades have the same functions as divisions although they are smaller in size. At present, the GSDF does not have brigades. In the process of determining which divisions to downgrade into brigades, the metropolitan area and the Kansai area, which are Japan's political and economic centers, and the northeastern region and Kyushu, where it is relatively easier to recruit SDF members, have been excluded. Likewise, four divisions in Hokkaido -- the Second Division (based in Asahikawa City) which defends the Soya Strait, the Seventh Division (based in Chitose City) which is the GSDF's only armored division, and the 11th Division in Sapporo City -- have also been excluded. Candidates for downgrading were said to have been selected from the remaining divisions according to their degree of importance. Furthermore, the size of infantry members forming the core of all divisions and brigades will be reduced to a small commanding unit during peace time, forming the so-called "core units" without rank-and-file members, to implement force reductions. The following steps to strengthen mobility are also proposed to realize a balanced national defense strategy: 1) deploying a considerable number of helicopters of the 12th Division in Gunma, reorganizing this into a "mobile air brigade," which can be dispatched to any place in Japan in an emergency; and 2) increasing the number of armored vehicles in all divisions and brigades. The plan also suggests an upgrading of the reserve SDF officers system to staff the core units. In addition, the "outline" also proposes possible consolidation and retrenchment of operational bases which have become difficult to maintain and manage around bases where GSDF divisions or brigades are stationed. It estimates that, of the 159 bases all over the country, around 40 need to be closed.
