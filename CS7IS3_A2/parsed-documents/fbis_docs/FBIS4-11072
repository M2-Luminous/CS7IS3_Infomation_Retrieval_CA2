[Campbell] There has always been a need to boost exports. Argentina has a closed economy. [Boragni] How can this trend be turned around? [Campbell] We need a cultural change. There are very concrete cases that point to the ongoing reversal of this trend. I am referring to relations between Argentina and Brazil, in which bilateral trade rose from $1 billion yearly to $6 billion. [Boragni] Does the trade deficit constitute a source of concern for the government? [Campbell] It depends on how we analyze it. From the viewpoint of imports, they are composed to a great extent of capital goods. This means that investments are being made in the country. But it is also true that we have to boost exports. [Boragni] Are you thinking about instruments for export promotion? [Campbell] Those of us who work at the Foreign Ministry do not design instruments. That is incumbent upon the Economy Ministry. We work at trade promotion through the Argentine Export Foundation. [Boragni] Are you not concerned about the 26 percent drop in commodity exports in January? [Campbell] Under no circumstances would I draw conclusions based on the results of only one month. Concerning January's exports in particular, the largest importer of Argentine commodities was Brazil. Exports to Brazil have grown considerably. [Boragni] Is not January's $585.6 million trade deficit a cause for concern when we compare it with January 1993's deficit of $136.6 million? [Campbell] The trade deficit is, undoubtedly, weighty, but I reiterate that it is not worrisome from the standpoint of imports. As long as the exchange rate remains stable, there will be an inflow of capital. [Boragni] Is it not incompatible to contemplate joining NAFTA when the United States and Canada are Argentina's competitors with regard to agricultural products? [Campbell] One must bear in mind that when countries sit at the negotiating table, they discuss all these questions. Compromise always comes later. [Boragni] While at the beginning it was said that Argentina would try to join NAFTA through Mercosur [Common Market of the South], now everybody talks about unilateral negotiations with the United States. [Campbell] At the beginning, we devised the so-called "Four Plus One" strategy, which led to the beginning of talks between Mercosur and the United States. Nevertheless, this does not prevent any country from negotiating on an individual basis. [Boragni] NAFTA offers a huge market but also entails keen competition. [Campbell] Argentina has been making headway in its trade standards. When a country wants to compete, it can do so.
