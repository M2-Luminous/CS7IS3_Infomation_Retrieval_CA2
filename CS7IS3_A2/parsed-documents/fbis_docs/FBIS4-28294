The reckless war blast of Perry came at a time when the United States and its followers were seeking openly to impose "sanctions" on the DPRK over its fictitious "nuclear issue". This is an unpardonable criminal act of driving the situation to the brink of war. Recently, Perry put the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea in "a round-the-clock alert posture" and brought the extra-large carrier Independence to the waters where it could enter into war exercises against the North within a few days, and planned a large-scale naval war exercise in the waters around the Korean peninsula, inciting a war fever. Judging from the fact that Perry threatened a "preemptive attack" on the extension line of these military moves, it is only too clear that it was not a mere threat but a war blast signalling the green light to the actually provocation of a second Korean war. It is a gross miscalculation if the U.S. hardline conservative force think they can overpower the North through a "surprise attack" by force of arms, without the least intention to seek a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. We are fully prepared to cope with any case.
