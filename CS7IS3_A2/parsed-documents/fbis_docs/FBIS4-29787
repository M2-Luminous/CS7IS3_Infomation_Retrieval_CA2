The talks are aimed at striking an accord on the three priority areas for the "framework" negotiations before the July 8-10 Naples summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) key industrial countries, the official said. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata will likely visit the U.S. before flying to Italy for the annual summit, said the official who declined to be named. The three framework trade priority sectors are insurance, government procurement, and trade in autos and auto parts. The official said the two countries will hold subcabinet-level talks on auto and auto parts trade in Washington in the first half of next week, aiming to reach consensus on "objective criteria" as a yardstick to assess the openness of the Japanese auto market. The official said he is not certain about whether Tokyo and Washington will reach a complete agreement on auto trade before the Naples summit. Japan will decide whether or not to postpone final settlements on auto trade beyond the summit at the end of next week by evaluating results of discussions at the planned subcabinet-level talks, the official said. He said subcabinet-level talks will also be held in Washington next week on government procurement and insurance.
