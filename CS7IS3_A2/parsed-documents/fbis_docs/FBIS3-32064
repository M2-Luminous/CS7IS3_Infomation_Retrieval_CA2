The CNT has upheld a strike for the past eight days to demand that fuel prices be reduced. A climate of tension prevails in the city, where the main avenues continue to be blocked by hundreds of buses and taxis. Police surveillance was reinforced in several conflict areas in Managua although no major incidents have taken place. According to police reports, the striking transportation workers and those who do not support the measure clashed in a sector of the northern highway, which leads to the Managua international airport, and the windshield glass of three vehicles were destroyed. Chamorro said today that the strike could have political undertones. She said the CNT continues the protest because its affiliates "are tough and who knows who is inciting them." "What they have to do is work," the president said, after she accused them of pressuring and threatening those who do want to work and of carrying out an "inhumane" task that leaves people without a vital service. The economic losses caused by the eight days of transportation strike amounts to many millions but has not been added up yet. The four [number as received] other cargo and transportation organizations that signed agreements with the government last Friday, have renewed their work. However, the service has not been totally reestablished. According to the agreement between government authorities and the Nicaraguan Federation of Cargo Transportation (Fetracanic), the National Chamber of Transportation (Canat), and the National Association of Transportation (Anatra) the fuel prices will be frozen until next May. Additionally, the agreement gives taxi and commercial cargo cooperatives a subsidy for the next four months and other concessions and tax exonerations.
