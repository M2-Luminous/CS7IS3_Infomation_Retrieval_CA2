"Bringing the Chinese scientists to the frontiers of the world science and technology" was what Professor Zhou Guangzhao, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the country's top scientific body, called it. "We're trying to make CAS one of the most active and productive members of the world's scientific family," said Professor Zhou in an interview at his office in Beijing, where a huge world map hangs on the wall. CAS, which was set up 45 years ago on a Soviet Union-style framework, now has 125 research institutes and 100,000 scientists, engineers and other staff members. The country's reforms over the past 15 years have freed the academy from its closed ivory-tower system and established a new system which is fully open to the world and society. So far, the CAS has established close ties with 3,000 Chinese industrial enterprises and more than 500 high-tech enterprises or joint ventures. In another move, at the Congress of CAS Academicians this June, a number of outstanding foreign scientists are due to be elected to the prestigious scientific body, for the first time in its 45 year- history. "Natural sciences are the laws of nature and they are free from the limits of national boundaries," Professor Zhou said, "and scientific discoveries and inventions are the common property of mankind." He added: "Only in an open system can the CAS fully absorb the advanced scientific results of the world to raise China's academic level, while making their own contributions to the world." Professor Zhou said that the academy will join the international efforts to solve such global issues as the problems of sustainable development, rapid growth of population, shortages of resources and deteriorating ecological environment. "If scientists are not able to make breakthroughs in the technologies of solar energy and nuclear fusion in the next few centuries, it will be difficult for human civilization to continue," Zhou said. Zhou said that the academy has taken a number of moves such as setting up national open laboratories, post-doctorate posts, national research centers, sending graduate students abroad, and cultivating 100 internationally-known scientists before the end of this century. "Once at the frontiers of the world sciences, the Chinese scientists will provide the world with their own contributions," he said. "Building a world-class university" was what professor Wang Dazhong, president of Qinghua University was thinking about. Qinghua is the country's top university. Professor Wang spoke to the reporters at his office, which dates back to the mid-19th century. "Since the competition of economy, science and technology in the 21st century will eventually turn out to be the competition of talents, Qinghua will strive to become one of the top-notch universities in the world by the year 2011, its centenary," he said. "Best university means producing best students," he said. "We will train high-level scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and government officials who are in great demand by China's emerging market economy." According to Professor Wang, among the more than 500 academicians in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 160 graduated from Qinghua. Twenty-nine members or alternative members of the 14th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party graduated from or once worked in Qinghua. A comprehensive university, Qinghua has Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji as head of its School of Economic Management, Professor Zhou Guangzhao head of the School of Sciences, and Professor Teng Teng, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, head of the School of Humanities. Professor Wang said that the university will promote the transfer of scientific results into productivity by developing high-tech enterprises. It is planning to set up an enterprise group and a science and technology garden for cooperation with the industries and enterprises from both home and abroad. A committee consisting of representatives from the university and from industry is expected to be established to develop cooperation with the world's renowned enterprises. "Taking a firm hold of the world's market of high-tech products" is what Professor Liu Chuanzhi, president of the Legend Group, the largest Chinese high-tech enterprise overseas, is thinking about. When he launched his company in Beijing nine years ago, Liu could not afford 200 yuan to install a telephone at his office. Now his company has become the biggest computer firm in Hong Kong. Liu spoke to the reporters at his luxurious office in Beijing, which he explained was prepared to receive international industrial giants. "I have now finally realized my dream of turning scientific results into products, and sold China's high-tech products in the world market," Liu said. The company was started with seed money of 200,000 yuan provided by the CAS. The company, which expands as fast as a legend can tell you, is now producing 10 percent of the computer display cards in the world, making it a well-known computer firm abroad. Its sales volume last year hit three billion yuan, 40 percent of which was sold on overseas markets. Last month, Legend became China's first high-tech company to be listed on Hong Kong stock market. He said, "In the highly competitive world of the computer industry, in order to keep a significant market at home, we are also striving to enter the world market." "The Legend Group has set up its information center at Silicon Valley in the United States, its research center in China's Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, and its development center in Hong Kong," Liu said. "That is why we are leading the world in the computer display cards manufacturing." According to Liu, the Hong Kong branch of the Legend was set up with only 300,000 Hong Kong dollars of investment. Now it has turned up to be the number one computer firm in Hong Kong, with a fixed asset of one billion Hong Kong dollars. Liu said the Legend is to combine the mainland's high technologies, market, and distribution system with Hong Kong's sales style and information. The company has now established 14 branch companies in the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia and Singapore, selling its products all over the world.
