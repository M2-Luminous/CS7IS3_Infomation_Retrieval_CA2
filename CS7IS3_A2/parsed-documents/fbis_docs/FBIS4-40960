I can cite the figures, by the way: Our mid-June results show that over 140 million privatization vouchers will be collected by the end of the voucher privatization [30 June]. This is guaranteed. May be we will even hit 145 million. Let me remind you that 148 million vouchers have been issued. This means, in fact, that an absolute majority of the population has had an opportunity to invest their vouchers. The state has provided property for these vouchers -- has come up with the goods, so to say. This was very important for us because many previous state programs were based on vouchers before but failed: Vouchers for harvest-1990, for northerners, for consumer durables -- the Ryzhkov, Pavlov, and Silayev governments all gave vouchers a try. All these efforts failed. Our privatization voucher program is the first to make good the voucher promises. The final stage of the privatization -- the June voucher auctions -- is a unique voucher booster: In June we are offering twice as much property for sale as for the total of 1994, including the Norilsk Nickel works, a superb enterprise with a great export potential. [passage omitted] Now we have the moral right to say: enough, the voucher privatization, the free privatization now ends. Everybody has had a chance to invest the vouchers. [passage omitted] On 30 June we are beginning a new program, in which money and finances are the most important. This money will be invested primarily in enterprises themselves. How is this going to happen? We will use the tried and tested approaches -- including auctions. But these are going to be money auctions, not voucher auctions. For example, an enterprise will issue a packet of shares worth 40 percent of its value. This 40 percent packet will be offered for sale, at a real auction, for money, with a hammer. There may be three, five, 10, or 15 buyers, and the packet will go to the highest bidder. Most of the money the bidder has paid will go to the enterprise, so it can buy new equipment, cut costs, or do market research. The remaining shares may also be sold. Some sales may be conditional, for instance on ecological grounds: You can buy this enterprise, but you must know that within five years you must reduce the waste the enterprise throws into the air or into the water. These procedures are possible, they are envisaged by our document. [passage omitted] Some people say that this is privatization for the rich, and that the grass roots will not benefit. This is a false impression. Look at what is happening. The rich, those who are able to spend a lot of money at tenders, invest in an enterprise, which already has shareholders from the first stage of the transfer to joint stock -- members of the work collective who received the 51 percent of shares in-house for example, or those who received shares of the enterprise at voucher auctions. So in fact, those who became shareholders at the first stage of the privatization free of charge are gaining access to financial resources at the second stage. The shareholders win, the enterprise wins, and hence the economy wins. So let me say again that the whole thrust of the new privatization beginning 1 July is in building up enterprises themselves. [passage omitted] The final objective of the first stage of the privatization was expressed in quantitative terms to create a wide class of shareholders. Even our most fierce opponents agree that there are 40 million shareholders in Russia. Let me remind you that Russia's adult population is 70 million, so in fact there are 70 million owners. They often do not understand what it means and what rights they have, what they can or cannot do, or what dividends they will receive. However, they are owners, and you cannot take away from them the share or shares they own. For us it means that the main objective has been reached: a class of property owners has been created. [passage omitted] The objective of the second stage is that privatized enterprises must be encouraged to develop quality, not quantity. They should be encouraged to undergo reconstruction -- this is becoming a key word for us now -- and to fit into the new market using the finances they will have access to at the second state of the privatization. [passage omitted] I believe the second stage will last two to three years. It will finish of its own accord, when all packets of shares are sold. But as it draws to a close, it will create the secondary market, an important factor of a market economy. The owner of the packet may sell it at some stage, so capital will start moving -- from less productive to more productive enterprises. This is what economists call the capital market, without which the goods market will not exist. [passage omitted] Russian privatization will reach this objective.
