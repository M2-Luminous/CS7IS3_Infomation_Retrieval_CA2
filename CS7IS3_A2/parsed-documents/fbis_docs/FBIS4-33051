Bankers offered their support to the present system because the BCV promised to supply currency according to market offers, making rational use of international reserves, which are at an "adequate level." Tuesday's increase in the dollar exchange rate came as no surprise to the BCV, "because a free system was instituted." The BCV had to supply currency according to market offers; this is what it is all about. "We do not accept rumors of exchange control, because we are not thinking of this. International reserves are at an adequate level (did not mention the amount), which gives us sufficient flexibility to cover import needs and to face the exchange rate situation." The BCV directorate hopes that yesterday's trend repeats itself in the next few days and that our currency finally stabilizes. The directorate added that businesses and people who purchased dollars over the past few weeks unloaded them in view of the possibility that exchange rates could drop and they "might lose." The BCV directorate is aware of an important transaction among three banks involving $4 million. Casas Gonzalez affirmed that there should be trust in the bolivar, which is backed by the BCV. "There are no great dangers at this moment; we need to change our attitude and not speculate." Regarding interest rates, Casas Gonzalez said that it is impossible to reduce them with the expectation of inflation; "if we do, the flight of capital increases. It is an illusion to say that interest rates can be reduced. One cannot stop dollars from leaving or attract investments without real positive interests." We have ruled out the so-called solidarity commitment to reduce the productive sectors' active rates, which was proposed by [Commissioner for Financial Reforms Gustavo] Roosen. "This does not mean that we agree with the situation, but all countries defend their currency with this mechanism." He added that the "crawling peg" [preceding words in English] system was given up on 1 May because it was no longer effective. This is no time to think there is a perfect system "when we are living a situation such as this where there is a crisis of confidence." We seek a balance between availability and demand. Reserves are used as cautiously as possible. While supplying the market to stabilize the bolivar, "the struggle to maintain reserves continues being a priority, but, along with reserves, we want stability. We cannot change the currency market scheme overnight." Regarding [Finance Minister Julio] Sosa Rodriguez's statement that the dollar exchange should be set at 150 bolivares, Casas Gonzalez said that this is determined by the market. "We hope it will be more or less this amount. Some technicians have estimated this, but I cannot give an exact amount, because I do not know what psychological factor will affect the rate." We know that there is a back order and that this is why we have to supply the market to cover part of it, but there is also much artificial demand." [New BCV director] Domingo Maza Zavala was the most notable absentee. The finance minister came out of the meeting satisfied and said "tomorrow (today) I will meet with the IMF president."
