The demobilization, backed by Western donors, is intended to bring down Uganda's 90,000-strong military to about 40,000. Military expenditure by the Ugandan government is estimated at 30 percent of the country's annual budget. Some 10,000 soldiers will be laid off by the end of this month, the officials said, bringing to 33,000 the number of troops demobilized since 1992. Donors have so far given 31 million dollars for the programme, but Uganda is seeking more funds to complete the exercise. A retiring soldier's benefits include 550 dollars in cash, bulding material and transport home.
