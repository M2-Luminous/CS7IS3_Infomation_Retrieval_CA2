In a statement on the 47th anniversary of founding the Ba'th Party, which will be marked tomorrow, the National Command said that the responsibility for safeguarding understanding and promoting the militant state to the highest level requires the masses' ranks to be equipped with militant thinking and a new awareness of both the nation's battle and its historic depth and civilized essence. The National Command explained that the Arab nation's forces can foil the schemes of fragmentation and internationalization of domestic problems, and can also mobilize the nation's resources to lift the embargo on Iraq. The National Command also stressed that the jihad in the Mother of Battles was a slogan for adhering to principles and insisting on entrenching basic values through liberating the people and moving international relations to a new level free from the spirit of trusteeship and the domination of world colonialism. It called on Arab parties, political organizations, trade unions, intellectuals, and literary and artistic people as well as all parts of nation's body to wage the battle of fateful civilized conflict by maintaining the spirit of resistance shown in both the Mother of Battles and the intifadah.
