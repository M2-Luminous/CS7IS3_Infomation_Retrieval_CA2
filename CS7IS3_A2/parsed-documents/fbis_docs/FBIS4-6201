The Ministry, however, called on those who have over 50,000 dollars to report to the authorities, citing the need to have correct information on the country's foreign currency reserves for effective implementation of economic policies. In another effort to internationalize the nation's economy, the Ministry allowed businesses to use Korean won equivalent up to 300,000 dollars, compared to the present limit of 100,000 dollars, in settling import, export and reinsurance accounts. The Ministry also allowed businesses to spend Korean won in settling freight and insurance accounts incurred through the export and import of goods.
