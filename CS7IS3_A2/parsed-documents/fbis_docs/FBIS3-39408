One does not need to be an astrologer to realize this state of affairs. Studying the official statements and the chronology of the developments will be enough. [passage omitted] The disclosure by the military officials after the air attack on the Zhalah Camp in northern Iraq, which has been described as the most intensive air raid since the establishment of the republic, said that the targets were completely destroyed and the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] suffered many casualties. However, the PKK, Democratic Party of Kurdistan, leader Mas'ud Barzani and the Turkish journalists who visited the area have disclosed that the PKK suffered few casualties. It will be recalled that in the past General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, accused those who sought a nonmilitary solution to the Kurdish problem of "making nonsensical remarks while sipping whiskey in the Bosphorus." This time, he has accused those who have questioned the air operation of "lobbying for the bandits." He has done so when even former President General Kenan Evren, who led the military takeover of the administration on 12 September 1980, has described the air attack as an unsuccessful operation. In view of this, should he also be regarded as a member of the "lobby of the bandits?" Who is telling the truth about the attack on the Zhalah Camp? It will be recalled that Tehran lodged a protest over the bombing of Iran's territory, noting that the bombs that were dropped on Iran killed and wounded several people and caused damage to property. The General Staff rejected Iran's protest. However, the information the Turkish Consulate in Orumiyeh conveyed to Turkey and the delegation Ankara sent to the region confirms Tehran's claims. In fact, it will be recalled that a government spokesman has disclosed that Turkey will compensate Iran. Considering all that, how can the discrepancy between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Turkish Armed Forces be explained? Which of the two state establishments is telling the truth? Sources affiliated with the General Staff have said that the operation against the Zhalah Camp cost 12 billion Turkish lira. However, Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin has said that the operation cost 1 trillion Turkish lira. Which of the two figures is accurate and who is telling the truth on that matter? [passage omitted] Civilians wish to learn from all the establishments, including the military, who claim to be totally open, about who is telling the truth about the attack on the Zhalah Camp. As tax payers funding the budget of $32 billion, the citizens demand a disclosure of the military spending in southeastern Turkey, which total $6 billion. They wish to know how this effects inflation rates. Those who call for a nonmilitary solution to the Kurdish problem want a civilian administration in Turkey. Their question of "who is telling the truth" is not aimed at serving the "lobby of bandits." On the contrary, they ask that question because they want to preserve Turkey's national unity. They are convinced that national unity can be maintained only through a political and non-military solution to the Kurdish problem, a solution that will establish peace and equality.
