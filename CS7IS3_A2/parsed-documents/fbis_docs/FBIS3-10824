It is now 2058, and we have a last-minute bulletin after 22.5 percent of the Liberal Party's internal votes and the Senate votes have been tallied. According to the latest figures from the National Civil Registry Office, 48.94 percent of the tables have been tallied throughout the country. Mr. Registrar, according to the National Civil Registry Office's figures, who has won the Liberal Party's elections? [Osorio] Ernesto Samper leads with 43 percent, followed by Humberto de la Calle with 15 percent, and Carlos Lleras with 7.42 percent. I want to warn this barely represents 42.5 percent, meaning the situation may change in different regions of the country. [Garzon] There is a low voter turnout and many null votes. Why? How can you explain this, Mr. Registrar? [Osorio] Apparently some people did not know how to use the ballot, so they simply deposited it, believing they were thus voting for a given party when they should have marked a candidate. [Garzon] Who has swept the votes for the Senate of the Republic so far? [Osorio] Two candidates from Caldas lead right now, but I must warn you that Caldas is in second place. We have 100 percent of the votes from Amazonas Department, and Caldas follows with 98 percent of the votes, so it is not strange for two candidates from Caldas-- Victor Renan Barco in first place and Omar Yepez Alzate in second-- to lead. [Garzon] What is the situation regarding the Chamber of Representatives, Mr. Registrar? [Osorio] Regarding the Chamber of Representatives, we have information about a 100-percent count in certain departments, and there are others where over 90 percent of the votes have been counted, meaning more than 10 departments. We are still gathering information, so we do not have a distribution by party and movement.
