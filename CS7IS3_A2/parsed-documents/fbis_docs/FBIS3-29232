In a written statement, the posts and telecommunications minister said the finding, a move that could result in punitive action unless a settlement is reached, was "unilateral." Kanzaki said his ministry has taken necessary action to boost imports under the accord. He said Japan would deal with possible U.S. punitive action against Japanese imports under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and other international trade rules.
