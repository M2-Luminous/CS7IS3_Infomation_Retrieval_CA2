The measure was a consequence of Brazil's renegotiation of its foreign debt with banks and "the encouraging progress of the stabilization program," an ECGD communique says. Michael Heseltine, secretary of state for trade and industry, said: "The resumption of the ECGD coverage of exports to Brazil will provide new opportunities for British companies." "Brazil is the ninth largest economy in the world, and it will be even more open now that the effects of the debt crisis will begin to decrease," Heseltine said in a communique. The coverage of credits was suspended in 1983 due to Brazil's delays in paying its debt. The coverage was resumed in 1989, but it was again suspended following new Brazilian delays with its debt. The ECGD said that it would concentrate on covering private companies, particularly in areas that will encourage the rehabilitation of the country's economy. Douglas Hurd, secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, visited Brazil at the beginning of April with a delegation of entrepreneurs. On that occasion he said that the United Kingdom wanted to increase economic relations between the two countries.
