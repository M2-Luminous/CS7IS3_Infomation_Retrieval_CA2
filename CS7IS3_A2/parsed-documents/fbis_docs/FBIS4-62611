The fifty most successful firms were chosen according to seven main indicators, including circulation, profit, profitability, growth rate and export potential, he explained. The role of wood processing is increasing while that of metal trading and processing has started to decrease, Mungel said. He pointed out that the food industry is stable, but the share of high-technology production needs to be increased. The average growth rate of export was 7 per cent per month in 1993, Mungel told the news conference, adding that the top 50 also included a one-man firm.
