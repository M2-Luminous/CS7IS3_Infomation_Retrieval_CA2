FBIS4-53179 "dreas096__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-096-A Daily Report 7 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Fuji Bank Enters Into Multilateral Netting Fuji Bank Enters Into Multilateral Netting 942A0214A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 May 94 p 4--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0214A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Fuji Bank has decided to participate in multilateral netting (multilateral settlements) which involves simultaneous settlement between foreign banks of credit and debit balances that arise in foreign exchange transactions. In July, Fuji Bank will contribute capital to the netting agency and will initiate transactions beginning in the first part of 1995. Since netting reduces the credit risk in the event of a default by one of the counterparties to the agreement, some commercial banks have moved to sign agreements with U.S. banks, but this is the first time that a Japanese bank has involved itself in a multilateral agreement. Fuji Bank will be participating in a multilateral netting agreement scheduled to begin business in July and include 13 principal European banks such as Barclays Bank and Paris National Bank and the Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank. The plan calls for the 14 banks to jointly capitalize Echo (headquartered in London), in the amount of several hundred pounds and to deposit 10-20 million pounds with the agency necessary for use as security to serve as the netting agency. For example, if Fuji Bank in a transaction with Bank A has receivables of $2 million and payables of 500 million yen and effects transactions with Bank B for $2 million in payables and 1 million pounds in receivables, Fuji Bank can use the netting system by paying the netting agency 500 million yen and receiving 1 million pounds. Even if Bank A should fail, risks can be minimized by reducing Fuji Bank's credits as if it had received $2 million. If a bank uses the netting system to offset credits and debits, it can reduce its assets. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is reviewing the possibility of recognizing increases in bank equity through such methods of reducing assets. Netting agreements are established in three forms; i.e., agreements that cover only one specific branch of a banking system, agreements that cover all branches of a bank, and agreements that cover several banks. Among city banks, there is an agreement between the Bank of Tokyo and the Tokyo branch of U.S. Citibank and the agreement which covers all branches of Mitsubishi Bank and U.S. Chemical Bank.
