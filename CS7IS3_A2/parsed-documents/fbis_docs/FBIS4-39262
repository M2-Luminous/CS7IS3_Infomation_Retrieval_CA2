The President of Turkey stressed that his country pays a special importance to the question of the Ukraine's territorial integrity. After that the session continued its work on forming the parliamentary standing committees. The deputies received the list of candidates for heads of the parliamentary committees, which immediately pushed representatives of the parliamentary factions to the microphones. There was the preliminary agreement to vote for the heads of parliamentary committees by the list, but now some deputies found surprises there. The right-oriented deputies said that their proposals were not included in full and the quotas were violated. In particular, the list included more representatives of the group "Ednist" (Unity) and agrarians than it was before. There were remarks that the list was prepared not in accordance with the principle of professionalism, but on the party principle, and that is why it could not be adopted for voting. The left-oriented representatives insisted on voting for the list as a whole. After the break the deputies approved the list of heads of standing committees by the majority of votes. Speaker of the parliament Oleksandre Moroz made a speech on the tasks for the Supreme Council and the parliamentary standing committees. Then the parliament worked on the draft regulations for the Supreme Council, which was adopted in its initial wording. Kiev, 1 June How to regulate the situation in the Crimea was the first question on the agenda after the parliamentary standing committees were formed. President Kravchuk made a speech before the MP's on this subject. Giving an analysis of the recent events in the peninsular and actions undertaken by the Crimea's leaders, President Kravchuk said: "Ignoring the constitutional demands and Ukrainian laws is not a simple mistake, but a strategy of the Crimea's present leaders and the party, which came to power in the Crimea. This strategy is aimed at the complete separation from Ukraine, with further joining to Russia." The President of Ukraine submitted to the parliament the proposals on how to manage the situation in the Crimea, which are based on a clear and stable position: The Crimea was and must be an integrative part of Ukraine. All illegal resolutions and decisions recently taken by the leaders of the Crimea must be cancelled and brought into accord with the Ukrainian Constitution and laws. Mr. Kravchuk answered to the questions of the MP's. After an extensive discussion the Supreme Council of Ukraine took the Resolution "Fulfillment of the Resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 24 February 1994 "Status of the Autonomic Republic of Crimea According to the President Ukrainian Constitution and Laws" and the Resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994 "Termination of Validity of the Law of the Republic of Crimea "Re-Establishment of Constitutional Grounds for the Statehood of the Republic of Crimea". [quotation marks as received] The resolution was adopted with 202 votes after the long-lasting discussion. Kiev, 2 June At the beginning of the morning sitting the Supreme Council adopted the Resolution "Amendment in Wording of Item 4 of the Resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine "Fulfillment of the Resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994 "Termination of Validity of the Law of the Republic of Crimea "Reestablishment of Constitutional Grounds for the Statehood of the Republic of Crimea." [quotation marks as received] Deputy from Bukovina Heorhiy Filipchuk was elected the Head of the Committee for Ecology, who was proposed to this post by Vyacheslav Chornovil as a candidate from Rukh. The Ukrainian President's letter on the 26 June elections evoked great interest and extensive discussion. According to one of MP's from Zaporizhya, this question was a "cross-road" for many opinions. The majority, judging from the speeches, were for the elections to be held at the appointed date. Other deputies proposed to prepare the respective legislative base and then to hold the elections immediately. Interesting was the opinion to elect the heads of regional councils at the parliamentary session, but not by a direct voting, which may lead to 26 "Crimeas" in Ukraine. Leonid Kravchuk, who participated at the meeting, considers that the MP's concentrated their attention only on the question of postponing the elections for the president, but almost ignored his proposition that, provided the Supreme Council prepares and adopts the necessary legislative documents before the date set for the presidential elections, he will not be against. Kiev, 3 June A draft on introduction of amendments and supplements to the Law of Ukraine "Forming the Local Power and Self-Governing Organs" was discussed a day before. In particular, this document provided for canceling the direct elections for heads of local councils. So this question evoked sharp debates yesterday. But this position, if adopted, would considerably change the status of the heads of local councils, in one hand, and the approach to the regional economic policy, on the other hand. Arguments "for" and "against" concerning this issue might be considered logical, if not for the fact that the legal and legislative base of Ukraine are not ready for the direct elections for heads of local councils. In particular, there was raised the questions: If heads of local councils are elected, to whom they will be subordinate; who will control their activities? Deputies to local councils must take control over this question, but meanwhile, the legal acts do not strictly regulate these positions. So, this was the question under debates. But in order to cancel the direct elections it is necessary to introduce a number of amendments and supplements to the current legislation of Ukraine. And this question was forwarded for voting. The amendment was not adopted by the majority of votes. This means that everything remains as it is provided by the law taken by the last Supreme Council.
