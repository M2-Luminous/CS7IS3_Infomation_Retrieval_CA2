However, in the interests of planning for developing structure for high technology industry in the twenty-first century, in 1976 the Toyama Technology Promotion Association was founded for the diffusion of high technology to and support of R&D by medium and small to medium-sized companies. The Association mainly assisted technical development and did research. It attracted attention from across Japan since there weren't many such local third-sector support organizations focusing on medium and small to medium-sized companies. The Association was reorganized and re-named the Toyama Technology Development Foundation in 1983 when Toyama was named one of the first eight technopolises under the Law for Accelerating Regional Development Based Upon High Technology Complexes (Technopolis Law) which aimed to create new cities in which industry, academia, and residents would coordinate their efforts. The Foundation uses the Toyama Technology Exchange Center constructed in 1985 as its base of operations. This year it will celebrate its tenth anniversary with ceremonies and commemorative lectures to which Tsukuba University president Reona Esaki is invited. Activities focus in three areas: technology development, personnel development, and technology exchange. An industrial design center has been established, so the Foundation is also cooperating in promoting design development activities. Technology development includes technical research aid activities in which grants of up to one-third of research costs (to a maximum of Â¥10 million) are given to medium and small to medium-sized companies for advanced technology research for new technologies or new products. These subsidies are paid upon successful completion. Since their inauguration in 1976, 84 grants have been made. One recent example of success: a precision machinery manufacturer developed an automatic punching planter for shiitake mushrooms which has received favorable response in sales throughout Japan. In the area of personnel development, the Foundation conducts training for corporate technicians on topics such as ``Training for High Technology Staff'' and ``High-Tech Seminar'' and also trains managers in order to assure the nurturing and retention of personnel who will be outstanding in dealing with high technology. It also conducts study meetings every Monday on product development methods. It also holds student field trips to corporations and provides employment counseling to promote college student hiring within the prefecture. In the area of technology exchange, the Foundation tries to improve corporate management resources and technology strengths by carrying out exchanges between different industries, industry-academia-government exchanges, and exchanges with advanced regions. The Manager-Researcher Exchange Forum is an annual event held since 1987 at Toyama University's engineering faculty in cooperation with the University's Regional Cooperative Research Center. Participants number more than two hundred. It has become a model for alliances between regional cooperative research centers and regional foundations established later. The Toyama Technology Exchange Club which is run on a membership basis holds monthly seminars focused on central lecturers to promote the members' mutual studies as well as cooperative research and market development. The Toyama Industrial Design Center was established in 1985 to plan for the improvement of design development capabilities among small to medium-sized companies. The Center is mainly active in education and training, design exchange, development support, and dissemination of information. The Center holds a monthly Night Forum which expands designers' circles and which has met 60 times. Information dissemination includes many events in which designers participate, such as the 1992 International Craft Festival which drew 33 participants from 16 countries. These build the appeal of Toyama as a prefecture which supports design. Beginning 1 December 1993, a design conference and various other design events will be held at Design Wave to show Toyama's appeal as a place from where design information is disseminated. Ten years of the Technopolis plan have also passed. It's the second stage now. Now the goal is to use the soil that has been cultivated by the technician training and technology exchange that has already occurred to support further exchanges between industry and academia and between different industries and to raise technology to the level appropriate to the Toyama technopolis.
