FR940216-0-00260 FR940216-0-00010 (d) Product to which standards apply. Any refiner for each refinery, or any importer, shall include in its compliance calculations: (1) Any conventional gasoline produced or imported during the averaging period; (2) Any non-gasoline petroleum products that are produced or imported and sold or transferred from the refinery or group of refineries or importer during the averaging period, if required pursuant to §80.102(e)(2), unless the refiner or importer is able to establish in the form of documentation that the petroleum products were used for a purpose other than the production of gasoline within the United States; (3) Any gasoline blending stock produced or imported during the averaging period which becomes conventional gasoline solely upon the addition of oxygenate; (4)(i) Any oxygenate that is added to conventional gasoline, or gasoline blending stock as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, where such gasoline or gasoline blending stock is produced or imported during the averaging period; (ii) In the case of oxygenate that is added at a point downstream of the refinery or import facility, the oxygenate may be included only if the refiner or importer can establish the oxygenate was in fact added to the gasoline or gasoline blendstock produced, by showing that the oxygenate was added by: (A) The refiner or importer; or (B) By a person other than the refiner or importer, provided that the refiner or importer: (1) Has a contract with the oxygenate blender that specifies procedures to be followed by the oxygenate blender that are reasonably calculated to ensure blending with the amount and type of oxygenate claimed by the refiner or importer; and (2) Monitors the oxygenate blending operation to ensure the volume and type of oxygenate claimed by the refiner or importer is correct, through periodic audits of the oxygenate blender designed to assess whether the overall volumes and type of oxygenate purchased and used by the oxygenate blender are consistent with the oxygenate claimed by the refiner or importer and that this oxygenate was blended with the refiner's or importer's gasoline or blending stock, periodic sampling and testing of the gasoline produced subsequent to oxygenate blending, and periodic inspections to ensure the contractual requirements imposed by the refiner or importer on the oxygenate blender are being met. (e) Product to which standards do not apply. Any refiner for each refinery, or any importer, shall exclude from its compliance calculations: (1) Gasoline that was not produced at the refinery or was not imported by the importer; (2) Blendstocks that have been included in another refiner's compliance calculations, pursuant to §80.102(e)(2) or otherwise; (3) Gasoline that meets the enforcement exemption for California gasoline under §80.81; and (4) Gasoline that is exported. (f) Compliance baseline determinations. (1) In the case of any refiner or importer for whom an individual baseline has been established under §80.91, the individual baseline for each parameter or emissions performance shall be the compliance baseline for that refiner or importer. (2) In the case of any refiner or importer for whom the anti-dumping statutory baseline applies under §80.91, the anti-dumping statutory baseline for each parameter or emissions performance shall be the compliance baseline for that refiner or importer. (3) In the case of a party that is both a refiner and an importer, and for whom an individual 1990 baseline has not been established for the imported product under §80.91(b)(4), the compliance baseline for the imported product shall be the 1990 volume weighted average of all of the refiner's individual refinery baselines. (4) Any compliance baseline under paragraph (f) (1) or (3) of this section shall be adjusted for each averaging period as follows: (i) The 1990 equivalent conventional gasoline volume for an averaging period is calculated according to the following formula: E:GRAPHICSer16fe94.021 where V eq =the 1990 equivalent conventional gasoline volume V 1990 =the 1990 volume of gasoline as determined under §80.91(f)(1) V r =the total volume of reformulated gasoline produced or imported by a refiner or importer during the averaging period excluding gasoline which meets the enforcement exemptions of §80.81 V c =the total volume of conventional gasoline produced or imported by a refiner or importer during the averaging period excluding gasoline which meets the enforcement exemptions of §80.81 (ii)(A) If the total volume of the conventional gasoline produced or imported by the refiner or importer during the averaging period is equal to or less than that refiner's or importer's 1990 equivalent conventional gasoline volume, the compliance baseline for each parameter shall be that refiner's or importer's individual 1990 baseline; or (B) If the total volume of the conventional gasoline produced or imported by the refiner or importer is greater than that refiner's or importer's 1990 equivalent conventional gasoline volume, the compliance baseline for each parameter or emissions performance shall be calculated according to the following formula: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.022 where CB i =the compliance baseline value for parameter or emissions product i B i =the refiner's or importer's individual baseline value for parameter i calculated according to the methodology in §80.91 V eq =the 1990 equivalent conventional gasoline volume for the averaging period, calculated pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section DB i =the anti-dumping statutory baseline value for parameter i, as specified at §80.91(c)(5) V c =the total volume of conventional gasoline and other products included under paragraph (d) of this section produced or imported by a refiner or importer during the averaging period
