The U.S. treasury official said Bentsen "urged Japan to do more to stimulate domestic demand and to bring down the (trade) surplus" during talks with Fujii. Fujii, however, emerged from the meeting saying the U.S. had not made any particularly strong requests. The 30-minute talks were held at the Treasury Department ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations in the afternoon. Bentsen "also emphasized the importance of steps by Japan to open up its financial services and insurance markets to foreign competition," the official said, suggesting an unchanged U.S. stance to await further Japanese moves to restart the stalled "framework" trade talks. The treasury official termed that talks "useful" for reviewing bilateral developments prior to the G-7 gathering. Both sides declined to reveal what Bentsen and Fujii discussed about exchange rates. Fujii said he told Bentsen that the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package adopted by the Japanese Government in February is proceeding "steadily" and "the economy is gradually showing brightness" and is not as weak as the recent projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF predicted in its twice-yearly world economic outlook that Japan's economic growth in terms of real gross domestic product (GDP) would be 0.7 percent in 1994. The Japanese Government is projecting a 2.4 percent growth for fiscal 1994. Japanese officials briefing reporters said Fujii spent most of the 30-minute session with Bentsen trying to explain the current state of the Japanese economy. They said Fujii assured Bentsen that the new cabinet to be formed when Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is elected premier will continue the policy of deregulating the Japanese economy and carrying out economic reform. The Japanese finance minister said he also explained that a policy accord newly reached Friday by the coalition parties endorsed the direction for "comprehensive" tax reform to be decided in June and enacted by the end of the year. Regarding the framework trade talks with the United States, Japanese officials said Fujii emphasized the importance of Japan- U.S. relations and Japan's desire to resume the talks as soon as possible. Fujii also explained that Japan's trade surplus has started to decline, noting the Japanese current account surplus shrank in yen terms last year, the officials said.
