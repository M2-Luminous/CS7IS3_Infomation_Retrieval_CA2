Kononova; place and date not given: "The Flag-Waving Begins When the Money Comes To Be Shared Out"] [Text] Some political scientists have evaluated as an act which is unprecedented in terms of personal courage and unpredictable in its consequences the consent of Yevgeniy Saburov (deputy prime minister and minister of economics in the I. Silayev government and director of the Center for Information and Social Technology under the present government) to head Crimea's ministerial cabinet. On 11 March of this year the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Crimea confirmed Ye. Saburov as head of the Crimean Government. What are the first results of the activity of the new cabinet? How is the political and economic situation in Crimea developing? This was the subject of our discussion with Yevgeniy Fedorovich Saburov. [Kononova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, what did you find attractive in Crimean President Yu. Meshkov's offer of the post of head of the cabinet? Which of the difficulties that you have encountered in your first month of work have come as a surprise to you? [Saburov] This invitation attracted me primarily by the possibility of the realization in practice of the ideas and principles of the implementation of economic reforms which seem to me paramount. In my view, it is extraordinarily important that a democratic government pursue its reforms with a view to the populace. That it not play at being some omniscient guru who has endeavored by his shamanistic incantations of the Phillips' Curve or monetarist theory type to evoke the spirit of capitalism on the sinful land and serve it up to the ignoramuses surrounding him but implement reforms openly, explaining to people and coordinating with them his every action. As far as the difficulties I have encountered are concerned, there have, I must confess, been no particular surprises. Everything was, essentially, expected. The only thing I did not expect was the weakness of the Ukrainian Government. A strong government that knows what it wants expresses this, as a rule, and it is possible to come to terms with it on some matters. A weak government changes its views three times a day, is in a state of continual mild hysteria, is not sure that it will be there tomorrow, and does not know how to shore up its positions. Coming to terms with such a government is absolutely impossible. Even here, in Russia, I heard from friends negotiating with various states: The negotiations with Ukraine are the worst since it is absolutely incomprehensible what they want. The point is that there never was Ukrainian statehood, it has emerged for the first time. And this concept itself is at this time in an absolutely infantile state, no one has the faintest idea what this means. As a result Ukraine is erecting prohibitory barriers where they have never been erected by the Baltic or Western countries, but is at the same time doing some things such as though there were still a State Planning Committee and it were possible to go to it with any purchase orders. Something quite childlike and unstructured shows through in all things, and because of this things are quite unpredictable. It is extraordinarily difficult working under such conditions. [Kononova] And what is the extent of your independence, Crimea's independence? [Saburov] Formally, according to the laws of Ukraine, Crimea is extraordinarily independent. In fact, however, each action of Crimea's causes great confusion in the leadership of Ukraine. We constantly encounter: "If we authorize this for you, what would our Lvov nationalists say." When you say: "You authorized this a long time ago, here are the papers," you hear in response: "Yes, we wrote this, but never thought that this is how it would actually be." We, however, will insist on fulfillment of the law on the delineation of powers between Kiev and Simferopol. This is a Ukrainian law, the deputies passed it themselves, let it now be fulfilled. Of course, there is also ill will, and there are simple natural enemies of Crimea. There is a part of the government which would not, generally, have any objections, but is afraid of the bad example for other oblasts, is afraid of a division of the state. And this is understandable. There are, finally, yet others who are simply nobodies and who are worried by just one thing--that their chair will be knocked from under them. And these people are the most frightening. [Kononova] I realize that a comparison is improper, nonetheless, Valentin Fedorov went to Sakhalin not that long ago, promising to score inconceivable economic successes there. We know how it all ended. What have you really managed to achieve? What kind of mark would you give yourself for the six weeks of work? [Saburov] Crimea is not Sakhalin, and I am not Fedorov. There can, truly, be absolutely no comparison here. It is still too early to give any marks. There is essentially no government yet even. Yes, I have been confirmed by the Supreme Soviet of Crimea, but all the rest of the government is as before, and it is not working, what is more, and a new one has not been appointed. Only now have the first appointments been made. And only the upper stratum has been appointed at that, but everything at the bottom needs to be changed also. Real work has been slowed considerably. Everything is only just beginning at this time. [Kononova] You had an opportunity to form your own team? [Saburov] I sharply protest this very word "team." Please understand that the economy and state administration are not a football. It was those who came to play at state administration that put this word in circulation. Let them busy themselves with teams and players. I, on the other hand, am inviting specialists who are not bound among themselves by any friendly relations and who have taken no oaths at a soccer match. They are various sorts of people. Each of which is a specialist in his field. There is just one principle of personnel selection--professional. Not party, not friendship, not some other. Have I succeeded in enlisting proper professionals? In some positions, yes, in others, no. The pay is, to be frank, beggarly, and not everyone will come for this. Those who really want to show what they are capable of and to test their ideas in practice will. [Kononova] Come from where? [Saburov] From Moscow, Petersburg, Zaporozhye. From various places. [Kononova] You do not wish to mention the actual names? [Saburov] I can cite the names only of those who have already been appointed. They are Muscovites, in the main, people with whom there was from the outset a firm agreement that they would come. Andrey Vasilyevich Chernyavskiy, minister of economics. Lyudmila Mikhaylovna Zaytseva, minister of finance. Viktor Nikolayevich Remeyko, Committee for Foreign Economic Relations. Anatoliy Romanovich Franchuk, minister for the administration of state-run enterprises, has already been appointed. He was a member of the previous government, that is, we are preserving a certain continuity. This position needs a person who enjoys authority among the directors. [Kononova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, you are constantly saying that Crimea's economy is strongly tied to that of Russia and oriented toward Russian sales markets. To what extent are politics getting in the way of economics? Is the situation concerning the shareout of the Black Sea Fleet being reflected in the activity of Crimea in some way? [Saburov] The Black Sea Fleet situation is a question of who will get the money from the sale of old ships. There is no politics here. Dough is being shared out. [Kononova] Nonetheless, do you have any wishes you would care to address to Russian and Ukrainian politicians? [Saburov] One wish: that they not be so avaricious. On account of their own greed, both sides have simply paralyzed themselves. Ukraine is distinguished by particular avarice, of course. This is the "I wouldn't eat it but I'll take a bite" from the celebrated story. This is not a story, simply the truth. "I won't eat it myself nor will I give it to anyone else." Everyone is afraid of making a miscalculation. They are arguing about the rent, about who the decommissioned ships should be turned over to for scrap. This is good money. There is flag-waving only when money is being shared out. [Kononova] And what is your view of Nursultan Nazarbayev's idea of the creation of a Eurasian Union? [Saburov] Some newspapers have written that Nazarbayev is reiterating Saburov's idea. I disagree with this assertion altogether, Nazarbayev's ideas are quite independent. But I truly am a supporter of the creation of such a union. But for its creation we all need to be a little more civilized. It should be remembered that the logic: mine is mine, and yours is also mine, is no use here. Sharing is essential. After all, Nazarbayev also initially "fell" on Baykonur, but then realized that he was not up to it, that maintaining it by himself would be difficult. This is why such ideas arise: I cannot finance all these things myself, I need Russia, I need some money. Russia is somewhat richer. They say, generally, you know, when it is a question of some crime or someone's unexpected behavior: "cherchez la femme, look for the woman." This is the clue. So here, when high politics begins, there is a different clue: look for the money. Everything is connected with this. This is, as the ordinary folk say, an economic issue. Why was Yuriy Meshkov, the president of Crimea, not admitted to the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia apropos the fleet? Crimea has every right to take part in these negotiations, the fleet's bases are on its territory. No, he was elbowed aside, suppose he also requested something or other. It is shameful, dear leaders, availing yourselves of Crimean land and trying to fool the Crimeans. It was not Meshkov who disgraced himself in wanting to take part in these negotiations, it was those who refused to admit him to them who disgraced themselves, demonstrating to the world their selfish interests. [Kononova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, you have dual citizenship, and you remain the research leader at the center where you have been working in recent years. Does this mean that you are unwilling to burn all your bridges? [Saburov] Yes, I remain a Russian citizen. And if my powers and knowledge are needed by the Russian Government, I am always at its disposal. Leadership of the center, search for the Russian economy's escape from the crisis, and the reforms being implemented here will remain for me just as urgent as before. [Kononova] From Crimea our reforms are seen as being.... [Saburov] ...considerably better than from Russia. And Chernomyrdin is altogether pursuing a pretty good economic policy at this time, in my view. Pretty good. Technically competent. He is not, at least, behaving like a bull in a china shop. He has shown that we need to know how to work, not live by statements and declarations. [Kononova] And the final question. What can you tell Russians who had been accustomed to spending their summer vacations in Crimea? [Saburov] Come. We await you. It is quiet, tranquil, provincial here. We will do everything necessary. Crimea's resorts are at your service. We are now negotiating and organizing in Moscow a Crimea tourist agency. Here we will tell you everything: what passes are available, where they are valid, how much they cost, how they can be purchased. So come without fail. [Kononova] Thank you.
