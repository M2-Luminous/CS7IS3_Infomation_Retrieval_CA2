FR941107-2-00152 FR941107-2-00088 [Release No. 34&hyph;34916; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;32] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to a One-Year Extension of the Pilot for Auxiliary Closing Procedures for Expiration Days October 31, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 notice is hereby given that on September 22, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the purposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. While the NYSE has not requested accelerated approval of the proposal, the auxiliary closing procedures are scheduled to expire on October 31, 1994. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange proposes to extend the pilot for auxiliary closing procedures for market-at-the-close (``MOC'') orders utilized on expiration Fridays and quarterly expiration days until October 31, 1995. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose Special procedures regarding the entry of market-at-the-close (``MOC'') orders on expiration Fridays were originally adopted in 1986 for quarterly triple expiration of derivative instrument products. 3 Since November 1988, these procedures have been used for each monthly expiration and apply to the so-called ``pilot stocks'' (the 50 most highly capitalized S&P 500 stocks and any component stocks of the Major Market Index that are not included in this group of 50). 4 In April 1992, the Exchange modified the pilot procedures and included additional special procedures for handling MOC orders in all stocks on expiration Fridays. In March 1993, the Exchange extended the expiration Friday auxiliary closing procedures to days on which quarterly index expiration (``QIX'') options expire. 5 In September 1993, the Exchange again modified the pilot procedures to change the cut-off time for entry, cancellation or reduction of MOC orders to 3:40 p.m. 3 Expiration Friday is the trading day, usually the third Friday of the month, when some stock index futures, stock index options and options on stock index futures expire or settle concurrently. Triple expirations are the four times a year during the months of March, June, September, and December when all stock index futures, stock index options, options on stock index futures and individual equity options expire. 4 The NYSE auxiliary closing procedures for expiration Fridays were initially approved by the Commission on a pilot basis for a one-year period beginning in November, 1988 and extending through October, 1989. The pilot has since been extended each year between October 1989 through October 1994 on a one-year pilot basis.
