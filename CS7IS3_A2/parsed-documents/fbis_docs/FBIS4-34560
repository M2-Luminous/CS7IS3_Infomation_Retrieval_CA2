Today, the de facto government ordered barricades of sand bags be erected in the area surrounding the National Palace and General Headquarters. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Constant, leader of the paramilitary group Front for Haiti's Advance and Progress (FRAPH), announced that on Friday they will begin a strike to protest the possible U.S. intervention. He said the group, which changed its name to the Haitian People's Armed Revolutionary Front, will stage the measure against U.S. President William Clinton, William Gray, his adviser for the Haitian crisis, and deposed Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. FRAPH patrolled the streets of the capital last October to prevent any activity after declaring a strike to protest the return of Aristide, which was scheduled for 30 October in compliance with the Governor's Island Agreement. Followers of the military protested the U.S. Government's intention to disseminate antimilitary propaganda from planes in a two-week period, like they did in Panama and Iraq. Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies and confidant of the coupist officers, said "that is immoral... they want to cause a civil war... the military High Command is not responsible for the coup... it was organized by soldiers." Meanwhile, sources at the U.S. Embassy in Haiti said that more than half of the diplomatic mission's personnel and their dependents have left the country, four days before the suspension of commercial flights to Haiti goes into effect. This measure is part of the nearly total embargo decreed since 22 May to pressure military officers into relinquishing power and allowing the return of Aristide.
