[passage omitted] Rabuka also stressed that his ministers must discharge their duties impartially and serve the government and the people of Fiji to the best of their ability. The prime minister also requested the ministers disclose in confidence a full list of their holdings of stocks in companies and shares they have acquired after taking office. His moves followed reports last year that Rabuka's wife and one of his cabinet ministers had shares in a construction company which had won a five million Fiji dollar (3.2 million US dollar) contract to upgrade Fiji's international airport at Nadi, on the western edge of the main island. At the time Rabuka denied he had anything to do with the awarding of the contract to the company, whose bid was the lowest, and later his wife and the cabinet minister sold their shares.
