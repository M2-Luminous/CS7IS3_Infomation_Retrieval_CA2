Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said that the Polish Government must still approve the partnership, but ruled out the possibility that the government would reject the project. He said that the government had already charged the premier with supporting the project and expressing Poland's willingness to participate in it. The Partnership for Peace will not remove a dangerous political vacuum, but has enough provisions to prevent one from appearing, Olechowski said. Poland is not striving for admission into NATO out of fear for its own security, but rather because the membership of Central and Eastern European countries in European structures should be a guarantee that this part of Europe does not become a "gray zone." Olechowski said that joint exercises between Polish and NATO military units could be held this year. He did not rule out the possibility that other partners would also participate in the exercises, but added that it is important to consider the political consequences of such activities in advance. Polish Premier Waldemar Pawlak said at the press conference that the continued existence of the Visegrad Group would not be decided on through top-level political talks but through concrete cooperation. Poland is interested in developing its infrastructure and communications, he said, citing the planned construction of a highway south from Gdansk, which he said would be important not only for Poland but for the other Visegrad countries as well. Poland would also welcome the opening of American and Western European markets to Central European, particularly Polish, goods, he said.
