After this meeting, Redman again denied presenting any specific proposals to the Bosnian Serbs. Slobodan Jankovic reports: [Jankovic] After the talks, Charles Redman told journalists the following: [Begin Redman recording in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] I think that Dr. Koljevic and I had a very good exchange. We are looking at ways to speed up this process and make progress. I think that we agreed that we should all take part and be very active in this process, because it is high time we saw whether we can reach final (?overall) solutions. In the first phase we succeeded in having the Bosnian Government and the Croatian representatives sign an agreement. We are now entering the second, important phase in which we will try to gather together all three sides. What we have done has accelerated the process. [end recording] [Jankovic] This was stated by Charles Redman after his talks with Nikola Koljevic, announcing that the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the three warring factions will continue to be involved in all the efforts to find a solution to the war in the region. Redman denied presenting any proposals, as he did after his talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Here is now a statement by Nikola Koljevic. [Begin Koljevic recording] I think that this is a positive step and, judging from the results, a very pragmatic move, without any extreme political conclusions. If you look at the sense of what the Muslim and the Croatian sides worked on in Washington, you will see that the most important thing was to eliminate the hotbeds of war. The war between the Muslims and Serbs was halted in Sarajevo. Neum has been eliminated as a contentious issue between the Muslims and the Croats. Central Bosnia as a hotbed of war has been or is being eliminated. When you take all this into account, you can see that all moves are being made in the direction of peace rather than imposing a political solution. We will have to find a political solution ourselves. Of course, no one can deprive a nation of the right to find a political solution itself. [end recording]
