FR940630-1-00042 FR940630-1-00011 The primary potential benefit of the provision is the additional safety that could result from analyzing the feasible range of reverser system failures, the effects of those failures, and the corresponding capabilities necessary to correct the failure or circumvent its effects. Such an analysis would reduce the possibility that an unanticipated condition with catastrophic potential would remain in the system. In addition to the safety benefit, it is expected that some operating benefits and manufacturing economies would result from the uniformity of standards between parts 23 and 25. The FAA is not able to quantify the potential benefits of this provision but has determined that the benefits would exceed the expected minor costs. Second, the proposed rule would add a new paragraph (b) to §23.959 requiring that the effect of any fuel pump failure on the unusable fuel supply be determined. Though not previously required, it has been industry practice to include this information in the Airplane Flight Manual. The FAA estimates that the nominal cost of making this determination would be $240 per certification (4 hours of engineering analysis at $60 per hour). In addition, an insignificant cost ($1) would be incurred in adding a table entry to the manual for each airplane that is produced. The fact that the proposed requirement is already standard practice supports the FAA's position that the potential benefits of the provision would exceed the minor costs. The safety benefits of this provision would be derived from the assurance that this vital information would continue to be provided for future airplane models. Third, under §23.979, the proposed rule would add the requirement for commuter category airplanes that an indication be provided at each fueling station in the event of a failure of the shutoff means to stop fuel flow at the maximum level. The FAA estimates that the proposed required device would necessitate an incremental design and development cost of $3000 per certification (50 hours of engineering design at $60 per hour) and an additional nominal manufacturing cost of $10 per airplane. The benefit of the provision is the avoidance of a potentially catastrophic condition whereby excess fuel could unknowingly be forced out of the contained fuel system by the pressure fueling system. The FAA holds that these potential benefits would exceed the minor associated costs. Fourth, §23.1041 would require that the powerplant cooling system must be able to maintain the specified operating temperatures of the powerplant components and fluids. The ambient temperature for testing reciprocating engine airplanes is currently required to be corrected to show the capacity of the cooling system at 100 ○F. Under the proposal, this temperature standard would be revised to the ``maximum ambient temperature conditions for which approval is requested.'' No costs are attributed to this provision. Reciprocating engine airplane manufacturers would continue to have the option to request approval for operations at the existing 100 ○F temperature. A decision to request approval for a higher temperature would necessitate demonstration of the capability of the cooling system at that temperature. That choice, however, would be made at the manufacturer's discretion and would be based on its decision that any associated incremental cooling system costs would be recovered in the marketplace. The potential benefit of this provision is the reduced likelihood that an inadequate cooling system would be relied on during high temperature operations. Finally, §23.1045(a) would be revised to state more generally that compliance with the cooling margin requirements of §23.1041 must be shown for all phases of operation, as compared to the four phases of flight currently listed. In effect, the proposal would add the taxi phase of operation. The FAA estimates that the specific addition of the taxi phase would necessitate an incremental 5 hours of engineering analysis valued at $60 per hour, for a total of $300 per certification. The potential benefit of this provision is the enhanced safety that would result from evaluating the efficacy of the cooling system during the taxi phase of operation. In the taxi phase of operation, engine power settings and heat production generally may be lower than that experienced during flight, but available air circulation might also be lower. The heat mechanics of the two phases of operation are distinct and warrant separate evaluation. The FAA holds that the potential benefits of this provision would exceed the nominal associated costs.
