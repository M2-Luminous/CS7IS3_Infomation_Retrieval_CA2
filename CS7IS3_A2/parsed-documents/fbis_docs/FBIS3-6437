The major points of the draft package of measures are to 1) review the basic plan for public investment; 2) use financial and investment loans to promote Japan's imports and foreign investments in Japan and 3) promote deregulation and establish objective criteria to deal with bilateral negotiations on individual sectors under the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The Finance Ministry, however, disapproves of expanding public investment, and the coordination of views within the government will be sped up in the future. There are two draft packages. One has been mapped out by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] with the intentions of the private sector taken into account, and the other has been worked out by the Prime Minister's Office. The two packages place priority on macroeconomic policy. The "United States is interested in bilateral negotiations on the individual sectors rather than in macroeconomic policy," (says a source at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo). There is a growing view among some government officials that "even if Japan comes up with macroeconomic policy that gives no pain to anyone, it could not break the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The government and the private sector should work on bilateral negotiations on the individual sectors with a resolve to suffer pain." The government will make a political decision, and the eleventh-hour coordination of views within the government will be reached. According to the draft package, the government, in line with the macroeconomic policy, will review the basic plan for public investment that envisions an investment of 430 trillion yen by the year 2000, cuts income tax and residential taxes by 20 percent uniformly for one year, and studies the possibility of setting numerical targets for reducing Japan's current account surplus. The review of the basic plan for public investment will raise the question of whether it is compatible with the current Five-Year Plan for Economic Development that the Miyazawa government under the Liberal Democratic Party drew up in June 1993 with the aim of building Japan into a life-style superpower. For this reason, the government is likely to ask the Economic Deliberation Council to discuss ways to formulate a new five-year plan within this year. In the course of discussing the ways, the council is likely to specifically recommend how much should be added to the basic plan for public investment. The draft package worked out by the Prime Minister's Office clearly indicates that the basic plan for public investment should be increased by 100 trillion yen. The draft package formulated by MITI gives no specific figure. The final package of measures to open the Japanese market that the government will map out during March is expected to only indicate the need for a review of the basic plan for public investment for early legislation. As for the tax cut issue, the government's position is that it will wait until the ruling party Tax System Reform Consultative Council completes its debate, but the government is hoping for an early settlement to revamping the current tax system. With regard to setting numerical targets to reduce Japan's current account surplus, the draft package of the Prime Minister's Office calls for studying the possibility of reducing Japan's current account surplus to about 2.0 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) as Japan's voluntary medium-term numerical target. The Finance Ministry and the Economic Planning Agency have reacted strongly against setting such a numerical target on the grounds that if Japan fails to meet the numerical target, the United States may slap sanctions on Japan. As steps to promote foreign investments in Japan, the Japan Development Bank will give American firms more access to the current low-interest loan system by using financial and investment loan funds. As measures to promote Japan's imports, presently under consideration are the expanded application of the preferential tax system, the upgrading of the import infrastructure, the construction of more port terminals, and the use of financial resources to implement public works projects. As to the bilateral negotiations on individual sectors under the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the draft package provides ways to deal with three priority sectors. In the government's procurement of telecommunications gear and medical equipment, the government will study the possibility of setting objective criteria to measure the trend of government procurement which has increased in the past. As for the insurance, automobile and auto parts sectors, the government will deal with them by relaxing regulations.
