Our party's position is almost the same as China's." In this way, the top official indicated the party understands China's position which places emphasis on settling the issue through continuous dialogue. He then indicated a cautious attitude toward UN moves toward sanctions, saying: "Even if the United Nations imposes sanctions, they are not always effective in settling issues. Nations cannot help having mixed feeling when urged to listen to what other nations say." The top official reiterated the party will come up with its own measures to deal with the issue by the end of this month, in preparation for an SDPJ delegation's visit to China on 1 April. However, regarding the possibility of making direct contacts with the Worker's Party of Korea, the top official noted: "Since it is a matter of convenience, we cannot visit Pyongyang without making advance arrangements." Furthermore, the party's current standpoint as a member of the ruling parties is different from its former position as an opposition party.
