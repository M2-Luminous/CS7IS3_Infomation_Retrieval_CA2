Frankfurt--In emulation of the "German model," Jean-Yves Haberer dragged Credit Lyonnais into a series of investments in manufacturing, business, and service firms. The bank's former president was not alone in the late 1980's. The "bank-industry" concept was hot, as was that of the "bankinsurer," which called for hybridizing insurance companies and banks. The general idea was to find a solution that would allow French capitalism to finance itself while at the same time protecting it from possible hostile takeovers. The "hard core" system of privatization, which distributed a strategic fraction of a company's stock among various "friendly" holders, was widely employed during the first cohabitation, but it got bad press after 1988, when it was reproached on political grounds for being too uniformly RPR [Rally for the Republic] in stripe and on economic grounds for putting too much emphasis on defending the existing stockholders (including the incumbent chairman and chief executive office) at the expense of developing the company's capital. In short, the hard core solution exhibited the defects of peculiarly French "inbreeding." It provided the political framework for connivance among the major national firms in a generalized "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours" arrangement that was in the final analysis fragile and in any case fainthearted. At the same time, the Socialists, now back in the driver's seat, no longer wanted the state to cover the capital requirements of government-owned companies directly. Portfolio Minds are turned to the "German model," which cast banks and a few insurance companies (including the biggest one, Allianz) in the central role. To compensate for a lack of capitalists during its industrialization, nineteenth- century Germany had relied on banks to mobilize savings indirectly and funnel them into industry. The traditional involvement of financial institutions dates to this period. It is characterized in part by a "Hausbank" system under which a company relies on its bank for all of its transaction requirements, from the sale of shares in its stock to the use of overdraft facilities. Often the German bank itself may even acquire stock in its customer, either in the event of difficulties or in order to go in with it on its business. This system was to be further strengthened after World War II. German banks, at one point dismembered by the Americans, were able to plead their case successfully with the help of Hermann Joseph Abs, the head of the biggest among them, Deutsche Bank. They reorganized as "universal banks," which were authorized to do everything at a time when U.S. banks were narrowly limited in scope. German universal banks may (as in France) open limited-service branch offices (deposit banking), arrange financing (investment banking), engage in insurance operations, and, of course, acquire shares in manufacturing or insurance companies. It is no exaggeration to state that the power of Germany's financial institutions quickly became considerable. Their heads cornered so many seats on industrial supervisory boards that a law was passed in 1965 (the Abs Act) limiting the number of seats that could be held by one person to 10. Today, banks and insurance companies still account for 10 percent of the seats on the supervisory boards of the country's 100 biggest firms. Percentage ownership is not always known, but it exceeds 10 percent in an impressive number of cases (see table below). Allianz' total portfolio is valued at 185 billion marks [DM]! As for Deutsche Bank, its stable portfolio is worth DM25 billion, not including stock in banks. The English-speaking world, which does not follow this model (or, rather, did not, since changes appear to be in the making in the United States), decries this influence on the country's economy. It sees it as a usurpation of power that is bad for the small investor and bad for free competition in general. The main arguments are as follows. Since banks would naturally prefer to be the ones to distribute credit to companies, they do not encourage them to turn to the stock market, thereby stunting its development. Because they are paid in commissions, they do not encourage corporations to declare large dividends. Because they can exercise their stockholding customers' voting rights in general stockholders' meetings, they "hog-tie" the discussions and decisions. In short, banks are held responsible for Germany's "hermetically sealed," "opaque" brand of capitalism. More Banal Behavior Given that this closure and opaqueness do not appear to have harmed Germany's postwar recovery (on the contrary!), these causes for irritation in the English-speaking world were precisely what some in France, including Jean-Yves Haberer, admired. Hence the infatuation with the concepts of "bank-industry" or "bankinsurer-industry." Today, the internationalization of finance, the "disintermediation" of the major groups (they have their own financial resources and need banks less and less), and the recession, which has triggered a series of serious setbacks, and compelled reappraisal or at least caution. In France, there has been much less talk about bank-industry since the resumption of privatization at breakneck speed and Credit Lyonnais' difficulties. Without debate or public explanation, French capitalism is regrouping around the "connivance" model. In Germany, on the other hand, banks remain loyal to the bank-industry concept despite some resounding failures: the collapse of Metallgesellschaft, which cost the lending banks DM3.4 billion, and the very recent bankruptcy of the Juergen Schneider real estate development empire. True, their power over the national economy is gradually declining as trade barriers come down, they are themselves tending towards more banal behavior. "Our holdings have tended to diminish over the past 10 years," Peter Pietsch of Commerzbank says. However, while ties to big business are loosening to some extent, this is less true of small and mid-sized companies--the "Mittelstand" that constitutes the country's industrial strength. They remain attached to their Hausbaenke, even if they now call on several institutions for major transactions. Furthermore, stock ownership is only one of the tools at the disposal of German universal banks in maintaining their ties with industry. "Our policy remains fundamentally unchanged," Peter Pietsch says. When problems arise, a bank increases its holdings (very often in conjunction with other banks), as in the case of Commerzbank's entry into the Karstadt distribution group during the economic crisis of the 1930's. In the 1970's, Deutsche Bank took over the Flick family's stock in Daimler-Benz to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Shah of Iran. Last year it increased its holdings in Continental Tires to 10 percent to counter Pirelli's attack. Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank will have to subscribe heavily to the next stock issue of Metallgesellschaft, which is on the verge of bankruptcy. Conversely, holdings are sometimes sold. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank recently each divested themselves of 15 percent of Karstadt's stock in order to facilitate the purchase of the group by its competitor, Kaufhof-Hertie. Deutsche Bank sold its 12.8 percent interest in Suedzucker sugars in order to encourage restructuring in that sector. Deutsche Bank's decision to reduce its stake in Daimler-Benz to under 25 percent is more unusual. Hilmar Kopper, the bank's head, "no longer wants minority control and does not want to be seen as having minority control. He wants to reduce his dependency as a stockholder," he explained to the magazine EUROMONEY in its January 1994 issue. He emphasizes that a Hausbank's power can backfire, making it more a "captive" of the company than vice versa. Hilmar Kopper also wants to trim his German portfolio and expand his European one. "I consider our industrial holdings necessary. They are an invaluable part of our assets," he says. But he wants "different-colored eggs" in his basket and plans to acquire an interest of "2 to 3 percent" in various European firms. Superpower This policy is currently hampered by the amount of capital gains taxes that Deutsche Bank will have to pay on the sale of its investments. For the time being, the German bank officially owns stock in only one foreign company, Fiat. But from now on it will tend to become less German and more European. Will France wake up when Deutsche Bank acquires 3 percent of Saint-Gobain, for example? Jean-Louis Beffa, the head of the French group, hopes it will and travels to Frankfurt regularly to ask Hilmar Kopper to do so. If it does, confronted with what will appear to be a "German superpower," the French may rediscover the virtues of bank-industry in a predictable panic.
