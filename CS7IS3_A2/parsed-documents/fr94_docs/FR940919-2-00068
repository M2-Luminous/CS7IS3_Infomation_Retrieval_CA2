These cooperative agreements are funded under the authority of section 781, title VII of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. Section 781 authorizes research on certain health professions issues. For this cooperative agreement program, research focuses on the medical education aspects of this legislation and ``medical education'' is defined as education provided to individuals working toward the M.D. or D.O. degree, or as post-graduate M.D./D.O. education in an accredited residency or fellowship program. Purpose The purpose of the Cooperative Agreements for Centers for Medical Education Research is to support research in medical education, especially regarding existing or proposed federal policies and programs and regarding the impact of Federal initiatives aimed at improving the training of health professionals and at meeting national workforce goals. Section 781 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to award cooperative agreements for the purpose of: (a) conducting research on the extent to which the debt incurred by medical students for attendance at educational institutions has had a detrimental effect on the decisions made by the students on entering primary care specialties; (b) conducting research on the effects that federally-funded educational programs or policies for minority or disadvantaged individuals have on: (A) the number of such individuals attending health professions schools; (B) the number of such individuals completing the programs of education involved; and (C) the decisions made by such individuals on which of the health professions specialties to enter; (c) conducting research on the effectiveness of the States in protecting the public health through: (1) identifying health care providers with respect to whom investigations of professional qualifications are warranted; (2) conducting such investigations; and (3) taking disciplinary actions against health care providers determined through such investigations to have engaged in conduct inconsistent with protecting the public health; (d) conducting research: (A) to determine the extent to which Federal programs and related financial incentives influence the percentage of medical school graduates selecting a primary care career; (B) to determine the extent to which Federal programs and related financial incentives adequately support the training of mid-level primary care providers relative to other health professions education receiving Federal assistance; (C) to assess the impact that direct and indirect payments for graduate medical education (including the appropriateness of payments for independent, ambulatory training sites) have on increasing the percentage of physicians graduating from medical school who enter primary care careers; (D) to assess the impact of medical school admissions policies on specialty selection and recommend ways admission policies can better facilitate and promote the selection of primary care as a medical career; (E) to assess the impact of Federal funding for biomedical research on the design of medical school curriculum and the availability of primary care educational opportunities;
