The high-ranking Argentine Air Force representative said these purchases "do not represent an imbalance between the two countries' air forces." Brigadier Gimenez arrived in Santiago on 25 April to attend a series of meeting with the Chilean Air Force general staff and to visit the National Aeronautical Enterprise (Enaer). Gimenez told journalists that "we want to tighten our friendship ties," and explained that the two nations' air forces are carrying out joint projects and assessing several cooperation projects for the future. He also said the individuals responsible for the theft of plans for the advanced training aircraft IA-63 "Pampa" from the Argentine Aerospace Equipment Manufacturing Company (FAMA) have not been identified yet. He denied that this theft might harm the plan to market this aircraft, which Argentina hopes to sell to the United States. The high-ranking Argentine official explained that the U.S. A-4 Skyhawk fighter bombers will arrive in Argentina in the next few months. Gimenez reiterated that both Argentina and Chile maintain a cordial relationship and are constantly exchanging information, and dismissed any type of unrest over the acquisition of combat aircraft by both countries.
