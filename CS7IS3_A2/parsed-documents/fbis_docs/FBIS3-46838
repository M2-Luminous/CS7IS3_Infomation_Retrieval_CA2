FBIS3-46838 "dreas004__a94017" FBIS-EAS-94-004-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX Japan `Strong' Authority Planned for Reform Council OW0201143494 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 Dec 93 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0201143494 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] A third party organ will be established in the Prime Minister's Office to implement political reform, including the easing of government regulations. In this regard, on 28 December, the government decided to make it a strong organ. In addition to deliberation and investigation rights, the government decided to allow the organ to have its own secretariat and to give advice to ministers. It is a concept designed to make the organ similar, in terms of its form and power, to the National Railway Reconstruction Administration Council, which was charged with overseeing the privatization of the national railway system. The government plans to submit legislation establishing the body to the next ordinary Diet session, pending consultations with coalition parties. The concept of establishing the third party organ was formed in response to a report by the Economic Reform Study Council -- a private consultative body to Prime Minister Hosokawa -- and recommendations by the Provisional Council for Promotion of Administrative Reform (third administrative reform council). The new body's main tasks will be: 1) to discuss the five-year deregulation program to be created by the administrative reform promotion headquarters to be established as early as mid-January and to watch how it will be carried out; and 2) to work out the draft of the freedom-of-information legislation on the basis of government inquiries. If necessary, the body will be authorized to intervene in discussions on the creation of deregulation programs by individual ministries and agencies and watch the progress of program implementation and advise cabinet ministers. For the time being, it is likely that an influential person in the financial world will be appointed to head the body. Moreover, the government is studying the possibility of appointing academicians, private citizens, retired bureaucrats, and journalists to the body. In particular, the government intends to allow the Diet to appoint council members. The idea of allowing the organ to have its own secretariat stems from an Economic Reform Council proposal made in its final report, saying that the organ should "have its own secretariat." It seems that the secretariat will be staffed by officials from the Management and Coordination Agency [MCA] and other ministries and agencies. Regarding the third party organ, Prime Minister Hosokawa and MCA Director General Koshiro Ishida agreed on the basis of the National Administrative Organization Act's Clause 8 to establish the body in the Prime Minister's Office. Following the agreement, coordination was made within the government. As a result, the concept of forming the third party organ was formed. The government intends to make the organ similar to the National Railway Reconstruction Administration Council, which was also formed on the basis of Clause 8 and had its own secretariat and right to advise ministers. It will be a stronger body than the Provisional Council for Promotion of Administrative Reform, which did not have the right to advise ministers. However, some members of the coalition parties, such as members of Naoto Kan's system revision study group which is composed of supra-partisan faction members, want the proposed body to report directly to the Diet to ensure that the organization is completely independent of the government. Because of this, coordination within the government and the ruling parties for the body's formation may be rough sailing.
