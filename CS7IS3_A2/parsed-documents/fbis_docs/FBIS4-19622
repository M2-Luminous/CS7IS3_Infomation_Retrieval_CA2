What can we do? [Hurd] Well, we have not so far succeeded in Gorazde in doing what we managed to do in Sarajevo and central Bosnia, which is, bringing the fighting to an end. So General Rose, the UN, have to go on seeking to make the situation better if they can, and meanwhile we have to consider, we have to judge -- as your report from NATO has just said -- how we can strengthen the effort, how we can make sure that we have more successes like that in Sarajevo and central Bosnia, and fewer failures like that in Gorazde. [Snow] Well now, clearly one of the main pushes of diplomatic activity has been on this idea of widening the facility to call in air strikes, to include the protecting of the safe areas -- in other words extending it beyond simply protecting UN personnel. But tonight, Mr. Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, was saying that this they will not support from Moscow unless there is already an absolute agreement, a common stance as he puts it, between Moscow, Brussels, and Washington. [Hurd] We need to involve the Russians. I don't believe the measures which the secretary general is proposing needs a new Security Council resolution. What it does need, and what it will now get from NATO, is detailed military staff work. We have got troops on the ground, British and French in particular, other Europeans, other countries, there are NATO forces in the air. What is needed now, and what will now happen, is to work out how these two can work together more effectively -- it's no good dealing with air without the ground. More ground trooops are needed. It's no good dealing with the ground without using the NATO air assets. That's what the NATO decision today says. [Snow] Alright, 50 minutes from now President Clinton will announce what he is going to do. What do you want to hear from him? [Hurd] He's announced what he is putting to his allies. I believe that the United States and the European allies are now at one on the main points. Yes we need to use air power, not because it's magic, not because it will itself bring peace, but because it can be useful in protecting the safe areas. Yes we need to keep sanctions strong and indeed strengthen them where we can, where there are loopholes. Yes we need UN troops on the ground -- more troops. I hope the President will be able to say that America is no longer having to block the financing of other people's troops, UN troops on the ground in Bosnia. I hope that other countries will now come forward with troops as we and the French and others have done. And finally, you need to have a negotiated solution, that is the only way this war is going to end -- as the French foreign minister said again today in his parliament, and that means bringing together what the Russians are trying to do, what David Owen is trying to do, what Mr. Stoltenberg is trying to do for the UN, and what the American Ambassador Redman is trying to do. It's not good having diplomats going the rounds, doing their own little bit without having a concerted effort by the international community, and that's what we are pressing for. [Snow] But we still have two bones of contention with the Americans, the first is the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims which, as Gorazde shows, surely remains a very unjust position -- and the Americans feel very strongly that it is unjust, and the second is the failure of the Americans to match air power with ground force? [Hurd] On your first point, I can imagine and have long talked about a possibility that at the end of the day, if all the UN efforts failed or the European efforts failed, and we came to the conclusion that we had to pull out our troops, there wasn't any longer any point in trying to stop this war. I can imagine then a situation in which the UN and international effort had collapsed and there were no grounds therefore for preventing the sides from fighting it out. I think it's very dangerous, tragic, and might lead to a spread of the war. I can imagine that at the end of the day, I think it would be bad for everybody concerned, but I see the logic of that. On your first point: It's for the Americans as it is for the Germans and the Italians and others who do not have ground troops [in Bosnia] to assess when and in what circumstances they could join in. We have to accept the situation as it is, whether it is the British, French, Spaniards, and one or two other European countries -- Russians or Ukrainians who are on the ground, and the Americans giving a lot of help from the air, a lot of help in the form of aid and civilian activity, but we do have to make sure that the ground and the air effort work together and there are no gaps or loop holes between them.
