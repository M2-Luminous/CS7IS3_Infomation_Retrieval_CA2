Coming up for renewal are the top positions in some of the fundamental institutions for the "government" of the West. According to various indiscretions, yesterday in Mulhouse Helmut Kohl and Francois Mitterrand are said to have agreed on a sort of organizational diagram of international power. Maybe it is not quite like this, also because the German chancellor and the French president are not the only ones to decide. But it is certain that the question has been discretely debated, also that Western chancelleries have entered into a period of feverish activity. Time is pressing as the first stage in this appointments marathon is scheduled to take place in Paris on 7 and 8 June, at the OECD ministerial meeting which ought to appoint the organization's secretary general. Then the EC's heads of state and government will be seeing each other at Corfu on 24 and 25 June, to appoint Jacques Delors' successor at the European Commission. This will be followed by the appointment of the director of the WTO (World Trade Organization), destined to succeed GATT, and the successor to the seriously ill Manfred Woerner as NATO secretary general. The problem worrying Kohl and Mitterrand is the presidency of the European Commission. They got themselves into trouble by prematurely promising to support Netherlands Premier Ruud Lubbers. Kohl's liking for Lubbers vanished when Lubbers criticized German reunification. Mitterrand has never been an enthusiastic supporter of the Netherlander, whom he also chided for showing a "scant spirit of solidarity" during the Uruguay Round trade negotiations. To undermine Lubbers, the two did not nip in the bud the candidacy of Leon Brittan, the British Conservative currently in charge of EC trade policy. They had him advance, with vague promises, then suggesting the name of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, a sanguine Fleming who has rarely put his foot outside his country's borders. Lubbers put his foot down: to torpedo his candidacy would represent an "unacceptable affront to the Netherlands." Leon Brittan has not backed off, even if he has become aware that he is losing punches. A difficult discussion is looming at Corfu, a blockage to be avoided at all costs because it would transform into a quarrel an appointment which traditionally takes place by general consent. And then Lubbers could be kept quiet by granting him the function of NATO secretary general. The OECD could be offered to Great Britain, leaving it to the London government to choose between former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, the present candidate, and Leon Brittan. Dehaene would then get the job at Corfu for lack of opponents. But, for the OECD, the game is more complex because it includes not just European players. The United States is supporting the candidacy of Canada's Donald Johnston, whilst the French have not lost hope that the job will finally go to their Jean-Claude Paye. From Washington the idea has been flown of possibly supporting a European candidate at the WTO in exchange for the EC countries supporting Donald Johnston for the OECD. In this complex scenario, the FINANCIAL TIMES about two weeks ago launched the name of former [Italian] Foreign Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero for the WTO secretaryship. The best tipped candidates, according to the English newspaper, are "the Italian Ruggiero and Brazilian Minister Ricupero." For the OECD secretaryship too, Ruggiero would be a possible compromise solution between Johnston and Paye. As a result, this matter has also been taken up with [Foreign] Minister Martino in his first international contacts. Martino, who has been supporting the suitability of an Italian presence at the top of one of the organizations regulating world trade and world economy, apparently has begun to ask for guarantees on the jobs to be given to the two Italian members of the next European Commission, for which have been put forward the names of Enrico Vinci, the present Secretary General of the European Parliament, and [Radical leader] Marco Pannella.
