FR940110-2-00100 FR940110-2-00075 Appendix B Potential applicants frequently direct questions to officials of the Department regarding application notices and programmatic and administrative regulations governing various direct grant programs. To assist potential applicants the Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions. Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline? A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances. Any change must be announced in the Federal Register and apply to all applications. Waivers for individual applications cannot be granted, regardless of the circumstances. Q. We just missed the deadline for a previous Department of Education competition. May we submit the application we prepared for it under this competition? A. Yes. However the likelihood of success is not good. A properly prepared application must meet the specifications of the competition to which it is submitted. Q. I'm not sure which competition is most appropriate for my project. What should I do? A. We are happy to discuss any questions with you and provide clarification on the unique elements of the various competitions. Q. How can I best ensure that my application is received on time and is considered under the correct competition? A. Applicants should carefully follow the instructions for filing applications that are set forth in this notice. Be sure that Block 10 of the face page of the application (Standard form 424) clearly indicates the CFDA number 84.198, and the title of the program_National Workplace Literacy Program_representing the competition in which the application should be considered. Q. Will you help us prepare our application? A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for staff to participate in the actual writing of an application, but we can respond to specific questions about application requirements, evaluation criteria, and the priority. Applicants should understand that this previous contact is not required, nor will it in any way influence the success of an application. Q. How long should an application be? A. The Department of Education is making a concerted effort to reduce the volume of paperwork in discretionary program applications. However, the scope and complexity of projects is too variable to establish firm limits on length. Your application should provide enough information to allow the review panel to evaluate the significance of the project against the criteria of the competition. We recommend that you address all of the selection criteria in an ``Application Narrative'' of no more than 50 pages in length. Supporting documentation may be included in appendices to the Application Narrative. Some examples: (1) Staff qualifications. These should be brief. They should include the person's title and role in the proposed project and contain only information about his or her qualifications that are relevant to the proposed project. Qualifications of consultants should be provided and be similarly brief. Resumes may be included in the appendices. (2) Copies of evaluation instruments proposed to be used in the project in instances where such instruments are not in general use. (3) Copies (samples) of any curricula that reflect the applicant's experience and the scope and direction of any current or previous projects related to this application. Note that a Budget Narrative describing specific uses of funds requested in the budget form also is required. No applications will be funded without this material. The Budget Narrative is not included in the recommended 50 page limit. Q. How should my application be organized? A. The applicant should assemble its package in the following order: The SF 424 on top, followed by the abstract, Partnership Agreement Form, table of contents, Budget Information Form, Budget Narrative, Application Narrative, assurances and certifications, and appendices.
