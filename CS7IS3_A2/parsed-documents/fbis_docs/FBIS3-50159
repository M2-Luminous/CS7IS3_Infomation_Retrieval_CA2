Under the pretext that the Republic of Moldova, after the introduction of its national currency, has instituted an economic blockade against Dniester and also invoking the need to regulate the circulation of their own currency and to balance the economy, this decree, among other things, prohibits the mass media from publishing material calling for the forcible overthrow of the current state and social structures or for their change, and bans mass demonstrations, which would bring about tension in the situation in the area. Similarly, the decree calls on all local executives unconditionally to observe the legal norms regarding the state of emergency. Local observers believe that the goal of issuing this decree is to preserve by all means the current order created through force of arms and, at the same time, to stop the population from participating in the future early elections for the parliament of the Republic of Moldova. As a matter of fact, during its session yesterday, the Supreme Soviet of the self-proclaimed Dniester republic issued a special declaration that the organization of elections and election campaign propaganda are prohibited throughout the Dniester region.
