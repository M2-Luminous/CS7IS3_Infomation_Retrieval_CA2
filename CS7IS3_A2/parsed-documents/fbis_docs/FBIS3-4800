Speaking at a news conference here, Gaviria said he asked for the loan earlier in the day when he met with Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, governor of the government-financed bank. Gaviria quoted Yamaguchi as expressing interest in cooperating with Colombia in promoting a 6 billion dollar project to develop the Cusiana oil field, believed to have oil deposits of some 1.5 billion barrels. Gaviria, who arrived in Tokyo Saturday for a five-day visit, said he expects an Ex-Im Bank loan to help encourage Japanese banks and companies to join the project. On other topics, Gaviria said his country will make a formal application soon for membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
