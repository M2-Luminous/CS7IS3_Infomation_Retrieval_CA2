The provincial price control bureau indicated that recently the prices of grain, oil, and nonstaple foodstuffs in some cities in our province have increased too much, which is an abnormal phenomenon. It has caused fluctuations of commodity prices on the market and increased living expenses of urban residents. The provincial party committee and government were very concerned about this issue and, in good time, held a special meeting to discuss it and make arrangements. In order to ensure basic stability of the prices of daily necessities of the public during the solar and lunar New Year season, per approval of the provincial government, it is hereby decided that ceiling market prices are set for a number of main varieties of grain and oil. The provincial government-set prices per 500 grams are as follows: 0.67 yuan for standard wheat flour; 0.68 yuan for first-class whitened wheat flour; 0.75 yuan for refined wheat flour; 4.00 yuan for peanut oil; and 3.50 yuan for rapeseed oil. The prices of grain and oil in all cities and prefectures shall be set in light of local conditions by the city or prefectural governments or price control authorities without exceeding the provincial government-set upper limits. The prices of grain and oil products and other varieties shall also [words indistinct]. The ceiling prices become effective as of 23 January, which all state-run operating units and individuals must strictly abide by. The provincial price control bureau demanded that price control authorities at all levels organize manpower to conduct full-scale inspection of local grain and oil markets. They should handle each and every case in which a unit or individual is found violating the regulations of the provincial price control bureau, and sternly penalize law-violating practices of taking advantage of the situation, jacking up prices recklessly, and disrupting market order, and expose them through the media.
