At present, the following dilemma which has been offered to our society (and grasped by it) is the foremost among them: Either we support production and employment, unavoidably slipping into the quagmire of destructive hyperinflation, or rein in inflation at the price of a further decline in production, the emergence of mass unemployment, and impoverishment of the population. Interminable and unproductive debate has begun about which is better and which is worse. Even respectable politicians, bankers, scientists, and journalists have fallen into this trap. This topic has turned out to be particularly attractive for amateurs since it allows them to engage in discussing the most complex socioeconomic problems on a kind of equal footing. Actually, the dilemma mentioned is far-fetched. In this instance, references to the fact that this situation is described in many "standard" macroeconomics textbooks do not help. They do not help because an analysis of the mutual linkage between production, investment, and employment, on one hand, and the rate of inflation, on the other hand, which is outlined in these textbooks always amounts to an utterly theoretical pattern or abstract model. The conclusions drawn in the process have value only within the framework of rigid restrictions: the existence of so-called perfect competition, the absence of monopolies of any kind, complete liberalization of prices, absolute noninterference by the state in economic processes. This methodological technique might be quite useful for the purposes of instruction in the basics of macroeconomics; however, it is unacceptable for working out a real economic policy. Life is always more complex than bookish models, and if it were not so, life would be simply boring. Poor knowledge of the economic reality of Russia, the leading trends and driving forces of scientific-technical progress, structural shifts in production, and sociocultural factors of economic growth are the primary reasons for many poorly thought-out decisions which have brought on the current crisis in the country. Attaching hopes to bookish wisdom gives rise to a claim of one's recommendations being universal. Unfortunately, we have to admit that the level and complexity of Russian problems have turned out to be greater by an order of magnitude than the professional potential and competence of a majority of Western experts and advisers. No reasonable solution to our problems exists within the framework of the aforementioned dilemma. In both cases, the finale is the same--universal destruction and chaos. The way out is to break free from the trap and develop and carry out a well-conceived, realistic, and effective program of action. It is important in principle to find and activate noninflationary factors for stimulating investment, production, and employment which would amount to the practical refutation of the dilemma in question and, at the same time, prove it to be far-fetched. Here is one more introductory remark. Miracles do not happen in real life. As the saying goes, one cannot go to bed in an economy that is badly sick and wake up to a completely healthy economy in the morning. Anticrisis programs should always take into account the time factor, be guided by strategic thinking, and be designed to be at least two to three moves ahead rather than just one. Individual actions, for example, infusions of financing to eliminate "bottlenecks," may entail unfavorable consequences in the short term (growth of the budget deficit), but in the very near future may result in perceptibly curing the economy and replenishing the state treasury. On the contrary, instantaneous advantages produced, for example, by an increase in the tax rate will in a very short time result in an unavoidable fall in budget revenues and bring about a further deterioration of the financial situation. Incidentally, statesmanlike wisdom is found in the ability to subordinate tactical decisions to strategic objectives, to steer the course of events instead of responding to them, and to engage in fire prevention rather than firefighting. Inflation In monetarist concepts, inflation is viewed as an isolated phenomenon, separate from its linkage to the structure of production, the existing system of economic mutual relations, and processes occurring at the microlevel. Growth of money supply in circulation is considered to be the only cause of inflation, and therefore containment of this supply is considered to be the only way to fight it. All means are good to this end: depreciation of the deposits of the population, late payment of wages, cutting budgetary appropriations for social and other programs, sky-high interest rates on credit, and so on. All objections by opponents are rejected out of hand by referring to the same dilemma: Inflation cannot be stopped without the contraction of investment, cutbacks in production, mass unemployment, and reductions in the incomes of the population. However, as has already been said, this is a far-fetched dilemma. Under our conditions, the nature and causes of inflation are much more complex, and so are the methods for reining it in. Along with monetary demand--an important factor, but not the only one and at present not even the dominant one--causes such as the growth of costs, the high level of monopolization in the economy, disruption of the existing system of economic relations with consumers being rigidly tied to their suppliers for considerations of technology, and the criminalization of economic relations are at work in this instance. Thus, some specialists estimate that no liberalization has actually occurred in the trade sector: The distribution of merchandise resources and price setting are controlled by the criminal structures more firmly than was the case in the time of the administrative-command system. It is not consequences but rather causes that should be fought. Inflation will not be overcome, even by way of primitive price "freezes," without these causes being eliminated; it might merely be driven deeper (which is largely the cause for the nonpayments crisis that has broken out). Many scenarios for solving the problems exist outside the framework of the monetarist dilemma. One such scenario was proposed in a joint report of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Division of Economics and the Reform Foundation. Its objectives were to normalize all aspects of the process of reproduction, set fixed prices for a limited assortment of raw material resources and railway tariffs for a period of time, perfect financial policy (including tax policy), and use a reconciliation procedure for regulating the ratio of prices to wages. Such efforts should be made in several stages. According to calculations of the RAN Institute of National Economic Projections made with the use of relevant models, the rate of inflation can be reduced to 8-10 percent a month as early as the first stage, and at the second stage, as a result of taking the entire complex of measures, to 3-5 percent per month. The discrepancy in these numbers which has been the subject of much debate recently is not due to the subjective aspect of the approach but to the completeness and sequence of implementation of the program of inflation control measures. To my mind, the fundamental difference (and advantage) of this program is found in the fact that it can be carried out without a fall in production and investment activity. In other words, the program is called upon to overcome the stereotype according to which a further recession is considered to be the unavoidable payment for reining in inflation. As we revisit the issue of restricting demand and, primarily, reducing budget appropriations, we must stress that we have reached the critical threshold in this area. It will no longer suffice to say that we would have to cut through living flesh. To cross this threshold would mean to experience all the horrors and consequences of an economic catastrophe. Perhaps there is only one item in which reductions are possible and feasible; it is expenditures for maintaining the immensely swollen government apparatus. This is not at all about resource savings which may turn out to be not all that significant in and of themselves. Something else is more important. According to the well-known Parkinson's law, the growing apparatus generates work for itself, complicates the decisionmaking procedure, boosts red tape and bureaucratic practices many times over, and spawns corruption (especially under our conditions). Cutbacks and streamlining in the government apparatus produce a tremendous economic effect by developing initiative and enterprise in all elements of the economy. There has been much talk about subsidies for agriculture, too, which "ruin the budget and merely spur on inflation." Indeed, it is well known that any reasonable idea may be perverted, and that in incapable hands all means are used to hinder rather than further the end. A contract system is the most reasonable and noninflationary--which is particularly important--way to support the rural areas and saturate the consumer market. It ensures the delivery of resources to federal and regional stocks on the basis of compliance with price parities, guarantees the recovery of appropriations for the acquisition of agricultural machinery, fuel, and mineral fertilizer, provides stable "rules of the game," and builds the confidence of the rural population in the government. It is easy to imagine what awaits us in the fall if such confidence is not restored. The peasants simply will not sell grain to the state. It will be impossible to put the squeeze on them by any hard or soft financing measures: On a self-sufficient farm, the peasant will feed himself with meat and milk, potatoes and vegetables. Meanwhile, there is no leeway associated with import purchases of grain and foodstuffs. A situation greatly reminiscent of the year 1927 may emerge. Investment Of course, we cannot count on a sharp increase in investment, given the tremendous decline in the gross domestic product (by about 40 percent of the precrisis level). Nonetheless, it is quite realistic to enliven investment activities very shortly and augment the influx of capital investment into the national economy. This may be done on a noninflationary basis. First of all, we should add selective (customized) support for priority spheres and production facilities to the quite stringent financial and credit policy. This is about concentrating the limited investment resources on pursuits in which they are capable of relieving social tensions and, most importantly, producing significant results quickly. The so-called multiplier effect works in this instance: Relatively small resources produce results that exceed the initial investment many times over. For example, resources are concentrated on housing construction (out of the funds of the population and enterprises, the federal and local budgets, and easy credit). This immediately boosts the demand for cement and bricks, products of wood processing, the output of glass and sheet iron. Their production expands (after all, the capacity is idle!), and the demand for the products of companion industries appears. To select appropriate priorities and concentrate resources for them--this is what the real state regulation of the economy and the conduct of an active structural policy are all about. This maneuver would be implemented within the framework of existing financial resources, without resorting to the additional emission of currency or increasing the burden on the budget. Perhaps the largest, stable, and, once again, noninflationary source of investment is associated with privatization (provided that we forget about its voucher mode as we would a nightmare). The Russian state, the components of the Federation, and municipal structures have quite expensive property. They would resolve to relinquish some of their property to others--at its real price. As a result of the effected operation, they would have the same resources, which we would call "capital," but in monetary rather than tangible form. They would be able to allocate these resources at their discretion for the construction of health-maintenance centers or maternity wards, schools or university laboratories, housing construction, and telephone installation in the settlement. Once again, it is important to stress that investment funds would be obtained on a noninflationary basis; they would not require emission or budget subsidies. Only a reasonable redistribution of resources would occur which would ensure the mutual reconciliation of the processes of privatization, structural changes, and a pickup in investment activities. The solution appears to be surprisingly simple and immediately evident--provided of course that we give up the extremely ideological desire to deprive the state of its economic might and influence (at any price). In this instance, it is very important to avoid the transient urge to blow away and send down the drain capital assets created by the labors of several generations. Creating conditions that make it possible to shift the interests of both the economic agents and the population from current expenditures to long-term investments also is one of key issues in creating a favorable investment climate in our country. In particular, this presupposes the protection of amortization allowances against possible depreciation, tax exemption for profits earmarked for investment, and the creation of specialized investment accounts and banks. It is quite important to divert a proportion of the monetary income of the population from current spending to savings, and not in the form of the increment of cash balances but in forms that make it possible to use savings for investment purposes. In this matter, restoration of confidence in the banking system is a key issue. This is not easy to achieve following the serious mistakes that were allowed to occur. However, it is extremely naive to count on success without the restoration of such confidence. Special-purpose savings for the construction of housing, certainly with reliable state guarantees, could be very promising. The need for housing is exceptionally high; meanwhile, the commissioning of residential buildings (in millions of square meters) dropped from 62.6 in 1985 and 61.7 in 1990 to 41.8 in 1993 (in 1992 it was 41.5 million square meters). Diverting the demand to housing could reduce pressure on the consumer market, reduce shortages in certain commodity groups, and thus become an important inflation-control factor. In a word, a number of serious proposals exist which make it possible, contrary to popular stereotypes, to combine inflation-control measures with support for production and stimuli for investment activities. Nonpayments The course of economic policy which was monetarist in nature and was lopsidedly geared toward restricting monetary demand in every way possible brought about a profound distortion of the entire system of financial relations. The liberalization of prices accompanied by the actual freezing of the working capital of enterprises deprived the latter of an opportunity to make timely payments for products purchased. No improvement in the system of settlements, which is important in its own right, can improve the situation. Therefore, profound and completely antimarket disproportions have developed in the economy both between the ratios of prices and the working capital of enterprises, and between capital benefits and the current stream of material and financial resources. The following data testify to this eloquently. The fixed assets of all sectors of the national economy and all forms of ownership came, after their reappraisal as of 1 July 1992, to 41.3 trillion rubles [R]. The gross domestic product (in current prices) came to R162.3 trillion in 1993. The national wealth which has been accumulated over decades ended up coming to one-quarter of the yearly product! However, this is not yet all. Prices for goods and services keep growing, whereas the price of fixed capital is strictly fixed and held under the strictest administrative control. Not one enterprise (whatever its form of ownership) is entitled to reappraise the cost of its fixed assets. This is regarded as an understatement of profits and tax evasion. The movement of goods and services, on one hand, and the movement of fixed capital, on the other hand, ended up severed. Enterprises are deprived of the opportunity to maintain even direct reproduction. These are the in-depth roots of the nonpayments crisis! To a considerable degree, nonpayments were also provoked by the direct actions of the government, more precisely, the Ministry of Finance. As of the end of 1993, the volume of past-due accounts receivable came to R18 trillion, of which the debt of the budget to the agrarian sector, enterprises of the defense complex, and establishments financed from the budget accounted for R7.8 trillion. At times, altogether paradoxical situations emerge: The Ministry of Finance does not pay for the products of the Southern Urals Gold Combine. Could it be that the ministry does not need them, or that there is no demand for them? Once again, we have to say that it is impossible to rectify the situation overnight. Painstaking efforts will be needed to restore the distorted financial system, eliminate existing disproportions, and fine-tune an effective settlement mechanism. Employment Finally, about the last point of the dilemma in question--the allegedly inevitable growth of unemployment as the price for reining in inflation. In this matter, the already mentioned arguments prevail without a serious generalization of world experience and an analysis of Russian reality. "Experts" usually refer to the Phillips curve. However, before moving on directly to the problems of employment, we would like to dwell on related and equally acute issues. An analysis by scientists from the RAN Institute of Economics indicates that the purely numerical data on the growth of unemployment conceal more profound and alarming trends. At issue are loss of occupational prestige, the mass disqualification of labor, and an abrupt decline in incentives to master knowledge and skills. The impact of such tendencies over any length of time poses the unavoidable threat of the destruction of not only the economic but also the labor potential of the country. Meanwhile, it is precisely the labor potential of the country that should, in the long run, become a guarantee of the real success of economic reform--an improvement in the standard and quality of living of Russian citizens. At present, discourse to the effect that if people want to work and know how, unemployment is not a threat to them sounds hypocritical. Appeals to ethics in the course of discussing the problems of unemployment are generally quite dubious. Under our conditions, they are just politically irresponsible. After all, presently the most gifted and talented workers, engineers, designers, and scientists, those who are just priceless, who not only know how but want to work, are left without jobs as a result of the cataclysmic crisis and the stoppage of enterprises. An economic model which is not in a position to use the richest labor potential, in a way the "gold reserve" of the nation, is flawed in its very foundation. It is a shame for the country and for ourselves. Let us move on to employment issues proper. The already described measures aimed at stimulating production and investment activities are capable of substantially boosting demand for labor, and then without using inflationary factors. We should add to this the potential of cooperatives and various forms of self-employment of the population, including the establishment of small enterprises at which the owner and the employee are frequently one and the same (a tailor, car repairman, manufacturer of craft products, and so on). As a rule, the creation of new jobs in this sphere does not require significant investment of any consequence. At the same time, an opportunity will appear to add considerable amounts of goods and services on the consumer market which is, in terms of its character, an inflation-controlling step. What is needed from the government and municipal organs? It is not additional money and subsidies but merely cooperation--the simplification of procedures for opening such enterprises, tax exemptions for them (if the newly formed cells of self-employment did not emerge, the unemployed would be paying no taxes!), the provision of vacant premises for them, and so on. The experience of organizing so-called "public works" which are well known in the practice of the world and have proven themselves in the implementation of anticrisis programs needs to be analyzed in particular. In summation, we would like to discuss opportunities for supporting low-income strata of the population without increasing the budget deficit or amplifying the inflationary spiral. As is known, in recent years the population has been markedly stratified in terms of income level. The incomes of the most affluent 10 percent exceeded the incomes of the least affluent 10 percent by a factor of 4.5 in 1991. In 1992 this ratio came to as much 7.5-8, and in 1993, as much as 11. When this ratio exceeds 10:1, a society enters a stage conducive to the development of acute social conflicts. So, if a progressive tax on the incomes of the most affluent is established at the rate of, say, 10 percent of their income (which would hardly be too burdensome), this will make it possible to increase the incomes of the least affluent by a factor of two! This will not require the printing of a single additional ruble. How to perform such an operation is an issue of political will and professional technique. At the same time, creating conditions for the people to be able to work and make money is the main way to fight poverty rather than increasing the number of wards of the state. This can only be done if socioeconomic policy is aimed at resuscitating production, at shaping a new type of economic behavior with the plank of self-support for individuals and families. Therefore, the dilemma in question does not stand up to criticism on any of its elements. The time has come to learn the lessons of the bitter experience of recent years, to change the strategic planks of economic policy, and to reject the stereotypes and dogmas that form its foundation.
