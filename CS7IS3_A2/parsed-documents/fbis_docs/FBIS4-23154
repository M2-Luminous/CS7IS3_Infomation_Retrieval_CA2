Several members are believed to have expressed serious dissatisfaction at Thursday's caucus meeting, saying that decisions were being taken without them being considered. ANC MP's have warned their leaders that in future the caucus has to be taken into account, especially when they negotiate behind the scenes with the two other parties in the government of national unity, the National Party [NP] and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]. One source of dissatisfaction this week is said to have been the election of Mr. Leon Wessels of the NP as deputy chairman of the constitutional assembly against the will of the caucus. And there was also considerable anger on Thursday stemming from the absence of President Mandela and several other leaders from the caucus meeting. They received the message clearly: In future they must attend caucus meetings. Deeper Cause The restlessness has a deeper cause. Many ANC MP's are deeply concerned that there could be a rift between members at ground level and the public representatives. If the leaders cannot even stay in touch with the caucus, it is being asked, how are the representatives going to keep in touch with the people out there? The fear is that the ordinary people will soon say the representatives are living in luxury and forget about them. Rumblings were heard this week from trade union circles concerning MP's salaries. In the parliamentary debate on the president's speech this week, ANC MP's have also expressed their concern regarding the situation. Gill Marcus has referred to the need for communication with the people out there. Mr. Raymond Suttner has asked the ministers to continue involving "the people" in running their departments and in taking important decisions. The people are not prepared to remain as spectators, he said. It is against this background, it has been said, that Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa has decided to refuse a cabinet post to concentrate on consolidating the party. It is also for this reason that the National Executive Committee of the ANC, under the leadership of Mr. Ramaphosa as secretary general, will play an equally important role -- if not a bigger one than the caucus -- in constructing ANC policy. It is also due to the concern over possible alienation between the representatives and the people at ground level that the ANC has decided to make the MP's and members of the provincial legislature responsible for every magisterial district in the country -- almost like in the days of the electoral constituencies. In this way the representatives are forced to maintain contact with the people. In fact, all parties are talking about the electoral system of the future. According to the current proportional electoral system, no provision is being made for constituencies. The advantage is that a party's support is accurately reflected by its number of representatives. Nobody is of the opinion that the system should be completely abandoned. But RAPPORT heard this week from all parties that in the five years before the next election, serious consideration will be given to a combined system in which a part of the MP's will be elected based on the proportional system and some will be elected according to the constituency system. In Germany, for instance, such a system is used. The problem is, however, that the system is complicated and could confuse illiterate voters.
