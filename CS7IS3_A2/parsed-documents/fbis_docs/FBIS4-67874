The Patriot is the only missile that has had actually been able to counterstrike other missiles. During a luncheon with Legislator Wang Tien-chin yesterday [13 April], Lt. General Chang Kuang-chin, deputy commander in chief of the Army, and other high-ranking Army officers briefed him in detail about the purchasing plan. The Army was quite impressed with Wang's recent rather professional questions on Patriot missiles. It was disclosed that, after extensive assessment, the Army is able to combat the problem of launching Patriot missiles even under circumstances that the Republic of China [ROC] lacks satellite navigation for missile launching. A high-ranking general also confirmed that the launching of Patriot missiles will not be affected by lack of satellite navigation. Army officers also learned from a study trip in the United States last July that the U.S. Army does not consider the Patriot outdated and will continue to improve the missile. Regarding how accurate the missile is in hitting a target, information provided by the Army shows that Patriot missiles can be 40 to 70 percent accurate in hitting a target. The information is based on various sources, including briefings at the U.S. Congress given by an assistant chief of staff of the U.S. tactical planning units. It was pointed out that Patriot missiles have been improved four times and the system the ROC Army will purchase is the latest. On the basis of the tactical capabilities it demonstrated in the Persian Gulf War, this model has gone through the U.S. Army's tactical tests and thus has a better launching control system.
