Song Jian, state councillor and minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, addressed the congress. On behalf of the State Council, he congratulated the academicians of the two academies for successfully accomplishing their missions. At the congress, prizes were presented to winners of the 1993 Chen Jiakeng Award. Song Jiang said: The Eighth Five-Year Plan will successfully be fulfilled next year. This year, we have begun drafting the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the development program up to 2010. China's scientific and technological circles are preparing to enter the 21st century with a new appearance and new stance. We should formulate our Ninth Five-Year Plan for scientific and technological development on the basis of democracy, inherit and develop the fighting spirit of the Chinese scientific and technological circles and the great achievements they have scored over the past nearly half a century, and continue to work hard to meet the development target for the next century. Song Jiang pointed out: We will continue to focus on the central task of economic construction, persist in reform and opening to the outside world, and more energetically implement the principle that economic construction must depend on science and technology and science and technology must be geared to economic construction. We must accomplish reform of the science and technology management system which has been undertaken for nine years, establish a science and technology management system and operation mechanism that meet the needs of a socialist market economy and conform to the law governing the development of science and technology, give full play to the role of science and technology as the primary productive force, and lay a solid foundation for building China into an economic, science, and technology power. This will be the basic task of the scientific and technological circles during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period. Discussing the principle of "holding fast to one end and leaving the whole field open" for scientific and technological work, Song Jian said: In the days to come, we shall maintain and strengthen a contingent of competent scientists and technicians who shall engage in basic research and undertake the missions of high-tech research and development and the task of tackling major scientific and technological research that has a bearing on the national economy, the people's lives, and national defense. He said in any case, whether to hold fast to one end or leave the whole field open, scientific and technological departments must constantly try to raise their capacity to compete in the areas of research, experimentation, and market development, and work hard to move closer to or reach the advanced world level. In conclusion, Song Jiang stressed: In the past four decades, China has made tremendous success in scientific and technological development, but the true upsurge has yet to come. During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, we should make preparations for the advent of the upsurge. We should train tens of thousands, or even millions, of young scientific and technological experts, further expand our contingents of scientists and technicians, strive to create conditions for their growth and their participation in the world scientific and technological arena, constantly heighten China's scientific and technological level, and make unremitting efforts to press on toward the forward position of science and technology. At the congress, CAS President Zhou Guangzhao presented prizes to the seven winners of the 1993 Chen Jiakeng Award. They were Professor Wu Wenjun, winner of the Mathematical Science Award; Professor Tang Aoqing, winner of the Chemistry Award; Professor Zhu Zhaoliang, winner of the Agricultural Science Award; Professor Shi Yuanchun, winner of the Agricultural Science Award; Professor Wu Mengchao, winner of the Pharmaceutial Science Award; Professor Huang Jiqing, winner of the Geoscience Award; and Professor Zheng Zhemin, winner of the Technological Science Award.
