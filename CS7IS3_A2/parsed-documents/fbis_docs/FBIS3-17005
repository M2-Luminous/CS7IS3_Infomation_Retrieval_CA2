Informed sources in the Russian gas company Gazprom told Interfax its management had sent an official telegram to Ukraine demanding that the latter honor its commitments under a Russian-Ukrainian March 10 protocol and a contract between Gazprom and the Ukrainian gas enterprise Ukrgazprom. In the protocol, Ukraine pledged to give Gazprom shares in its gas enterprises and pay by April 1 $100 Mn of the total debt of nearly $900 Mn. The Gazprom sources said Ukraine had still not made a list of enterprises where Gazprom would have interest or determined the size of the Russian company's shares in them. To date Ukraine has paid $59 Mn of the $100-Mn sum to be paid by the end of this month. According to some sources, Ukraine also continues siphoning off some of the Russian gas pipelined to Western Europe.
