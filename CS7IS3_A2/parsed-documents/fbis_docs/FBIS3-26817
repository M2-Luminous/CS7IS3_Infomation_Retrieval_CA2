Over the past year, Tibet's gross regional product reached 3.65 billion yuan, up 8.1 percent over last year and exceeding the average growth rates over the past 10 years. Financial incomes of localities totaled 149 million yuan, up 37 percent over last year. Opening up has helped steer vast farms and stock raising farms in Tibet toward the broad market. Peasants and herdsman of tens of thousands of households were organized by market forces. In the past, the state planned allocation and transfer of grains in southern Tibet to the northern part and cows and sheep in northern Tibet to the south. Now there are professional transporters, sellers, and agents who activate exchanges of agricultural and animal husbandry products between northern and southern Tibet. If we call the returning of livestock, land, and pasture to peasant households the first push to the farming and animal husbandry production in Tibet since the reform and opening up, then, the further commercialization of farming and animal husbandry products will provide a greater motive force to encourage farmers and herdsman to develop production. Last year is Tibet's sixth of consecutive harvests of farm produce. Compared to the previous year, livestock production also increased. Total agricultural output increased 5.3 percent over the previous year. Opening up has also brought opportunity and vitality to Tibet's industries. By conscientiously carrying out the "Regulations Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" and seriously changing operating mechanisms, enterprises in the entire region have fulfilled various economic targets and reduced their deficits. The transportation sector, a sector vital to Tibet's economy, had been enduring competition and challenges from all sides. Last year, the autonomous region decided to lift all restrictions on transportation enterprises in a bid to steer them into markets. Under this situation, not one of the 20-odd state-owned transportation enterprises under the Communications Department collapsed. On the contrary, they made up deficits and increased surpluses by a large margin. Even the Gerermu Transportation Corporation, the only enterprise that operated at a loss, eliminated losses by more than 200 million yuan. Opening up has brought a great number of businessmen into Tibet from the interior of the country, given an impetus to arousing local people's awareness of commodity, and helped Tibet's tertiary industry grow rapidly. Opening up has enabled Tibet, a place used to be backward in foreign trade, to transform itself into a front of China's foreign trade. Opening up has made tourism a pillar industry in Tibet, enabled more people to see Tibet's unique strong points in resources, and attracted many foreign businessmen. Although the investment environment was not very good, 27 foreign-funded enterprises were opened here last year and economic exchanges and cooperation with the interior were conducted more frequently. The very effective policy of importing from abroad and cooperating with units in the interior quickened the process of transforming Tibet's strong points in resources to economic ones. Opening up is exerting more and more influence over the consciousness and concepts of people in Tibet. They realize that no matter how unique Tibet is, they cannot only depend on long-term "blood transfusion" nor on maintaining planned or semiplanned economic structures to get rid of backwardness. They can only integrate Tibet's market into the vast nationwide market and double efforts to get rid of backwardness. Autonomous Regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu emphatically said: "In reform and opening up, Tibet must make efforts to develop in pace and forge a direct link with the nationwide market."
