For sure, the problem cannot be overlooked. It might be seen as a trifling report which many people can simply ignore. However, this issue can have an adverse impact on the not-so-good relations between Thailand and Malaysia, and cause the Islamic world to look at Thailand with suspicious eyes. The whole issue began when Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi revealed that the Islamic fanatic group, Al-Argam, was using Thailand as a training ground for its suicidal squads. Why must the Malaysian religious group have death squads? As everybody knows, there have always been strong conflicts in all Islamic nations over the administration of the countries. The fanatics call for the strict enforcement of the religious law as prescribed in the Quran, while the others want their countries to be ruled by a constitution and an internationally recognized legal system. This is the cause of the conflict in the Islamic states and Malaysia is no exception. Formerly, the Al-Argam group was included in the Malaysian Islamic Center under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office, the agency in charge of overseeing Islamic affairs. However, the Malaysian Government has banned Al-argam's operation since 1991, probably due to its rebellious nature. It is interesting to note that Al-argam was established 26 years ago, with suicidal squads comprising 315 members operating in 15 countries. The organization reportedly uses Thailand or Bangkok as training venue for its militiamen. Its leader is [Assha Ari Muhammad]. Up to this point, the Malaysian Government has probably been seeking cooperation from the Thai Government to put an end to Al-argam's terrorist training activities in Thailand. We recommend that the government pay more attention to this issue whether Al-argam really has its training center in Thailand or not. Malaysia is playing its internal political game beyond its boundary. Hence, Thailand is being dragged into the issue. The leader of Al-argam is in fact a politician. It is obvious that cooperation between Thailand and Malaysia is a major ingredient of peaceful coexistence on this golden peninsular. So far in many cases cooperation between the two countries has not been very impressive. This is a good opportunity for the two countries to make serious efforts to strengthen their bilateral cooperation in all fields.
