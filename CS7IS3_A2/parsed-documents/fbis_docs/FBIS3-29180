The sixth party congress set forth the renovation policy and created a turning point in socialist construction in our country. The seventh congress evaluated the results of five years of the renovation process for socioeconomic development platform and strategy. It also put forth the orientations and measures for conducting renovation in a far-reaching and uniform manner. The international situation has developed quickly and become complicated since the seventh congress. Socialist regimes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have collapsed. The independence and sovereignty of a number of countries have been challenged by policies based on power and imposition. Hostile forces are stepping up activities in a bid to undermine our people's national construction and defense. Once again, our revolutionary undertaking is facing harsh challenges. The international situation presents new opportunities, however. The strength and determination to struggle for national independence and sovereignty have been consolidated. The trends of cooperation and development have prevailed in the world community. Revolutionary forces have learned valuable lessons from temporary setbacks. The success of our renovation policy has further consolidated our people's strength and position, thus creating conditions for us to overcome difficulties and take advantage of good opportunities to serve national construction. Faced with new challenges and opportunities, our party and people have adopted a firm political stance. The resolutions of the party Central Committee's Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Plenums have concretized and further developed the line set forth by the seventh congress, resolving a series of practical problems on the domestic and diplomatic fronts based on actual international developments and situations. We have persisted in renovation, accelerated socioeconomic development, broadened the process of democratization, firmly maintained political stability, consolidated national defense and security capabilities, diversified our diplomacy, and gradually overcome the impact of a blockade and an embargo. The National Party Conference has the duty to assess implementation of the seventh party congress resolution and evaluate the actual results of renovation since the sixth congress. The objectives of this are to clarify further a number of issues relating to socialist construction in our country and define major policies and measures to implement the seventh party congress resolution successfully and lead the revolution in our country forward. PART ONE The Situation on Implementing the Seventh Party Congress Resolution. I. Achievements 1. The great achievement of primary importance is our success in overcoming the socioeconomic crisis to a very important extent. The crisis began in the late 1970's and early 1980's. It lasted for many years and became most serious during 1986-88, when inflation ran at a gallop. Another menacing challenge occurred in 1991. Thanks, however, to the great efforts of our party, state, and people, our economy not only held fast but recorded outstanding achievements and tided us over sluggishness and recession. Economic growth has remained very high and steady for the past three years. The inflation rate was cut from 67 percent in 1991 to 17.5 in 1992, and then to 5.2 in 1993. The GDP shows an average annual increase of 7.2 percent, compared with the target of 5.5 to 6 percent set for the five-year period from 1991 to 1995. Agricultural production has developed relatively comprehensively. The food grain issue has been resolved satisfactorily. Output of food grain in 1993 amounted to nearly 25 million tons, exceeding the target set for 1995. Industrial production is growing at an average annual rate of 13 percent, higher than the 8 to 10 percent target set in the five-year plan for 1991-95. Productivity in a number of important sectors and products -- electricity, crude oil, steel, and cement -- has increased. The communications and liaison system has expanded rapidly using new equipment and technology. Many sectors -- building, transport, trade, travel, and other services -- have developed. The economy is undergoing structural changes. A number of production and business sectors have emerged. Foreign economic relations have expanded, becoming more diversified and multilateral. We have overcome the unexpected drop in trade with our traditional market, broadened our exchanges with newer trade partners, and increased our annual export volume by nearly 20 percent. By the end of 1993, some 836 foreign investment projects had been licensed, with a registered capital of $7.5 billion. We have begun to attract more development aid and preferential capital loans from various governments, and have normalized relations with international financial and monetary institutions. The economy has achieved some initial capital accumulation. Although this is still small, a broad section of the population has seen their lives improve. A multisector economy is taking shape. State firms are beginning to be rearranged and re-registered. Those with long histories of operational losses have been reduced in large numbers, while the number of state firms with effective operations has increased. In general, the state economic sector is continuing to develop. It controls key activities and is playing an essential role in the economy. The sector's share of GDP increased from 34 percent in 1990 to 39.9 in 1992. Agricultural cooperatives have developed much clearer orientations for renovation since the party Central Committee's fifth plenum. The autonomy of peasant households has been affirmed. A number of new formats for economic cooperation have emerged. The Land Act officially gave peasants rights to long-term and stable use of land. This has helped the peasant household-based economy gain momentum. Individual economies and private capitalist economies have developed remarkably. Share-holding and partnership enterprises, which are attracting capital from various forms of ownership, have emerged in increasingly large numbers. The market system, under state management along socialist lines, is becoming a driving mechanism in the economy. The amendment of laws and continued renovation of various systems and policies on planning, pricing, exchange rates, finance, banking, labor, wages, and land have created a more favorable environment for various firms to develop dynamism, self-motivation, and a sense of responsibility in production and business. The state has accumulated more experience and made progress in the macromanagement of the economy. Parallel to economic development, resolution of various social issues and implementation of social welfare policies have been given more attention. Thanks to an increase in production and services, market prices have become relatively stable and the lives of people in various urban and rural areas have been improved. The number of rich households has increased while the number of needy households -- especially the number of underfed households -- has been reduced. Basic needs for food and clothing have been met in a more satisfactory way. Construction of houses, roads, electrical facilities, and health establishments has developed in various rural and urban areas. Democratic rights -- especially economic democracy -- have developed gradually. The people are free to work according to the law. They feel more secure about putting their money into production and business, and this has created more jobs. Various policies -- tackling employment, eliminating hunger and poverty, war invalids, families of fallen heroes, and people who have performed meritorious deeds for the revolution; providing assistance to disabled, helpless, and homeless people; and the policy of helping needy students return to school -- have been carried out satisfactorily. Educational activities have made some progress in fighting degradation, diversifying various educational formats, rearranging the school network, consolidating the system of specialized schools and selective classes, and building general education schools for ethnic minority students. The popularization of education has begun to develop satisfactorily. Vocational training and the study of foreign languages and computer technology have developed in various cities. Science and technology have started to develop as a driving force. Scientific and technological studies have been linked with social requirements. Many research and application projects -- especially in agriculture, fisheries, consumer goods, and export goods -- have developed practical value. They have helped increase economic results and improve technological knowledge. State-level scientific study programs have become more centralized, and for the first time include programs on social science and the humanities. Cultural activities have become more lively. Exchanges with foreign countries have expanded. Literary and artistic works have become more copious in content and theme, and more diversified in form, category, and means of expression. The information system has developed with the expansion of radio and television coverage to various districts throughout the country, including a number of mountain areas and distant offshore islands. Health care activities have shown great progress in various fields, such as preliminary care, expanded immunizations, and the control of epidemics and social diseases. The requirements for essential medicine have been partially met. Physical education and sports have achieved encouraging results. Population and family planning work has been carried out correctly, leading to an increase in voluntary registrations for the birth control program. 2. The second important achievement is the continuation of political maintenance and consolidation. Because of our success in many areas of renovation -- especially socioeconomic achievements, the party's skillful leadership, and political awareness of the country's people and soldiers -- we have survived the recent international political shock. The party's leadership role has been strengthened, the state's management efficiency has been heightened, democracy has been broadened, and national defense and security have been guaranteed. The people's confidence in the party, state, and renovation undertaking has increased and public movements for socioeconomic improvement have developed. After the seventh congress, our party -- especially the Central Committee, Political Bureau, and Secretariat -- accelerated party building, considering this to be of crucial importance to the entire revolutionary cause in our country and to our party. The third party plenum confirmed that economic development is the central duty and party building is the fundamental duty. It clarified conceptions on party building when the party is a ruling party, and defined principles for party organization and activities. It outlined the duties for consolidating the unity and unification of the entire party. It renovated and strengthened logical and ideological work and consolidated the party organization. After more than a year of party building, we have improved and heightened our knowledge and responsibility toward party committees and members. We have rearranged the party organization and reestablished cadre committees to oversee party committees and youth unions in state organs and mass organizations. The function and role of grassroots party organizations, together with their procedures and personnel management regulations, have been established. Party principles -- especially democratic centralism for the restoration of order and principles -- have been executed. Party management and work attitudes have been revamped in a more democratic, collective, and appropriate manner to ensure close and efficient party leadership and expand the positive role of state organs and mass organizations. We have concentrated more on training and admitting new party members. In 1992, admission of new members increased by 39 percent over 1991. In 1993, it increased by 30.7 percent over 1992. The party has continuously renovated its thinking and paid more attention to logical and ideological work. It has clarified conceptions and principles for guiding renovation and has gained more leadership experience. Party cadre have become more mature and active, and have gradually grown accustomed to leadership and management work in renovation. Our social democracy has made significant strides over the past two years, together with the construction of a law-governed state of, by, and for the people. Most prominent was the promulgation of the 1992 Constitution. That helped to institutionalize rapidly the party's line on national construction along socialist lines. Implementation of constitutional stipulations in politics, the economy, culture, education, industry, security and national defense, and the citizen's fundamental rights and obligations -- together with introducing many new legal documents and regulations -- have further accelerated democratization in our social activities. The fatherland fronts and mass organizations have diversified activities to broaden the national great unity, motivate the public to carry out its political duties, accelerate social activities, provide good care for the people, and protect their interests. Mass motivation has been given more attention by party committees at different levels. Coordination between state organs and the fatherland front and mass organizations has been strengthened more than ever in motivating the public to take part in law-building; planning national policy; formation of local authorities; and the policy implementation relating to socioeconomy, security, and national defense. The armed forces, together with the public, have made many efforts to accelerate renovation in national defense and security, and in developing their own strengths. They have executed their duty to protect the socialist fatherland; guarantee political stabilization; and safeguard national independence, sovereignty, and integrity satisfactorily. We have successfully implemented the great strategic adjustment in national defense, reduction in military personnel, and the strengthening of universal defense. We have built regional defense networks in provinces and cities, adjusted the strategy for national security, revamped our military activities in the new situation, gained better knowledge regarding the current situation, and become more efficient in fighting the activities of hostile forces. 3. The third achievement involves our diplomatic activities. Vietnam's relations with foreign countries have expanded and its prestige and position in the international arena has been enhanced. This creates a favorable international situation in which to build and defend the fatherland. The seventh congress asserted Vietnam's foreign policy of firmly maintaining peace, expanding relations of friendship and cooperation, creating favorable international conditions for national construction and defense, and positively contributing to the world people's common struggle for peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress. The congress stressed Vietnam's broad-minded foreign policy of befriending all countries in the world and struggling for peace, independence, and progress. The Central Committee's third plenum concretized and seriously implemented this policy against the background of new changes in the region and the world and following the seventh national party congress. We positively expanded diplomatic activities and recorded very significant achievements. We restored normal relations with the People's Republic of China and further developed friendship and cooperation with them. We strengthened and enhanced the special solidarity with the Lao People's Democratic Republic. We cosigned the Paris Accord on Cambodia. We struggled for its serious implementation, established friendly and neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia, and promoted and opened up a new stage of cooperation and friendship with ASEAN and its organizations. We also expanded relations with others in the Asia-Pacific Region and maintained and developed existing relations of cooperation with the Russian Federation, the states of the former Soviet Union, and East Europe. We preserved and developed our traditional relations with Cuba, India, and the DPRK; continued to support the legitimate causes of Palestinians, Asians, and South Africans; and expanded relations with developing countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. We positively contributed to consolidation and development of the Nonaligned Movement's role in the new situation, and also improved relations with Western and Northern European countries, the EC, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and a number of the newly industrialized. We restored normal relations with international financial and monetary organizations, and made progress in the struggle to lift the U.S. embargo and for normalizing relations with the United States. II. Shortcomings and New Problems 1. Our economy still depends on agriculture, which is still backward. Our industries are small, infrastructure is poorly developed, material-technical bases are very few, accumulation from the internal economy are minimal, and investment and development are not great enough. Productivity and economic results are low, although growth is acceptable. Our production capability, developing for mobilization in the days ahead, is not up to par. This will affect adversely economic growth in the years to come. Our capability to curb inflation is not consistent, while the budget deficit continues. Budget overdrafts are high and foreign debt payments, which are due, are too immense to be settled because our annual exports are still minimal. Meanwhile, many sectors, localities, units, and leading and managerial cadres are not firmly maintaining awareness in practicing thrift and diligence, thereby causing great losses to public property, while lavish spending is prevalent. It is necessary to say that our national and cooperative economies slowly have developed and strengthened. Our national economy has not satisfactorily assumed its active role in production and circulation. The state-run business sector has missed good chances to develop many important domains and areas, and this has allowed a group of private traders to exploit these opportunities and cause difficulties for both our producers and consumers. We have not completely overcome obstacles in the private economy. We have difficulties in production development and experience a lack of good management and guidance. Moreover, illegal trade is still prevalent. We realize that our economic mechanism is at a nascent stage with many spontaneously arising factors; our state management capability is still low and optimally cannot develop the strength of the market economic mechanism nor contain its many negative sides. Our legal system is not complete, while its implementation is not seriously carried out. Planning and activities for financial and banking sectors are still poor and are fraught with negative practices. The goods distribution system is irrational and it is carried out in an arbitrary fashion. The principle of distributing incomes in accordance with labor has not been strictly observed. 2. In the cultural and social domains, many great and urgent issues are still not resolved, although we have recorded some achievements in these domains. Unemployment, especially for youth of working age, is still the pressing issue and is one of the fundamental factors causing negative practices in our society. Social policy is not implemented justly. Many people legally amass wealth, but many others get rich quickly through illegal business activities. At the same time, many families who rendered meritorious service to the nation, sacrificed lives, and suffered great loss during the wars are still facing great hardship. The number of poor and starving people still accounts for a significant part of the population. The people's lives in many areas -- specially the highland, isolated, and ethnic-inhabited areas -- are still destitute. Education is inadequate in both quality and efficiency. Many issues relating to curriculum and training methods have not been defined to suit development requirements. Many schools are degrading seriously. Laboratory and scientific research equipment is scarce and outdated. Pedagogical schools and teachers provide poor training and education service, which is causing great public concern. Education management cadres at all levels hardly are given proper training. Individual education expenses are too high, which affects the education of children from poor families. Funding for scientific and technological research is higher than before, but still too low to meet the demand. It is only about 1 percent of the total state budget. Therefore, it must be thinly spread to different areas. The result of this level of funding is limited returns. Measures and regulations have not been introduced to encourage economic enterprises to invest in this field. Different scientific groups have not been formed. The organic relationship among scientific research establishments, training institutions, and production units has not been established. The import of foreign technologies has been poorly managed and has led to the import of outdated technologies and equipment at high prices. This causes long-term negative effects for the nation. The situation relating to culture and arts is causing great concern. Running after money, unhealthy interests, bad habits, and superstitions is on the increase. Poisonous and dangerous cultural products are readily available in the market. Incorrect tendencies -- such as the rejection of our revolution's achievements and our revolutionary culture and arts, the detachment of arts from the party's political line, the tendency to commercialize the arts, and the spread of bad foreign-influenced arts and debauched lifestyles -- are appearing in creative, logical, and critical works. These mistakes and incorrect conceptions were mentioned by the fourth plenum of the seventh party Central Committee, but they are slowly being rectified. Guidance by party organs and the state management over the cultural and arts work is weak. Our public health service is not meeting minimum requirements of society. Grassroots health care is weak. Hospitals are ill-equipped and provide low standards of service and care. The increase in population is still higher than 2.2 percent. This obstructs socioeconomic development and improvements to life, and affects the development of our race. Despite many efforts to contain them, social vices are tending to increase -- especially drug addiction, gambling, prostitution, and robbery. Corruption and smuggling are prevalent, raising public indignation, and greatly affecting the people's confidence in the party and state. 3. The political situation is stable, but many complicated factors which must not be overlooked still exist. Many party and state organs have not been clean and strong. Political security is not really firm. Social order and safety are not safeguarded. The renovation line on party building has not been satisfactorily implemented. The party mechanism is heavy and bulky and its management and work attitudes slowly are being renovated. Leadership quality and performance of many party committees are still low. They are even sidestepping the party line in some places. Cadre-related work is a weak link. Cadres, generally speaking, are not up to duties or requirements. In many places, difficulties and embarrassment are experienced when able cadres are needed for appointment to key leading positions. There are not enough qualified cadres and leading specialists to take care of party work, state management, production and business, external economic relations, religion, ethnic communities, and women-related work. Planning, training, fostering, and assigment of cadres are not performed well. Party committees are not giving proper attention to checking the observation of party regulations, lines, and policies. The reform of the state mechanism is slow and lacks efficiency. Evil practices of authoritarianism, oppression, vindictiveness, bureaucracy, and indiscipline are prevalent in many places. The fatherland fronts and mass organizations are still facing difficulties in work and methods. The number of cadres working in mass organizations is not stable. They lack enthusiasm are not given appropriate care, training, and benefits. Confusion and lack of vigilance are still prevalent among party cadres and people. They still have a low level of awareness regarding sabotage plots and activities by hostile forces, who always wish to scrap our party and socialism. Some party cadres remain unconcerned in the face of wrong viewpoints or activities aimed at stirring up social disorder. Others have deviated seriously from the socialist path, or are even inclined to choose another. Ideological and theoretical work is still slow, not sharp enough, lacks militancy, and is not able to respond convincingly to newly emerging issues. Many party cadres, including core leaders, are still sluggish in self-education. They do not try to improve their character and understanding. Disunity among cadres at some party organizations is also very serious. III. Generalizations Despite shortcomings we need to overcome, our past important achievements are creating favorable conditions for the country to advance gradually to a new development stage -- the stage of industrialization and modernization. These conditions consist of many elements of stature and trend, material and spiritual, economic, political, social and cultural, and domestic and foreign. The reality of past years allows us to assert that the lines and main policies of our party on renovation were correct and the steps taken appropriate. The resolutions of the sixth and seventh party congresses are being absorbed into the life of our people. Reviewing the reality of renovation brings up many useful lessons. It is necessary to determine that the first experiences learned through the renovation process and pointed out by the seventh party congress need to be developed and applied to our current reality. Those were the lessons of maintaining firmly the socialist path during renovation, combining the determination of revolutionary principles and strategies with flexibility in policies and sensibility to the changes. There were also the lessons of the necessity to renovate comprehensively and harmoniously, and to apply appropriate steps, contents, and methodologies. Other lessons learned were to safeguard firmly the party leadership role and the state management in developing a multisector merchandise economy and socialist democracy as well as the need for the timely exposure and handling of problems, which arise during renovation. We also need to pay appropriate attention to the task of reviewing reality and continuously completing and perfecting theories to build the socialist path. Renovation is a difficult process, and one which is unprecedented, but we have been bravely searching and learning, and achieving important progress. The most basic, decisive factor was the determination of our party to retain its leadership position; to reject pluralism and a multiparty system; to honor the spirit of independence, self-determination, and innovation; and to follow correct lines and policies, which are in good accordance with the rules and reality of Vietnam. Our party has also been able to develop the total strength of the great all-people solidarity block and expand international cooperation. The seventh party congress outlined six characteristics for the socialist society our people are building. The congress also pointed out seven basic directions to make these characteristics a reality. This is the socialist direction that the conferences of the seventh Central Committee materialized into practical directives. The building of socialism, however, is still new to us. It requires from us massive energy to research, study, and discover. We will be able to figure out more clearly the socialist path for our country by continuously reviewing our work and studying ideological theory. We will also be able to figure out the concrete model for each domain of the economic, political, and social and cultural fields. We have to encourage innovation and development of Marxism-Leninism-Ho Chi Minh Thought, especially Leninist thoughts, on a new economic policy and the state-managed capitalism. This will help invent new forms of transition and diversified intermediary steps suitable for our concrete historical circumstances and which will help our country advance firmly on the socialist path. PART TWO Essential tasks to be carried out in the period ahead. Lying ahead of our people are major challenges and opportunities. These are: -- The danger of being further left behind economically, compared with many countries in the region and the world, because we started from the lowest point and our growth rate is not high and steady enough; we have also had to struggle upward in a fiercely competitive environment. -- The danger of straying from socialism if we fail to abide by the implementation guidelines. -- The scourge of corruption and other social ills. -- The peaceful evolution-related schemes and actions of hostile forces. Yet, we also enjoy many fundamental advantages: -- Our party has a correct policy line and is united and single-minded. -- Our people are diligent, intelligent, and patriotic. They have good abilities and firm revolutionary willpower and believe in the party leadership. -- Our armed forces are absolutely loyal to the revolutionary cause of our party and people. -- The successes obtained in renovation are creating our new posture and strengths. -- The development of the scientific and technological revolution and the trend toward broadening global and regional ties of cooperation and development have brought us opportunities for obtaining more important resources. The general targets set forth by the Seventh Party Congress up to 1995 will be to overcome difficulties and ordeals, stabilize and develop socioeconomic activities, strengthen political stability, dispel negativism and social injustices, and basically tiding the country over the current crisis. Over the past two and a half years, we have achieved a significant part of that target, especially the economic ones. For the remaining years of our office, we must motivate the entire party, people, and army to be of the same heart and mind; to exert extraordinary efforts; to uphold a sense of independence, sovereignty, and self reliance; to broaden international relations; to practice the motto of industry, thrift, integrity and righteousness; to strive to exploit our advantages; to dispel dangers; to overcome ordeals; and to successfully achieve the general targets cited above. We must quicken our pace to achieve the various aims of the strategy for socioeconomic stability and development to the year 2000 to build a powerful country, a prosperous people, and an equal and civilized society. The following are essential: 1. To press for changes in the economic structure toward industrialization and modernization. Socioeconomic improvements, together with the expansion and strengthening of development cooperation with various countries and international organizations, have allowed us to press ahead with our national industrialization and modernization to create more jobs, speed up economic growth, and further renovate the people's material and spiritual life. This is a central task of foremost importance for the period ahead. Industrialization and modernization are the ways to avoid the danger of being further left behind compared with nearby countries; to maintain political and social stability; and to protect independence and sovereignty as well as the course of socialist development. At present, we have not followed the old pattern of industrialization. We will not repeat the mistakes, hastiness, and subjectiveness that the Sixth Party Congress has criticized. Industrialization is in fact to build the material-technical bases of socialism. This is not a simple question of increasing the pace and proportion of industrial production in the economy. Rather, it is a process of structural change linked with radical technological renovation to build a foundation for rapid growth and high and long-lasting efficiency for the entire economy. Industrialization must be accompanied by modernization and this requires the combination of gradual steps of industrial development with efforts to seize opportunities to shorten our process and to form spearheads of development to catch up with scientific and technological progress in the world. The orientation, scale, and steps of industrialization and modernization must be carefully thought out through a complete understanding of the following important points: -- The firm maintenance of independence and sovereignty must go along with the broadening of international cooperation, building an open-door economy both at home and abroad, multilateral and diverse relations with other countries, combining economic activities with national defense and security, and linking economic growth with social progress and social justice, and with cultural development and environmental protection. -- Persisting on the strategy of directing vigorous efforts at exports while replacing imports that can be produced locally. -- Developing the comparative advantages of the entire country as well as each area, sector, and domain in a given period. -- Constantly improving competitiveness in local, regional, and international markets. -- Taking socioeconomic results as a fundamental standard for determining the course of development and for selecting investment and technological projects. -- Rapidly exploiting the strengths of the entire country, of each region, and sector; appropriately gathering resources for various fields of activity and key areas to promptly produce high results while paying attention to meeting essential requirements; working out practical policies, systems, and measures for localities which have difficulties; stepping up development cooperation; and ensuring that various regions and strata of people can benefit from economic growth. -- Attention must be paid to small- and medium-size projects requiring small capital investments and capital that can be recovered quickly in accordance with the motto of using short-term projects to finance long-term ones. -- Building a number of necessary, large-scale projects. -- Making intensive capital investments to exploit to the fullest our productivity and our existing technologies with an emphasis on projects that affect product competitiveness. -- Combining traditional technologies with modern technologies, ensuring the advanced nature of imported equipment and technologies, giving priority to technologies that need small capital but which directly or indirectly create more jobs. -- Until the end of this decade, great attention must be paid to agricultural industrialization and to the rural economy. We must carry out comprehensive agricultural, forestry, and fishery development in conjunction with efforts to develop processing industries for agricultural, forestry, and marine products and for consumer goods manufacturing and exports. -- Expanding trade, travel, and services in both urban and rural areas and stepping up other overseas economic activities. -- Renovating, expanding, upgrading, and selectively building infrastructure facilities in the most difficult areas where development is being hindered. -- Selectively building heavy industry establishments in important sectors where there are pressing requirements and in which we have the capital, technologies, and marketplace to achieve rapid development and high results. -- Developing scientific and technological studies and application, education and training, public health, and environmental protection to meet immediate and long-term development requirements. While exploiting comparative advantages such as cheap labor, resources, and a convenient location, we must study and read regional and world development trends, the strategies and policies of trading partners and rivals, and attempt to discover new opportunities and comparative advantages. We must foster and develop to the fullest our most decisive resource, namely, the Vietnamese population, for long-term development and to prepare the necessary conditions for development along this course. To carry out industrialization and modernization, we must mobilize various sources of capital in conjunction with effective efforts to manage our capital, with the domestic source of capital being regarded as crucial and the foreign source as important. To ensure an average annual growth rate of not less than eight percent, we must promptly increase the total amount of investment to over 20 percent of the GDP within the next few years. This must be higher in the ensuing years along with efforts to improve efficiency of capital management. This requires great efforts and appropriate policies to encourage the entire society to practice thrift in production and consumption and to concentrate on investing in production, especially in material production. Concentrated investment earmarked from the state budget is decisive for the growth of the entire economy. It is necessary to increase the sources of investment capital in targeted projects by allocating a greater part of the GDP to the state budget and by attracting all sources of aid and low interest loans from various governments and international financial and monetary organizations. We must audit, inspect, closely manage, distribute and effectively use public assets, and must guard against losses and wasteful spending. The state's capital investment is designed mainly for building the socioeconomic infrastructure and a number of key, spearhead industrial establishments, and processing industries for agricultural, forestry, and marine products, for the manufacture of export goods, and to cater to export services. Part of this must also be reserved for financing employment projects and projects to reforest wastelands and bare hills and expand aquaculture and deep sea fishing activities. The state will only allocate capital to socioeconomic infrastructure projects and to areas where capital is not likely to be recovered. Credit loans invested by the government must be returned by users. We must renovate the managerial mechanism for capital construction to prevent negativism, waste, and misappropriation of state-owed capital, especially in project planning, construction price estimates, and the assessment of work performance. In this area, highly credible local and foreign companies must be used to verify the quality and price of imported equipment and materials and audit construction projects. Every project must have a concrete owner. If it is a project where capital must be recovered, it must be fully recovered by the state on schedule. We must fully exploit the savings and investment potential of the public as well as businesses in different economic sectors. This must be done in different forms to ensure that all potentialities are mobilized and that every cent invested yields profit. We must gradually increase the proportion of this source of capital within society's total capital investment. In order to broaden the scope and improve the efficiency of investment, we must supplement and perfect the necessary macroeconomic policies. First of all: -- We must stabilize the macroeconomic environment, consistently implement the policy on the multisectorial economy, protect all forms of legal possession and business freedom, and introduce an internal investment law and other necessary laws and regulations to encourage and support efforts to develop investment. -- We must renew the national finance policy, satisfactorily resolve the relationship between state finance and private finance, and correctly balance the demand for increasing budget revenues with the demand for self-investment by each business sector and residential region to guarantee profits for investors and create momentum for broadening business and production. -- We must form and develop capital markets that consist mainly of investment banks, commercial banks, finance and insurance companies. We must continue to reform the banking system according to the principles of the market mechanism and international practice in order to mobilize sufficient capital, provide credit efficiently, and meet the high demand for development in the national economy. We must develop joint stock companies; gradually broaden the issuance and circulation of shares, credit notes, and bonds; and create conditions for a stock market. -- We must supplement and amend structures and policies to observe strict regulations concerning the practice of frugality in developing investment in all activities of the party, government, Army, public security force, mass organizations, business, and people. -- We must create favorable conditions to attract additional foreign capital and technology while simultaneously exploiting internal resources. We must widely apply policies to attract more foreign investment and set up regulations to define responsibilities in obtaining and repaying foreign loans, ensuring their proper use, and avoiding financial overcommitment. We must start planning for different regions, beginning with key areas, processing zones, special economic zones, and industrial areas. We must outline investment projects and set priorities for projects that need foreign investment. We must ensure the scientific soundness of the deployment of important projects, avoiding mistakes that might cause long-term effects. And we must continue to improve the investment environment, including laws, regulations, and working and living conditions for foreign investors. Encouragement of direct foreign investment must be part of a uniform development strategy and management structure to ensure state authority, control, and guidance over the socioeconomic development process. State management structures must be established over projects with foreign investment and those completed and in operation. Together with increasing of investment in different forms, we must increase our capital contributions toward joint ventures with foreign countries. The science and technology sector must concentrate its research on quickly applying new findings to production and business in order to serve industrialization and modernization. It must meet the demands of new equipment in the national economy, improve existing technologies, modernize traditional technologies, and correctly adapt new ones. It must also help to manage and closely assess imported technologies and pay attention to the development of electronics, informatics, biology, and new materials. Through practical renovation, it must get close to real life, quickly discover and improve upon the public's inventions, accelerate its studies, and clarify issues relating to the strategy for industrialization and modernization. 2. We must strive to implement the policy on developing the multisectoral economy consistently and give various economic components and business establishments more headway to develop quickly and attain strong results. Efforts must be made to strengthen and improve state-run establishments to help them work effectively be active in the economy. This is very important and urgent because it will help encourage and support other economic sectors in their development while accelerating rapid and long- lasting growth. It is an apparatus with material strength that will help the state regulate and lead the market economy to develop further in accordance with the socialist orientation. It is necessary for us to be able to distinguish the nature of state ownership from that of state-run businesses. We must realize that state assets and capital are used in various forms to ensure strong socioeconomic results and enhance the state's ability to accelerate and control economic activities. Investment in state-run businesses should include those set up with a 100-percent state capital and those with the majority of shares held by the state, so as to allow the state to control them effectively. Efforts must be made to allocate land and forest areas to the people on a long-term basis, to give leases or provide concessions for exploiting mines, to enter into joint ventures, and to buy shares from enterprises in other sectors. We must integrate efforts to strengthen state-run businesses in various sectors, areas, and socioeconomic infrastructure projects; in the financial, banking, and insurance establishments; and in a number of key production and service units so as to help the economy develop strongly. It is necessary to encourage other economic components to participate in different forms and degrees. In carrying out these tasks, we can reduce the number of inessential state-run businesses while consolidating, expanding, and building new and essential state-run enterprises. We must strive to strengthen and develop state-run businesses in agriculture, forestry, and fishery to cooperate with other business branches to build industrial and service centers, especially for the processing industry; scientific-technological centers; and cultural and social centers in localities throughout the country. We must strive to strengthen and improve the state-run trade system; to control firmly the export-import business and the trading of essential materials; to regulate wholesale and retail trade; and, together with other sectors, to stabilize and develop local markets. Efforts must be made to ensure smooth transportation of goods, to serve and accelerate production development, to protect the interests of producers and consumers, and to make fundamental changes in organization and management of state-run businesses to ensure autonomous operation of businesses in the market economy while ensuring effective state control. Fundamental factors leading to ineffective operations, negative practices, and waste at many state-run business establishments are caused by our not having certain people who act as direct owners of state assets and who take responsibility for and protect the interests of state properties. We have no attractive and firm motives to encourage personnel at state-run enterprises to devote their energies to the development of their establishments. We still lack the material and organizational strength to define decisively various methods to curb corruption and acts that inflict losses on public properties. We must find ways to overcome these shortcomings. To attract more capital, create a driving force to curb negativism, and accelerate the profitability of state-run businesses, we must introduce various forms of shareholding enterprises in line with our production and business system and with the majority of shares held by the state. Step by step, we must apply the method of selling shares to enterprise personnel. Efforts must be made to distribute profits to personnel based on their base salary and their number of shares. We should conduct a pilot project to sell a number of shares in state-run businesses to private organizations and individuals. On introducing a shareholding enterprise system, we will stipulate the organization of management boards comprising representatives of state shareholders, worker shareholders, and other shareholders. Regulations and selection criteria to help management boards select managing directors should be set up. Various forms of work contracts with workers should be applied in a widespread manner and be perfected continuously within state enterprises. The state will support and encourage -- in accordance with the development needs of the economy -- implementation and renovation of enterprise unions and general corporations into the organization of business conglomerates, thus avoiding intermediary authorities. The system of managing ministries, managing authorities, and distinctions between centrally- and locally-managed enterprises will be gradually discarded. State authorities at all levels and sectors should take care of and assist state enterprises in their businesses, especially in matters relating to capital, technology, marketing, and cadre training and deployment. For enterprises that serve the public's socioeconomic benefit but suffer low incomes or losses, the state will have a reasonable relief policy that discourages reliability. The state will have clear regulations on the state's inspection authority and stop as hoc inspection and control work, which is inconvenient to businesses. For state enterprises that do business in inessential areas, suffer extended losses, and lack the capacity to overcome these losses, the resolute measures pointed out at the second plenum of the seventh Central Committee should be applied. We will continue to renovate the economic establishment of cooperatives and develop the independent role of cooperative members. The state supports, assists, and guides the development of all cooperative economic establishments in various economic sectors on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis. Management of cooperatives should be democratic and should encourage combining the strength of the cooperative with the strength of each household member. The renovation of cooperatives and other cooperative economic establishments should be carried out in all sectors of agriculture, forestry, and fishery in accordance with the resolutions of the seventh Central Committee's fifth plenum. Strict measures will be applied in handling the sluggish cooperatives. Experimental renovation should continue in all forms of cooperative economic establishments in handicrafts, financial credit, trading, and services. Cooperatives can function on a larger scale, can perform various types of business, and are not restricted within any administrative boundaries. Besides the capital contributed by members and the assets of the cooperatives, capital and labor from outsiders should be motivated. Members of cooperatives receive incomes that are subject to contributed labor and shares. Cooperatives can exercise any of the various levels of collectivity of production supplies in accordance with the business necessity, aspirations, and benefit of the members. The individual and small business economic sector -- which comprises mostly family business establishments -- is speedily growing and possesses tremendous potential to become an important element of the economy. We must have a policy to help this sector in terms of capital, technology, market information, and so forth in order to help their businesses become effective, thus creating more employment and more opportunities for individuals to contribute to national construction. We must also guide and encourage individual business establishments to join cooperative economic establishments gradually and on a voluntary basis. The private capital economic sector, both overseas and domestic, is growing fast and making positive contributions to national construction. The state continues to encourage private capital economic activities in those sectors and areas allowed by law. The state also protects the legal rights and benefits of private businessmen, joins development and investment funds with these businessmen on a consensus basis, and encourages them to sell prioritized shares to their workers. The state helps and guides them to overcome difficulties and do business according to state laws and regulations. Concrete regulations will be promulgated to stipulate the state's management role toward business establishments with capital invested directly by outsiders. In combination with the state's inspection and control functions, we need to develop grassroots organizations in the party, trade unions, and politico-social mass organizations within the private business enterprises and joint business enterprises, either domestically or with overseas partners. These grassroots organizations will contribute to productivity, protect the legal benefits of workers, and prevent illegal deeds. We should create conditions and a legal environment for lawful competition activities and for developing collective businesses on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis, regardless of the disparity between these businesses in a sector or locality. Using the major state enterprises as the bases, we will form business corporations with a significant ability to compete in the domestic as well as the international market. 3. We must build a uniform market mechanism under state management and in accordance with socialist orientations. Continued efforts must be made to build a new economic structure, bearing in mind the need to persist in the transition to the market mechanism while at the same time increasing the efficiency of state management. Steps must be taken to perfect apparatuses and policies to create the necessary conditions for the market mechanism to operate effectively. It is necessary to guarantee the right of autonomy of businessmen. Prices should be set mainly by the market. Market indicators are very important factors for allocating resources to production and business establishments. It is important to adopt incentive measures to encourage everyone to compete in a legitimate and wholesome manner. Steps must be taken to limit monopoly. Business people have the right to earn profits in a legitimate way. The state only sets the prices of a small number of goods and services bearing a particularly important socioeconomic significance or having a highly exclusive nature. In any case, prices must all be set within the limits of the market mechanism. It is necessary to stabilize transportation costs and the prices of electricity, water, fuel, and oil. Steps must be taken to eliminate the system of providing subsidies for losses. It is important to regulate income distribution in a rational way and create conditions for expanding production facilities and for reducing waste of resources. It is necessary to abide by the principle of positive [laix duwowng] interests, closely monitor the rate of inflation, and create favorable conditions for both savings and loans. It is important to regulate currency exchange rates in a satisfactory manner, bearing in mind the need to see to it that the actual rates remain relatively stable but not rigid and henceforth, help promote exports and control imports. Plans must be worked out to determine fees and wages in a rational manner. It is necessary to formulate a selective subsidy policy for agricultural and export products. Appropriate measures must be taken to protect local products and the interests of both producers and consumers. Uniform steps must be taken to form various types of markets, products, services, labor resources, capital, technology, real estate, and so forth. It is necessary to step up state macromanagement to direct and guide the overall performance of the national economy. Efforts must be made to create an economic environment and legal boundaries for production and business activities. Measures must be taken to develop positive factors, prevent or contain the adverse impact of spontaneous or negative actions, and overcome the inherent shortcomings of the market mechanism. Henceforth, these will cause the latter to become a really important instrument for distributing and making better use of all sources of strength as well as for distributing or redistributing the national income to guarantee equilibrium between revenue and spending, regulating the interests of the various economic sectors and people of all walks of life, meeting the growing demands of development, and ensuring social justice. The state macromanagement system must cover all areas of the national economy and economic sectors instead of the state business sector only. It is necessary to strengthen the concentration and uniformity of government agencies when it comes to exercising macroeconomic management. At the same, it is necessary to increase the responsibilities and power of sectors and localities in case they can work out better solutions to the various problems involved. It is necessary to guarantee the right to autonomy of business establishments. Special ministerial agencies should devote efforts to carry out their functions as development project planners for economic and technological sectors under their charge satisfactorily. They should also provide direction, assistance, and supervision for operations of business establishments belonging to different economic sectors and in different areas of activity as specified under their state management functions. It is important to strengthen the role of interministerial agencies in overseeing the overall performance of all sectors and areas of operations, thus putting all socioeconomic activities under the state's effective macromanagement system. Administrative organs at all levels should perform their state management functions in areas under their charge by overseeing the operations of business establishments belonging to different economic sectors, bearing in mind the need not to distinguish between central and local economic organizations. Steps must be taken to perfect the legal system to ensure strict observance of rules and regulations. Efforts must be made to consolidate and strengthen the advisory role of planning agencies so the latter can formulate good plans and projects to serve development goals, calculate and maintain a balanced macromanagement system, adjust investment structures, effect economic restructuring, and serve as a venue for coordinating efforts to tap all sources of strength at home and abroad and make effective use of them to realize socioeconomic development goals. We must continue to reform the financial and monetary system fundamentally and comprehensively, while satisfactorily promoting economic activities to increase investment and development. We must strive to ensure uniform management of the national financial system, savings, and expenditure; and improve the financial work of the state, enterprises, and population. Efforts should be made to improve budget management at the central and local levels to ensure sufficient allotments for normal expenditure, investment development, and national defense. We must mobilize capital at home and abroad, strive to meet immediate requirements, practice thrift, and promote investment development for long-term interest. We must encourage state-run enterprises to carry out autonomous financial management under the close supervision and control of the state. We must strive to keep the budget deficit at less than 5 percent of GDP, make great efforts to increase state revenue to pay for expenditures, refrain from issuing banknotes to resolve the budget deficit, and strive to balance income and expenditures. Efforts must be made to reform the accounting system and improve auditing in the state and private sectors. The central state bank must formulate and implement the monetary policy to ensure the effective allotment, transfer, and remittance of money; curb inflation; coordinate with financial, trade, and price agencies to maintain an average annual price increase in the single digits only; and strive to balance international debt while increasing foreign currency reserves. The financial and banking sectors must satisfactorily carry out their functions of establishing funds, effectively use and provide credits, and strive to meet the requirements of economic development. This is to maintain their role as a center for the settlement and circulation of money within society. They must strive to improve the foreign currency management mechanism to create conditions for the Vietnamese dong to be effectively circulated and become the sole currency for the settlement of debt nationwide. 4. Measures to resolve cultural and social issues. Our party and state's guiding thought in carrying out cultural and social work is to care for, foster, and develop the human factor to create a driving force for revolutionary objectives. Efforts must be made to resolve various current issues and ensure social justice, enhance the people's intellect, promote a healthy atmosphere in society, and protect and develop our national cultural traits. In order to create sufficient jobs for workers in an effective way, the state and people must save money for investment development while satisfactorily implementing the socioeconomic strategy. They must encourage all economic components, citizens, and investors at home and abroad to expand branches and occupations to create more jobs for the laborers and reduce the number of unemployed workers, expand foreign trade, and promote the export of laborers. Efforts must be made to organize vocational training for youths to enhance their professional skills. For personnel and workers laid off by administrative agencies and economic units, we must reorganize them and provide vocational training as well as loans to help them become involved in production and business or find other jobs, while striving to set up consultative agencies to introduce new jobs. We must formulate laws to protect the legitimate interests of both employees and employers at private capitalist business establishments. The laws on labor, wages, insurance, and taxes have been and will be promulgated in accordance with investment promotion, the elimination of social injustice, and opposition to illegal businesses. The statutes, regulations, and discipline for workers formulated by business establishments must not violate state laws. It is necessary to say that the economic growth rate should be parallel to social progress and justice at each stage of development. Social justice should cover areas such as the distribution of the means of production, income in accordance with results in production, and equal opportunity for each member of the production force to develop his ability. We must implement the principle of distributing more income to those who work and contribute more and vice versa, while striving to oppose mediocrity and dependence on others. We must ensure that income is distributed in accordance with labor. We must encourage and treat competent and capable workers appropriately, and ensure a fair income for investment projects, especially in production and business. We should encourage the people to amass wealth through honest means, while fighting poverty and hunger; motivate the rich to participate in economic development; formulate rational policies to promote credit, taxation, and vocational training in order to create conditions for the poor to be able to progress and earn enough to become rich. Various former wealthy areas should, together with the state, assist poor and underdeveloped areas. We must mobilize rich people to contribute to helping the poor by providing loans, equipment, and materials and transferring experience and work methods. We should set up funds to repay those who have rendered meritorious service to the state; formulate appropriate policies for the rich; and mobilize business enterprises and private organizations to participate in humanitarian and charitable activities to help the victims of war and natural calamities, as well as the disabled, the elderly, and the homeless who can no longer work. The responsibility of each citizen in solving individual and family problems should be heightened. At the same time, the common sharing of responsibilities in society in general should be intensified to develop our people's humanitarian tradition. The goals and measures set forth in the resolution of the seventh party Central Committee's fourth plenum regarding education and training, culture, the arts, public health care, and population and family planning work must be continued, so that in a few years significant achievements can be recorded in our education service, thereby helping the education service fulfill its role in upgrading the people's mental abilities, creating the people's labor force, and improving the people's skills. First, compulsory elementary education must be implemented. If possible, universal secondary education should be introduced in some localities. Policies to exempt and reduce school fees and provide suitable financial assistance must be applied to guarantee the education of children from poor families, especially those living in isolated, high altitude, and former revolutionary base areas. Existing ethnic boarding schools must be consolidated and additional ones must be built. We must reorganize the vocational training system, upgrade the service provided by teachers' colleges, and rearrange the tertiary education system by linking academic training with vocational skills, study with practice, and training and research with production. National university centers must be built with improved goals, curricula, and education methods to meet national development requirements. Planning for fostering and retraining the contingent of teachers must be established, policies to grant appropriate rewards to teachers must be introduced, and state management of the education and training service must be strengthened. Steps must be taken to build a modern culture, but one that is imbued with national traits. Educational activities must be organized to make everyone aware of the need to adopt a morally correct lifestyle and culturally appropriate behavior. Efforts to develop national culture must be linked with endeavors to promote cultural exchanges with foreign countries, bearing in mind the need to preserve and develop national traits while simultaneously learning from the cultural quintessence of other countries. Resolute measures must be taken against all acts of violence and miscellaneous cultural practices that are immoral or culturally unfit and contrary to human nature. Along with inheriting and carrying on the traditions of human compassion, mutual love and assistance, and other fine customs, efforts must be made to eliminate outdated practices, superstitions, and other social vices. Steps must be taken to improve the quality of and guarantee democracy and freedom for cultural and artistic activities. At the same time, it is necessary to uphold the sense of responsibility of writers and artists toward the nation and people. Plans must be worked out to cultivate talent and encourage writers and artists to produce wholesome works with a high ideological and artistic value. Efforts must be made to turn out fine works to serve the goals of national renovation. It is necessary to take positive factors into account while simultaneously adopting resolute measures to deal with negative phenomena, erratic tendencies, and hostile arguments or maneuvers. It is important to promote nonprofessional cultural activities and accelerate the mass movement for cultural activities at the grassroots level. Steps must be taken to strengthen the mass media to disseminate lines, policies, and laws in a timely manner so as to make everyone understand cultural, literary, and artistic values and appreciate things that are genuine, good, and beautiful. Plans must be worked out to contain the venom of bad cultural practices and reactionary or decadent printed materials. It is important to strengthen the party's leadership; revamp the state management mechanism and enhance the efficiency of its control over cultural and artistic activities; and supplement necessary policies and laws and see that they are strictly enforced. Due efforts must be made to look after the people's health, bearing in mind the need to give first priority to primary health care and take positive measures to fight disease. Plans must be worked out to restore, consolidate, and expand grassroots medical facilities in populated areas as well as set up mobile medical teams in those localities where dispensaries are nonexistent. Steps must be taken to upgrade hospitals and provide them with better equipment. Plans must be worked out to build a number of major medical centers and special medical facilities. Adequate measures are needed to implement the medical insurance program and apply the policy on hospital fee exemptions or reductions to social welfare recipients and needy people. It is necessary to stop malnutrition, malaria, goiter, and leprosy in children. It is imperative to try every possible means to contain drug addiction, prostitution, and AIDS. Effective measures must be adopted to ensure that within the next few years we will be able to reduce the country's average population growth rate to less than 2 percent, with first priority being given to localities with high population growth rates. Efforts must be made to develop a large-scale movement for physical education and sports activities among people nationwide, especially among youths and students, and take steps to form special physical education and sports organizations and encourage athletes to break their own records. The struggle against corruption constitutes a burning and pressing current task. Resolute and full measures must be taken to launch an anticorruption campaign in the entire working apparatus, at all echelons, and in all sectors from the central down to the grassroots organizations. The following key measures must be applied uniformly: -- It is necessary to review, amend, or supplement mechanisms, policies, laws, and procedures governing the activities of state agencies and government employees. It is important to try every means to overcome loopholes in the management system and clearly define the responsibilities of those in charge of state property protection, utilization, and development. This will help to discover and deal with corruption cases quickly. Efforts must be made to renovate and consolidate financial management and bookkeeping. It is necessary to make full use of consultancy, assessment, and auditing services. It is important to streamline the mechanism, cut unnecessary expenditures, and guarantee sufficient salaries for wage earners. -- Consolidate education and training for cadres and party members to heighten their revolutionary morality. Leaders of sectors, localities, and agencies have to bear the responsibility for corruption within their respective areas. The responsibility of leaders in grassroots party organizations should be enhanced, and party members and the masses should be actively motivated to fight corruption. -- Strictly carry out inspection, investigation, and supervision by agencies in charge and by mass organizations, so that corruption can be detected early. Defendants in corruption cases, especially in serious ones, should be handled in a timely and strict manner in accordance with state laws, regardless of the defendant's position or rank. In the fight against social ills, coordination between the suppression and prevention of crimes must be heightened. The focus should always be on prevention, and a national program on crime prevention should be set up with an adequate budget. Sanctions and punishment stipulated by state laws should be strictly followed in association with an active education program, including both occupational training and production labor, coupled with improvement of detention and re-education facilities, in order to rebuild the defendants and give them opportunities to rebuild an honest life. We should prevent and punish all forms of mistreatment of prison inmates. 5. National defense and security. While carrying out national construction, we must never neglect the important task of safeguarding our fatherland, independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, national security, socio-political stability, and our determination to protect socialism. We need to thoroughly understand and properly carry out our national defense and security duties and stick firmly to the guiding viewpoint set up by the party Central Committee's third plenum. We have to motivate a comprehensive and universal movement to defeat all "peaceful evolution" schemes and activities and subversive violence. In the next few years, we have to carry out following successfully: -- Heighten revolutionary vigilance, intensify political and national defense movements, and cohesively combine the people's security task with the national defense task. -- Build steadfast defense areas and the people's security; and intensify defense forces in major areas in order to safeguard firmly territorial integrity, sovereignty, and national security. -- Safeguard firmly internal security, the party, and the state; and quickly detect and suppress all sabotage activities. -- Strengthen state management in social order and suppression of crimes; build up a people's movement to safeguard national security, social safety, and order. -- Build the people's army and the people's security forces politically, ideologically, and organizationally. Maintain all technical equipment well and make an effort to attain the gradual modernization of major equipment. Increase investment in national defense industries. Improve the cultural and physical life of the troops to ensure a strong people's armed force that can fulfill its tasks effectively. -- Strengthen the party's leadership role and the state's management role in national defense and security; bring into reality all state lines and policies regarding national defense and security; and quickly organize, consolidate, or improve the quality of agencies and cadres in charge of helping other sectors and echelons carry out national defense and security tasks. The Ministries of National Defense and the Interior should perform their management role in national defense and security well in accordance with their assigned authority and responsibilities. -- Perfect legal documents regarding national defense (laws on national defense and security, borders, and the sea; the supplementary law on military service; and other laws and regulations), and ensure the effective implementation of these laws. 6. Continuing to broaden external relations. To expand our foreign affairs achievements even further, we must continue our policy of independence, self-determination, open doors, diversification, and multilateralization. We must strive to increase unanimity; limit disagreement; create favorable conditions for our national construction and protection; and contribute to the common struggle of the world population for peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress. We must broaden our friendship and cooperation with all nations on the principle of equality; mutual benefit; peaceful coexistence; respect for one another's independence, sovereignty, and national integrity; and settlement of disagreements through negotiations to ensure stability, security, and development. We must increase relations with international organizations and positively partake in world activities to protect the environment, fight dangerous diseases, eliminate poverty and starvation... The external activities of the party and people must be broadened to win the wide support of world organizations and people for our national construction and protection undertaking. We must clearly realize our difficulties and challenges as well as advantages and opportunities, and closely follow complicated changes in the world in order to apply suitable policies. These must be in conformity with our principles but also be flexible and active. We must strengthen party leadership and state management and sufficiently coordinate with all sectors in our external relations. We must pay attention to providing education and training for more cadres with good qualification and abilities. 7. Building a Vietnamese Government of, by, and for the people. We must build and gradually perfect a Vietnamese Government that is governed by law; that is, a government of, by, and for the people. It should govern all aspects of social life according to law and lead the country toward development under the socialist direction. A law-governed Vietnamese Government should be built on the foundations of strengthening and broadening the people's unity and based on the worker-peasant-intellectual alliance under the party's leadership. Implementing a socialist democracy and expanding the people's right to mastery are the first duties and the fine nature of our government. We must follow President Ho Chi Minh's instruction: "Government organs from the central level down to the villages should serve the people. That means carrying out the people's common work, not oppressing the people." The government must be closely linked with the people, must respect and listen to their opinions, and must be under their supervision. It must resolutely fight against bureaucratism, authoritarianism, corruption, waste, and special privileges and benefits. We must protect the people's rights and the basic rights of citizens as stipulated in the Constitution, such as the right to possessions, the right to use production equipment, the right to legal trading, the right to freedom of discussion and expression of opinions for national construction, and the right to freedom of religion and non-religion. We must promptly examine and settle complaints and accusations lodged by the public. We must create opportunities for the people to contribute to the national work and offer opinions regarding construction of the party's lines and policies and the state's important bills. We must improve elections, and through elections, we must elect able people with good morals as people's deputies as well as place them in state mechanisms. We must restore social order and discipline, oppose any manifestations of extreme democracy, and implement dictatorship over elements who carry out activities against the fatherland and the people's interests. We must accelerate and heighten the quality of law-building work to build a uniform legal system and institutionalize the party's renovation line in all aspects of social life. Education on the law must be strengthened to improve legal knowledge, law-abiding consciousness, and the people's respect for the Constitution and law in their work and social lives. We must ensure that the law is carried out in a correct, uniform, and just manner. We must continue to improve and reform the state mechanism and ensure the unity of power. We must clearly define and expand the power of the administration, legislature, and judiciary. And we must work according to the principle of democratic centralism. The National Assembly's work quality must be heightened so that it can perform its legislation and supervision functions better. The number of National Assembly deputies working in specialized areas must be increased. We must reform and strengthen the administrative system's organization, personnel, and working structure. The administration's management role must be developed. The role and responsibilities of local authorities must be defined on the basis of the law and the guidance of the central government. We must continue to strengthen and reform the judicial system. The power of different judicial organs must be correctly defined. We must gradually establish new judicial organs to meet new demands arising from socioeconomic development and ensure fair trials for all law violations. We must set up civil service regulations and public work responsibilities and retrain government cadres and officials to ensure uniformity in the administration. 8. Renovating and reorganizing the party and strengthening the relationship between it and the people. We must continue to understand concepts thoroughly and implement the lines and measures set forth by the party third plenum. We must concentrate on political and ideological work to ensure political and ideological unity in the entire party. Cadres and party members must be given regular training on the party's concepts and lines to upgrade their knowledge; confirm their commitment in the socialist path; and help them creatively apply and develop Maxism-Lenininsm, Ho Chi Minh Thought, and the advanced ideas of our times and grasp the new thinking to resolve problems that arise from real situations correctly. Ideological work must first concentrate on pressing problems that need to be dealt with quickly. Through practical research and review, problems arising from the renovation process must be scientifically clarified together with measures to solve them. Mistaken concepts and vague and unsure ideologies must be corrected. We must fight all opportunistic, rightist, dogmatic, and conservative manifestations. Party cadres and members must strictly observe party resolutions and directives and state laws. They must not disseminate concepts that contradict the party's line. Party unity and unification must be strengthened. Principles related to party organization and activity -- foremost, the principle of democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership and individual responsibility -- must be implemented. Revolutionary morality and healthy lifestyles must be maintained to fight waste, corruption, and illegal businesses. We must fight personalism, lack of discipline, arbitrariness, authoritarianism, parochialism, and clannishness. Party protection work and the work to ensure internal and national secrecy must be given particular attention. All conspiracies and tricks to degenerate party cadres must be eliminated. Control over the implementation of the party's lines, policies, and regulations must be strengthened. The national unity block must be broadened, and the close relationship between the party and the public must be consolidated. Uncle Ho's thoughts must be promulgated to broadly unite the Vietnamese people in supporting the renovation cause for national independence and striving to extricate ourselves from poverty and backwardness in order to surge forward toward the goal of a rich population, a strong nation, and a just and civilized society. We must consider the national interests as our common goal. At the same time, we accept different viewpoints as long as they do not run counter to the national interests. We should eliminate obsessions and hatreds and look forward to the future. The ideology of unity must be manifested in all state guidance, policies, and laws. We must perfect policies to guarantee the interests and roles of the workers, peasants, and intelligencia. Women and youth must be fostered and developed. The party and state policies regarding ethnic and religious people, industrialists, businessmen, and the overseas Vietnamese community must be supplemented and satisfactorily implemented. Party echelons and committees must hold study workshops before implementing party Central Committee and Political Bureau resolutions on work relating to fatherland fronts and mass organizations. We have to set up mechanisms to coordinate the activities of state organs and mass organizations. The work content, method, and attitude of the fatherland fronts and mass organizations must be revamped. We have to reform cadre-related work. First, we must renew the concepts and methods of our cadre-related work in assessing, selecting, employing, and deploying; especially key cadres. Gifted people must be trained, fostered, and employed. We have to create favorable conditions for good people -- both inside and outside of the party and inside and outside of the country -- to contribute their best efforts for the nation. The contingent of cadres must be rejuvenated. Woman and ethnic cadres must be given special attention. We must fight narrow-mindedness, parochialism, prejudice, and discrimination. The evaluation, choice, and assignment of leading cadres at all levels must follow fundamental standards outlined in the third Central Committee plenum resolution. We must pay particular attention to their political knowledge, determination regarding the party's goals and ideals, and morality and lifestyle to ensure that they always exercise diligence, practice frugality, instill honesty, and uphold righteousness. They must not be corrupt; they must be determined to fight corruption. They must be aware of organization and discipline, stay close to the masses, and obtain a capacity and quality on par with their duties. We will bring about the democratization of party member work. Evaluation of cadres must be done collectively by the party committee directly managing the cadres, together with relevant agencies. It must be done in accordance with the proper process in a democratic, conscientious, and fair manner. Every cadre has the right to be informed and to give opinions on their evaluation by the party committee and agency leaders. All party organizations will reorganize and reevaluate the existing contingent of cadres. Based on this evaluation, they will make plans for party member work from now until the year 2000. This will correspond to the requirements for the quantity, quality, and structure of cadres. We will provide training to cadres according to plan. The training content must be specific for each task and requirement of each position concerned. Renovation must be carried out in both teaching and studying methods, while adequate funds must be provided for the training. Party members -- especially cadres at all levels -- must regularly study, enrich their knowledge, heighten their level of understanding, and improve their revolutionary characteristics. We must urgently prepare the human force for the eighth party congress and subsequent years. We have to improve the policies and awards for cadres, renovate our thinking, heighten the scientific characteristic of the organization task, and continue to overhaul the organization system to guarantee a light and effective party mechanism with high efficiency. We have to boost research on organizational models and discern the party's function, duty, and leadership style in every sector and echelon. From there, we must set up plans to perfect the organization and rationalize the mechanisms of the party, state, and other organizations. We will renovate the party's leadership model. Our party is a ruling party that sets policies and lines for national construction and protection. The successful implementation of party policies and lines requires us to grasp firmly the organization and cadre work. The party takes the lead in applying the principle of democratic centralism and the principle of collective leadership with individual responsibility. The leadership task is fulfilled through the party organization, not through individual party cadres. The leader executes collective decisions, follows up on and guides the implementation, encourages good deeds, and corrects deviations to develop the role and efficacy of the state, not replace it. We must heighten the militancy of party members regarding the consolidation of grassroots party organizations. Political determination and loyalty to the party's ideals, the working people's interests, and the interests of the people as a whole are essential characteristics for a party member. Party regulations clearly stipulate the criteria and duties of a party member. Every member must abide by these regulations and serve as a model in striving to become an excellent worker, cadre, or manager who fulfills all assigned tasks, studies regularly to improve their knowledge and work ability, respects organizational discipline, fosters party unity, and strictly obeys state laws. We have to handle degenerate and deviant party members in a timely and strict manner, as well as those who breach party discipline and state laws. We will continue to expel from our party those who are no longer eligible for membership. We must perform the party development task well, especially among youth and women and in organizations where grassroots party organizations do not exist or have few members. We will rejuvenate the party contingent. On the occasions of the party's 65th anniversary and other important festivities in 1994, we will launch education and training campaigns regarding party development -- with particular attention focused on youth -- in preparation for the eighth party congress. A new era is before us, full of promising potential, challenges that we are determined to overcome, and favorable opportunities we must exploit. Our entire party, Army, and people must stick together, remain unified in the struggle to implement the seventh party congress resolution successfully, and bring the renovation undertaking forward with ever greater victories.
