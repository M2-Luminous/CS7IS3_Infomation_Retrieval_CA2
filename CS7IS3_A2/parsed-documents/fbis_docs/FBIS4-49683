Deng Pufang again rejected suggestions that China's 89-year-old paramount leader was close to death at a press conference to support the Far East and South Pacific Disabled Games. "I really deeply regret all these rumors. He is in very good health. He enjoys the normal life of a retired person," said Deng Pufang, president of the Chinese Federation for the Disabled. "As the weather becomes warmer and warmer, he can go for walks. It is good for his health," the son added. In recent weeks, rumours that Deng Xiaoping is dead or dying have swept world financial markets. They have been denied by his family and the foreign ministry, but the last time he was seen was on television in February he had to be helped to walk. One of his daughter's, Deng Lin, said on April 28 her father was resting in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping has always been known to be a keen bridge player. But his son said that the Chinese leader was now a keen armchair football fan. "As this summer there will be a lot of matches like the World Cup, I am sure he will be interested in watching," said Deng Pufang. Deng Pufang was himself crippled when attacked during the Cultural Revolution, which is why he is now head of the Chinese federation for the disabled. The Far East and South Pacific Disabled Games will be held in Beijing from September 4 to September 10.
