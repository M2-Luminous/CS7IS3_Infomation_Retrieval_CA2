This year, the high export growth rate of over 20 percent marked in 1993 is likely to be maintained, expanding the industry's exports from $5.1 billion to $6.2 billion. This projection by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), however, is based on the condition that the Japanese yen remains strong. Signs are emerging, however, which indicate a weakening of the Japanese currency. Production of computer hardware, telephones, facsimiles, telephone exchanges and other equipment amounted to about $8.2 billion last year, up 13.4 percent from 1992. This year, the aggregate output is expected to grow by 17 percent and hit $9.6 billion. Domestic demand for computers and personal communications equipment will also expand by around 9 percent with the advance of the nation toward an information-based society. The industry's single largest export item is computer monitors. The nation's four major monitor producers -- Samsung, Goldstar, Hyundai and Daewoo -- churned out a total of $2 billion worth of monitors last year, accounting for about 30 percent of the world market in terms of quantity last year. In terms of value, Korea is second only to Taiwan in the monitor market. Monitor producers are expected to enjoy brisk business this year as demand for personal computers in the United States is recovering while that in the European Community will continue to increase sharply. Exports of personal computers (PCs) are also expected to rise, by some 20 percent, this year, if demand in the United States, which accounts for 80 percent of Korean shipments abroad, continues to center around the 486-class PCs. More than half of PC exports, however, will be made under the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) formula. Samsung, the largest of the Big Five computer makers, showed the highest OEM rate -- 84 percent of its exports worth $190 million last year were made under the OEM formula. Sambo, which is the leader in the domestic market, was second with 58 percent, while the remaining three -- Goldstar, Daewoo and Hyundai -- exported 90 percent of their PCs with their own brand names attached. In all, the five computer assemblers are forecast to export $539 million worth of PCs this year, a level which still falls far short of 1991's $719 million. For the Korean mass producers, 1992 was a disastrous year. In that year, world PC demand shifted from the 286-class to the 386- class and then to the 486-class. The change was simply too rapid for the Korean mass producers, who were unable to alter their production lines. As a result, exports were more than halved to a mere $332 million. The five PC makers plan to spend some $44 million for research and development of high-function notebook computers, the so-called personal digital assistants (PDAs), multimedia PCs, Pentium PCs and other high value-added products. Exports of computers and peripheral equipment are projected to total $3.78 billion this year, up 20 percent from the 1993 estimate of $3.15 billion. In the telecommunications field, exports are expected to grow at a similar rate to that of the computer industry. Production, however, will grow by a far lower rate of 8 percent on average mainly because of the expected low demand for wire telecommunications equipment and a sharp drop in Korea Telecom's purchase of domestic telephone exchanges. In contrast, domestic demand for mobile telecommunications devices such as pagers and cellular phones will continue to grow rapidly, causing a corresponding increase in imports of these products. Last year, over half of the domestic demand for cellular phones was met by Motorola, the world leader in this field. Samsung, Goldstar and Hyundai, the three key Korean players in the market, accounted for 16 percent, 12 percent and 4 percent of sales, respectively. New firms are entering into this fast growing and lucrative business. Exports of telephones, especially cellular phones, and facsimiles are expected to grow by over 20 percent this year as domestic producers are turning out new products. Telephone exports (wire, cordless and cellular) are forecast to total $463 million, up 22 percent from 1993, while facsimile shipments will grow by 26.5 percent to mark $215 million. Korean-developed digital telephone exchanges are also likely to see a sharp increase in exports. The three producers who jointly developed the TDX exchange -- Samsung, Goldstar and Daewoo -- are eager to explore new markets for the products. The three plan to raise their combined exports to $105 million this year, up 28 percent from 1993. Domestic demand for the exchanges, however, will grow only 3 to 4 percent as Korea Telecom has been reducing its purchases with the progress in its telephone network modernization program. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Industrial Electronics Industry in 1993 and 1994 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |(Unit: $ million) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |1992 |1993 (estimate) |1994(projection) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | |increase (| |increase (| |increase (| | | |percent) | |percent) | |percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Production|7,221 |1.6 |8,188 |13.4 |9,579 |17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Imports |3,205 |-9.2 |3,629 |13.2 |3,934 |8.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Domestic |6,199 |-8.0 |6,707 |8.2 |7,313 |9.0 | |sales | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Exports |4,227 |8.5 |5,110 |20.8 |6,200 |21.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Production and export projections for major items | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |(Unit: $ million) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |Production |Exports | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |1993 |1994 |increase (|1993 |1994 |increase (| | | | |percent) | | |percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Computer |4,560 |5,472 |20.0 |3,148 |3,777 |20.0 | |and perip-| | | | | | | |heral equ-| | | | | | | |ipment | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Telephone-|637 |769 |20.7 |380 |463 |21.8 | |s (wire, | | | | | | | |cordless, | | | | | | | |cellular) | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Facsimiles|341 |407 |19.1 |170 |215 |26.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Measuring |117 |134 |14.7 |85 |100 |17.6 | |instrumen-| | | | | | | |ts | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Telephone |518 |537 |3.6 |83 |105 |27.7 | |exchanges | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
