The airflow produced by these devices should be sufficient to prevent cross-currents of air near the patient's face from causing escape of droplet nuclei. Whenever possible, the patient should face directly into the hood opening so that any coughing or sneezing is directed into the hood, where the droplet nuclei are captured. The device should maintain an air velocity of " 200 feet per minute at the patient's breathing zone to ensure capture of droplet nuclei. 3. Discharge Exhaust From Booths, Tents, and Hoods Air from booths, tents, and hoods may be discharged into the room in which the device is located or it may be exhausted to the outside. If the air is discharged into the room, a HEPA filter should be incorporated at the discharge duct or vent of the device. The exhaust fan should be located on the discharge side of the HEPA filter to ensure that the air pressure in the filter housing and booth is negative with respect to adjacent areas. Uncontaminated air from the room will flow into the booth through all openings, thus preventing infectious droplet nuclei in the booth from escaping into the room. Most commercially available booths, tents, and hoods are fitted with HEPA filters, in which case additional HEPA filtration is not needed. If the device does not incorporate a HEPA filter, the air from the device should be exhausted to the outside in accordance with recommendations for isolation room exhaust (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.5). (See Supplement 3, Section II.C, for information regarding recirculation of exhaust air.)

Values have been derived from the formula t 1 = [In C 2 C 1 ) (Q V)] × 60, with T 1 = 0 and C 2 C 1 ^ (removal efficiency 100), and where: ␣t 1 = initial timepoint ␣C 1 = initial concentration of contaminant ␣C 2 = final concentration of contaminants ␣Q = air flow rate (cubic feet per hour) ␣V = room volume (cubic feet) ␣Q V = ACH The times given assume perfect mixing of the air within the space (i.e., mixing factor = 1). However, perfect mixing usually does not occur, and the mixing factor could be as high as 10 if air distribution is very poor ( 98 ). The required time is derived by multiplying the appropriate time from the table by the mixing factor that has been determined for the booth or room. The factor and required time should be included in the operating instructions provided by the manufacturer of the booth or enclosure, and these instructions should be followed.
