The absence of strategic definiteness and successiveness in the activities of the supreme bodies of power, primarily the Supreme Council and the president, have become the principal causes prompting the decision to terminate their powers and call early elections. The elections of the first Ukrainian legislature held in accordance with the electoral law adopted by the last Supreme Council of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, a law of an explicitly antistate nature, hampered the creation of a politically determinate and structured Ukrainian legislature. Under these circumstances, the issue of an expeditious choice of ways to form the bodies of state power and administration, and their structure is becoming of primary importance. In particular, this concerns executive power, as well as the status, functions, and powers of the head of the Ukrainian state. Confirming its opposition to the current executive power and its leadership, and supporting the resolution by the Small Council on the expediency of postponing presidential elections until a later date when the above issues have been resolved, the Fifth All-Ukrainian Congress of the People's Rukh of Ukraine, in light of the current circumstances, believes it advisable to refrain from nominating a Rukh candidate for president. The People's Rukh's Small Council has been requested to finalize the decision regarding Rukh participation in the presidential election campaign. We are appealing to all democratic and national-patriotic forces to join their efforts to prevent Ukraine from embarking on the procommunist and proimperial path.
