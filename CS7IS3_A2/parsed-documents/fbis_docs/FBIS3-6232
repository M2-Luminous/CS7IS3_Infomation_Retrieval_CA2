It was decided that the ruling parties' representatives' meeting would serve as the venue for coordinating views on electoral cooperation and realignment of political parties. During today's meeting, Shinseito representative Deputy Secretary General Kozo Watanabe, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, and Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa commented on the Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] plan to unite the social democratic and liberal forces. They said that if there is no plan for the ruling parties to become one party in the future, electoral cooperation will not be possible in the upper house elections scheduled for summer 1995. They also pointed out that even in the lower house elections, it would be impossible to cooperate in the single-seat constituencies while competing in the proportional-representation constituencies. They indicated that it is necessary for the ruling parties to aim to form a new-new party [shin shin to] to campaign effectively in the forthcoming elections. In response, SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo said, it is still a viable method of electoral cooperation for the ruling parties to coordinate on the choice of candidates and cooperate with each other in the elections. He stated that it is not possible to proceed right away to form a new-new party. In light of these differing views, the ruling coalition parties decided to use representatives' meetings or party heads' meetings as venues to coordinate views on electoral cooperation, and to discuss the closely-related issue of the realignment of political parties for the time being.
