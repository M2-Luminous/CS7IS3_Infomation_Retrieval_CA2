Price rises have slackened recently, but it is necessary to continue to curb inflation, to stabilize the market and to lower prices, the vice-premier told a three-day national conference on price inspection, which closed today in Beijing. Zou said that the aim of the price reform is to build a market price system with a reasonable resource distribution and indirect government control. To achieve this goal, it is imperative to change the price formation mechanism, straighten out the price system and reform traditional price management. But the vice-premier stressed that even if the price reform is completed, the government will still exercise controls of various forms over commodities and services either under state monopoly or necessary for the public good. He pointed out that after state controls over prices are lifted, it is necessary to transform the price mechanism and to raise the prices of basic products and infrastructural facilities in a gradual, planned way. Currently, he said, price hikes are accompanied by fake and shoddy goods and staggering profiteering. Efforts must be made to crack down upon these illegal activities, he said. Zou noted that the relationship between macro-controls over market prices and economic growth must be handled correctly. In addition, governments at all levels must pay attention to price legislation, he said, adding that a price law and regulations curbing cheating, price gouging for unreasonable profits and monopolies must be formulated soon. To check price rises, the State Council, China's cabinet, will again send inspection groups to provinces and autonomous regions across the country in mid-June.
