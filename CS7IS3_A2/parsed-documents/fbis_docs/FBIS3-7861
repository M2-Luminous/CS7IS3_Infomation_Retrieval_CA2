The commander of UN forces in Bosnia said he had "an agreement in principle not in writing" with Bosnian Serb authorities and that he felt he needed a written agreement. The Brotherhood and Unity bridge between the Serb-held Grbavica part of the Bosnian capital and the mainly Moslem rest of the city was to be opened to civilian pedestrian traffic. "I'm not going to push the issue on either side today," said Rose. "I'm afraid you'll all have to come back in a couple of days' time," he told reporters. In Belgrade Sunday, Bosnian Serb General Manojlo Milovanovic said his troops would use force to stop the re-opening of Grbavica bridge. The cancellation left over 100 Sarajevo residents, who had come to the bridge, disappointed that they could not see or get news of loved ones in Grbavica they had not seen in some cases since the war began in April 1992.
