Diplomatic circles said after the visit that Aliyev had particularly asked for Turkish military trainers to train the Azeri National Army and advise on military strategy. The Azeri president was also seen having extensive talks with Turkish Chief of Staff Dogan Gures before and during a working lunch in the Presidential Palace. Aliyev noted that he hoped the signed accords between the two countries--including a friendship and cooperation accord, as well as one on military training--would be implemented. "We have had consultations on speedy implementation of the signed accords," he told a press conference at Esenboga Airport after his talks. He said the ties would be enhanced with NATO member Turkey following its newly-signed Partnership for Peace deal with the alliance. He said Azerbaijan's six-year-old war with Armenia made the clauses of the agreement specially important for his country, but did not elaborate. His remarks in Ankara followed the failure of a new round of Nagorno-Karabakh peace talks in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, where the deputy speaker of the Azeri Parliament said his side objected to a clause in the draft agreement providing for peacekeeping forces from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) being brought into the conflict zone. Afiaddin Dzhalilov told reporters that the document did not mention occupation of parts of Azerbaijan by Armenian forces. The draft accord, which provides for a cease-fire from May 9, was signed by all other participants, but Dzhalilov's refusal to join made it invalid, REUTERS reported from the Kyrgyz capital. "Turkey will continue to be the advocate of Azerbaijan's righteous demands," Demirel said, in reference to the Azeri calls for Armenian withdrawal from its territories. In a veiled reference to the Kyrgyz and Russian initiatives, a statement from the president's Press Office said Turkey supported the Minsk process of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) for the establishment of peace in the region. Demirel said in the statement that Turkey was ready to do what it could in the democratization process in Azerbaijan. Aliyev, in turn, assured in the press conference that Ebulfaz Echibey, the deposed president of Azerbaijan, was "living well" in Keleki, a small village of Nakhichevan. "God give him long life," he said. Turkey has attempted in the past to establish cooperation between the two leaders in Azerbaijan, claiming their cooperation would ensure domestic stability and enable a united fight against the Armenian attacks.
