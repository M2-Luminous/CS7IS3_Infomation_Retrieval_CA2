In January the Israeli Ministry for Foreign Affairs appointed Yusuf Haji-Yahya as the country's ambassador in Helsinki but he has refused, citing personal reasons. Haji-Yahya, who has a law practice in Tel Aviv, says that he had made his decision already before the recent massacre of Palestinians at a mosque in Hebron. He would have been Israel's first Arab ambassador.
