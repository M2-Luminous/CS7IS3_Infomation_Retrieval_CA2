He added that an agreement exists between the KDH and SKOI that the KDH would not interfere with the selection and placement of SKOI candidates on the slates of candidates. However, SKOI's candidates will be placed after the KDH's own candidates who stand a realistic chance of being elected. The KDH Council is ready to recognize the right of SKOI members to their own club of deputies in the parliament, Langos said, and estimated that the joint ticket might gain the support of 10-15 percent of voters. Regarding possible differences of opinion between the KDH and SKOI, Langos said that these are not important at present and that the KDH's offer does not entail any obligation for disciplined voting [by SKOI candidates] in the future. According to Langos, all parties to whom the KDH offer has been addressed must decide autonomously. He warned, however, that it is urgent that they make their decision soon.
