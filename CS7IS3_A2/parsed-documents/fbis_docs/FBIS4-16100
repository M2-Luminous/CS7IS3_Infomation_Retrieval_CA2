Last year, your forecasts turned out to be by far the closest to what actually happened. How do you evaluate the prospects for and the situation with the regulation of the rate of exchange by the Central Bank today? [Fedorov] I think the rate of exchange would now be, maybe, 3,000 rubles [R] to the dollar but for attempts to restrain it. But the reserves for restraint are almost exhausted. If we get the $1.5 billion from the West on which the talks with [International Monetary Fund Managing Director] M. Camdessus centered, then, of course, they will be thrown onto the market. And this will retard the process further. But I am sticking to the forecast I made in December: It is perfectly feasible that the exchange rate may be R10,000 to the dollar by the end of the year. By restraining the exchange rate the Central Bank has, so to speak, gone against its own nature. Now it is even letting the premier down in some respects. Because a certain amount of credit, for instance, has been held back deliberately. In reality, there are between 2 and 3 trillion in liquid money on the market, and if you reduce the volume of credit issued, then this is sufficient to affect the rate of exchange. But any forecasts are made on the assumption that the Central Bank and the government will not fix the rate. [Levina] Do you consider this realistic? [Fedorov] I think it is doubtful, because this would be a blatant deviation from market principles. But now, as you can see, those in the upper echelons are trying with all their might to show that the reforms are continuing, and that there will be no deviation. And as soon as they fix prices, the exchange rate, or drastically cut, say, interest rates, or remove something or other from commercial banks, it will be impossible to preserve the image of reformers. But nevertheless, Chernomyrdin is somehow trying to maneuver between two rockfaces: nodding approval to one side, and not moving too far away from those on the other. But, as we know, a person cannot be in two places at once.... [Levina] And what can be said about the crux of the question on the liquidation of commercial banks? [Fedorov] Ultimately, roughly one-half of all banks will disappear or merge with others, and this is a fact. After all, even today many major banks survive only at the expense of state funds. A huge quantity of preferential credits and subsidies is released via commercial banks, and this keeps them afloat. A whole series of very well-known banks are actually giants with feet of clay -- and these are banks which are particularly friendly with the Central Bank. But those on less friendly terms with the Central Bank are far stronger, because they have drummed up real business, they have a genuine clientele, stable resource sources. Take, for instance, the "Stolichnyy" Bank -- it is fiercely unpopular with the Central Bank. The "Stolichnyy" managers may or may not be likable, but the fact is that this bank will not go under because it is engaged in specific financial business. And there are other banks which deal in specific business and have their own reliable sources. But those banks -- even very respectable and famous ones -- with a balance sheet showing between 75 and 80 percent centralized resources will be the first to go under because they are not competitive. This even concerns certain banks in, say, the oil and gas industry. But, I hear you cry, this is where all the state money and resources are, surely? But I get the feeling that some of them are breathing their last. While oil workers had a lot of money -- they prospered. But when the need arises to do business, to seek out depositors -- then they are weak. [Levina] Right now, at a time when the discussion of the budget is under way, everybody is concerned by one question: Will the same type of monstrous inflation witnessed last year continue in 1994? Why are such diverse figures cited on this score in official documents? [Fedorov] When a situation emerges whereby on virtually the very same day the president says inflation will be between 3 and 5 percent by the end of the year and the premier says it will be between 7 and 9 percent (while at the same time naming percentages of 10, 14, and 15 in various speeches), this means that they have lost their bearings and there is no clear policy. In principle, were we to set ourselves a limit of 3 percent, this could be done without any problems. This does not require any new discoveries, and no IMF will ever tell us anything new, no matter who's in charge there. Everything the IMF knows, we know ourselves. [Levina] So what is the problem? [Fedorov] This is a question of political will, and that alone. It is quite possible to stop the printing presses for a month. But this is painful. Likewise, it is perfectly feasible to cease emissions for six months. It is essential to look at which expenditure is inefficient. A great deal of it! And I have repeatedly suggested halting the issue of government decrees such as, for instance, the one on setting up an organizing committee to mark the 300th anniversary of a small boat belonging to Peter the Great. There is no need to spend millions on this nowadays! But there are dozens of these decrees. They represent the whim of useless administrative bodies. From government bodies downward. Why are there so many departments? Or what does the so-called center for information science policy under the government do? Of the 1,000 people making up the government apparatus, I believe that 700 could be pruned. And why are there 10 telephones on every bureaucrat's desk? You know, this means at least five types of specialist communications facilities. What for? There is a very great deal of unnecessary expenditure in our country. Resources are squandered with frightening gusto. In the last six months I have made repeated representations to Chernomyrdin to tear apart the expenditure base of the budget with an iron hand, and I brought him a list of 60 senseless decrees which ought to be abolished in view of the huge and unnecessary expenditure entailed by them. He referred them repeatedly to the government for examination, and discussions were organized. On several occasions the premier even took up a pen to sign something, but was then unable to do it. As a result, everything boiled down to the suspension of just one law on land, which was highly offensive and "cost" 100 trillion.... [Levina] Tell me, how are planned volumes of emissions determined in practice? [Fedorov] There is a very specific correlation: The percentage growth of emissions in the next quarter must be lower than the rate of inflation in the previous quarter. Now, however, we are officially preparing for the second quarter with a growth in emissions which is not lower but higher than previous-quarter inflation. That is, the spiral is twisting toward even greater inflation.... [Levina] Why? [Fedorov] There are solid lobby interests in parliament. Each group is fighting to increase expenditure on a particular budget item. And for some reason, nobody senses that by increasing the deficit you are making the country's position worse. [Levina] Does the Central Bank have too few powers? [Fedorov] On the contrary. In our country the Central Bank even has somewhat more powers than should really be available to any normal Central Bank. It deals with payment transactions and sundry other things, and if it were to be given the chance to offer credits directly too -- well, then there would be a lot of very happy people there. The oversight of banks is their favorite job. Because the psychology of old State Bank staffers -- to engage in small, specific matters -- is irrepressible. [Levina] What, in your view, should the Central Bank be doing in principle? [Fedorov] In any country the department of the Central Bank involves itself in two things: First, economic analysis, on the basis of which it gives the center a signal to rectify monetary and credit policy. Second, cash in hand. In some places the oversight function also exists. But this differs from country to country. But just you try to ask the following question of a Central Bank representative in any region of our country: "How do you analyze the economic situation in the region?" And he will immediately begin to complain to you about the sowing campaign, the railroads, the problems besetting enterprises, and that his ceiling is low and credits cannot be issued. And then it becomes clear: That is not what I would call a Central Bank. But without this, without the precisely and intelligently calculated guidelines and a firm political will to reduce the budget deficit, inflation and impoverishment cannot be halted.
