FR940805-2-00027 FR940805-2-00021 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Public Information Collections Approved by Office of Management and Budget The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has received Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for the following public information collections pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96&hyph;511. For further information contact Shoko B. Hair, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 418&hyph;1379. OMB Control No.: 3060&hyph;0168 Title: Reports of Proposed Changes in Depreciation Rates_Section 43.43 Expiration Date: 10/31/96 Estimated Annual Burden: 120,000 total hours; 10,000 hours per response. Description: Section 220(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Section 220(b), requires the Commission to prescribe depreciation charges for the subject carriers. Section 219 of the Act requires annual and other reports from the carriers. Section 43.43 of the Commission's Rules establishes the reporting requirements for depreciation prescription purposes. Communication common carriers with annual operating revenues of $100 million or more that the Commission has found to be dominant must file information specified in Section 43.43 before making my change in the depreciation rates applicable to their operating plant. The Commission uses the information to establish proper depreciation rates to be charged by the carriers, pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Act. The information serves as the basis for depreciation analyses made by the Description Rates Branch in establishing the aforementioned rates. Without this information, the validity of the carriers' depreciation policies could not be ascertained. In the Report and Order in CC Docket No. 92&hyph;296 (released 10/20/93) (Depreciation Simplification Order), the Commission streamlined its depreciation prescription process for local exchange carriers (LECs) regulated under its price cap regulatory scheme by adopting a modified basic factor range approach. In the Second Report and Order issued in CC Docket No. 92&hyph;296, the Commission adopted the initial set of accounts and ranges for the price cap LECs and terminated phase one of the implementation process. Ranges will be set for the remaining accounts later this year.
