Kaci Kullmann Five denied the charge. "This is an evasive maneuver on the part of the prime minister. We are pursuing the same policy we presented before the election. At that time, Brundtland said the Conservative Party was the only government alternative," the Conservative leader said. In the NTB interview Brundtland said she was very satisfied with 1993. "This has been a good year for the government, the Labor Party and especially for Norway." The prime minister said there is still a lot of turbulence. She believes the Center Party will again emerge as a clear-cut nonsocialist party when the EC issue has been clarified. The Center Party is pursuing an EC strategy and laying all other issues aside. When the EC fight is over, the Center Party will be back in the nonsocialist camp, in her opinion. "All parties act as special-interest parties and present special profiles on individual issues. They pursue a critical opposition policy. The election campaign has continued in the Storting. We are not confronted with any comprehensive policy, not even from the Conservatives. I feel the Conservative Party is operating to a greater extent than before with random political standpoints that seem unconnected. This developed during the current year and we saw it clearly in the fall," Brundtland said. No Basis The Conservative Party leader repudiated the prime minister's statements and asked her to be concrete when she criticizes the Conservatives for not being a total alternative and trying to present a "special profile on individual issues." "I don't think she has any basis for saying this. We are still pursuing the economic policy we announced before the election. And when it comes to two major areas--defense policy and education policy--we are continuing to work on what we promised. We are following up the proposals from the Defense Committee report that had broad majority support, and we think there should be more serious study than fun and games in school. Therefore we have proposed an increase in the total number of teaching periods," Five said. "The prime minister is quite preposterous and she also disagrees with what her own party leader said in the Storting's budget-balancing debate before Christmas. Thorbjorn Jagland spoke of the Conservatives in quite a different way than she does now," Five said. The prime minister is optimistic about the prospect of reducing unemployment. "It now looks as if we will stabilize the unemployment figures. In the last two months, jobless figures have flattened out, and each weekly figure has tended to be lower than the one in the same period last year. Now this year's and last year's curves have crossed, and we are at a lower level than we were 12 months ago. This means that for the first time in several years the January unemployment figure could be lower than it was a year ago," she said. Once again she stressed that the favorable development in 1993 is not due to an economic boost from other countries or favorable oil prices. "It is our own economic policy that has changed Norway's circumstances," she concluded.
