Aldoshina report; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] The government is apparently to get involved in solving the problems of reciprocal nonpayments between enterprises. [First Deputy Prime Minister] Oleg Soskovets announced at a news conference today that this is really a problem for enterprise managers to resolve. The first deputy prime minister is of the view that nonpayments are the result of poor management and badly organized relations between suppliers and consumers. As for the wage arrears in a number of industries, the Ministry of Labor has been instructed to investigate and to take measures. Soskovets reiterated that the government intends to strengthen the role of the state in economic development. It is not yet clear how this will look in practice, as Oleg Soskovets was not inclined to talk specifics. He answered questions with either platitudes or statements such as: The government is studying this problem, or the government is working on this. Incidentally, Soskovets' meeting with journalists today was the first of a series of news conferences on the implentation of the program of economic reforms in the period up to 1995. We will probably hear specific answers to all issues later.
