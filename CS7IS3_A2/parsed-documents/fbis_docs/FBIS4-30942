UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi said "the Serbs must withdraw and until they do the talks will not proceed." But he added that the talks on a cessation of hostilities with the warring parties, which were to have started here on Thursday, could still get underway on Friday if the Serbs pulled out from the three-kilometre (two mile) exclusion zone around Gorazde. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic insisted in an interview with WTN that the Serb forces had withdrawn. "There were not many there. They left last night," he said.
