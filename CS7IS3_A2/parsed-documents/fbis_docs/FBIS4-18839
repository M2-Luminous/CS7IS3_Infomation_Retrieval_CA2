[Longuet] In the framework of the long conversation I had with Mickey Kantor on 30 March, we agreed to put our "foot in the door." However, the aim is not to force our partners to join a system which, moreover, we have not yet defined. France and the United States want the social dimension of international trade to be taken into account. The aim is not to curb the expansion of the developing countries or to call into question competition with countries with low wages, but to ensure that our partners share concerns -- and hence objectives -- of a social nature. Like democracy, freedom of information and human rights are imperatives, and there must also be a degree of respect for the worker. With a minimum and a limit. The minimum encompasses the International Labor Organization [ILO] and matters relating to enforced labor or child labor. I would readily describe it as a "humanitarian clause" without which world trade would not be morally acceptable. The limit is that there is no question of imposing our system of social protection on others. However, there must be some proportion, a relationship between the level of development and the degree of social protection. [LE FIGARO] Why talk of this social clause now? [Longuet] The GATT issue is based on three major considerations: solidarity among regional groupings (and we have succeeded in securing recognition of the European identity); respect for the environment; and the social clause. These are the preconditions of fair trade. Indeed, the countries which do not respect the international standards in the sphere of the environment should not benefit from an unfair advantage. Conversely, the protection of the environment must not be a pretext for adopting protectionist measures. That is why we were demanding the permanent establishment of a committee for the environment. We secured it. Conquest and Relocation [Longuet continues] On the other hand, before 15 December, we did not want to call into question European solidarity by demanding, at the time, a monetary or social clause. Today, the United States is demanding the introduction of a social clause. This is a chance to seize the opportunity and try to move the European position in this direction. Here, too, our position is gaining ground, as the compromise adopted in Geneva yesterday shows. With regard to the Third World countries, if we imposed restrictions on them, they would have reason to refuse them. But this is not the case: The social clause is the logical complement of the commercial provisions of the GATT agreement: The gradual dismantling of the AMF (Multifiber Agreement), the reduction in customs duties and -- if China one day joins GATT -- the dismantling of quota regulations. Who will be affected by the social clause? The new industrialized countries, of course, and the developed countries which are considering relocation as an element of conquest. [LE FIGARO] Is this not opening a new debate, while there has already been some backtracking on the proposals made in Geneva [as published] and a number of issues have not been settled? Are the shortcomings of the GATT agreement not being concealed? [Longuet] Between 15 December and today, there has been some backtracking on a small number of tariff offers. But, generally speaking, the GATT agreement is and remains positive: Customs duties will fall by 40 percent! That is a wonderful prospect for world trade. In terms of sector agreements, we knew that there were some difficult areas: aeronautics and financial services, for instance. Even on these two issues, negotiations are planned for after Marrakesh. I think that making progress between 15 December 1993 and 15 April 1994 on social issues is much more important than sadly noting that we have not received new offers of customs duty reductions. Reaching a good agreement with the Americans on social issues and aeronautics also strikes me as a good investment. With regard to the AMF, I would like to be sure that the lack of proposals to open textile markets by countries with low wages -- Pakistan and India, for instance -- will be well compensated for by a slower dismantling of tariffs affecting those countries. [LE FIGARO] To return to Marrakesh, do you think that all the states present will sign? [Longuet] Yes. I think that the significance of the event must be gauged. The creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) marks a new era in relations among countries. After the end of the Cold War and the military confrontation between the blocs, the creation of the WTO bears witness to a period in which the concerted development of human activity prevails over ideological and territorial confrontations. [LE FIGARO] Is there likely to be a problem of ratification in some countries, especially in the United States? [Longuet] I think that if Mickey Kantor, who succeeded in securing a favorable vote in the U.S. Congress on NAFTA, is demanding this social clause, it is because he has fully realized that it was useful to have this clause to ensure ratification of the GATT agreement. [LE FIGARO] Is there not some inconsistency in welcoming the GATT agreements, explaining that they are good for France, and at the same time supporting the GATT entry of the new industrialized countries (NIC), where wages are 10 or 20 times lower? Will that not speed up the process of relocation? [Longuet] In the sphere of development, the Asian NICs have taken the easiest route: producing consumer goods in a competitive way. They must now move on to the next stage: that of infrastructure, which is costly, which requires technology and capital, and in which we are very competitive. It will take them 10 or 20 years to catch up. Toward the Western Model [Longuet continues] During this period, we will continue to sell them capital goods. But experience shows that these countries will have to face a fairly rapid increase in the cost of labor in their countries. Their ability to mobilize a cheap labor force is not unlimited, whereas the requirements of consumption are vast. The wage increases in Hong Kong, Chenxing, and Singapore are already considerable. We are therefore engaged in a race in which these countries are both our clients and our competitors. But they will be competitors less and less as their production costs become comparable with ours, and clients more and more as their purchasing power increases. The implementation of rules on forgery and intellectual property will now contribute to moving these countries toward the Western model. [LE FIGARO] The problem for us is the cost of the transition, which is measured in particular in terms of relocation. [Longuet] When the French consumer benefits from an increase in his purchasing power by the reduction in the price of products, the French producer does not benefit from a reduction in his production costs, in view of the cost of labor which nobody reasonably envisages reducing. The scales are tipped in the consumer's favor, to the producer's detriment. Should we not now seek a better balance? This is what we are doing by including some social security contributions in the budget. This eases the pressure on the producer and shifts it to the taxpayer, hence to the consumer, whose purchasing power will be reduced. If the load is shifted to sectors which are not exposed to world competition -- I am thinking, for example, of the distribution of gasoline by hiring pump attendants -- you penalize the consumer a little but you benefit employment. I think that this is now a priority. [LE FIGARO] For years, the participants have been trying to introduce a monetary dimension to the GATT agreements. However, the Americans do not want that. What is most important: stabilizing the dollar or signing GATT agreements? [Longuet] If we could do both, it would be perfect, but the stabilization of the dollar is largely beyond our control. We are participating in the organization of GATT and the creation of the WTO, and the WTO will become a factor of stability in a world which lacks it terribly. So, what is, basically, the best way of stabilizing the dollar? It is a European currency, which would make it possible to offer a refuge "as good as the dollar," as my friend Jacques Toubon would say. [LE FIGARO] What is France's position on China joining GATT? [Longuet] We are not hostile to it in theory. But, in view of China's size and the problems involved, the conditions of this membership really must be carefully defined. And China must accept all the rules of the WTO.
