That presupposes considerable territorial concessions on the part of the Serbian side, as well as the accesses to Sava River and the sea. Otherwise the tedious (and futile) series of Geneva talks will be continued, while the melancholy of the West will deepen even more. At the same time in the West, given some honorable exceptions, officials are hoping that the Muslim troops, after a successful final duel with the Croats in Mostar and central Bosnia, may make a turning point in the struggle against the Serbs. In that context it seems as if it is increasingly to be believed that there is a readiness of the "lilies" to continue the war, which, according to some statements by the top Muslim officials, might last for many years. "We can rely only upon our army," Izetbegovic repeats, encouraged by the support of the United States, whose attitude is that the war has to do with the legitimate defense of Bosnian sovereignty, whereby the Serbs, and later the Croats, are defined as the aggressors. "Divisions" and Heroes But how great is the military force of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the official name of the Muslim army? Estimates about this are being made in the Serbian republic on the basis of data collected by the intelligence service, particularly after some statements made by the Muslim leadership, such as Izetbegovic's latest, claiming that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has at its disposal 200,000 excellent fighters. Most of the chroniclers of the Bosnian war reject that figure as exaggerated. The refusal to comment by the generals of the army of the Serbian republic is explained by their caution -- "our enemy should not know how much we know about him!" Still, it is known that the "lilies" are organized in six corps, one of which is completely engaged in clashes with forces loyal to Fikret Abdic in the autonomous province of western Bosnia. We still remember the time when around 100 units organized themselves in the Patriotic League, or Green Berets, while various crisis staffs tried to organize them into army formations. Those units glamorized themselves by giving themselves names such as "Handzar" [the World War II Muslim unit under Ustasha command], "Smail Aga Cengic" [an Ottoman lord of the Bosnian origin], and so forth, while the staffs of "divisions" and "regiments" were highly improvised. In the course of time such a sort of combative optimism evaporated, so that those formations finally became organized into brigades, whose commanders were usually the local gazijas (heroes), while only in the third phase was there a desperate search for educated officers from the former Yugoslav People's Army. The initial mishaps and failures of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army have been ascribed to the "underground" activities of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] at the time when Tudjman and Izetbegovic were allies, while recently also to treason on the part of former chief of the General Staff Sefer Halilovic, who was first suspended, and now is expecting to be brought to trial. Basically, each corps of "lilies" has six brigades. For a long time they were quite small and weak, some of them hardly coming up to the force of a battalion, but now, these brigades are up to 2,000 men each. The corps are in charge of the defense of the territory, which has already become quite reduced in size, where the majority of communications have been destroyed (or disconnected), so that the possibility of maneuver on the front is very limited, and particularly the possibility of penetrating further into the territory. It is believed that, after several successive mobilizations, the Muslim army has at most 100,000 men under arms. A considerable help to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is the support of volunteers and hirelings from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, and some other Islamic countries, whose evil temper the Croats in central Bosnia have best experienced on their own skin. According to some data there are around 8,000 such volunteers. There are many conflicting reports about the combat skills of those fighters, but every witness agrees that blood-thirstiness is their general characteristic. For a long time the Muslim army [the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina] was relatively poorly armed. Its average was strengthened by the HVO's arsenal involving more than 230 tanks and 350 guns of various calibers, most of them captured at the beginning of the war, during the raid on Novi Travnik. There, in the Bratstvo [Brotherhood] factory, several thousands mortars, multiple rocket launchers, and other weapons of that kind were stored, ready to be exported.... However, with the collapse of the alliance, the Muslim side found itself without any tanks. For a long time the shortage of ammunition was also quite perceptible. Still, the shipments from the Islamic countries that arrived at the ports of Ploce, Metkovic, and Split in the first half of the last year considerably improved the arsenal of the Muslim army. Furthermore, the weapons that are still coming in under the cloak of humanitarian aid are also vital for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Despite the arms embargo, in a short time the Muslim side also obtained six transport helicopters. The Serbian and Croatian army staffs very often complain to the blue helmets that the AWACS planes are often turning a blind eye to this, while instantly reacting to every take-off of Serbian or Croatian aircraft. The Overestimated Favorite of the West Finally, one must not forget about the very powerful military-industrial complex that the SFRY built up in central Bosnia. The Bratstvo factory in Novi Travnik fell into Muslim hands with minor damage to the plant, so that the production of ordnance, although rather reduced, has continued. Still, the Muslims lack shells, which were manufactured in Vogosca (under the Serb control), percussion caps [kapisle] produced in Gorazde (now with the status of a UN protection zone, but without any communications because of its encirclement by the Serb forces), and gunpowder and explosives from Vitez, where fierce clashes are still going on.... One would say that the Muslim army has plenty of weapons, and even ammunition, but the infrastructure is insufficient, while the conditions for servicing are even worse.... On the other hand, according to witnesses, the army of the "lilies" [reference to the flag of Bosnia-Herzegovina] is becoming ever better organized, while its fighters are increasingly yielding to the influence of the fanatical supporters of holy war. In the West the recent reports (CIA) that are coming in express the belief, probably on the grounds of the continuous Muslim successes in the fighting against the Croats in Bosnia and in parts of Herzegovina, that the Muslim army is capable of taking the strategic initiative along the entire front as early as now. It seems, however, that Western analysts are still overestimating the strength and combat readiness of its favorite, pushing the entire Muslim people into a catastrophe, as Radovan Karadzic put it recently. It appears that more objective is the view that the Serbian republic army should not wait for the announced Muslim spring offensive to come into full swing. The General Staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is certainly analyzing the possible situation in which the "lilies" would have to fight on two fronts. After the recently called mobilization, that, for the time being, has only a preventive character, the Bosnian Serbs might create conditions for a reactivation of potentials that have been hitherto held in reserve, which considerably shortens the way to a counteroffensive. Is there any alternative way out? The inevitability of a peaceful settlement imposes itself as an answer to that question. Another answer is perhaps to be found in certain geopolitical theories, that suggest that by encouraging Izetbegovic the West is actually pushing him toward the abyss. Because Europe does not want the seed of Islamic fundamentalism on its soil....
