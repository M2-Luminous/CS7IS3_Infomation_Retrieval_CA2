FR941222-2-00119 FR941222-2-00096 The OCC's appeals process provides that a national bank may file its appeal either with the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller of the OCC District in which the bank is headquartered (or the Deputy Comptroller for the appropriate program in Washington, D.C. if the bank is a multinational bank or under special supervision), or directly with the Ombudsman. The proposed guidelines clarify that the term national bank includes a Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank. The District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller normally does not directly or indirectly participate in making reviewable supervisory decisions nor report directly or indirectly to the agency official who made the reviewable decision. In addition, the national bank may always file its appeal with the Ombudsman who is outside the bank supervision area, reporting only to the Comptroller. Therefore, the OCC believes that its appeals process complies with the Act's requirement that appeals be heard by an agency official who does not report directly or indirectly to the agency official who made the material supervisory determination under review. However, to further assure that the appeals process remains completely independent, the OCC has added a provision to require the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller to transfer an appeal to the Ombudsman if the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller directly or indirectly participated in making the decision under review or reports directly or indirectly to the agency official who made the decision under review. In addition, the OCC has added a provision to require the Ombudsman to transfer an appeal to the Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy if the Ombudsman should be recused from reviewing the decision under appeal. The OCC also is proposing to extend the period of time in which the District Administrator, Deputy Comptroller, or Ombudsman must make a decision on an appeal. Currently, the OCC's policy requires that the District Administrator or the Deputy Comptroller, in the absence of any extenuating circumstances, issue a written response within 20 calendar days of the filing of an appeal, and that the Ombudsman issue a written response within 30 calendar days of the filing of an appeal. In addition, the Ombudsman must issue a written response to a second-tier appeal, which is an appeal by a national bank of an appeal decision made by a District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller, within 15 calendar days of the filing of that second-tier appeal. The OCC is proposing to extend the time period for deciding all first-tier appeals to 45 days, and all second-tier appeals to 30 days. Based on the OCC's current experience with the appeals process, it has found that some additional time may be necessary. The OCC believes that the time periods in the proposed guidelines complies with the Act's requirement that an appeal be heard and decided expeditiously. The Act also requires that the appeals process contain appropriate safeguards for protecting the appellant from retaliation by agency examiners. Currently, the OCC takes steps to ensure that banks are not unfairly treated because of their appeal, although these steps are not part of the OCC's written appeals process. Specifically, the Ombudsman makes periodic informal inquiries after a decision on an appeal is made to determine whether the bank believes the OCC has taken action against it in retaliation for its appeal. If a bank indicates that such retaliatory action has occurred, the Ombudsman initiates an investigation. To ensure that these procedures are followed for each appeal, the OCC proposes to include the Ombudsman's follow-up-inquiries in its guidelines. Specifically, the OCC proposes that the Ombudsman contact the appellant bank to inquire whether the bank believes that OCC examiners have taken actions against it in retaliation for its appeal within (1) six months after the date the Ombudsman, Deputy Administrator or Deputy Comptroller issues a final written response to an appeal, and (2) six months after the date of completion of the first examination following an appeal. In addition, national banks that believe they are the subject of retaliation because of their appeal may, at any time, seek redress with the Ombudsman. Finally, the OCC proposes to change its definition of appealable matters to expressly comply with the definition of ``material supervisory determinations'' as provided in section 309(f)(1) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 4806(f)(1)). The OCC's current process permits national banks to seek review of all agency decisions and actions except those involving the appointment of receivers and conservators. Also expressly excluded are preliminary examination conclusions communicated to the national bank prior to the issuance of either a Final Report of Examination or other written communication from the OCC. The OCC believes that, until these preliminary conclusions become final, they are not ``material supervisory determinations'' for purposes of the appellate procedures. Also, consistent with the Act, the OCC proposes to continue to exclude enforcement-related actions or decisions from actions covered by the guidelines. The OCC proposes to clarify that enforcement-related actions include decisions to take prompt corrective action pursuant to section 38 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o) and, thus, are not appealable under these guidelines. To be consistent with the Act, the OCC proposes to add the definition of ``material supervisory determination'' to its discussion of appealable matters. The OCC appeals policy still includes decisions and actions in addition to those specifically identified by the Act as material supervisory determinations, unless otherwise excluded. Issues for Comment The OCC requests comments on all aspects of its appeals process. In particular, the OCC requests comments on the following issues: 1. Do the guidelines adequately provide independence in the appeals process? 2. Do the guidelines adequately provide that appeals are heard and decided expeditiously? 3. Do the guidelines adequately protect appellant banks from retaliation by OCC examiners? 4. Is the scope of appealable matters appropriate? 5. To what extent should the Ombudsman be bound by existing OCC policies?
