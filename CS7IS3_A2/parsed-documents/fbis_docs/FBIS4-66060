Leon Schwarzenberg, its leader, confirmed that yesterday. However, some of the intellectuals who support this list are wondering about the need to maintain it after Michel Rocard's statements. For instance, Bernard-Henri Levy thinks that in advocating the lifting of the embargo on arms supplies, the PSF [French Socialist Party] first secretary has "committed his list." Laurent Fabius, his predecessor as head of the PSF, expressed his agreement with Mr. Rocard's position, explaining that he had "taken a position on this basis" since August 1992. On the other hand, Philippe Vasseur, secretary general of the PR [Republican Party], thinks that Dominique Baudis, leader of the UDF-RPR [Union for French Democracy-Rally for the Republic] list, "demonstrated a calm attitude" by refusing to give way to "a media event" in favor of lifting the embargo on arms supplies to Bosnia. Pierre Lellouche, RPR deputy for Val-d'Oise and Jacques Chirac's diplomatic adviser, also spoke out against lifting the embargo, adding that Bernard-Henri Levy "is not Malraux." Jacques Barrot, centrist vice president of the UDF group in the National Assembly, said that "giving way to emotion and trying to lift the embargo on arms sales to Bosnia would amount to making a threefold mistake," namely burying the hope of peace, creating a terrible spiral, and making an admission of weakness. Finally, PCF [French Communist Party] National Secretary Robert Hue also stated his opposition to the lifting of the embargo.
