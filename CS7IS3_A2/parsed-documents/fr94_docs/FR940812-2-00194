For implementation of the voltage-based repair criteria to tube support plate intersections, notify the staff prior to returning the steam generators to service should any of the following conditions arise: 1. If estimated leakage based on the actual measured end-of-cycle voltage distribution would have exceeded the leak limit (for the postulated main steam line break utilizing licensing basis assumptions) during the previous operation cycle. 2. If circumferential crack-like indications are detected at the tube support plate intersections. 3. If indications are identified that extend beyond the confines of the tube support plate. 4. If the calculated conditional burst probability exceeds 1×10 ^2 , notify the NRC and provide an assessment of the safety significance of the occurrence.
