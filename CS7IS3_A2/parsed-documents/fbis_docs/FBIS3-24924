During his visit he met with his Nigerian counterpart, General Sani Abacha, in Abuja. On his return to Ndjamena, the president was welcomed by the prime minister and other members of his government. Let us listen to President Deby outlining the purpose of his visit to Abuja: [Begin recording] [Deby] We decided to pay a short visit to Nigeria as part of the efforts to develop the friendly relations of cooperation existing between both countries. This visit had become necessary after the changes that took place in that country and especially after the devaluation of the CFA franc in our country. It must be noted that, as far as trade with Chad is concerned, Nigeria is an extremely important country. Most of the trade between the two countries takes place in an informal way. We, therefore, decided to pay this visit to discuss all these issues in order to formalize our commercial activities. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] Your Excellency, concerning the devaluation of the CFA franc, in concrete terms, what economic benefits can Chad expect from Nigeria? [Deby] [Words indistinct] and even on this specific point, Nigeria is an oil-producing country. We have great difficulties in this specific field, so we expressed the wish to see Nigeria helping us to procure this product. What we are expecting from the Nigerian authorities is a positive reaction to our request. [end recording]
