"If we have to set up a process of consultation which would last hours and hours, it would never happen," Woerner was quoted as saying by a NATO official. He also warned Serbs against revenge attacks against UN Protection Forces, saying NATO would not hesitate to launch more air strikes if requested. Russia reacted angrily to air strikes Sunday [10 April] and Monday on Serb positions around the besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). After Monday's air strikes, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev insisted that Russia should be consulted before all NATO raids. "It is very dangerous and a big mistake to make such decisions without prior consultation with Russia," Kozyrev said during an official visit to Madrid. But Woerner, speaking at Aachen in Germany, said it would not be possible to protect UN troops -- who called for NATO's air strikes Sunday and Monday -- if there were hours-long delays. "Close air support has to be rapid. You have troops under fire. You want to protect them. You have to hit very rapidly," Woerner was quoted as telling reporters. He also said he hoped attacks on UN troops and Gorazde, in eastern Bosnia, would stop after Monday's air strikes. But he added: "We did what we said and we will not hesitate to repeat close air support air strikes as long as requested."
