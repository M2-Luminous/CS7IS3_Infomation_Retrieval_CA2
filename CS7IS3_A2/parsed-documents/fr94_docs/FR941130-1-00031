Box 1508, 4132 Highway 278, NW., Covington, GA 30209, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4348 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(c) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked (CAS Reg. No. 31212-13-2), when used as an inert ingredient (carrier) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops or to raw agricultural commodities after harvest. Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading, and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement on inert ingredients published in the Federal Register of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, crosslinked, will need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below. In the case of certain chemical substances that are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects. In addition, these criteria exclude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, conforms to the definition of a polymer in 40 CFR 723.250(b)(11) and meets the following criteria that are used to identify low-risk polymers. 1. The minimum number-average molecular weight of acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, crosslinked, is estimated to be approximately 1,000,000. Substances with molecular weights greater than 400 generally are not absorbed through the intact skin, and substances with molecular weights greater than 1,000 generally are not absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal tract. Chemicals not absorbed through skin or GI tract generally are incapable of eliciting a toxic response. 2. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, is not a cationic polymer, nor is it reasonably expected to become a cationic polymer in a natural aquatic environment. 3. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, does not contain less than 32.0 percent by weight of the atomic element carbon. 4. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, contains as an integral part of its coposition the atomic elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. 5. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, does not contain as an integral part of its composition, except as impurities, any elements other than those listed in 40 CFR 723.250(d)(3)(ii). 6. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, is not a biopolymer, a synthetic equivalent of a biopolymer, or a dervative or modification of a biopolymer that is substantially intact. 7. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, is not manufactured from reactants containing, other than impurities, halogen atoms or cyano groups. 8. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, does not contain a reactive functional group that is intended or reasonably expected to undergo further reaction. 9. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, is neither designed nor reasonably expected to substantially degrade, decompose, or depolymerize. Based on the information above and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural practice, this ingredient is useful, and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, that contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request within 30 days after the publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300372]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have an economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Dated: November 15, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 180 be amended as follows: Part 180_[Amended] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2.
