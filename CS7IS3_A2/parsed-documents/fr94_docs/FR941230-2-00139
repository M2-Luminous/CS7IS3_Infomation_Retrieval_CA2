FR941230-2-00139 FR941230-2-00072 Field-Initiated Gang Research Program_$500,000 OJJDP's Field-Initiated Research Program offers support for research ideas generated in the field rather than by OJJDP. Fiscal year 1995 Field-Initiated Research Program funding would be directed to the support of research on gangs, reflecting the growth in violence among youth gangs. Priority research topics include evaluation of prevention and intervention approaches aimed at diverting at-risk youth from becoming gang members, factors related to joining and leaving gangs, ethnographic studies on the dynamics of gang creation or joining, or other topics identified by applicants. OJJDP would provide up to five awards for up to $100,000 each under this program. Gangs, Groups, Individuals, and Violence Intervention_$200,000 Little is known about the interrelationships among gang participation, group delinquency, and individual violence. The dynamics of a juvenile's movement in and out of these relationships is not well understood. How these patterns of delinquency contribute to the careers of serious and violent offenders is unknown. Nor do we have a clear understanding of the prevention and intervention program implications of these patterns of delinquency. This project will involve a systematic review, assessment, and synthesis of existing research results on gangs, other types of group involvement, and individual serious and violent delinquency to determine the implications for prevention and juvenile/criminal justice system interventions. The framework to be used in conducting this review of existing knowledge is a criminal career model, including onset, acceleration, maintenance, and desistance elements. Implications for OJJDP's Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent, and Chronic Juvenile Offenders project will be drawn. Recommendations will be made for prevention programs and interventions in the juvenile and criminal justice systems that take into account meta-analyses of prevention and intervention programs. One cooperative agreement will be competitively awarded to implement this project in fiscal year 1995. Impact Evaluation of Law-Related Education*_$500,000 OJJDP proposes to join with the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) in conducting a multiyear impact evaluation of law-related education. The evaluation would serve a variety of purposes, including: (1) providing descriptive information about the process of designing, implementing, and maintaining projects; (2) determining outcome and effects of the program, such as changes in attitudes or behavior of participants; and (3) developing information on the best practices and performance indicators to allow for ongoing assessment by program practitioners. The contractor selected for this effort would be competitively selected by OJJDP and DOE. Innovative Approaches in Law-Related Education*_$200,000 The purpose of this competitive program is to support and advance the practices of law-related education (LRE) for the prevention of delinquency within and outside the classroom. Funds will be available to support two projects, at up to $100,000 each, that promote innovative methods, techniques, approaches, or delivery related to LRE. The promising approaches or ideas submitted will be judged on their applicability to delinquency prevention, on whether the proposed approach differs from previously funded efforts of OJJDP, and on the extent to which they provide an innovative approach consistent with accepted LRE program principles. Delinquency Prevention_Continuing Programs Satellite Prep School Program and Early Elementary School for Privatized Public Housing_$720,000 This is a continuation of a demonstration program under which OJJDP supports the establishment of an early elementary school program on the premises of the Ida B. Wells Public Housing Development in Chicago, Illinois. The program is a collaborative effort among OJJDP, the Chicago Housing Authority, and the Westside Preparatory School and Training Institute to establish a prep school for children in kindergarten through 4th-grade who live in the development. On September 14, 1994, the Wells prep school opened with kindergarten and 1st-grade students. In September 1993, a 2nd grade was added and in September 1994 a 3rd grade was added. The prep school operates as an early intervention educational model based on the Marva Collins Westside Preparatory School educational philosophy, curriculum, and teaching techniques. The Westside Preparatory School, a private institution located in Chicago's inner-city Weed and Seed neighborhood, has had dramatic success in raising the academic achievement level of low-income minority children. Fiscal year 1995 funds will be used to continue the operation and management of the Wells prep school and to add a 4th grade. Awards will be made to existing grantees. No additional applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995. Targeted Outreach With a Gang Prevention and Intervention Component (Boys and Girls Clubs)_$600,000 This program is designed to enable local Boys and Girls Clubs to prevent youth from entering gangs and to intervene with gang members in the early stages of gang involvement to divert them from gang activities and into more constructive programs. The National Office of Boys and Girls Clubs would provide training and technical assistance to existing sites and expand to additional gang prevention and intervention sites. The program would be implemented by the current grantee. No additional applications would be solicited in fiscal year 1995. The Congress of National Black Churches: National Anti-Drug Abuse Program_$250,000 OJJDP proposes the continuation of The Congress of National Black Churches' (CNBC) national public awareness and mobilization strategy to address the problem of drug abuse and enhance drug abuse prevention efforts in targeted communities. The goals of the national mobilization strategy are to summon, focus, and coordinate the leadership of the black religious community, in cooperation with the Department of Justice and other Federal agencies and organizations, to help mobilize groups of community residents to combat drug abuse and drug-related crime activities among adults and juveniles. CNBC operates this program in 31 cities. The program will be expanded to address family violence intervention issues and target up to six additional cities for a total of 37 cities. No additional applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995. Cities in Schools_Federal Interagency Partnership_$200,000 This program is a continuation of a national school dropout prevention model developed and implemented by Cities in Schools, Inc. (CIS). CIS provides training and technical assistance to States and local communities, enabling them to adapt and implement the CIS model. The model brings social, employment, mental health, drug prevention, entrepreneurship, and other resources to high-risk youth and their families at the school level. Where CIS State organizations are established, they will assume primary responsibility for local program replication during the Federal interagency partnership. This program is jointly funded by OJJDP and the Departments of the Army, Health and Human Services, and Commerce under an OJJDP grant. The project will be implemented by the current grantee. No additional applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995.
