FR940830-0-00060 FR940830-0-00013 With respect to the recommendations provided by the commenters concerning whether the unit must be occupied by the homebuyer that paid it off, the Department believes that prior to conveyance, the unit would be occupied by an eligible subsequent homebuyer and therefore the unit itself would be eligible for modernization work, where needed. The Department believes that decisions as to whether the IHA plans to modernize paid-off but not conveyed Mutual Help units at all, which specific units will be modernized and the level of work to be provided, should be made at the local level by the IHA. The Department also has removed restrictions on the modernization of paid-off but not conveyed Turnkey III units to the extent that there is statutory authority to do so. The authority to perform comprehensive modernization on Mutual Help units provided by the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 does not extend to Turnkey III units. Because the eligibility of homeowner-occupied Turnkey III units for modernization work is limited, see §905.666 and §968.310, the regulations have been amended to allow HAs to do work necessary to meet statutory or regulatory requirements in Turnkey III units which are paid-off, so long as the work is completed prior to conveyance. Contingency Accounts Comment: Although not proposed by HUD, three commenters recommended an HA-wide line-item account for contingencies. Such an account could be used for cost overruns and contract modifications (change orders). The commenters called for money assigned to this account by the HA to be considered ``obligated''. One PHA has found that its underruns on construction contracts are sufficient to fund most exigencies and act as a de facto contingency account. However, HUD restricts the use of underruns by requiring that all monies be reprogrammed within the funding program's original obligation period. It was noted that a contingency line item exists for development funds, and the amount in the contingency line item could be limited to a fixed percentage of the construction costs and would not require HAs to make numerous revisions to their budgets. A single revision could be made annually with the contract modifications reflected in the proper line item. Response: HUD generally agrees with these comments and has revised the regulation to permit HAs to budget for a contingency account for cost overruns and contract modifications. HUD notes that Section 504 accessibility conversion is an eligible expense under HA-wide physical improvements. Refer to the next section below for a discussion of HA-wide items. HUD currently permits a contingency account in its Development Program and has decided to adopt a similar approach for the CGP. A HA may budget up to 8% of its total annual grant for a contingency account. (A new account will be established and included on the Annual Statement Form). Money budgeted in a contingency account is considered unobligated until it is moved to another account and obligated for a cost overrun or other work items. The HA will provide the status of its contingency account in its annual Performance and Evaluation Report (P&E Report). For example, if an HA uses $100,000 from its contingency fund for a contract modification in Account 1460, the P&E Report will reflect a reduction of $100,000 in the contingency account and an increase of $100,000 in Account 1460. The $100,000 will be obligated when the contract modification is issued under Account 1460. The contingency account will be a fixed account for each annual grant; i.e., the HA cannot replenish the account as funds are used from it. HUD wishes to clarify that it does not restrict the use of underruns by requiring that all monies be reprogrammed within the funding program's original obligation period. Under the CGP, a HA may extend the target dates for fund obligation in the approved Annual Statement without prior HUD approval whenever any delay outside of the HA's control occurs, as specified by HUD ( e.g., litigation, HUD or other institutional delay, extended labor strikes, extended material shortages, or need to use leftover funds) and the extension is made in a timely manner. The need to reprogram unobligated funds resulting from underruns constitutes a valid reason for self-executing a time extension. Comment: One HA suggested a two pronged approach for implementing contingency accounts. First, HUD should remove the two-year obligation deadline and allow HAs to obligate monies at any time in the modernization process provided that the funds are expended within the 5-year statutory limit. The second component would permit each HA to establish a line-item contingency account equal to 1%&hyph;2% of the total grant amount in its annual submission. Funds resulting from underruns or credit contract modifications would be transferred into the contingency account for future use. The account would not be allowed to exceed 10% of the outstanding grant balance without prior HUD approval. HAs would draw funds to pay for contingencies from the account as needed. These funds would be added to contract accounts via budget modifications. In general, excess contingency account funds would be reprogrammed into additional modernization work. This modernization work could come from anywhere in the HA's physical or management needs assessment or from eligible management improvements. As the expenditure deadline for a particular funding year nears, HAs would begin to use the excess funds in that year's contingency account to pay for contract work performed in other funding programs. At the end of the fifth year, all program funds_including contingency account funds_would be expended. HAs would prepare for HUD's review and audit, annual reports detailing the use of all contingency funds. In addition, program close-out reports would provide HUD with a detailed accounting for each contract on which program funds were spent. An amendment to §§905.666 and 968.310 was also recommended to describe the mechanics for operating a contingency account. Response: HUD wishes to clarify that there is no statutory two-year obligation period, three-year expenditure period, or 5-year statutory limit for spending funds approved in a particular FFY. However, HUD expects that funds allocated in a FFY, including those designated by the HA as contingency funds, will be obligated within two years and expended within three years of approval. If an HA can demonstrate that a longer implementation schedule is necessary ( e.g., size of grant, complexity of work), HUD may approve an obligation/expenditure schedule that exceeds this National guideline. The HA has responsibility for proposing its implementation schedule, as part of each Annual Work Statement. Also, as previously noted, the HA may self-execute a time extension of the approved implementation schedule for reasons outside of its control ( e.g., litigation). In all cases, however, timeliness of obligation and expenditure of funds will be considered in the assessment of a PHA's modernization performance under the PHMAP.
