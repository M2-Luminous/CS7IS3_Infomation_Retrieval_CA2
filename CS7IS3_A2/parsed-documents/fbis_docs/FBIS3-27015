By the end of January, personal savings in domestic banks hit a total of 1,480 billion yuan ($172.1 billion), an increase of some 3.7 billion yuan ($426 million) over December. Of the total, fixed time deposits accounted for some 70 per cent, which enhanced the lending strength of the country's banks for the national economy. Analysts say the savings increase indicates that the country's high interest-rate policy still poses significant attraction for people to keep their savings in the banks, thus easing inflationary pressure on the domestic market. "In an effort to encourage deposits, the bank saving interest rate is at its highest since China launched economic reform in 1978," said Zhou Rongfang, an official with the Interest Rate Department of the People's Bank of China, the central bank. In January, the Industrial and Commercial Bank, a leading savings bank, saw individual savings in its Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai branches increase almost 2.2 billion yuan ($255 million) from the previous month. Li Lan, a bank official, said that the corporate bonds and shares in the securities exchanges have not yet become attractive enough to draw money away from bank savings. Ordinary Chinese still believe the best way to protect their savings from devaluation is to rely on the bank saving interest rates, which now stand at an annual rate of 10.98 per cent for one-year fixed deposits," he explained. Many Beijing depositors say that they knew little about the shares listed in the stock exchange, and were unwilling to take the risk of investing their lifetime savings in them. "We are counting on our bank savings to support our children's education and the opportunity of buying an apartment--the biggest item on the spending list of most Chinese consumers," said Xiao Wang, who, along with his wife, work for a foreign-funded firm in Beijing. Zhang Qingshou, Vice-President of the Industrial and Commercial Bank, said his bank will carefully use its saving deposits, which are the source for more than half of its bank loans, to ensure a sound implementation of its lending plan this year. This year, more than 60 per cent of the bank's loans are expected to support the country's industrial enterprises, and the rest will be earmarked for commercial loans, Zhang said. Prompted by the strong backing of bank loans and the buoyant domestic market, the country's industrial enterprises also saw their output grow 33.2 per cent in January over the same period last year. A constant rate of production, said an official with the State Statistics Bureau, was, to some extent, driven by improvement in product sales. The bureau's figures show China's retail sales reached 119.2 billion yuan ($13.8 billion) last month, an increase of 22 per cent from the same month last year.
