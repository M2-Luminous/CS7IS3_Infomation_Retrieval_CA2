This was stated, among other things, by Douglas Champ from Canada, the head of a team of International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] experts, at a news conference in Mochovce yesterday. Since the beginning of this week, the international group of experts has been studying in Mochovce all important aspects of radioactive waste storage at the depository adjacent to the power station, possibilities of enhancing the depository's safety, requirements for control, technology, and professional qualifications of the maintenance staff, as well as the progress of finishing work. The experts reached the conclusion that the concept of storing radioactive waste to be used at Mochovce is good and that, following the implementation of recommended measures, storage will be reliable and safe. According to Douglas Champ, the recommendations will encompass a wide range of ideas, ranging from design, construction, specifications of the waste, and measurement of limits, down to public relations.
