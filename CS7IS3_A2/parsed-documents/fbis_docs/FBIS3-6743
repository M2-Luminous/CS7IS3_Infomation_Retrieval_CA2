The white paper says although there had been numerous political charlatans in South Korea, there has been no such a special-class turncoat well-versed in flip-flaps like Kim Yong-sam who gratified his greed for power by traveling between the ruling and the opposition and repeatedly changing his political views. It further says: No sooner had Kim Yong-sam entered upon his political career than he found himself among the one hundred thirty-six initiators of a "constitutional amendment bill" to make the traitor Syngman Rhee, a pro-American dictator, a "life president" in November 1954 and when the bill was voted down at the "National Assembly", he became one of the twenty "National Assemblymen" from the "Freedom Party" who rattled the bill through the parliament by phony calculation such as counting as one fractions of .5. Later, informed about the truth behind "Operation Ever Ready", a plot weaved by the U.S. to remove Syngman Rhee, Kim Yong-sam lost no time but broke away from the "Freedom Party" in December 1954 and joined the opposition Democratic Party. After shifting to the side of the opposition, the political charlatan had resorted to every conceivable means of political frauds, swindle and tricks to disguise himself as a "champion of democracy against dictatorship" for 35 years till he came to be embraced by the dictator through the merger of three parties. In January 1990 Kim Yong-sam partook of the U.S. imperialists' grand compromise strategy intended to totally block the anti-U.S., anti-fascist action of the popular masses and maintain and prolong the pro-American "military government" by merging the ruling "military government" and the conservative opposition force and thus saved the No Tae-u group from the blind alley to which it had been driven, and committed a criminal act of laying a stumbling-block in the way of the movement for independence, democracy and reunification. Seating himself at the helm of dictatorial power, Kim Yong-sam openly backpedaled on the fine-sounding commitments to "democratisation" he had made before his assumption of office through a fascist frenzy of the "civilian" dictatorship. The traitor has brandished the sword against the people while unhesitatingly granting unprecedented leniency for the former dictators, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, with the assurances that "the unsatisfactory past would no longer be made a topic for discussion". The Kim Yong-sam group placed on the backburner its promise to "do its utmost for the growth of minor enterprises" and concentrated more than sixty percent of the treasury funds on big businesses. As a consequence, more than 4,300 minor businesses went bankrupt last year, leaving one million people jobless. Kim Yong-sam went the length of invoking the fascist "emergency arbitration power" which even those of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics had not dared to do, in brutally suppressing the workers' struggle for their right to existence. On the plea of "eradication of corruption", Kim Yong-sam increased his family property by more than 590,000,000 won in six months or so and his secretaries collected 39,000 million won as political funds at the backroom of "Chongwadae" [presidential office]. The so-called "doctrine on the superiority of the nation" uttered by the traitor Kim in his "presidential" inauguration address turned into a "doctrine on the inferiority of the nation" and a "doctrine of hostility against the nation", and his "policy of improving relations" with the North was replaced by a "policy of aggravating relations". The white paper brands the traitor Kim Yong-sam as a political charlatan who has no philosophy of his own, no political view and has no regard for the nation and people, and as a two-bit shyster who has not an iota of conscience as a human being and no creed as a politician. The white paper says that all the people must immediately topple the traitor Kim Yong-sam whom they need not to watch or expect from any longer, and open a broad avenue for independence, democracy and reunification.
