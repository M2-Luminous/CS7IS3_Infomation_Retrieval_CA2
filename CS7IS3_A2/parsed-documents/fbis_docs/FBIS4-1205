Introduction The accord must not be seen in isolation but in conjunction with Constitutional Principle XXXIV, Chapter 11a: Volkstaat [homeland] Council of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act 200 of 1993, the unsigned memorandum of agreement between the ANC and the AVF [Afrikaner National Front], dated December 21 1993, the Guidelines for the deliberations of the Volkstaat Council, as well as the unmandated defining statement on the principle of self- determination. 2. The essence of this package is the following: Constitutional provision is now made for any community sharing a common cultural and language heritage, whether in a territorial entity or in any other recognised way. The final constitution may now give expression to any particular form of self-determination provided there is substantial proven support within the community for such a form of self-determination. A constitutional body, the Volkstaat Council consisting of 20 members is established. The Volkstaat Council shall serve as a constitutional mechanism to enable proponents of the volkstaat to constitutionally pursue the establishment of such a volkstaat. The Volkstaat Council shall be competent to gather, process and make available information with regards to: - possible boundaries, - powers and functions, - legislative, executive and other structures at national and provincial level, and - any other matter directly relevant to the establishment of such a volkstaat. To make feasibility and other relevant studies with regard to the above. The Volkstaat Council is elected by members of Parliament who support the establishment of a volkstaat. The following procedure will be followed by the Freedom Front in the appointment of the said council: - the public will be invited to nominate suitable candidates for appointment to the council. - a short list of possible oppointees will be drawn up by a panel. - after formal hearings and interviews, twenty experts in their fields will be appointed as councillors. The procedures provided for in the constitution with regard to the finalisation of present provincial boundaries shall not be construed as precluding the establishment of a volkstaat. Proposals for self-determination of local communities through community councils or structures modelled along the lines of similar structures and processes in other parts of the world could be considered. A national advisory body attached to the Volkstaat Council and constituted by twenty five representatives elected by local communities in the different provinces, supporting the ideal of self-determination in a volkstaat, could be established. In the event of the realisation of a volkstaat, this body will represent the respective communities within the volksraad of such a volkstaat. Citizenship intended for persons residing in a possible volkstaat will not be racially based and shall be compatible with internationally accepted norms. The accord makes specific provision for the following: The parties commit themselves to further negotiations also after the election to address the ideal of Afrikaner self-determination including the concept of a volkstaat. The possibility of local and/or regional and other expressions of such self-determination will also be considered. Support for the ideal of self-determination in a volkstaat will be indicated by the electoral support which parties with a specific mandate to pursue the realisation of a volkstaat will gain in the forthcoming election. To facilitate the consideration of the volkstaat after the elections, electoral support should not only be measured nationally, but also by counting the provincial votes at the level of: The electoral district; and the polling station as indicated by the parties. The Volkstaatraad [Volkstaat Council] shall form such advisory bodies as it may determine. The parties further undertake to discuss and reach agreement on matters such as stability in the agricultural sector and indemnity as well as other outstanding issues which could include international mediation to help resolve these matters.
