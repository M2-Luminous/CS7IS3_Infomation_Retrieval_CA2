That is, in the context of deploying and arming its military forces in anticipation of any military action between the northern General People's Congress forces and the southern forces belonging to the Socialist Party, as a result of the current crisis threatening Yemen's unity. This development in the Yemeni Economic Establishment comes after the decision to change its name, removing the word "military," and after the closure of its office in Moscow as a result of the state of political openness which Russia is currently witnessing and in the light of the Russian military attache's participation in the proceedings of the joint military committee and his direct acquaintance with the true conditions there, as a result of which he regularly informs his government of the details of what is happening. While Russia is working to join the Western states' community and hence is forced to take account of numerous considerations in its foreign policy, prompting it to sacrifice some arms sales in states experiencing a certain crisis, East European states where communism has collapsed continue to look for markets, even for a "few dollars" to solve their economic problems, even if it is at others' expense. The Economic "Military" Establishment's approach has not been affected by the clamor provoked by the Polish press and AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's report about the arms deals concluded with the two Polish companies Cenzin and Cenrex to supply the northern armed forces with various types of weapons, after this was revealed by Muhammad Sharaf, Yemeni charge d'affaires in Warsaw, during his contacts with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah in Sanaa and later in a telephone conversation with Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas in Aden -- because these deals conflict with the stipulations of the "Pledge and Accord Document," seeking to avoid military aggravation of the Yemeni crisis. The Polish arms trade with Yemen actually began on 18 November 1993, namely when Col. 'Abdallah al-Hadrami, director general of the Economic (formerly Military) Establishment, paid a 24-hour visit to Warsaw. The visit was a surprise to many people. Al-Hadrami rejected the charge d'affaires' request to attend his meeting with the chairman of Cenzin responsible for war production, so as to prevent him from learning details of what was going to be discussed, thus doing away with his efforts as official representative of the united Republic of Yemen to follow up any action concerning the country. It was decided that contacts should be made directly with the Yemeni establishment, namely through Col. Muhammad al-Shahari, director of its Moscow office. [passage omitted] AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT cooperated with a number of Polish journalists to uncover details of the deal and managed to obtain copies of the letters sent by the companies Cenzin and Cenrex and companies of the visa applications. Polish Economic Cooperation Ministry and Foreign Ministry sources approved the signing and implementation of the military deals, whose value ranges between tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars.
