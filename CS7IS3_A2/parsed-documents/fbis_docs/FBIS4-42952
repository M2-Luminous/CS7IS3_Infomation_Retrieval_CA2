Mentese stressed that all ethnic groups living in Turkey have equal rights. "People who talk of a Kurdish entity or equal political rights are playing with words. Whose identity or political rights are we talking about?" Criticizing the outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), he said, "The PKK terror organization has diverted the issue and has been operating behind a false claim, mainly that the fighting is being conducted for the sake of the Kurdish identity and the freedom of the Kurdish people." The interior minister blamed the creation of a "Kurdish problem" on certain centers of power, which he said have intentionally projected this image to the public based on unfounded and groundless claims. Mentese emphasized the tolerant atmosphere in the country by claiming that "there is no differentiation between Kurdish, Turkish, Circassian, Bosnian, and Albanian citizens of Turkey. Everybody is free to choose his or her profession freely and the same is true for our Kurdish citizens." He concluded that, "Therefore, these accusations result from games played by foreign centers of power." During the speech, Mentese also said that people who murder babies, women, children and the elderly without any hesitation, hiding behind the cover of "fighting for the salvation of the Kurdish people," cannot be tolerated and accepted. Referring to the harsh living conditions in the Southeast, Mentese said: "The current situation in the Southeast cannot be interpreted as a `Kurdish problem.' The problem is the geographic nature and position of the region. Due to this, neither the government nor the private sector has been able to make investments to reverse the existing economic conditions or to assist in the creation of jobs in the region. Necessary measures will be taken to upgrade the living standards in the region." The interior minister assured the audience that necessary socioeconomic measures have already been taken to encourage the development of the region and attract investors. As the purpose of the gathering was to seek ways of establishing an environment of peace and security in the Southeast, many government officials from a variety of ministries attended the meeting. Attendees included the undersecretaries from the ministries of Foreign Affairs, National Security, Justice, Finance, Education, Agriculture, Forestry, Public Works and Housing, Labor and Social Security and Transportation. The undersecretary of the National Intelligence Organization (MIT) also participated in the event as did the Higher Education Council (YOK) president, the general director of the Youth and Sports Ministry, the undersecretary of the Emergency State Coordination Council and a representative from the general staff of the Turkish Armed forces.
