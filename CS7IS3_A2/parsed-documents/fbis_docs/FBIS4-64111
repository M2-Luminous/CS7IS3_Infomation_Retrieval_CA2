Gudauta militants carry out armed raids on peaceful villages of the area, later accusing the Georgian side in order to gain over public opinion. Yesterday [25 May], Abkhazian mercenaries units attempted to attack Georgian positions. Georgian Armed Forces units and the local population, who until then had refrained from any retaliatory actions, had to open fire. The opposite side retreated suffering casualties. Six attackers were killed and two taken prisoner. Embittered by this failure, Abkhaz separatists dropped four bombs on the village of Ajara yesterday at one p.m.; luckily, there were no casualties.
