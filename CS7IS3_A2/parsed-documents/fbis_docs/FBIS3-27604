The technology, which was invented by the young agronomist Huang Peijin after five years' painstaking efforts, is believed to be able to solve the long-existing problem of low yields per ha [hectare] when producing hybrid rice seeds. The application of the technology in Lingling Prefecture has recorded a per ha average output of 4,500 kg on a large area of farmland over the past three years, and helped save more than 3,000 hectares of improved farmland from making rice seed, bringing about 40 million yuan in output value. Domestic and overseas experts say that the technology is of high value in application. The invention of the technology, which has also obtained a national patent, has brought Huang many honors, including the gold prize given by the International Intellectual Property Organization. Professor Yuan Longping, dubbed "father of hybrid rice" and a chief technical advisor for the technology, wrote inscriptions for the TV programs made by the seed company in Lingling Prefecture of Hunan. Teaching materials, both in English and Chinese, have also been published by China Scientific and Technological Publishing House in tandem with the TV programs, according to local officials.
