The bank managers approved bank activities of 1993 and set future priorities. Bank President Jacques de Larosiere told the final news conference he is satisfied with the meeting results. The bank's adherence to the development of the private sector was unanimously supported. Special attention will be paid to the assistance to small and medium ventures. Bank-supported projects to help private businesses will be a major sphere of the bank activities. The bank board has decided to expand its activities in all the 25 post-communist nations in 1994. Each of them will have at least one project. At the same time, Russia will remain the major area of bank operations, said de Larosiere. Bank credits issued to the Russian Federation increased tenfold in 1993. Russia counts for over 20 projects worth of 1.5 billion ECU [European currency units] from out of the bank's 150 investment projects worth of 3.5 billion ecu. The actual sum of the credit use is so far 120 million U.S. dollars. Financing of environmental protection projects remains a priority area of the bank's activities. The bank head noted they will pay more attention to safety of nuclear reactors and have reached an agreement on additional allocations for reactor upgrading projects. Three Russian projects of the kind are being discussed. Another important result of the bank board meeting is the decision to help central and east European plants to enter world markets. Free goods exports is an obligatory condition for their transition to the market economy, stressed de Larosiere. The bank's 1993 successes, expanded activities and more complicated tasks have raised the question of increased funds, which are amounting to ten billion ecu in accordance with the bank rules. In the words of de Larosiere, corresponding proposals will be prepared by the bank leadership by the fourth annual meeting of the bank board to be held on April 10-11, 1995, in London.
