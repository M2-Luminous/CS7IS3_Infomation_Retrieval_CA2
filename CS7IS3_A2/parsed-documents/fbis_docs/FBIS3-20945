Tools and Development 94WS0163B Berlin INGENIEUR DIGEST in German, Dec 93 pp 36-37 94WS0163B Berlin INGENIEUR DIGEST Language: German, Article Type:CSO [Article by Wolfgang Baier, VDI/VDE-IT GmbH (Association of German Engineers and Association of German Electrical Engineers - Information Technology Ltd)] [Text] TOU-ASSISTANCE Tools and Implementation 1. Professional Support To each enterprise founder the TOU-project carriers assign a team consisting of an industrial manager and an engineer or natural scientist. This team advises the founder during conception of the enterprise, during work on implementation of development plans, and during product marketing or production setup. The consultations are free of charge, but cannot be made available on an unlimited basis. The team members moreover arrange contacts with actual customers, potential customers, partners for joint projects, suppliers, and financial investors while also doing, if necessary, research on technical and marketing problems. Besides providing those free consultations, the TOU-Project carriers also conduct seminars which are specially planned to deal with problems relating to given enterprises and which require payment of a fee for custodial service. 2. Financial Support Phase I. Conception. Work involved in conception of an enterprise is supported with nonrepayable grants-in-aid, toward expenses for necessary studies (market scope, technical feasibility, etc.) and for certification of operations management. The assistance covers 75% of these expenses up to 45,000 DM maximum. The enterprise need not yet be established during this phase. Phase II. Development. The enterprise must have been established and its founders must be fully devoted to carrying out the development plan. Also during this phase they are assisted with nonrepayable grants-in-aid covering up to 80% of the expenses, but not exceeding the 800,000 DM maximum. A marketable product should be ready at the end of this phase. Phase III. Marketing. During this phase the BMFT can underwrite TOU loans. The maximum amount of such a loan is twice the large as a concurrent loan from a Home Loan Bank, but will not exceed the 500,000 DM maximum. These loans do not require a collateral and are not subject to an interest markup so that the rate of interest on them is 3% below the market rate. 3. Implementation of Support The application for support of an enterprise establishment is informally submitted to a TOU-Project carrier. The application must include a brochure containing all ideas and describing essential facts about the proposed enterprise. Following an examination of these brochure (which takes about four weeks), the TOU-Project carriers coordinate with the applicants the further enterprise conception procedure. This includes a time schedule, requirements for phase-I assistance, key items in the conception work, etc. After completion of the conception work (within about six months), the application can be submitted for phase-II assistance. A decision by the BMFT is then reached within six weeks. Following the development phase (2-3 years), the enterprise concept is to be checked out and prepared for realization. Enterprises often require a second round of financial support, for preparation of product marketing. When necessary, TOU loans can now be applied for at the German Equalization Bank. 4.
