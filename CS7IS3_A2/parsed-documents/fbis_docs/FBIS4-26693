With respect to intellectual property rights [IPR], the Ministry of the Interior will amend the Copyright Law so that it conforms to specific trade-related regulations in the IPR agreement. As far as our application for GATT membership is concerned, the international community always treats us as a developed country. According to GATT regulations, the Copyright Law should be amended within one year after application has been submitted to join the world trade organization. In other words, the Copyright Law should be amended by 1 January 1996. The most important revisions will be the need for mandatory authorization before foreign works can be translated, and the lease rights of movies. According to Wang Chuan-lu, chairman of the copyright committee, the mandatory need for translation rights authorization in the Copyright Law is based on educational needs. He added that certain writers who cannot find copyright owners can also translate and disseminate their works. While this is not in line with (?GATT) regulations, in reality there has been no application for authorization of translation rights since the Copyright Law went into effect two years ago. The experience in Japan has been that there have been very few applications for authorization of translation rights. This being the case, the effects of the amendment will be limited. As for the lease right, it currently applies only to computer software and audio tapes. The amendment will cover all audio-video products. And movies may not be leased until [word indistinct] authorization from the primary copyright owners. In other words, movies cannot be leased until fees have been paid twice. Consequently the cost of leasing movies will increase by a great margin. Besides this, the amendment's greatest impact will be seen in the substantial broadening of the area which the Copyright Law will protect. In addition to copyright owners in Britain, the United States, and Hong Kong, the copyright of owners in all 114 GATT members must be protected. Foreign works will have to used even more cautiously. This is Hsiao Ching-wei reporting from the Ministry of the Interior.
