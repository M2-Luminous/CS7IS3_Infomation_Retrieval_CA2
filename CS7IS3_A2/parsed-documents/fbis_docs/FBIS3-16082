He said that since the deputies were elected from all population groups they expressed today's public opinion. He reiterated his readiness to actively work with the new parliament for the benefit of Kazakhstan and its multinational populace. He noted that the elections mirrored democracy in Kazakhstan today. "We have not come up to European standards yet, we are on our way to reaching them." He reported that most CSCE observers, including those from France, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Central Asia, had described the voting in Kazakhstan as very democratic. He noted that only some of the CSCE monitors had held "a news conference unknown to us" without waiting for the election outcome. They alleged at the news conference that many irregularities had gone on record at the polls. Such conclusions, in Nazarbayev's opinion, were improper. He reported that 37 parties and movements had taken part in the parliamentary elections in Kazakhstan. Representatives of 12 nationalities were chosen. On the so-called state list of candidates, criticized by international observers most of all, the president remarked that the nominees had been selected on an alternative basis. In his words, the state list featured scientists, lawyers, economists, representatives of different nations and ethnic groups, women, and members of various parties and movements.
