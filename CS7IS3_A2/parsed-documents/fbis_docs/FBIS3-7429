Prince Sirivut's stance surprised observers, who had expected him to follow up on his strong words in Phnom Penh Sunday, when he said the repatriation "is a human rights abuse from some people or Thai authorities.". While Prince Sirivut was holding a one-hour meeting with his Thai counterpart, Prasong Sunsiri, in Geneva the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, condemned the repatriations. Some 25,000 Cambodians poured across the border at Ban Phakkat a week ago to escape fighting over the former Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin, which the Cambodian Government said it seized March 19. Thailand started a three-day operation to repatriate the refugees last Friday, transporting them north to Sap Tali, from where they could cross into what the Thais said was a safe zone in Cambodia. The Thais refused access to independent observers, however, sparking criticism of its handling of the matter. On Monday, Thailand's National Security Council [NSC] said the refugees who fled fighting a week earlier in northwest Cambodia had themselves chosen repatriation to a Khmer Rouge-controlled zone. NSC Deputy Secretary Khachatphai Burutphat told reporters that all 25,000 had moved to a safe zone inside Cambodia opposite the Thai town of Sap Tali. In Geneva, Ogata voiced "deep concern" at the move, saying she feared the refugees, mostly women and children, "could be exposed to the fighting and their lives might be at risk." But Thai Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa dismissed her concern, telling AFP there was "no question of the Thai Government sending them to areas where their lives could be threatened." Speaking to reporters after meeting Prasong, Prince Sirivut said bilateral committees would be set up to handle a whole range of issues, including refugees. Asked repeatedly about the border situation, Prince Sirivut said several times that the committees, to be set up "as soon as possible," would deal with all matters. Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Suwit Simasakun said the two ministers had not even touched on the specific issue of the 25,000 refugees. Government Spokesman Aphisit said the refugee problem had also not been raised when Prince Sirivut met Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. The two sides dealt with framework issues for future relations, he said. In Phnom Penh Sunday, Prince Sirivut has said: "It is not normal that the Thai authorities take this decision to send 25,000 people without security, with nothing we can check." A decidedly upbeat Prince Sirivut said Monday he was pleased the two sides had "resolved a lot of problems today." Cambodia and Thailand "are ready to sit down and to create a legal framework to resolve problems state-to-state. We decided to solve problems in a peaceful way," he said, adding: "We don't want any local people to jeopardize our good relations." In Geneva, Ogata commented that she was "particularly saddened that contrary to early information, (the Thai) government has not allowed these to stay in Thailand until such time as a return in safety and dignity could be worked out by all concerned." Aphisit said Thailand had been forced to act because "we were finding it difficult to provide the necessary assistance keeping them where they were."
