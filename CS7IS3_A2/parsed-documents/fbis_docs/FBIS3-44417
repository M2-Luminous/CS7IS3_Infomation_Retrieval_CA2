The participants maintained: Since the implementation of the overall agricultural development project and the principle for comprehensively improving mountainous areas, water courses, forestry, farmland, and roads and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, the province has noticeably improved agricultural production conditions and the ecological environment, promoted the popularization and application of new varieties and new technologies, and upgraded overall agricultural production capability. In the past five years, 1.879 million mu of medium- and low-yield land, covered in the state-listed development projects, were transformed; 568,000 mu of wasteland suitable to agricultural production were reclaimed; 30,000 mu of grassland were improved; and 207,000 mu of shelter belts were built. Three million mu of key farmland was built in the western part of the province and Chaoyang area. Some medium- and low-yield land of the mountain areas in the eastern part of the province were transformed with the focus on improving the soil's acidity and transforming frozen land. All localities across the province rapidly developed the production of wheat and vegetables, fruit trees, the cattle breeding industry, coastal areas, and beaches. The participants maintained: Although the province has made great achievements in overall agricultural development, some problems still persist that cannot be ignored. Xiao Zuofu set forth six opinions on overall agricultural development to which we should pay attention. First, we should persist in the principle of never ignoring grain production and positively developing a diversified economy. We should focus the overall agricultural development on grain production, ensure a stable improvement in overall grain production, strengthen the construction of agricultural infrastructural facilities, ceaselessly improve agricultural production conditions and agricultural service means, and vigorously develop high-yield, good-quality, and high- efficiency agriculture. Second, we should develop areas on a large scale and stress efficiency of scale. We should persistently make unified plans and arrangements and make reasonable distribution to set up agricultural production bases and comprehensively develop agriculture in line with the orientation of regional economy, commercialization, intensive economy, and modernization; and build the overall agricultural development areas into ones experimenting with the development of high-yield, good-quality, and high- efficiency agriculture; modernized agricultural model areas; and areas advanced towards the target of becoming fairly well-off. Third, we should organize overall agricultural development in line with the requirements of industrialization and coordinate small- scale production with large markets. We should comprehensively develop agriculture in line with the ideology that the government cultivates markets, markets guide production, production meets the demands of markets, support and protection policies, and according to the requirements of industrialization; organize each and every household to engage in decentralized management; develop key industries and key products in line with regional distribution, specialized production, coordinate management, socialized service, and enterprise management; and carry out the cropping-breeding- processing, production-supply-marketing, domestic-and-foreign trade, and agricultural-industrial-commercial production and management system where markets play a leading role, production bases are set up according to market demands, and production bases establish contacts with peasant households. Fourth, we should pay attention to scientific and technological input and persist in high starting points, high standards, high quality, and high efficiency in overall agricultural development. We should try every possible means to try out increasingly more new agrotechnological findings and improved varieties; strengthen technological training; improve the peasants' quality and scientific and technological level; set up areas experimenting with the development of high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture; increase the input of new high-tech and improved varieties; and increase the scientific and technological contents of agriculture. Fifth, we should arrange, in a unified manner, various funds in line with overall agricultural development. We should collect funds from all fronts and increase the input to agriculture. We should define projects according to their efficiency and determine the amount of capital in line with projects. Instead of making equal distribution or dividing the proportion of investment according to conventions, we should select and increase input to areas with high enthusiasm and the guarantee for timely supply and allocation of capital. In regard to the capital input orientation, we should grasp the construction of both infrastructural facilities and key projects so as to make full use of the limited capital. Sixth, we should gradually conduct development in management. So far, some localities have made appropriate achievements by organizing and setting up entities and increasing machines. All localities should positively make explorations, accumulate experiences, and embark on a sound orbit of overall agricultural development. Xiao Zuofu stressed: 1994 is the last year to implement the project to comprehensively develop agriculture on the Liao He plain as well as the first year to work out the next overall agricultural development project and the project for developing Songliao Plain with World Bank loans. Therefore, it is of great importance to achieve this winter and next spring's work. All localities and all departments concerned should firmly grasp the formulation of the overall agricultural development plan. All localities should comprehensively fulfill the tasks for comprehensively developing Liao He plain and attain the desired results by 1 May 1994. Wang Huaiyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, made an important speech at the forum. He particularly stressed the necessity to accurately handle the relationship between industry and agriculture and the relationship between large and medium-sized enterprises and town and township enterprises. In regard to the further development of the rural economy and the overall development of agriculture, he pointed out that in line with the reality of the province, we should work out ways to develop agriculture and elevating agriculture to a new height. A ratio of fifty-fifty exists between urban and rural populations of the province. Our province has more large and medium-sized cities and large industrial enterprises. All this has helped provide a vast market for developing agriculture. We should focus the development of the rural economy on grain production, take the construction of farm and sideline products bases as a starting point, and gain the advantages of large-scale management. Our province has great potential in this regard. Now that foodstuffs and vegetables from the southern areas have entered the markets of the north, it is time to set up large markets in northeast China. Only when there is an ample supply of materials will markets become more brisk. In regard to the overall agricultural development, he stressed that we should achieve the construction of farmland water conservancy projects; pay attention to the development of sea and road transportation and the construction of small towns; and develop roads linking counties with townships and linking townships with villages. With convenient transportation conditions, we are able to promote commodity circulation. We should work out plans to build small towns. Only when small towns are well established and the town and township enterprises relatively concentrated will we be able to achieve big development. In short, Liaoning has great potential for agricultural development. Leaders at various levels should pay attention to agriculture and rural work. So long as we do solid work we will be able to turn expectations into reality. Present at the forum were vice mayors in charge of agricultural work and responsible comrades of the provincial-level departments concerned.
