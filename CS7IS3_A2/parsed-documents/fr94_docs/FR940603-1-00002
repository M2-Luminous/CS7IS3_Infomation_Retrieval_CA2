SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations of the President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) implementing section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act (hereinafter referred to as NEPA or the Act) are applicable to and binding on all agencies of the Federal Government. Pursuant to the CEQ implementing regulations, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is proposing to implement procedures to ensure that its planning and decisionmaking are in accordance with the policies and purposes of NEPA. The CEQ implementing regulations direct that agencies shall include, at a minimum, procedures required by 40 CFR 1501.2(d), 1502.9(c)(3), 1505.1, 1506.6(e), 1507.3(b)(2), and 1508.4. APHIS' proposed procedures would supplant the APHIS Guidelines Concerning Implementation of NEPA Procedures originally published in the Federal Register on August 28, 1979 (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384) and corrections as published in the Federal Register on August 31, 1979 (44 FR 51272&hyph;51274). The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service APHIS, established in 1972 (7 CFR 371.1(a)), is a regulatory and facilitative agency responsible for the protection of plant and animal health. Its mission is to protect American agriculture by providing leadership in ensuring the health, safety, and care of animals and plants, improving agricultural productivity and competitiveness, and contributing to the national economy and public health and safety. APHIS accomplishes this mission by: 1. Excluding exotic plant and animal pests and diseases and noxious weeds. 2. Detecting, monitoring, and managing plant and animal pests and diseases and noxious weeds. 3. Facilitating agricultural imports and exports. 4. Providing for pure, safe, and efficacious veterinary biologics. 5. Protecting the welfare of certain animals. 6. Controlling nuisance mammals and birds. 7. Collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information. 8. Providing scientific and technical services. APHIS' mission is carried out under five functional areas: Pest and disease exclusion. APHIS conducts inspection and quarantine activities at U.S. ports-of-entry to prevent the introduction of exotic animal and plant diseases and pests. APHIS also participates in inspection, survey, and control activities in foreign countries to reinforce its domestic activities. Animal and plant health monitoring. APHIS conducts programs to assess animal and plant health and to detect endemic and exotic diseases and pests. Pest and disease management programs. APHIS carries out or cooperates in programs to: Control and eradicate animal and plant pests and diseases; reduce losses caused by wildlife damage; provide technical assistance to State and local governments, farmer or rancher groups, foundations, and the public; and ensure compliance with interstate movement and other disease and pest control regulations within the jurisdiction of APHIS. Animal care. APHIS conducts regulatory activities that ensure the humane treatment and care of certain animals. Scientific and technical services. APHIS carries out other activities, including the licensing and testing of veterinary biologicals and the development of standards to ensure their safety and effectiveness, diagnostic activities for control and eradication programs, applied research for the development of methods and tools, regulatory oversight to prevent damage and reduce risk, and regulation of imports and exports of terrestrial plants under the Endangered Species Act. APHIS conducts cooperative programs with State and local agencies and organizations and foreign countries to eradicate, manage, or prevent the movement of plant and animal diseases and pests. More than 2,500 exotic insects, plants and animal diseases, weeds, and vertebrate pests have been identified as posing a potentially serious threat to agriculture in the United States. APHIS' inspection and regulatory programs help prevent the introduction into the United States of animal and plant pests and diseases and noxious weeds of foreign origin and the spread of certain established animal and plant pests and diseases and noxious weeds within the country. Although limited inspection and testing activities take place in certain countries of origin, APHIS' port-of-entry inspection and quarantine are the primary line of defense against exotic pests and pathogens. However, notwithstanding these efforts, pests and pathogens occasionally are introduced into the United States. Therefore, in order to comply with NEPA, CEQ, and U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations, we are proposing to establish regulations in 7 CFR by adding a new part 372 (§§372.1 through 372.10) as described below: Section-by-Section Analysis Purpose (Section 372.1) This section would set forth the purpose of the procedures, namely to implement section 102(2) of NEPA by assuring early and adequate consideration of environmental factors in APHIS planning and decisionmaking and by promoting the effective, efficient integration of all relevant environmental requirements under NEPA. This strategy of early and integrated consideration of environmental factors, diligently pursued, will facilitate achieving the requirements of sections 101 and 102(1) as required by 40 CFR 1505.1(a). Designation of Responsible APHIS Official (Section 372.2) This section would designate the Administrator of APHIS, or an agency official to whom the Administrator may formally delegate the task, as the individual responsible for overall review of APHIS' NEPA compliance. Information and Assistance (Section 372.3) This section would provide that information, including the status of studies, and the availability of reference materials, as well as the informal interpretations of APHIS' NEPA procedures and other forms of assistance, will be made available upon request to: Environmental Analysis and Documentation, Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental Protection, APHIS, USDA, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Maryland 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8565; FAX (301) 436&hyph;8669.
