FR940223-0-00031 FR940223-0-00016 Similarly, we are amending subpart L of the regulations, which deals with resources and exclusion of resources under the SSI program, to reflect the above legislation. Specifically, we are amending ยง416.1234 regarding exclusion of Indian lands and, ยง416.1236, which encompasses resource exclusions provided by other statutes. Public Comment A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was published on July 27, 1992 (57 FR 33137). A 60-day comment period was provided. The comment period ended September 25, 1992. We received 9 comments. The comments generally supported the NPRM. We have summarized and responded to the issues raised in the comments below. Comment: Seven commenters expressed concern that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) might begin to apply a $2,000 annual limit to all exclusions of Indian judgment funds and per capita distributions. They stated that the proposed regulations were unclear as to whether ANCSA, as amended by Public Law 100&hyph;241, might adversely affect the SSI benefits of Native Americans other than Alaska natives. Response: ANCSA provides for the exclusion of ANRVC cash to the extent that it does not, in the aggregate, exceed $2,000 per individual per year. The provisions of ANCSA apply only to ANRVC distributions to Alaska Natives. We believe this is clearly explained in the amended regulations at paragraph IV(a) of the appendix to subpart K and at ยง416.1236(a)(10). In accordance with Public Law 97&hyph;458 and Public Law 98&hyph;64, the Secretary totally excludes all judgment fund and per capita distributions made pursuant to those public laws. Comment: One commenter asked why the proposed regulations did not refer to a $2,000 limit for per capita distributions to Indian tribal members other than Alaska Natives, because Public Law 97&hyph;458 appears to include such a limit. Five commenters suggested that instead of applying a $2,000 annual limit on Indian judgment fund and per capita distributions, the Secretary should apply a $2,000 per payment limit, in accordance with Public Law 97&hyph;458 and Public Law 98&hyph;64. Consequently, only Indian judgment funds or per capita distributions in excess of $2,000 per payment would be countable for SSI purposes. Response: There appears to be some confusion over whether, as a result of the proposed regulations, SSA would or could begin to apply a $2,000 exclusion limit to other than ANSCA distributions. SSA never intended to apply a $2,000 limit to such other distributions and these final regulations clearly do not do so. Public Law 97&hyph;458 provides that any Federal or federally assisted program, other than Social Security Act programs, shall not consider Indian judgment funds except for per capita shares in excess of $2,000, as income or resources. However, the statute does not limit the amount of payments that can be excluded under the Social Security Act programs. Public Law 98&hyph;64 does not provide a $2,000 limit on exclusion of funds covered by that statute. Accordingly, for SSI purposes the Secretary excludes from income and resources all judgment fund and per capita distributions made under Public Law 97&hyph;458 and Public Law 98&hyph;64. Comment: One commenter proposed that foster care payments paid to tribal members to help defray the costs of basic needs, and that General Assistance payments from the Bureau of Indian Affairs be excluded from income and resources under the SSI program.
