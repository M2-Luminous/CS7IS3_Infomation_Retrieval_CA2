This comment uttered Tuesday by Sergey Demin, deputy head of administration of Maritime Kray, at the session of the kray Emergency Situations Commission passed somehow unnoticed by those assembled. There is every reason to believe, however, that the next session of the commission may be held under candlelight, and it will be dedicated to precisely which plants will have requisitions placed for pot-belly stoves and what will be used to fuel them. Perhaps publicly for the first time in his life Yuriy Basharov, general director of the Dalenergo joint-stock company, screamed out in front of television cameras and bystanders--"We have reached bottom... We are on the brink of disaster! If we cut off the energy system today, we will not only freeze this winter--we will be living under torchlight for the next two years." Basharov's face turned red as he screamed from the platform. Due to the fact that kray enterprises and city administrations owe Dalenergo over R110 billion for energy used, the Dalenergo people themselves have become debtors and cannot pay for fuel. The required amount is R30-40 billion. As a result, fuel oil has stopped being offloaded at the Maritime Kray thermal power station as of 23 December, and coal in the amounts intended for the kray has stopped being loaded in Eastern Siberia and Southern Yakutia as of 25 December. Reserves of fuel oil on hand are capable of supplying only five to eight days of operation of the heat producers. "If we sweep the coal storehouses clean, the Maritime Kray state regional electric power station will have a supply to last until 1 February, while reserves at the Artem state regional electric power station will last until 10 February," Basharov continued. According to a departmental order with respect to Dalenergo, a timetable for shutting off thermal energy systems of enterprises and residential buildings must be drawn up by 13 January. It would be appropriate under the present situation to compare this timetable with a sentence, the execution of which depends on the resourcefulness of financial specialists and directors of enterprises in debt to Dalenergo. Igor Lebedinets, chairman of the Emergency Situations Commission and deputy head of administration of Maritime Kray, stated unambiguously: "Unless we put R30-40 billion of net assets into circulation right away, we will have to shut off power from residences." In short, use your water and electricity now while you have them. The situation Vladivostok is in looks especially bleak. The municipal enterprise for heating systems owes Dalenergo R15.7 billion, but residential building trusts have not settled their accounts with it. These trusts, in turn, are not receiving money from the city administration. Once again, unfortunately, the leaders of the city and the kray have been unable to find a common language even for such a topic as whether or not their own apartments will go without heat. City mayor Viktor Cherepkov did not attend the Emergency Situations Commission session at all. City manager Vladimir Gilgenberg again tried to argue the matter of putting tax withholdings into the city budget, but Igor Lebedinets did not want to hear any explanations--either from Gilgenberg himself or from the deputy mayors of Vladivostok for finance and economics. Sergey Demin, deputy head of the kray administration for problems of the fuel and energy complex, is to fly to Moscow today, where he will try to secure the receipt of grants promised by the government in the amount of R62.8 billion. At the same time, Demin himself stated: "For Moscow, our regions are remote not by virtue of their designation or distance, but by virtue of their treatment..." Here we can only modify a common saying: Rescue of the freezing is a matter for the freezing themselves...
