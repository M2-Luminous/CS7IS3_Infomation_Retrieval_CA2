The serious events and incidents that have taken place in Guatemala after this signing demand that the URNG General Command address national and international opinion to: Communicate The great satisfaction with having signed the aforementioned agreements, which are the result of an intense and difficult process, and that they offer a solid and viable base for a serious, fair, and in-depth negotiation. [sentence as published] A current General Agreement on Human Rights and its prompt verification concern the urgent needs of the country insofar as it covers the basic demands of Guatemalans and it opens the doors to a new phase in the negotiation process. Full compliance with this agreement creates the necessary conditions for all sectors of society to find solutions to the current problems. That the value of the General Agreement on Human Rights must be evinced through its true implementation and compliance. In addition to the obligations pledged by the parties in signing this document, the right of the entire population to demand its respect and validity becomes legitimate. This agreement has been made possible through our people's heroic toil, the substantial efforts and sacrifice of their organizations, which express, under totally adverse circumstances, their complaints and demands as well as the contribution of those who, understanding this situation, have abided by and supported it. This pivotal agreement was also made possible thanks to the understanding and favorable reception of the international community, which with its statement and support helped advance it. The General Agreement on Human Rights and the timetable agreement cover the entire content of the negotiation. They do not mean an end to the conflict, but they constitute a basic step in a process that calls for the participation and permanent mobilization of all sectors of society to achieve its true and practical significance. Compliance with the General Agreement on Human Rights and the prompt establishment of the agreed verification mechanism by the United Nations constitute the first trial by fire of the process. The first aspect would make no sense in the absence of the second one. Warning Regarding rights and statements that are alarming and highly negative. The heinous assassination of Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez on 1 April is condemnable and, in the context of the signing of a human rights agreement, constitutes a flagrant provocation of Guatemalan society and the international community. The statement by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio immediately following the signing of the General Agreement on Human Rights does not demonstrate his commitment to comply with it, but rather his intention of offering the URNG militants amnesty. This action conveys the existing contradictions, contravenes the negotiation process, and calls into question his political will to conclude a negotiation that will bring a just and democratic peace. The campaign of misinformation and distortion conducted by official and unofficial spokespersons before the signing of the General Agreement on Human Rights, and which continues to flagrantly seek to discredit the URNG--blaming it for actions that have been perpetrated by groups of the Army itself--reveal recalcitrant wills that oppose a fair political solution. Urges and Demands The government of President De Leon Carpio and the Army to comply with the General Agreement on Human Rights, thus returning the support and trust offered by the international community and the national public. That the assassination of the Constitutionality Court president, an action that lies within the jurisdiction and scope of the security forces, where it originated, be cleared up as soon as possible. The threat of imposing a state of exception is part, whatever its true or presumed justification, of a preconceived plan to limit the freedom of expression of civic and popular forces. Therefore, it is inadmissible and condemnable. Fair play in the negotiation process is the fundamental condition for it to evolve. This is why the Army organizations must suspend the psychological war, and the president must not lend himself to maneuvers to discredit the URNG as its main counterpart in the negotiation process. Nothing must be allowed to curtail the expression of Guatemala's civilian sectors. The international community plays a highly significant role in ensuring this freedom, and we urge it to express its solidarity. [Signed] URNG General Staff: Comandante Rolando Moran; Comandante Pablo Monsanto; Comandante Gaspar Ilom; and Carlos Gonzales, secretary General of Guatemalan Labor Party Central Committee.
