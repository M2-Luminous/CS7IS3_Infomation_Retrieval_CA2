The Ministry of Defence tonight refused to comment on the claims that the low-flying missiles, carrying conventional high-explosive warheads, would be placed on all 12 of Britain's Trafalgar class nuclear-attack submarines. The SUNDAY TIMES said the deal, valued at hundreds of millions of pounds, would give a more flexible response to the emergence of powers like Iraq and Iran which do not possess nuclear warheads but could eventually have missiles which could target Britain. Unofficial soundings suggest the deal may get U.S. approval despite current opposition by President Clinton to proliferation of weapons like cruise missiles, according to the paper. It quotes a British source as saying: "This will be a significant boost to our capability outside of Europe."
