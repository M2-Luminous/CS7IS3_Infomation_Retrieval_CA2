[sentence as received] For example, prosecutors in Gdansk are investigating the case of Janusz H. who was arrested last January under the charge of having tried to smuggle half-a-tonne of cocaine aboard a Polish ship "Lublin 2," but they also work to trace all the international ramifications of the case. According to reports obtained by Gdansk prosecutors from U.S. authorities, Janusz H. had earlier been sentenced in the United States for a similar crime to 30 years in jail. In 1985 he was the skipper of a fishing ship "Kuna" and got caught off Florida coast while trying to smuggle 15 tonnes of marijuana. Released earlier and deported to Poland, Janusz H. started his own business as the owner of a Col-Pol-de-Pesca company chiefly preoccupied with trading with Colombia. His interest in doing business with Latin Americans was not incidental. While in a U.S. jail, he had made friends with a Bolivian citizen Pedro Julio B.A. who was serving an 18-year term for cocaine smuggling. This man was seen in Gdynia at the time when Janusz H. was arrested but prosecutors did not manage to gather evidence against him and he was released. Last June, police in Ecuador seized a 10-kg parcel with heroin addressed to Janusz H. in Gdynia, Prosecutor Mariusz Marciniak told PAP.
