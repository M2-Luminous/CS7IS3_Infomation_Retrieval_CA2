According to the sociological data, six percent of the Latvian citizens watched these programmes. As to the Ostankino tv programmes (which are regularly watched by 48 percent of the population in Latvia), they will be broadcast only in the decimetre channel. As a RIA correspondent was told at the Latvian tv centre, the number of the people watching these programmes will thus decrease. This decision has been taken by the Latvian Radio and Television Council which explains it by the Latvian law on television under which only a third of the tv time can be used for the programmes not in the official language, that is, in Russian, to be more precise. According to the chairman of the Latvian Radio and Television Council, all these changes are an experiment and may possibly be revised next year.
