Ldr. [Squadron Leader] Prasong Sunsiri, Democrat Party General Secretary Maj. Gen. Sanan Kachonprasat and PM's [Prime Minister's] Office Minister Sawit Phothiwihok will be going to Rangoon in the coming weeks to discuss joint energy development and water diversion plans with the ruling military junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc). It is anticipated that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will be signed on Thailand's buying natural gas from the Manaban Gasfield that is currently being developed by the multinational oil companies Total CFP (France) and Unocal Corp (USA). These projects are evidently a major component of the Asean "constructive engagement" policy towards the Slorc. A few points and some questions need to be pointed out and asked about the planned gas pipeline, the ceasefires that are currently being discussed between Slorc and the ethnic groups, security issues, the repatriation/relocation of refugees, and the living and labour conditions of villagers in the Ye-Tavoy area through which the gas pipeline will run. These are issues that are very much interrelated, a fact that some parties may not like others to realize. In the past two months most of the 8,000 semi-recognized Mon refugees who have been taking shelter in Thailand for the last 3-4 years have been compelled by Thai authorities to move to a place called Halaukhani. This site is no more than 12 kilometres from a major Slorc army base and is in even closer proximity to the military junta's frontline heavy weapons positions. The Mon, Karen and many others insist that the area that the refugees have been sent to is clearly inside Burma, a claim validated by all but a few recent Thai maps. Some UNHCR officials have said that the site is in a "no-mans-land" on a "very fluid" border, while other officials accept the Thai claim that it is Thai territory. (Incidentally the UNHCR officials say that the ideal secure distance for a refugee settlement is around 50 kilometres from the borders.) The Thai authorities have according to local sources been inconsistent in their claims that the site is in Thai territory although they are currently insistent that it is. Whatever it is, it is vulnerable to attack, and there are many reports in the papers expressing the reluctance of the Mon refugees and leaders about going there. The Mon have used virtually every form of media available to them other than coming out openly -- there have allegedly been personal death threats amongst other threats -- to make plain their concern about the lack of security in Halaukhani. In the context of what they are convinced is a forced repatriation, the Mon have also made their belief very "clear that they are being pressured to agree to a ceasefire so that the (natural gas) pipeline can be built" through the Mon lands. The coerced repatriation into an area where the refugees could be said to be as vulnerable as hostages is clearly one of the forms of pressure that are being brought to bear on the Mon leaders by Thai authorities as they begin the ceasefire negotiations with the notoriously treacherous Slorc regime. The second round of talks between the New Mon State Party (NMSP) and the Slorc began in mid March, just after news reports stated that two Slorc battalions had been deployed in apparent preparation for an attack on the Mon Headquarters at Baho. The talks have now been called off -- and the Mon leadership have more than a little justification for being concerned about the well- being of their kindred -- particularly the almost defenseless refugees at Halaukhani. A source of further worry connected to the gas pipelines is its relationship to the Ye-Tavoy railway on which between 10,000 and 30,000 villagers from the vicinity of the proposed pipeline are being forced to labour under appalling conditions. Testimonies given to journalists and aid workers by people who had escaped the work gangs are consistent with those given in literally hundreds of human rights interviews conducted along the border since the Slorc took power, attest to the pervasive reality of conditions tantamount to worse than slave labour. The villagers who are forced to work from early morning to night are obliged even to provide for all of their own needs including food, medicine, and shelter, and they must also provide their own tools for doing the work of the Slorc. Slorc officials as a matter of course vehemently deny that any human rights violations take place under their governance, they also claim that all labourers are paid. However, the escapees from the railroad construction sites, including several Slorc army defectors, were unanimous that the labourers never got paid. This is also consistent with stories from numerous other sites. The stories of the escapees are of beatings, rapes, deaths from accidents and untreated diseases (such as a dysentry outbreak at the Natkyizin section of the track that different witnesses claim resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people in January) and long hours of gruelling work. The Slorc has denied that the railway has a military purpose, claiming it is for national development and to help the local people. Despite the Rangoon military junta's claims, it's infrastructure development programmes in the area seem designed to increase the speed with which the unusually large numbers of troops who have been brought into the area in the past few years can be deployed. Even the logging concessions granted by the Slorc have served -- by design -- to open up access routes into the most remote parts of the border to the benefit of the Slorc troops. The railway route, which crosses the planned pipeline route a near a place called Kanbaut and which runs parallel to the Ye-Tavoy highway some 7-10 km to the east would form a double barrier to Mon and Karen army units moving from the mountains to the sea. Units caught between the two routes by rapid deployment forces could be easily surrounded and annihilated. Furthermore, long range heavy weapons that could be brought down by rail or the currently-under- repair railway to the disputed territory through which the pipeline is to run would allow the Slorc to shell even the most remote strongholds of the Karen and Mon forces (in which areas it should be noted there are numerous internally displaced people who have not wanted to seek refuge in Thailand.) The development programmes of the military dictatorship in other areas of the country where there are ethnic minorities, have served to help the Slorc consolidate its occupation -- the multi-billion dollar gasfield and pipeline programme could be seen as a strong incentive to the Slorc to make very certain that it controls the area securely. Neither Thailand nor the Western multinational corporations who are investing in the project have any guarantee that the Slorc will not use the extremely brutal methods it has become infamous for, to secure the ground for their profit-making development programme. Part of the process of securing the pipeline route appears to be clearing all inhabitants from anywhere near the sections of the route that are most vulnerable to attack. The villagers who formerly lived in the hills to the east of the Ye-Tavoy road, particularly those in the Zinba stream watershed directly between Kaleinaung and Nat ei taung (Ban I Tong) have all been forcibly relocated into resettlement villages beside the highway where they can be more easily controlled by the Slorc troops. From these places they can also be easily taken to do forced labour duty such as ammunition portering, serving the Burmese troops in their encampments and labouring on the railway or the road. The lands which they have been driven off have been declared "black areas" -- free fire zones for the Slorc troops. This is partially borne out by the Burmese official who said "there are no people left" from the Zinba River to Kaleinaung, leaving one to question what has happened to them. One place other than the resettlement villages (called "strategic hamlets" or "cluster villages" in military parlance) where the villagers have gone to is Thailand. As refugees, they remain in camps such as Da Now See, Pa Yaw and Aung Tha Pyei. Many hundreds of people have fled to the relative safety of Thailand from the railway, and many more are expected to do so as people try to avoid doing murderous second or third work stints. There are reported to be a great many more people who have left their homes to avoid the slave labour who have remained in the "liberated areas" controlled by the NMSP and the Karen National Union (KNU), and where they will probably stay until food shortages or a possible Slorc attack drives them over the border. Reliable local sources say that an average of 20 new asylum seekers per day are coming through just two of the many possible routes into Thailand. It is hard to tell how many have already crossed the border as most of the people who do so will be trying to go deeper into Thailand to join the hundreds of thousands of illegal workers who appear to be better off than those on the border who fear being forcibly repatriated. Obviously there are no guarantees that the people in the camps will not be forced back over the border, especially after the examples of Halaukhani and the recent pushback of people at Pailin on the Cambodian border. For those newly arriving at the border and seeking to stay in the camps there would be a great sense of insecurity as they cannot be sure of being allowed to register as refugees or stay in the refugee camps. Previously the number of refugees allowed to stay in the camps was fixed by the Thais. Thailand's policy on refugees, if there is one, seems to be to keep them from ever feeling secure on Thai soil so that they would rather go back home at the first opportunity -- even if it is still not safe to do so. Thai leaders owe it to their own people not to make deals that will have serious negative repercussions for their nation. In the past, personal interests of leaders have often been put before the national interest, and certainly before the interests of the indigenous peoples and the environment, with a result that lives, cultures, national economies and the environment could be severely destroyed.
