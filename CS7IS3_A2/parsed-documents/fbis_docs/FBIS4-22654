When will you switch the nuclear power plant off? [Vasylchenko] I think that the excitement is not justified. Chernobyl is working more reliably than all other nuclear power plants in Ukraine. [DER SPIEGEL] However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) attests to numerous safety faults... [Vasylchenko] ...only in a press statement that was not, as promised, conveyed to us in advance. However, apart from the known problems, the IAEA inspection team that visited us in March did not ascertain any new faults in the basic design of this reactor in its report. [DER SPIEGEL] The inspectors are warning against difficult working conditions. [Vasylchenko] What is meant by that? I do not know any. [DER SPIEGEL] Last year alone, 150 specialists left the plant, many went to Russia. Your predecessor, a Russian, abandoned his post under mysterious circumstances and disappeared into a sanatorium. [Vasylchenko] We replaced the persons who had left by no-less qualified employees. [DER SPIEGEL] Many experts doubt this. You depend on Russia's spare part deliveries. [Vasylchenko] This is no problem for the power plant. The Russian enterprises would supply everything if only the money were available for it. [DER SPIEGEL] You do not have it. [Vasylchenko] The safety standard is not lower than in other reactors of the same type in Russia and it is even higher in several respects. In no other reactor has so comprehensive work been done to increase safety. [DER SPIEGEL] Nevertheless, compared to other nuclear reactor types, Chernobyl continues to be extremely dangerous. [Vasylchenko] The United States and Germany can afford higher safety standards, while Ukraine can only afford a lower one. This was also laid down in the IAEA documents. If it were switched off, my people would become even poorer. [DER SPIEGEL] The fear of a new catastrophe is unfounded? [Vasylchenko] Those who are alarmed only show that they are not familiar enough with the matter. I worked in Chernobyl before the accident, I have worked there after it from the first day onward, and I am not afraid. [DER SPIEGEL] This sounds very cynical; 2,500 of the workers who were employed there after the melting of the core died; more than 50,000 people have fallen ill. Now IAEA inspectors are fearing a new catastrophe because the sarcophagus has cracks and is in danger of collapsing. [Vasylchenko] According to my assessment, the sarcophagus is no less stable than at the time of its construction. [DER SPIEGEL] Chernobyl covers only 7 percent of the national power demand. Could Ukraine not do without Chernobyl by savings, for example, the installation of counters in apartments and a slight electricity price increase, which is very cheap? [Vasylchenko] If one talks of closing down Chernobyl, one has to talk about closing down all RBMK reactors in Russia and Lithuania. I myself would be very glad if further reactor blocks were built in my city. They would probably be even safer.
