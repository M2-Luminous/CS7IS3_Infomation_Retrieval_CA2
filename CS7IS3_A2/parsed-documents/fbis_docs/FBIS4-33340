This would be Aristide's solution for reinstatement as president, from which post he was unseated in 1991 by a military junta. The news was released today by an international news agency. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim stated that the Brazilian Government feels that the use of force would be an extreme measure. Amorim believes this is a complex question, and one first has to see whether the sanctions applied by the United Nations against the Haitian military yield positive results. He said: [Begin Amorim recording] For the time being, the United Nations, the UN Security Council -- the appropriate body to apply coercive measures -- has renewed and stepped up sanctions against the de facto Haitian Government. I think we have to verify whether these more stringent sanctions are working. Moreover, an armed intervention is a most complex question. It is difficult... [pauses] We acknowledge the legitimate objective of having President Aristide reinstated in office, and we have supported this, but the use of force is something that always inspires caution and needs to be examined with great care.
