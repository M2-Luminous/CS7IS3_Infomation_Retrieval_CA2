The source added that the Salalah meeting was the outcome of a proposal made by the Sultanate of Oman, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, because the four countries were concerned that Yemen not slide into a civil war. The source went on to say that these countries advised the Yemenis and the Yemeni leaders to opt for either confederation or federation, particularly since the merger unity has failed due to doubts, suspicion, and mistrust between the two parties to the merger unity.
