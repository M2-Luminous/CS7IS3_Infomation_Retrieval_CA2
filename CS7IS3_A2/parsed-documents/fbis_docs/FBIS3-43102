Zhmud; UDC 681.316.56:538.61(088.8)] [Abstract] A feasibility of constructing different types of optical memory devices based on interference systems of spatial light scanning with wavelength re-tunable semiconductor injection lasers is examined and an analysis is made of their characteristics. Functioning of these devices is based on the effect of changes in the spatial structure of the interference picture at the output of a multiple-beam Fizo interferometer (FI) with changes in the wavelength of laser which illuminates the interferometer. Optical memory devices with one Fizo interferometer and two crossed FI in the scanning system are discussed. A block diagram of a simple optical memory device with a multiple-beam FI in the scanning system is provided. Problems of constructing memory devices with a super-large capacity are also examined.
