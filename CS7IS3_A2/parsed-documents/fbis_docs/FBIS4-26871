Practice over the past 40 years proves that the five principles of peaceful coexistence conform to the needs of the times and to the reality of world development, and therefore they are winning support and approval from more and more countries and they have become universally accepted basic principles for handling international relations. Advocacy of the five principles of peaceful coexistence was a great beginning in the history of international relations and was a new development of the basic principles of international law in the post-war situation. The basic principles of modern international law came into existence in the bourgeois revolutionary period and were the embodiment of the will of the bourgeoisie. The principle of sovereignty and the spirit of equality they reflected did not take into account the vast numbers of colonies and semi-colonial countries. They served the old international order, which was based on power politics, and had fundamental limitations. Since the Second World War, there have been profound changes in international relations. Following the upsurge of national liberation movements, the vast numbers of Third World countries that had newly won independence went onto the international arena, thus having a great impact on the international order dominated by major powers. In order to safeguard their national independence and develop their national economies, Third World countries opposed all forms of hegemonism and power politics in international relations, called for the establishment of a new form of international relations on the foundation of independence and equality, and hoped for some basic principles to standardize this type of new international relations. Advocacy of the five principles of peaceful coexistence was precisely the reflection of the demand and aspiration. The five principles of peaceful coexistence have developed the spirit of the UN Charter in light of the post-war reality and have concisely and clearly summed up the basic principles that must be observed in modern international relations. They provide that all rights and obligations are premised by the principle of reciprocity and have an equal binding force on countries with different social systems and at different stages of development. Moreover, their content embraces political and economic aspects and form a complete whole. Therefore, we can say that the five principles of peaceful coexistence are a manifesto of Third World countries that call for the establishment of a fair and rational new international order. Their advocacy marked the beginning of a new period in the history of international relations. In past decades, in order to promote the establishment of a new international order, Third World countries have made unremitting efforts, struggles, and great progress, changing the face of post-war international relations to an exceedingly large degree. Since the end of the Second World War, a number of socialist and nationalist countries have appeared, ushering in the coexistence of the two social systems of socialism and capitalism and of socialist, capitalist, and nationalist countries. The advocacy of the five principles of peaceful coexistence and development of the international situation show that peaceful coexistence is not only needed for countries with different social systems, but likewise needed between socialist countries. Only when all countries, despite their power, strength, wealth, ideologies, and social systems respect each other's sovereignty, treat each other equally, and coexist peacefully can the world have lasting peace and prosperity. In light of the new characteristics in the post-war international situation and the new practice in international relations, the five principles of peaceful coexistence have developed into general principles fit for use by all countries, thus greatly enriching and developing the idea of peaceful coexistence. Since the end of the Cold War, the world has had profound changes and is faced with many problems, so upholding the five principles of peaceful coexistence in international relations has greater significance. Mutual respect for sovereignty is the core and foundation of the five principles. The equality of all countries, big and small, the inviolability of territorial integrity, and non-interference in the internal affairs of another country all derive from the principle of sovereignty. The principle of sovereignty is also the cornerstone of the UN Charter. Safeguarding sovereignty and infringing on sovereignty have always been a focal point in international relations. Since the end of the Cold War, international struggles centering on the question of sovereignty have become increasingly conspicuous. Major Western countries, taking advantage of changes in international political and economic relations, pursue "neo-interventionism," advocate that the concept of sovereignty is "outmoded," and that "human rights are superior to sovereignty" in an attempt to achieve the goal of harming the sovereignty of medium and small countries and interfering in the internal affairs of developing countries through playing down the principle of sovereignty. This practice has seriously endangered the normal development of international relations. There is no denying the fact that there have been profound changes in the world's political and economic situations today. Due to the exceedingly speedy development of science and technology, the world has already greatly "shrunk," economic interdependence is increasingly deepening, activities across national borders are getting increasingly brisk, and the common problems faced by humans are increasing. Under the circumstances, it is completely necessary for more extensive cooperation between nations and for the international community to take more common action. For this reason, in safeguarding their own interests, sovereign countries must at the same time consider the interests of other countries and the common interests of humanity. But this does not mean the principle of sovereignty has changed. Under the unfair international order, strong countries always impose their will on weak ones, harming their sovereignty. While advocating such views as sovereignty being "outmoded," major Western powers in fact do not limit their own sovereignty, but only call for limiting the sovereignty of other countries. Today as the economies of the world are getting increasingly integrated, developed countries are not really keen on solving the problem of poverty which has a bearing on the whole world. On the contrary, they are strengthening protection of their own economies and limitations on immigrants. On the other hand, major Western countries often use as an excuse the universal principle of human rights to flagrantly interfere in some developing countries and demand that they accept Western values, social systems, and economic patterns. This practice is in fact a manifestation of power politics under the new post-Cold-War situation. International reality proves that although the international situation is greatly different from in the past, the independence of countries and the equality with which all countries handle international relations still remain unchanged. Sticking to the five principles, safeguarding national sovereignty, and opposing interference in the internal affairs of another country in any form are still very important in guaranteeing the normal development of international relations, in promoting international peace and cooperation, and particularly in protecting the just rights and interests of vast numbers of developing countries. The five principles of peaceful coexistence came into existence at the high tide of the national independence movement in the 1950's. At that time, they mainly stressed independence and sovereignty in national relations, but also applied to the economic field calling for equality and mutual benefits in international economic relations. The economic imbalance between South and North has long been serious, and many developing countries are faced with social turbulence and economic stagnation. There are of course internal reasons for this, but a more important one is the seriously unequal relations in the international economy. The worsening of trade terms, the low prices of primary products, the heavy debt burden, and the prevalence of protectionism and supraeconomic pressure have seriously hampered the economic development of developing countries. Developing countries strongly call for the establishment of a fair and rational new international order. Since the end of the Cold War, the influence of the economic factor on international relations has obviously increased, and therefore upholding mutual respect for sovereignty and the principle of equality and mutual benefit has more conspicuous significance. Today as countries around the world are getting increasingly interdependent and as the global problems they face are increasing, developed countries and developing countries should make concerted efforts and strengthen cooperation and exchanges on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and equality and reciprocity. Only this is beneficial to world peace and development. Due to historical and practical reasons, developed countries have an unshirkable responsibility for narrowing the gap between South and North and improving the unfavorable position of developing countries in the world economy and trade. Developed countries should offer necessary preferential conditions to developing countries in respect to economic aid, technology transfer, and trade, and should completely abandon the incorrect practice of attaching political conditions to trade and economic aid. Since the end of the Cold War, the world has been developing into a multipolar one at an accelerated rate. The five principles will play a bigger role in safeguarding world peace and promoting development. Multipolarization means superpowers can no longer dominate the world. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the strength of the United States as a superpower has relatively weakened and it finds it impossible to maintain "one-power domination." The imbalanced development of the world's politics and economy makes the strength of major powers tend to be balanced. The economic strength and political status of West Europe and Japan are rising. Russia's status in the world's strategic pattern and its influence on world affairs must not be neglected. Some developing countries, especially some large countries and regional groups, have been developing comparatively quickly by seizing the favorable opportunity of the world's economic readjustment and have become an important new force in the multipolar world. The multipolar development of the world's politics and economy offers an historical opportunity and extensive objective foundation for implementing the spirit of the five principles in international relations. The policy of hegemonism and power politics pursued by superpowers will be more strongly opposed. Any practice of disregarding the sovereignty of another country and imposing one's ideology on another is impractical. The current transition of the world's old pattern to a new one has afforded an opportunity for world peace and development. Sticking to the five principles can help resolve problems faced by the world today and establish a fair and rational new international order people have long been looking forward to. Times are progressing and theories have to be developed. Compared with the Cold War period, the present transition period from the old pattern to a new one has many new characteristics and still needs to be understood through practice. However, as basic principles guiding international relations, the five principles of peaceful coexistence still indisputably possess strong vitality.
