Yun Ho-chin, a councilor at the North Korean Embassy in Vienna, represented his country at the two-hour talks, in which the IAEA explained technical details of the need to maintain continuity in surveillance materials in response to the North Korean position conveyed at the first meeting Friday [7 January]. The IAEA presented its explanation and demands to the North Korean side on paper. ``The North Korean representative and the IAEA had a working-level contact to discuss problems of inspection on North Korea's reported nuclear facilities on Monday,'' IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said. ``At the meeting, the IAEA has conveyed technical requirements (for the inspection) to the North Korean side.'' Meyer declined to disclose further information. One IAEA source said, however, the IAEA action means that there are differences of opinion on the scope of the inspection on North Korea's seven reported nuclear facilities. Practical problems such as dispatch of the inspection team could be discussed only after the two sides agree on the scope of the inspection, the source said, requesting anonymity. At Friday's meeting, North Korea told the IAEA that it would not accept inspection of two sites, a radiochemical laboratory that is in effect a nuclear reprocessing facility and a 5-megawatt reactor, another IAEA source said. As a result, the two sides are standing far apart as the IAEA demands opening of those two facilities as well, the source said. Spokesman David Kyd, meanwhile, said that the IAEA does not expect immediate progress in the problem of inspection on two unreported sites believed to be nuclear waste storage facilities. The two sides are expected to resume their talks this week.
