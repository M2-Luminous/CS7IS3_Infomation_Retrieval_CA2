Although huge co-operative potential exists, the so-called regional "economic bloc" still remains just a theory, said Lu Nanquan, secretary general of the China Society of Eastern European and Central Asian Studies. He made the remark at a recent symposium on co-operation between China and neighbouring Asian countries, in which some 50 scholars took part. The detente following the 40-year Cold War provides Northeast Asian countries with a solid external atmosphere for economic co-operation, said Lu. And the development of regional economic blocs in other parts of the world, such as the European Union and North American Free Trade Agreement, provides great inspiration, Lu added. In the broader sense, Northeast Asia includes Northeast China, Russia's Far East, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the Republic of Korea (ROK), Japan and Mongolia. Market economies now dominate the region and economic development is the priority here. Bilateral trade between the neighbouring countries has been active in recent years. For example, the trade volume between China and the ROK reached $8.9 billion last year, and that between China and Russia totalled $7.2 billion, up by 24 per cent over the previous year. Meanwhile, economic co-operation between Japan and Russia, and between the ROK and DPRK, has also seen steady growth. "These factors form a solid basis for the booming economic co- operation between nations in the region," said Lu. Potential Northeast Asia boasts a sound economic foundation and rich national resources, which hold great potential for the further development of the region. The United Nations Development Programme has decided to invest $30 billion in the next 20 years in the Tumen River Project, which should give a boost to relations among Northeast Asian countries. The fact that Northeast Asia includes developed and developing countries facilitates co-operation in capital, technology and natural resources, said Lu, adding that this also provides opportunities for the flow of labour and products. However, Lu admitted that it was difficult to push into being the theoretically-sound economic bloc. The Cold War has overshadowed the region for so long and with such an intensity that it is a demanding job to integrate the economic group, Lu said. Countries of the region are miles apart in political and economic systems, making it hard to eliminate ideological and military conflicts quickly. He also pointed out that Japan's attitude to creating a new economic nexus is key, as it is the biggest potential investor in the region. Unfortunately, its militant history brings many doubts to further co-operation in the Northeast Asian region. Economically, Japan is adjusting its strategy, shifting its investment focus from North America and Europe to Asia. Within Asia, Japan's emphasis will move from the Southeast to the Northeast. The adjustment, however, takes time due to the cycle of investment returns, said Lu. He predicted that economic co-operation in the region will spread from trade to manufacturing and technology, starting with bilateral relations before turning in a multilateral direction. Small economic co-operative zones will likely emerge first to form a basis for the development of the whole bloc, Lu added. Another influential power to the booming economic group is the United States, Lu said at the symposium. Although America is far away from Northeast Asia, it has a great impact in the region, especially on the Korean Peninsula. Interests The United States is eager to protect its political and economic interests in the region, which determines its willingness to become involved in projects here, said Lu. Judith Thornton, a professor with the University of Washington in Seattle, shared Lu's view, saying the U.S. sees itself as an active participant in and beneficiary of Asian economic growth. Seen from the economic point of view, the American scholar said, U.S. involvement in the Asian-Pacific market stems mainly from the self-interested actions of American exporters and importers, borrowers and investors participating in the fast-growing economic development. She also pointed out that the potential areas of economic co-operation lie in infrastructure construction, including transport, telecommunications and energy. Major ports in the region like Dalian, Vladivostok, Nakhodka, and Vostochniy have the potential to serve as a gateway to the heartland of Asia and Siberia. The Tumen River Project would encourage joint efforts by Russia and China to build transport links. And it is just as likely that expansion of China's transport network will be competitive with the Eurasian Continental Bridge, said Thornton. A pipeline carrying natural gas from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to Central China will be constructed to bring the oil and gas of Sakhalin to Central China, South Korea and Japan. The pipeline is expected to be funded by Japanese lenders or other international financial organizations such the World Bank and Asian Investment Bank. East Siberia contains significant energy supplies including oil, gas and hydroelectric. Further development of the energy sector will fuel the economic growth of the region.
