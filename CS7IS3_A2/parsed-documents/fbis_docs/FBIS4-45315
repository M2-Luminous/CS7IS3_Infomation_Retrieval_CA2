Dr Zeenat Naquatee said a Kashmiri youth had been trapped by terrorists. "I know of drugs being distributed from mosques to recruit boys," she said. "One youth is made an addict and he is told he will get the drug if he recruits ten others. Narco-terrorism is a fact of life in parts of the Kashmir Valley," Dr Naquatee who is from Srinagar, said. "Many among the youth had gone insane. They can't believe what they have done," she added. Dr Naquatee, who is here for a Commonwealth Youth Conference, was speaking to journalists yesterday. She said youths had been taken across the border with promises of jobs and money. "They have been forced to write letters saying all is well with them" she said. "But when the truth has come home, these turned out to be horror stories," she said. She said now many Kashmiri Muslims are fleeing the Valley to escape forced recruitment by terrorists. The youth are getting disillusioned with terrorism, she said. "So foreigners are coming from Afghanistan, Sudan and Pakistan. These people are now killing Kashmiris in Kashmir" Dr Naquatee said. She said "the terrorists speak of a freedom struggle. (But) did Indians kill Indians when they were struggling for freedom?" She said the terrorists have brought problems for everyone. "It's dark in our homes. We can't go out. We don't know when firing, killing will happen," she said. Talking about women, Dr Naquatee said they have become the worst victims of terrorism in the State. But she regretted that nobody is talking about the human rights of women. "Women have no freedom of action or movement, no education, no medical care. Women have seen their sons snatched away to join terrorists, their husbands forced to give money at gunpoint," she said. There have been too many "forced marriages," she said, adding that everyone knows about these. "For whose independence are the terrorists fighting? For that of terrorists trained across the border? Independence movements come from the people and not from a handful of trained terrorists," she said. The world had seen movements against Communism. India had seen its independence struggle. "These movements came from the people who did not need to be trained across any border," Dr Naquatee said. Dr Naquatee said the real problem was in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK). "Unlike us, people there do not know what democracy means" she said. Kashmiris had a peaceful alliance with India, she said. "Otherwise people would have called Sheikh Abdullah a traitor" she said. Pakistan was killing Kashmiris in the name of Islam and within Pakistan was dividing Muslims among themselves, she alleged. Within Kashmir, she said, the majority did not want Pakistan. "The trouble in any case is only in three or four districts within Jammu and Kashmir," she said. Terrorists would oppose elections because the gun has given them power she said. "When they want money, when they want something done by a bureaucrat, when they want something from a shop, they get it at gunpoint," she said. But people wanted elections, she said. "People need someone they can go and talk to, someone who will back them," she said. "The majority is being ordered around by a minority with guns," she said. She said the people were caught between the terrorists and the security forces. But the trouble had been started by terrorists, she said. "The security forces have been there since 1947. They have been protecting us since then. We had no problem with them all these years," she said. The security forces have a problem in identifying terrorists, she said. "If there had been no sponsored terrorism, there would have been no excesses," Dr Naquatee said.
