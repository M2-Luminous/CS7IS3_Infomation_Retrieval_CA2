Joining deputies from Shanxi Province in a discussion during the current session of the National People's Congress, Li said that Shanxi has played and will continue to play an important role in the national economic development. He noted that Shanxi supplies over 200 million tons of coal to other parts of China each year. Coal mines run by townships and villages produce over half of the provincial coal output. The small coal mines have made contributions to the nation. "It is necessary to support small coal mines, accelerate their technical upgrading, strengthen their safe production and turn them into modernized or semi-modernized enterprises," he said. On difficulties of state-owned enterprises, he said that solving problems of major state-owned enterprises is a vital but difficult issue in the current reform. The central authorities have decided to make continuous investigations in and study on this issue, which cannot be solved in one or two years or by adopting merely the joint-stock system. The invigoration of state-owned enterprises will depend mainly on technical progress and the production of marketable goods. He also talked about building water conservancy projects to solve water shortages in Shanxi and about assisting the province's poor areas to develop their economies.
