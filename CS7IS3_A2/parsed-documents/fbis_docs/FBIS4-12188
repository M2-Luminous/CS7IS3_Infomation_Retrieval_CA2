The source regretted the unjustified confusion and anxiety that those incorrect reports have caused among the public. The source indicated that although those meetings did not emerge with the results that all Yemenis had looked forward to, they did help stress the need to abide by the pledge and accord document and to swiftly implement the decisions that the Council of Ministers made during its meetings in the economic and trade capital [Aden], especially regarding security and military issues.
