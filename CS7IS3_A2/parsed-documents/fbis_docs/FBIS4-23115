FBIS TRENDS-20JUN94-RUSSIA-UKRAINE BSF Officers Contest Sevastopol Mayoral Post BSF Officers Contest Sevastopol Mayoral Post Former and current Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) officers have reportedly entered the 26 June election for the city council chairman seat in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol (Krasnaya Zvezda, 4 June). While the chances of any of the BSF officers winning appear slim (Interfax, 9 June), their candidacies nevertheless could further exacerbate Russian-Ukrainian and Crimean-Ukrainian tensions by fueling Ukrainian suspicions of Russian meddling in Krym (Crimea). BSF officer candidacies appear to be an effort to secure a stronger voice for BSF interests in the running of Sevastopol, the fleet's main basing facility. The registered candidates reportedly include Reserve Admiral Aleksey Kalinin, former BSF commander, Colonel Aleksey Melnikov, deputy head of BSF air force communications, and Rear Admiral Aleksandr Penkin, deputy BSF commander (Krasnaya Zvezda, 4 June).
