In the chapter on the Asia-Pacific region, the book says, "During the past few years, Asia witnessed the end of the Cold War not once, but twice: the end of the antagonism between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union." For the United States, Is Improving its Relations With China More Important Than Dealing With North Korea's Nuclear Issue? The two events that marked the end of the Cold War brought about a breakaway from ideology and a relaxation of international friction. As a result, countries have begun to grope for new relations based on "economics." "This trend is even trying to normalize U.S.-Chinese diplomatic relations, despite the long dispute between the two countries over human rights and exports of Chinese-made weapons and ammunition," said a Mr. Harding [name as published], a researcher at the Brookings Institute. On May 27, the day after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced his decision to renew China's most-favored-nation trade status, while breaking the link between human rights and trade, a meeting was held in New York by the Asia Society. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was invited to the meeting to give a lecture entitled "The Future of the United States and the Asia-Pacific." Although he first pointed out "the U.S. policy toward Asia is confronted with three pressing issues: the new development of the situation in China, North Korea's nuclear program, and the improvement of U.S.-Japan economic relations," he spent most of his time explaining the importance of strengthening U.S.-Chinese relations. As for Japan, he merely referred to it in connection with the North Korean issue. Once the establishment of new international relations based on "economics" becomes the main trend of the times following the decline of power politics, this inevitably brings on a change in the psychological distance that exists between different countries: a once-distant nation may suddenly emerge as a close nation, and vice versa. In other words, this is the beginning of a "new shifting of nations." The remarkable advance being made by U.S. firms in China and other Asian nations is a good example. A New World Called China General Electric Co., which is said to be the bellwether of U.S. business management, was the first to go into action. In the autumn of 1992, General Electric established its Asian headquarters in Hong Kong to supervise the region covering China, Southeast Asia, and India in line with the strategy of Chairman John F. Welch to "draw a demarcation line between Japan and the rest of Asia." In the case of American Telephone & Telegraph Co., the chief executive officer in charge of China was stationed in Beijing, while the CEO in charge of Southeast Asia was posted in Hong Kong. If we look at how U.S.-Japan relations and U.S.-China relations changed in 1991, the year marked by the collapse of the Soviet Union, and in the following year of 1992, we can assess the psychological distance between the United States and China. In 1992, the total hours' duration of telephone calls made from the United States to China grew by 87.2 percent from a year earlier, while telephone calls made from the United States to Japan grew by only 14 percent. Concerning the total amount of direct investment in China on a contract basis, the United States moved quickly ahead of Japan in 1992. The movement to convert government-controlled economies into market economies has spread throughout the world as another consequence of the end of the Cold War. In the early 1980s, Nomura Securities Co. exerted overwhelming influence on the Chinese market. Well before the Tiananmen Incident, then-General Secretary Zhao Ziyang of the Chinese Communist Party had asked Masanori Ito to explain the Japanese capital market to him. At that time, Ito, who is now a senior advisor to Nomura Securities, was in charge of carrying out Nomura's policy toward China. Zhao had also asked American, British, and German experts to explain how matters stand in their own countries. Later, Zhao questioned Ito: "Given that Japan, the United States, Britain, and Germany are all capitalist nations, why do they have different systems?" According to Ito, "Chinese people were eager to follow the example of Japan, as they are also an Asian people." Japan Is Left Out in the Cold However, what Ito said is now a thing of the past. The fact is that China seems to have chosen the United States as its model. In 1993, Merrill Lynch & Company Inc. helped list Chinese companies' shares on the New York Stock Exchange. When its chief executive officer, Daniel P. Tully, went to China in March 1994 for the opening of its Beijing office, Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng directly asked him for assistance and advice in financial business. Meanwhile, a total of 22 Chinese companies are planning to list their shares on overseas stock exchanges after this summer. Many of them have already appointed U.S.-affiliated securities firms as their lead underwriters. "If we remain idle, the entire world market will be Americanized," said senior managing director Katsuya Takanashi of Nomura Securities, with great anxiety. This spring, the Tokyo Stock Exchange sent delegates to China after it realized that an overseas listing boom was on among Chinese companies. However, since China decided to follow the example of the United States, there were no companies willing to list their shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The number of foreign issues listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which reached its peak of 127 in 1991, is expected to decline to 97 by the end of June, as many U.S. companies, such as General Motors Corp., are delisting one after the other. The closedness of the Japanese capital market is cited by the U.S. side as a cause of foreign delistings. However, if Japan considers the recent move by U.S. companies to be merely a result of the trade friction between Japan and the United States, there is a possibility that Japan might be left out of the worldwide trend toward market economies. If the United States is really determined to give consideration to economic interests before fundamental rules, with its President acting as a "vehicle," Japan, which has always viewed the world through the United States, will certainly become bankrupt in policy. To avoid such a situation, Japan had better begin reviewing its relations with the United States, based on a simple viewpoint that, after all, the United States of today is a "nation that changes its relations with other nations eaasily."
