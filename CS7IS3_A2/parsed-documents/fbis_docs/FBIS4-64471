In mid-April Basis Research was commissioned by FOCUS to conduct a poll of 1,000 western Germans and 500 eastern Germans about their opinion on the FDP and its representatives. The results are almost devastating. The reputation of the FDP has plummeted together with Ministers Klaus Kinkel, Guenter Rexrodt, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, Karl-Hans Laermann, and Irmgard Schwaetzer to unprecedented levels in the party's history. A total of 80 percent of those polled are "completely," "largely," or "partly" of the view that the FDP is by far not what it used to be. Even though the liberals in Kohl's Cabinet are known to most people (with the exception of Education Minister Laermann), they are not convincing. On an approval scale of -\5 to +\5, the 1,500 people polled gave only Klaus Kinkel a relatively acceptable popularity value with +\1.5. His three colleagues (Irmgard Schwaetzer was not included in the poll) had to content themselves with +\0.5 to +\0.7. A little better but hardly glorious are the marks for material competence. Here the foreign minister receives +\1.9, the economics minister +\1.2, and the education minister +\0.9. Right at the bottom: the justice minister with +\0.7. Even among those voters who voted for the FDP the displeasure with the party leadership cannot be ignored. They mainly complain that the range of personalities in the FDP has deteriorated and that the party lacks politicians such as Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Otto Count Lambsdorff. Another result of the FOCUS poll, which was held when the FDP had not yet made the coalition statement for the benefit of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, is also sensational: A total of 68 percent of those polled criticized the fact that the decision had not yet been made, and 85 percent were either completely or partly in favor of the FDP committing itself to the same partner at the federal and at the land level. Despite this criticism, which is depressing for the FDP, two-thirds of those polled believe that the FDP will enter the Bundestag again.
