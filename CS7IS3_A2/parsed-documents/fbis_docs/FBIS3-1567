The center, which is located on the second floor of a building on the East 40th Street, was decorated with lanterns and colorful streamers and was permeated with laughter this evening. The get-together sponsored by PWC members from Hong Kong opened at 1830 [1030 GMT] under the chairmanship of Zhu Youlin, a PWC member from Hong Kong, and Ni Ping, a celebrated presenter from China Central Television. After PWC Vice Chairman An Zijie gave a welcoming speech, Premier Li Peng gave an extemporaneous speech. He said he was very glad to be able to join PWC members from Hong Kong in marking the Lantern Festival, and he wished all PWC members good health, successful careers, and happiness for their families. Speaking on the current situation in Hong Kong, Li Peng said: The China today is not the China of more than 150 years ago. Today, China's political situation is stable, its economy is developing, and we are full of confidence in the future of our motherland. He said: No matter what may happen, the Chinese Government's determination to reinstate its sovereignty over Hong Kong will not change, and Hong Kong certainly will witness a stable transition of political power and long-term prosperity and stability. Under the current circumstances, Li Peng said, the PWC's burdens and responsibilities have become even heavier and greater. He urged all PWC members to work harder and make even greater contributions to Hong Kong's long-standing stability and prosperity and the motherland's prosperity. The 50 or so PWC members from Hong Kong and China, members of its secretariat, and friends from the press watched a brilliant performance given by literary and art workers in the capital. The pleasure-filled get-together, which lasted more than two hours, reached a climax when Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Office, and Fang-huang Jiwen, a PWC member from Hong Kong, sang the songs "I Am A Chinese" and "Tomorrow Will Be Even Better."
