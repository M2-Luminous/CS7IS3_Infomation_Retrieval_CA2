In agriculture spending, member states counted 1,298 cases of fraud, at a cost totalling ECU248.3 million. In the rest of the budget, 1,001 cases of fraud were uncovered costing ECU145.9 million. The European Union budget for 1993 was ECU73.4 billion, half of which was devoted to agricultural spending. "The frauds are more and more sophsiticated and more and more refined with the help of new technology," Schmidhuber said. The commissioner said international criminal organisations had started operating against the Union and were escaping serious punishments because of a lack of cooperation among the member states. The Union needs to improve its policing of the spending it agrees to, Schmidhuber said. "We depend too much on chance. We need to create links between our data banks and concentrate our efforts on the largest types of fraud," he said. The Commission is going ask the Council of Ministers to agree to write community fraud into their countries' domestic legislation, with tough punishments those found guilty of committing the frauds. Agriculture Commissioner Rene Steichen has already compiled a "blacklist" of firms found guilty of defrauding EU agricultural spending. Britain on Wednesday put forward a similar proposal to the justice and interior ministers meeting in Brussels. Legislation is going to be simplified to reduce the possibilities for agricultural frauds, the EU comissioner said. The Commission will also set up, for a trial period, a free telephone number for people to call in with information relating to frauds. Rewards would not be offered, Schmidhuber said.
