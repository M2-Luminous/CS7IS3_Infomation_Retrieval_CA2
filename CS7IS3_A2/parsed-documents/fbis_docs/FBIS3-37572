In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday following the talks with Russian officials that ended last week, Samadov said that Tajikistan "is destined to success only with Russia." He said that Russian troops and the troops of other CIS states on the Tajik-Afghan border are a "powerful stabilising factor." Russia's presence in Tajikistan has helped avert "a large-scale armed interference of militants from Afghanistan into Tajikistan." Speaking about the prospects for normalising the situation in the republic, the premier called for intensifying the political dialogue, including with representatives of the opposition who are seeking to restore peace in Tajikistan. "This should be done as soon as possible without setting any dates or preliminary conditions. This process should involve international organisations, primarily the United Nations, Russia and Central Asian republics," Samadov said. "Our government is ready to take the necessary steps to begin the process." He stressed that his government "is ready for a dialogue with those who favour democratic development of Tajikistan." "Without any preliminary conditions we need to reach an understanding on joining our efforts to promote complex political, economic and social integration processes that are under way in Tajikistan this year," the premier said. Asked if Tajikistan plans to sell raw uranium to Arab states and Iran, Samadov replied that "I am sure that the process of selling uranium made in the republic, which is being monitored by respective international organisations, will proceed in the same way as it has been proceeding until today. I state that any attempts to link Tajikistan with countries seeking to involve it in the development of their uranium programmes are doomed. The exception is the countries with which we have steady relations in this field, primarily Russia. These attempts are doomed politically too." Commenting on the situation in the Central Asian region, Samadov pointed out to Tajikistan's relations with neighbouring Uzbekistan. "Our government has put inter-state relations, if we speak about the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Republic of Tajikistan, on a constructive basis, the basis of mutual understanding of specific problems and the assessment of the substantial assistance provided by the Republic of Uzbekistan at the period of hardships in 1992-1993," the premier said. "I feel responsible for building such a system of economic and political relations which would ensure that the assistance and support we have received will be returned, but without damaging our own interests and with due account of the circumstances in this or that republic," Samadov said. "As for the Tajik and Uzbek people, I am sure that considering the centuries-old historic ties that have been established on the vast expanses of Central Asia, these relations cannot be other than peaceful and all attempts to provoke an aggravation of these relations will be checked," the prime minister stressed.
