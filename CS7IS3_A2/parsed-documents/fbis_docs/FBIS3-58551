Active combat elements as well as military specialists were among the 5,000. It was reported that the military personnel assigned by Turkey have been distributed on the fronts. It was also learned that, in tandem with the counterattack launched by the Azerbaijani Army, three commando battalions of the Ground Forces have been deployed on the borders with Armenia. It is being reported that the Azerbaijani units have had successful military operations over the last 10 days. It is being claimed that the specialists and personnel sent from Turkey had a role in the success of the Azerbaijani units on the Fizulinskiy, Mardakertskiy, Goradiz, and Agdamskiy fronts. When Geydar Aliyev first came to power in Azerbaijan, the services of the Turkish personnel were discontinued, and subsequently some of them had returned to Turkey. However, new personnel were dispatched to Azerbaijan following the resolution of differences with the Aliyev administration. It was claimed at the time that most of the Special Warfare elements sent to Azerbaijan to help the People's Front gain power were pro-Turkes. When Aliyev came to power, Nationalist Action Party leader Alparslan Turkes' control over Azerbaijan collapsed and his son Tugrul Turkes had no other choice but to return to Turkey.
