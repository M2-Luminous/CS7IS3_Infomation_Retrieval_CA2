The local government election law does not correspond to the party's program that supports the franchise of all residents, Vovks said. Commeting on the League of Stateless Persons, Vovk said it had no rights to represent all 700,000 non-citizens of Latvia in the local elections as it wanted to do. The Democratic Initiative Center would endorse a popular referendum on citizenship proposing a five year residence qualification, language skills and knowledge of basic principles of Constitution as terms for naturalization, Vovks said. Vovks conceded that he did not believe that Latvian citizens would support DIC version for the country's citizenship law. But he said the party would still demand a referendum to bring the citizenship problem in the focus of popular attention. DIC was founded in 1989. It has a membership of 53 now.
