Their official name is "Turk-islam Federasyonu" or "Belcika Turk-islam Kultur Dernekleri Federasyonu," which can be translated as "Turkish-Islamic Federation" or "Federation of Turkish-Islamic Cultural Associations of Belgium." The Belgian headquarters of this federation is in Beringen, and its European headquarters are in Frankfurt. It is also supported actively at international level by the Turkish Government, which denies this, as might be expected. As an extremely dangerous extreme right movement, it is an avatar of Colonel Alparslan Turkes' fascist nationalist party. Highly active in the late 1970's and 1980's, its members specialized in guerilla warfare and the murder of progressive politicians. They also engaged in heroin trafficking in order to finance their activities. However, they are even better known for their direct involvement in the failed attempt against Pope John-Paul II in May 1981. If we are to believe the Turkish daily, MILLIYET, the person who fired the shots in Saint Peter's square in Rome, Ali Agca, was allegedly harbored for a while with the Belgian representative of the "Gray Wolves," Selahattin Saygin, in Maasmechelen. Do the "Gray Wolves" also benefit in Belgium from the relative leniency of the Turkish authorities? Of course: In 1986, during the third conference of "Gray Wolves" of Belgium, the fundamentalist Turkish newspaper, DUSUNCE, reported that apart from Selahattin Saygin, the Turkish consul from Antwerp, Feyha Enc, and the Turkish minister of health, Halil Sivgin, also appeared at the podium. Belgium is also used by the "Gray Wolves" for heroin trafficking. This information has already been published several times in LE SOIR, but it should again be pointed out that one of the "Gray Wolves'" most famous activists, Oral Celik, alias Bedri Ates (borrowed name), was arrested on 10 November 1986 in Halluin by the French customs authorities, while leaving our country with 3.6 kg of heroin. Concealed under a false identity, he has since admitted that he was indeed the extreme right activist fingered by his fellow terrorist, Ali Agca. Further evidence of the criminal activity of the "Gray Wolves" in Belgium was the presence in September 1990 in the Liege suburbs of Ahmet Esensoy, who was involved in heroin trafficking and was the right-hand man of Rifat Yildirim, one of the most famous "Gray Wolves" terrorists. Esensoy, who has since been apprehended, was in transit. A generally reliable source says that there are allegedly comings and goings between Belgium and the Frankfurt "city bazaar," the preferred spot of the "Gray Wolves."
