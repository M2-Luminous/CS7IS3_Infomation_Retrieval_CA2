[Lissouba] I saw the blow coming. I instructed my close associates to go to the IMF and the World Bank and convince them how tragic the decision would be if unaccompanied by serious measures, by a sort of Marshall Plan in order to cushion, even annul, its bad effects. [Kpatinde] Africa is marginalized we increasingly hear. [Lissouba] It is not marginalized, it is ignored. It does not exist. We noticed this during the GATT negotiations. We realized it recently again with the devaluation of the CFA franc. [Kpatinde] Who is to blame? [Lissouba] It is difficult to lay blame. Although I am an African, I do not systematically attribute the mistakes to others. Why accuse others if we always kowtow to others and if we prefer to dance to imported music? The day Africans say: "Certainly, each of us has a fatherland, but our future depends on a coherent, rigorous, and integrated Africa, a thoughtful Africa," they will find the solution to their problems. For instance, there was an average of 10 deaths each day in Angola before independence. Today this figure is multiplied by 100. Who is to blame? Are those who tell the different factions: "Take up arms and fight," or are the Angolans themselves to blame? Congolese wanted democracy fervently. Why have some chosen today to hide from the reality rather than help in consolidating the freedom we won at such a high price? [Kpatinde] The devaluation of the CFA franc was expected for two or three years yet the Dakar decision seemed to surprise most of your peers. [Lissouba] Two or three years? You are lenient: We were expecting it for at least 10 years, but the relative growth and our riches -- such as oil in Congo -- and artifice enabled us to dodge the debate for a long time. The economic crisis has brought us down to earth. The system on which the CFA franc was based began to crumble. Africa is no longer as attractive as before. Its indebtedness has assumed proportions that weighed on the common foundation. The French themselves have too many problems to continue keeping our coffers afloat. [Kpatinde] Since devaluation was inevitable the heads of state should have worked out counter measures. [Lissouba] The continuity of the state has obliged me to assume the mistakes of those who preceded me. What could we have done? To act would have required the help of the OAU or much more solid and interdependent regional institutions. The financial crisis in which these institutions are struggling does not enable us to reflect on such fundamental issues as devaluation and creation of a new currency. [Kpatinde] The creation of such a currency, by the way, has been planned. [Lissouba] Look at the disaster around us. We have resisted better only because we remained within the franc zone. Despite all its shortcomings, the CFA franc remains a stable currency that feeds a parallel sector and does not cause much inflation. The CFA franc has not basically destabilized our economies as in the case of the cedi (Ghana), the naira (Nigeria), or the zaire today. We could have obtained better results in our zone but because of political instability we have not concentrated on the main thing these past decades. Power went from one hand to the other. Today, it is Peter, the next day it is Paul. How can we think about long-term development under these conditions? [Kpatinde] Are you for or against the devaluation? [Lissouba] You do not need to put the question that way. When it rains, you do not ask yourself whether or not you like the downpour. The devaluation could not be avoided and it has simply come into effect. [Kpatinde] What must be done to offset its negative effects? [Lissouba] If one could afford to dream, and if our partners really wanted to help us, I should say that indeed a real Marshall Plan needed to be put in place for Africa. In any case, backup measures are necessary in at least two areas: foreign debt obligations and equipment costs. All our debts must be canceled because we are not responsible for them and very often they are based on shady contracts. No doubt it will never be known precisely what has been done with all these loans which we have seemingly contracted. Equipment costs vital to our industrialization should not be prohibitive. Otherwise, a bowl of rice will become a luxury for the less privileged among us. [passage omitted] [Kpatinde] French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin recently had the occasion to appreciate your leadership qualities... [Lissouba] "Alliance with a more powerful person than yourself has some disadvantage" and according to La Fontaine "might is always right." The fact that a minister from a superpower country considers that he has more rights than the president of a small republic clearly illustrates the fight between the iron pot and the earthenware. If you want to be respected you must first start by respecting others. Shady deals are not rare in France either and the CANARD ENCHAINE [a French newspaper] is quite generous about revealing them... [Kpatinde] What is the point of disagreement between you and the French Government? [Lissouba] Believe me, I am most surprised about France's hostility to me. I went to France for the first time at age 14 and stayed there till I was 32 and I think I have adopted the culture of that country. I am a man with a unique personality and cannot be a mere replica of the French. However, I am far from nourishing the idea of threatening French interests in Congo because it is France which inspired me spiritually. We are able to subsist today, thanks to the resources we draw from oil which we are incapable of tapping from the ocean bottom apparently by using our own intelligence. I am not ashamed to say that it is France's creative genius that provides for our livelihood today. I deplore this to some degree but it is a reality which I admit. [Kpatinde] Maybe people wanted to test how much you love France? [Lissouba] I had to make pledges and give guarantees. I had to prove that I will not attack in any way the interests of those helping us. [Kpatinde] The law which concedes to Elf company the marketing of all the crude oil from the Nkossa deposit is among these pledges.... [Lissouba] This law was initiated by me and it was passed last December. My message was devoid of any ambiguity: "We guarantee you your interests, guarantee us peace and safe life!" Not my own life, but those of my people and of all the innocent persons who die needlessly every day. [Kpatinde] What is the exact nature of the concessions made to Elf? [Lissouba] The term "concessions" is not appropriate. Under the agreements signed with the companies operating in Congo, a quota of the oil production should go to us, and this should be payable in cash or in kind. To receive payment in kind, we just need to inform our partners at least six months before hand. As a good Cartesian, I thought by notifying our partners three years before hand I was within the stipulated time. I made the decision to give a notice of three years in advance and to sell by anticipation to another company, namely Oxy, the quota that should normally go to Congo out of the Nkossa deposit. That is all. Our French partners reacted for reasons which one can easily understand: "Why should you give your quota to other people apart from us? After all, Oxy could prospect for oil as we do." That is sheer logic. In the face of these reserves, we asked Oxy to prospect for oil instead of buying oil already prospected and exploited by others. [Kpatinde] Are you condemning the agreement signed in April 1993 with Oxy? [Lissouba] Let us say that the wording of the contract is now slightly different. With a permit, Oxy can now operate peacefully. A quota of the oil explored will go that company; the remainder will be for us. Although the former permits granted are maintained, in the future the rule to determine an equitable sharing of the production quota will be strictly adhered to. [Kpatinde] So, Oxy will no longer use -- as initially agreed to -- Congo's quota of Brent oil from the Nkossa deposit? [Lissouba] Exactly. The law passed in December extending Elf's high sea exploration has put an end to that eventuality. I will not sell Nkossa oil to Oxy. At the beginning, I thought it would be simple, but the logic our French partners was another matter. Let me say that we could have settled this matter in a more amicable way. [Kpatinde] According to LETTRE DU SUD, a confidential bulletin published in Paris, you granted Oxy all Congo's oil quotas.... [Lissouba] These are allegations. When I was elected in August 1992, Elf and Agip were controlling 90 percent of our oil production. We are currently drafting a law on hydrocarbons that will us to double or even triple the number of our partners in a few years. Why would we give all our assets to one partner at a time we are trying to find more partners? [Kpatinde] Who will your future partners be? [Lissouba] We are currently negotiating with Shell. Oxy will intervene on Marine XI and Marine XII, and will fill in the vacancy left by Amoco which wishes to withdraw. I repeat that Oxy will operate on the sites with its own means and not buy oil exploited by others. Total and other smaller companies are also competing. [Kpatinde] Why was the law by which you granted Elf exclusive rights to the commercialization of the Nkossa Brent oil voted on twice by Parliament? [Lissouba] There were some minor problems in the dealing between the Presidency and the ministries concerned. Those in charge had forgotten to include the amendments I made in the first draft. These omissions were amended and the law was voted on in emergency session as stipulated in the Constitution. It was nothing very serious in fact, as it was just to replace the word "sold" by "commercialized." [Kpatinde] So, you signed a peace of the brave with Elf? [Lissouba] If you want to call it that, only we were not at war, at least as far as I am concerned. I maintained right from the beginning that in no way were Elf's interests threatened. What else should we do if not manage our own interests while taking into account the interests of others, and ask for the royalties needed to modernize our country? Our discussions with Elf are going on and we will come to an agreement.... [Kpatinde] Not so long ago, there were rumors of a coup d'etat in Brazzaville.... [Lissouba] I came to power not in a coup d'etat but in line with a procedure set up and agreed upon by all Congolese, including the military, who pledged to abide by the democratic institutions: free, contested, and transparent elections. I have no fear of any coup. [Kpatinde] Who was plotting against you? [Lissouba] The practice of coup d'etat is a bad habit inherited from the past. In democracy, power is not conquered with guns; it belongs to the National Assembly elected at the polls. So let us allow those nostalgic for the past to adjust to the new era. One day, they will finally leave their guns in the closet. [passage omitted] [Kpatinde] How do you explain the violence that is currently rampant in Brazzaville? [Lissouba] First of all, it is due to acculturation. When you teach people that power lies in the use of force, what do you expect from them except to take up arms and attack the Presidency instead of waiting for the next election? [Kpatinde] Will the current lull in violence last in Brazzaville? [Lissouba] Like all human actions, this lull cannot be separated from the general situation that has prevailed in Congo for a year now. What do we see? The domination of individual interests over the general interest and the stubbornness of those who are determined to take power at all costs, even bloodshed, thus endangering this lull. We will come out of it with a spiritual awakening and we will return to our old values if we reinforce the security of our people. We have to reinforce security in all ways, especially by offering development to our people and improving their prospects. [passage omitted] [Kpatinde] What do you think is behind this sudden lull? [Lissouba] Certain facts became clear to the people. For a start, the people were losing out in the fratricidal clashes, which led to loss of life and property. The cause of the disturbances is unclear. Some people, like the former head of state, say they were due to the lack of security following the 3 November shooting, which led to three deaths. This shooting, however, took place at a time when the single party system was in charge of all security. The government set up in September 1992 was overthrown less than two months later following a vote of no confidence. It did not, therefore, have the time to examine any documents, much less even provide the least amount of security. Statements by former leaders made the whole country consider what was going on and understand that all violence was part of the thinking that "the one who has the gun wields the power," an idea which is very dear to Marxists. [Kpatinde] Will you maintain your policy of holding out a hand to the opposition now that you have won a clear election victory, which has been confirmed by an international arbitration body? [Lissouba] I did not wait for the arbitrations body's verdict before making statements that would rally the people round. In any case, the true question is what price Congo is prepared to pay to consolidate peace. [Kpatinde] People accuse you of selecting all your aides from Nibolek, your native region.... [Lissouba] At the Science Faculty in Brazzaville, I taught hundreds of students without considering their regional or ethnic origin. Why would I change my attitude now? That is an unfair accusation. Most of those students are currently unemployed and are waiting to be trained to continue the job. I hope to create a pan- African institute of innovation management for them in Pointe-Noire. Whoever wants to obtain a position of authority should go to the institute to be trained in decentralization, management, communication... [Kpatinde] It has, however, been observed that all your aides are from the same region. [Lissouba] Because of the crisis, which has been going on for two years, it is difficult to find the best aides. At first, I recruited professionals from my opponents' group, but their only distinguishing characteristic was their vanity. Upon reflection, I told myself that they were of no use to me and were likely to cause more problems. [passage omitted] [Kpatinde] You spoke of a "political initiative" recently. Do you intend to involve your leading opponent, Bernard Kolelas, in government? [Lissouba] When I returned to Congo after several years in exile, I went to see my brother Kolelas at his home in Bacongo to make political suggestions. Even though I am the older one, I took the initiative to visit him at home. So far, he has not given me any response but the current disorder. There are no suggestions I can make he does not know of already. [Kpatinde] So, Kolelas will not be your next prime minister. [Lissouba] I could not do that even if I wanted to. The Constitution stipulates that the prime minister must be chosen from the parliamentary majority at the National Assembly. [passage omitted] [Kpatinde] One might have thought he would be minister of state in a national unity government. [Lissouba] A government of national unity is not a government of political parties. During the formation of the first government, I invited to Brazzaville some professionals close to the opposition whose contribution I wanted. After consulting their leadership, they declined my offer. [Kpatinde] Would you rather have Kolelas heading the Brazzaville City Council? [Lissouba] He does not need me. All I have been doing is to encourage him to take the City Council. His party has the largest number of municipal councillors in the capital. For Brazzaville, one is talking of 700,000 inhabitants, that is a third of the population of Congo. Well, Kolelas must show his ability to lead a third of Congo! He could set up a municipal police force to protect all Brazzaville residents, without exception. Brazzaville, as a cosmopolitan capital, must not be the hostage of one ethnic group. [Kpatinde] There is talk of two moderate opposition figures, Jean-Pierre Thystere Tchicaya and Justin Lekoundzou, entering the government. [Lissouba] I know the former, who is my junior, better than the latter. Both are very capable, but in politics, ulterior motives are never far off. [Kpatinde] In mid-November, you expelled the Radio France Internationale (RFI) correspondent.... [Lissouba] This lady was often mistaken about Congo. I believe that my country, no matter how poor it is, has to preserve its honor. To be an RFI journalist does not mean that one is above everything, that one can drag our name in the mud with impunity. We have too much respect for our ancestors and our culture to close our eyes to that. [Kpatinde] What exactly do you accuse her of? [Lissouba] I shall limit myself to two examples: She said on the air that there was a curfew in Brazzaville; this was false. She also said that the airport was closed to traffic; this too was false. When her misconduct came to my attention, I asked the interior minister and his foreign affairs counterpart to meet her and ask her to be more objective. We were not asking her to take our side, just to stop fabricating stories. She concluded from this that she was the brightest star in the heavens. [Kpatinde] Where do your relations with Israel stand? Are they limited to security matters? Did you really conclude a "multimillion dollar" contract with the Israelis? [Lissouba] Congo restored its ties with Israel in 1991, through a resolution of the National Conference. We operated in line with existing accords. We are faced with a savage urban guerrilla force and we were defenseless against the atrocities they committed before, which could start again at any time. Congo, it should be pointed out, has 14,000 soldiers and security personnel, of whom only 4,000 are enlisted men. It does not have any units specially trained to combat urban guerrillas. This shortcoming prompted us, when faced with the violence prevailing in our country for more than a year now, to put in place within the shortest possible time a specialized unit by using the know-how of other countries, particularly Israel. Such know-how must be paid for. This is the cost of our security. The most important thing is not the cost, but the expected efficiency. We are prepared to pay the necessary price for it.
