Do you agree with this description? [Lafourcade] Obviously, Gen. Germanos is speaking of our current deployment. It is always a difficult period because we are setting up a large force 8,000 km away from France, and you must understand that there are grounds for concern in an operation of this nature. That being said, let me tell you that everything is going well -- you can see this for yourself. The UN resolution was adopted last Wednesday [22 June], I believe. It is now Sunday, and more than 1,000 soldiers and 120 vehicles have arrived here. [Duquesne] Does this mean that this is only the start of the operation, that you are carrying out reconnaissance missions in Rwandan territory, and that you feel that the situation might prove delicate for yourself and for your soldiers? [Lafourcade] We immediately got in touch with the population in a difficult situation in Rwanda, with refugee camps, although our deployment is not even fully achieved. I believe that this decision was the right one, since we have already been able to reassure many refugees in a number of camps without going too far into the north or the south of Rwanda. [Duquesne] A last question. You are arriving in a region controlled by government forces, where there are many Hutus. It is known that many Tutsis or moderate Hutus have been murdered. Don't you feel that you are coming a little late? [Lafourcade] I will answer you like a soldier: A decision was made on Wednesday evening and there are already 1,000 soldiers four days later; I believe I am not too late. [Duquesne] You were quick, but politically, wasn't it too late? [Lafourcade] I should tell you that this is not my problem. I believe that our political negotiators who were behind this resolution wanted to ensure that the killings would be ended before the arrival of UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] II.
