I. Purpose and Substantive Description A. Authority This competition is authorized under the Community Outreach Partnership Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 5307 note; hereafter referred to as the ``COPC Act''). The COPC Act is contained in section 851 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992). Section 801(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 provides for a $7.5 million set-aside for each year of the 5-year demonstration authorized in the COPC Act. (The funds appropriated by Congress for FY 1993 were rescinded by the 1993 Supplemental Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 103&hyph;50, approved July 2, 1993.) B. Allocation and Form of Award The competition in this NOFA is for $7.0 million to fund the first year of the Community Outreach Partnership Centers (COPC) Program authorized as indicated above. An additional $500,000 will be used to fund the first year of the National Clearinghouse mandated by section 851(j) of the COPC Act. A separate announcement will be issued at a later date for the National Clearinghouse. Each grant made under the COPC program will be for a maximum two year period of performance. The maximum size of any grant will be $750,000, while the minimum will be $250,000. Each applicant must submit an application within this range. In future years, successful applicants will have to compete for funds with all other applicants. C. Description of Competition The Congress has mandated that the Department carry out ``a 5-year demonstration to determine the feasibility of facilitating partnerships between institutions of higher education and communities to solve urban problems through research, outreach and the exchange of information.'' The COPC Act stipulates that grants are to go to public and private institutions of higher education to establish and operate Community Outreach Partnership Centers (COPC). These centers shall: ``(a) Conduct competent and qualified research and investigation on theoretical or practical problems in large and small cities; and (B) Facilitate partnerships and outreach activities between institutions of higher education, local communities, and local governments to address urban problems.'' The specific problems that grants under the COPC program must focus on are ``problems associated with housing, economic development, neighborhood revitalization, infrastructure, health care, job training, education, crime prevention, planning, community organizing, and other areas deemed appropriate by the Secretary.'' Furthermore, the COPC Act states: ``The Secretary shall give preference to institutions of higher education that undertake research and outreach activities by bringing together knowledge and expertise in the various social science and technical disciplines that relate to urban problems.'' It is clear from the statutory language quoted above, and the program requirements and selection criteria detailed below, that Congress intended that COPC be multi-disciplined, combine research with outreach, work with communities and local governments and address the multi-dimensional problems that beset urban areas. To be most effective during the term of the demonstration, the assisted research must have a clear near-term potential for solving specific significant urban problems. The selected institutions must have the capacity to apply their research results and to work with communities and local institutions, including neighborhood groups, in applying research results to specific real-life urban problems, including design of comprehensive strategies and consolidated housing and community development plans to resolve these problems. D. Eligible Applicants Applicants for this competition must be public or private nonprofit institutions of higher education granting four year degrees and accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education. A consortium of institutions may be part of any application, but one institution must be designated as the legal applicant. Finally, each institution may be part of only one consortium or submit only one application, although the application can include various schools within the institution. E. Program Requirements Grantees must meet the following program requirements: 1. Responsibilities. Each Center shall: (a) Employ the research and outreach resources of its sponsoring institution of higher education to solve specific urban problems identified by communities served by the Center; (b) Establish outreach activities in areas identified in the grant application as the communities to be served; (c) Establish a community advisory committee comprised of representatives of local institutions and residents of the communities to be served to assist in identifying local needs and advise on the development and implementation of strategies to address those issues; (d) Coordinate outreach activities in communities to be served by the Center; (e) Facilitate public service projects in the communities served by the Center;
