FR941025-1-00025 FR941025-1-00006 From its review of burn injury data, the Commission estimates that on average, about 1,150 children were treated each year in hospital emergency rooms for burn injuries associated with clothing of all types during the period from 1980 through 1993. Of that total, the Commission estimates that each year, about 90 burn injuries to children were associated with sleepwear, about 860 were associated with day wear, and about 200 were associated with other types of clothing or unspecified types of clothing (10). From available data, the Commission estimates that virtually no infants younger than one year old were treated in hospital emergency rooms for burn injuries associated with clothing. The Commission also found that most thermal burn injuries associated with sleepwear involved females, whereas most burn injuries associated with daywear involved males. Thermal burn injuries from nightwear were usually associated with nightgowns or pajamas that probably were not tight-fitting (10). This review of information about burn deaths and injuries associated with children's clothing suggests that the children's sleepwear standards in their current form may cover certain garments which do not present an unreasonable risk of burn deaths or injuries: specifically, sleepwear garments for infants younger than one year of age, and some tight-fitting sleepwear garments for children ranging in age from one to about fifteen years old. This information also indicates that notwithstanding the existence of mandatory flammability requirements for children's sleepwear for more than 20 years, burn injuries to children continue to be associated with sleepwear, particularly nightgowns and pajamas (10). For this reason, the Commission concludes that the injury data do not support revocation of the children's sleepwear standards in their entirety. Finally, from this review of information about burn deaths and injuries, the Commission is unable to identify other specific types of children's clothing which may present an unreasonable risk of burn deaths or injuries. For this reason, the Commission is unable to find support from the injury data for extension of the requirements of the children's sleepwear standards to other types of children's garments. 2. Can the Protection Afforded to Children by the Sleepwear Standards Be Maintained if Garments in Infant Sizes and Tight-Fitting Garments Are Exempted From the Standards? This question is the principal issue raised by the ANPR and was the subject of many comments. In order to address this issue, the Commission must also consider its correlative: To what extent have the sleepwear standards prevented burn deaths and injuries to children? After careful consideration of the events leading to issuance of the children's sleepwear standards and all available information about burn injuries and deaths associated with children's sleepwear, the Commission is not able to estimate quantitatively the number of burn deaths and injuries which may have been avoided because of the requirements of those standards. Statistically projectable data are not available about the numbers of deaths and burn injuries associated with children's sleepwear before the issuance of the standard for sizes 0 through 6X (6). Data compiled by the Commission show a measurable reduction in burn deaths and injuries associated with all types of clothing, including children's sleepwear, during the past 20 years (6). However, as many commenters observed, the household environment has also changed during that time period. The number of persons who smoke cigarettes has declined, contributing to a reduction in the number of lighters and matches in the nation's households (6), (14). Voluntary standards have been issued or revised to address many sources of ignition in the household, including gas-fueled ranges and space heaters and kerosene heaters. As noted in the ANPR, sales of both gas-fueled ranges and kerosene heaters have declined in recent years (4). After considering all available information, the Commission has reason to believe that the children's sleepwear standards have contributed to the general decline in burn deaths and injuries associated with clothing, but cannot quantitatively assess the extent of that contribution. a. Can Sleepwear Garments for Infants Be Exempted From the Standard for Sizes 0 Through 6X Without Reducing the Level of Protection That Standard Provides? Many comments urge the Commission to exempt sleepwear garments intended to be worn by infants younger than one year old from the requirements of the standard. These comments observe that infants who are not capable of moving by themselves are not at risk of exposing their clothing to an ignition source (6). Another group of comments opposes exempting garments in infant sizes. These comments state that the Commission considered and rejected such an exemption in 1978. Other comments opposed to such an exemption state that sleepwear garments for infants are not labeled to specify the age of the intended wearer, but rather the body measurements of the intended wearer (6).
