When coal is burned to generate electric power, CO[.sub]2[/] released accounts for 60 percent of the total greenhouse gases. According to the article on "Global Climate Change and Development of China's Energy Resources" published by Zhu Bin [2612 2430] in ENERGY OF CHINA (No 5, 1993) [See JPRS-CEN-93-010, 5 Nov 93, pp 23-27], although China ranks third in total CO[.sub]2[/] discharge -- behind the United States and the former Soviet Union -- China's total CO[.sub]2[/] released by coal-burning ranks top among the three countries. By using Zhu Bin's method, a bar chart demonstrating China's future CO[.sub]2[/] emission is shown in Figure 2 below. Shadowed areas are CO[.sub]2[/] released by power-generating plants, which accounts for 35 percent of total CO[.sub]2[/] emission. Figure 2. Future CO[.sub]2[/] Emission in China According to information provided in the article on "Transaction on Energy Conversion" published in IEEE [1992.7(2)], which stated that if, for the power plants, Superconducting Magnetism Energy Storage (SMES) is used to replace oil-fired or gas-burning units of 1 percent of total installed capacity, CO[.sub]2[/] emission will be reduced by 1.6 percent. If SMES is used to replace 1 percent of the coal-fired units in China, then CO[.sub]2[/] emissions could be further reduced by 2.4 percent or more. Table 1 shows predicted data of gradual decrease of CO[.sub]2[/] emission resulting from gradual replacement of oil-fired and gas-burning units by SMES in China. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

If China fails to do so, it will again lag behind other nations in the area of electric power construction.
