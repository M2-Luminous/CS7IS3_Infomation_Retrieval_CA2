Taking part in the work of the Collegium were O.N. Soskovets, first deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers-Russian Federation Government, V.B. Yefimov, Russian Federation minister of Transport, S.K. Shoygu, chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee on Civil Defense Affairs, Emergency Situations and Clearing Up the Consequences of Natural Calamities, B.N. Burachenko, chief of the Department of Transport, Communication and Social Infrastructure of the RF Council, corporation presidents V.A. Brezhnev of Transstroy and V.M. Nalivayko of Transmash, a number of other representatives of the government, joint-stock and commercial structures involved in railroad transport work, and also members of the RF MPS Collegium, chiefs of RF MPS roads, administrations and departments, authorized representatives of the RF MPS in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Poland and Finland, directors of a number of the sector's railroad divisions, enterprises, associations, scientific-research institutes and higher learning institutions, and representatives of the road committees of the trade union for all the railroads. I.A. Shinkevich, L.B. Titova, V.S. Myshenkov and Yu.A. Sokhin, from the Central Committee of the Independent Trade Union of Railroad Workers and Transport Construction Workers, were in attendance. G.M. Fadeyev, RF minister of Railways, chaired the Collegium meeting and gave a report. O.N. Soskovets, first deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers-Russian Federation Government spoke at the meeting. It was noted in the main report and the reports of the speakers that putting into practice the Program To Ensure the Stable Work and Economic Stability of Railroad Transport in 1993, drawn up at the expanded MPS Collegium in December 1992, mobilizing intra-sectorial reserves and state support made it possible for the sector in general to achieve the priority tasks of providing for the transport needs of the country's people and economy. Unified technological and administrative relations with the railroads of the CIS and Baltic countries were retained. In 1993, passenger turnover was 273 billion passenger-km, i.e., 7.8 percent higher than the level of the past year, and 1,346 million tonnes of freight were shipped (30.7 million tonnes over the plan). The level of fulfilling the train traffic schedule and the static load per railcar rose, other indicators of rolling stock use were improved, and the operations contingent of workers was reduced. The program for protection of the social and economic interests of the railroad workers was successfully put into effect. The Sectorial Tariff Agreement between the Russian Federation Government, the Ministry of Railways and the Independent Trade Union of Railroad Workers and Transport Construction Workers was on the whole fulfilled. The profit for the railroad transport enterprises for 1993 was about 1.3 trillion rubles [R]. At the same time, this year the sector constantly found itself in a difficult financial position, primarily because of the insolvency of the consignors, which often interfered with prompt payment of wages and made it impossible to renovate rolling stock properly or completely satisfy the demands for repair of technical devices. By the end of 1993, the consignors and consignees owed over R1 trillion for the transport performed. A number of railroads made by no means full use of internal reserves, often maintained an excessively inflated operations staff and fleet of tractive rolling stock and railcars for the transport volume being fulfilled, and did not show the proper persistence with respect to a policy of fuel-energy resource conservation. Quite a few miscalculations were made in vocational training and placement of personnel, and also in reinforcing technological and executive discipline, which in some cases led to gross violation of traffic safety rules, accidents and wrecks. Most of the railroads failed to take exhaustive measures to recover debts from consignors and consignees for transport fulfilled, which put the sector in a very difficult financial position. The collegium devoted its main attention to discussing the financial-economic situation in the sector. The report by the RF MPS minister and virtually all the speeches of those taking part in the conference touched on these problems to a greater or lesser extent. As a result, the Program of Action of the MPS, Railroads and Other Railroad Transport Enterprises To Develop Reforms and Strengthen the Sector's Financial-Economic Situation in 1994-1995 was drawn up and approved. It was proposed that all production collectives expand organizational work to carry it out, considering the milestones and indicators outlined in it to be the minimum necessary to strengthen the economy of the railroads of Russia and other enterprises of the sector. The Collegium resolved that preparation be made and the stage-type transition to a contractual form of interrelations with the customers be completed in the first six months of 1994. In accordance with an edict of the President of the Russian Federation, when concluding contracts, fixed payment periods for transport are to be established, a flexible tariff policy, based on economic expediency under specific conditions is to be followed, tariffs are to be differentiated according to the type of freight, and the appropriate rebates are to be offered. Naturally, if the payment deadlines are violated, the consignors will be deprived of rebates and other benefits, applying to the full the economic responsibility measure established by the corresponding decree of the Council of Ministers-Russian Federation Government. Methodological instructions on the procedure for calculating the economic expediency of using a flexible tariff policy for each transport operation under specific conditions (business plan) are slated to be worked out and sent to the railroads before 1 February 1994. In the 1st quarter of 1994, additions to the appropriate articles of the Railroad Charter, pertaining to the introduction of the contract form of interrelations between the railroad workers and consignors and consignees, are to be submitted to the Council of Ministers-Russian Federation Government for approval. The competitiveness of railroad transport is to be increased on the basis of carrying out flexible tariff regulation for international transport and raising the throughput and processing capacities of the border stations and the quality of information and dispatch services. At the same time, freight should be accepted for international transport service only on condition of pre-payment of the impending transport services. The Collegium devoted particular attention to debit indebtedness. As we know, this is one of the main reasons for the tension arising in the sector's financial situation. To reduce it, in January-February 1994, special subdivisions will be created at the RF MPS, railroads and divisions, which will deal with offsetting mutual debts between railroad transport enterprises, as well as those of the enterprises of other sectors of industry. In this case they will first start clearing off the debts of the MPS enterprises for fuel-energy resources. In addition, in the 1st quarter of 1994, other structures are to be created at the MPS and on the railroads to implement clearing accounts for the debts of customers, including through obtaining their products with subsequent sale on domestic and foreign markets and using promissory notes in clearing accounts with freight owners. At the same time, the railroads are permitted to increase the established limit of advance financing, if the assignments for the transit railroads and the MPS to transfer funds are fulfilled. A procedure will be worked out in the near future for settlements with the railroads for sums exceeding their advance financing limit. In order to ensure the comprehensive development of railroad transport as a unified production system, the Collegium accepted the proposals of the railroads, plants and other enterprises and organizations of the sector to form the following centralized funds and reserves in the RF Ministry of Railways to finance general sectorial expenditures: --a railroad transport investment fund to acquire specific types of rolling stock and finance a number of construction projects and facilities of general sectorial importance, needed to support and develop the sector's material-technical base; --a fund to support railroad transport educational institutions, in the amount of 0.3 percent of the revenues; --a fund to support central public health institutions for the sector, in the amount of 0.2 percent of the revenues; --a financial reserve for the RF MPS, in the amount of 1.5 percent of the balance profit; --a fund to finance NIOKR [scientific-research and experimental-design work] of a general sectorial nature, in the amount of 1.5 percent of the revenues. In the 1st quarter of 1994, the level of the norm for withholdings for the RF MPS investment fund will be submitted to the RF Ministry of the Economy and RF Ministry of Finance for approval. In addition, the Statute on Education and Use of the Fund for Support of Public Health Institutions of the RF MPS is to be updated and submitted for approval. In 1994-1995, a unified all-network automatic accounting and statistical information transmission system must be set up. This will require revision of the list and volume of sectorial statistical reporting, and rescinding of obsolete indicators. The time has come to form a unified banking system for the sector. Today, along with powerful, viable financial institutions, small-scale institutions, capable of serving, for example, the needs of only one depot, are often set up at transport enterprises. Determining the main directions for the development of the banking system, drawing freight owners into the service of this system, and also attracting the savings of railroad transport workers and the people are, therefore, very urgent tasks. The organization of bank branches on railroad divisions is to be completed in the first half of 1994. Ensuring a further rise in the level of passenger transport organization is one of the priority tasks of railroad transport. Under the conditions of the unprecedented rise in prices for air, sea, river and motor vehicle travel, the railroads often become the only affordable means of transport for the population. Because of this, railroad workers should devote priority attention to the problems of satisfying the people's demand for passenger, freight and baggage transport, improving the standards of service to passengers at terminals and on the trains and keeping to the schedule of passenger train runs. We must nevertheless also remember the factor of economy in this transport. For 1994-1995, therefore, differentiated indexing of tariffs is specified for long-distance passenger transport, based on the category of trains and railcars. This indexing is called upon to ensure that, in 1995, transport shows no loss, and after that, shows a profit. Similar measures are outlined in suburban traffic, by agreement with local bodies. In this connection, it is recommended that the chiefs of railroads and divisions continually work with local organs of authority and freight owners to regulate local taxation, establish tariffs for electric power and allocate funds to finance suburban transport and acquire rolling stock, build railroad facilities, and provide for other needs. It was also proposed that, on a monthly schedule in 1994, the need for routine and capital repair of technical devices, based on the transport work actually performed, be precisely defined. After this, in accordance with the normative requirements, the allocation of the necessary resources is to be specified in the plans, and no demands for maintaining technical devices for transport may be put off. It is time for the roads to examine the organization of material-technical support for line enterprises and to take measures to reinstate supervisory monitoring of the supply of materials and spare parts. The Collegium adopted a resolution to improve the plan for scientific-research and experimental-design work in 1994, drawn up by the RF MPS and approved by the railroads. Guided by the Strategy for Scientific-Technical Policy Under the New Conditions of Railroad Transport Work, adopted at the expanded session of the Presidium of the NTS [Scientific-Technical Council] of the RF MPS, it recommended that, when necessary, creative scientific-production groups of specialists be formed to draw up priority proposals ensuring the development of reforms in railroad transport. In the 1st quarter of 1994, proposals will be prepared concerning the idea of improving the system of tariffs for freight and passenger railroad transport under market conditions, which outlines specification of the form of addressed state support of railroad transport enterprises and the sectors served by them, and also the necessary volume of investments from the republic budget in the development of railroad transport, which should be taken into consideration in determining the tariff level. Because of the reduction in the network's work volume in certain railroad regions, a disproportion has formed between the rolling stock fleets required for operational needs and the surplus fleets. To bring them into line, it has been specified that the surplus fleet of railcars and locomotives be taken out of operation, by removing from the inventory, in 1994, 50,000 railcars which have worked out their service life; that the railcars on the roads and at industrial enterprises of the sector be divided up; that spare parts, after reconditioning, be sent to supplement the working technological reserve, and wheelpairs with rolling axle-boxes be used to replace wheelpairs with plain-bearing axle boxes. It was decided to transfer, during 1994, 100,000 railcars to the long-term MPS reserve, carrying out their appropriate preparation and mothballing, and determining the storage sites which should be equipped with lighting, fire-fighting devices and other measures to be fulfilled for the purpose of ensuring the safeguarding of this rolling stock. Here it was established that in distributing among the roads the expenditures for depot and capital repair and updating the freight cars, their depreciation, and also payment for exceeding the quota of the railcar fleet indicated as a reserve, not be taken into account. At the same time, changes must be introduced into the system of statistical accounting and reporting for the freight car fleet. Some of the locomotives will also be transferred to the MPS reserve, with ensurance of their mothballing and placement at reserve bases or station and siding tracks specially equipped for this purpose. Each road should establish a maximum norm for maintaining locomotives in the reserve of the road administration to cover the daily fluctuations of transport work, but not over 10 percent. Guided by the Basic Directions for Work on Fuel and Power Conservation in Railroad Transport Under the Conditions of Liberalization of Prices for Energy Carriers, adopted by the Presidium of the NTS MPS, it was designated that specific details be given for the work of the fuel-energy commissions for line enterprises of the divisions and roads, directing their efforts primarily toward expanding the list of specific norms per unit of work or output and increasing accounting and monitoring of the use of energy resources. It was decided to boost the introduction of resource and energy saving technology, reconditioning and reinforcing of parts for repeated use, mechanization of work places, non-dismantling diagnostics, and a reduction in the wearing out of rails and wheel flanges in 1994 on the Far Eastern, Transbaykal, October and Krasnoyarsk railroads, in 1995 -- on the Sverdlovsk, Gorkiy and Southeastern railroads, and in 1996 -- on the rest of the country's mainlines. Safety is a very important problem in transport. To improve the state of traffic safety, particularly that of passenger trains, the following are to be ensured in 1994: --studying and introducing, beginning in the second half of 1994, new rules for technical operation, instructions for train traffic and shunting operations and instructions on signalization on RF railroads; --carrying out technical inspections and checks of the railroads, divisions and enterprises, regarding this as one of the most important elements in preventive work. Introducing a procedure for compulsory personal examination of the results of the inspections of enterprises by the chief of a road division, of road divisions -- by the chief of the railroads, and of railroads -- by directors of the MPS; --developing and introducing the newest technical devices increasing train traffic safety, specified by the assignments of the State Program for 1994-2000; --ensuring fulfillment of the requirements for observing safety measures when transporting hazardous freight and performing shunting operations with railcars loaded with this freight; --organizing the training and instruction of workers involved in processing hazardous freight and rolling stock loaded with it. A competent solution to social problems is one of the most important conditions for a successful solution to the problems facing railroad transport. It is because of an efficient policy in this sphere that the railroad workers have managed to avoid many social conflicts, which have literally shaken other sectors of industry. Because of this, the Collegium feels that, to ensure the social protection of the railroad workers in 1994-1995, its main task should be considered to be fulfilling the Sectorial Tariff Agreement, following a coordinated policy in the sphere of wages and ensuring the comparability of wages by railroads and regions, on the basis of the conditions, intensiveness, difficulty and quality of labor. The sectors are to maintain, in 1994-1995, the rates of housing construction achieved, drawing in the resources of enterprises, cooperatives, railroad workers and other sources of financing. Reinforcement of lawfulness and legal procedure and unswerving adherence to existing legislative and normative acts in the subdivisions of railroad transport must be ensured in transport. Business contacts with law-and-order authorities must be strengthened, and preventive and legal education work put into practice with their participation. When violations of the law are revealed, efficient measures should be taken to eliminate them, making the guilty workers answerable. In order to increase the discipline of workers involved in train traffic, and particularly those involved in passenger service, it is recommended that the directors of enterprises use the contractual form of concluding labor agreements, and specify in them, in accordance with labor legislation, the responsibility for proper execution of service duties. By decision of the Collegium, the executors responsible for each point of the Program were determined, and plans were made to establish periodic monitoring of the course of its fulfillment at enterprises and in associations -- monthly; on divisions and railroads -- quarterly, with a report to the MPS for the road as a whole; in the MPS administrations -- quarterly, with a report to the deputy minister. To monitor the course of fulfilling the decisions of this Collegium, a work group, directed by O.A. Moshenko, first deputy minister, was set up to assist the roads. A procedure was established for quarterly summing up of the results of fulfilling the assignments of the Program, with analysis of the success of the measures being carried out. This work group is entrusted with the preparation, in the first half of 1994, of proposals for the improvement of the sector's administrative system. COPYRIGHT: "Zheleznodorozhnyy transport", 1994
