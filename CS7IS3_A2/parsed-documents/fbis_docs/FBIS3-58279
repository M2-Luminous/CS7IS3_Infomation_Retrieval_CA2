But Zhirinovsky had no intention of coming to the point, and launched into a long discourse on territorial issues. Territorial problems have become a virtual fixation for the Russian politician. Next, our colleague asked what he thinks about being compared to Hitler. His reply was a bit odd: [Begin recording] [Zhirinovsky] One of your writers said: We are neither rightists nor leftists, we are only footballists. Similarly, we too are neither rightists nor leftists, but only centrists. We are to the right of center. It could be that we are slightly to the right of center by some 20 percent, just like you. You have the True Path Party once lead by Suleyman Demirel. On his Ankara party headquarters, it was once written: The future rests with the father. It wanted to say that Demirel would become president in the future. And, in fact he became president. [Aksay] And are you going to become the father of Russia? [Zhirinovsky] Yes, Russia's father. Is Demirel a fascist? Never. I will be just like him in Russia. [Aksay] You mean to say that you could become Russia's Demirel, that is, Russia's father? [Zhirinovsky] Yes, yes, yes. [end recording] When Turkey is mentioned, Zhirinovsky constantly speaks about Pan-Turanism. He often mentions the name of Alparslan Turkes and goes into a long exposition of Pan-Turkism. He then said: [Begin recording] [Zhirinovsky] Very good conditions exist for you to create a Turan in this region, Caucasia -- your next door neighbor Azerbaijan speaks Turkish; they are of your own people -- and Turkmenistan. There are Turkish speaking peoples over a compact region. Culture and religion are all identical. This is very good for you. Had I been a Turk, I would have done this [create a Pan-Turkic state]. Had I been in the place of Alparslan Turkes, I would have established the same party and now I would have worked to bring all the former Soviet Central Asian republics closer to Turkey, to tie them to it, and one day to establish one single state. I would have done this. [Aksay] Is this why Turkey is a threat? Is it a threat because it might unite the other Turks? [Zhirinovsky] Yes, yes, yes, yes.... [Aksay, interrupting] But, as you know, the Pan-Turanists and Pan-Turkists are not in power in Turkey. [Zhirinovsky] Yes, not now, but they could be in the future. It is better for Russia that there should be a common border between Russia and Turkey, without the Caucasus, Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. Only Turkey and Russia. That will be sufficient. [end recording] Yet another gaffe from Zhirinovsky. In reply to Aksay's question, he gave a reply that is cause for thought. [Begin recording] [Aksay] You are saying Turkey does not really have a culture of its own, and that the Turks still pass off the Byzantine culture in Istanbul as their own. Does your lack of knowledge of Turkey's culture and your statement that the world will lose nothing if the Turkish culture vanishes not reflect a negative attitude toward Turkey? [Zhirinovsky] The Turkish culture could grow like a flower in the Tashkent region, because that is exactly the place for you. Below that are the Persian-speaking Afghanistan and Tajikistan, and to the north is Russia. But the Tashkent-Ashgabat region is your motherland. You have the Motherland Party, and your motherland lies between Tashkent and Ashgabat. One day in the past, your Ottoman Turkish armies marched into the Byzantine lands from this very region between Tashkent and Ashgabat. [end recording]
