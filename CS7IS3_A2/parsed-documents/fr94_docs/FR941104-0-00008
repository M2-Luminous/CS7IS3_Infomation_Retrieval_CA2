FR941104-0-00008 FR941104-0-00002 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;10&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9059; AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;07] Airworthiness Directives; Robinson Helicopter Company Model R22 Series Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This document publishes in the Federal Register an amendment adopting Airworthiness Directive (AD) 94&hyph;17&hyph;07 which was sent previously to all known U.S. owners and operators of Robinson Helicopter Company Model R22 series helicopters by individual letters. This AD requires an inspection and repetitive visual checks for slippage of the tail rotor (T/R) drive and replacement of the T/R gearbox, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by two incidents in which the T/R output key (key) was not installed between the output shaft and the output pinion during assembly of the T/R gearbox. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent slippage of the T/R drive, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. DATES: Effective on November 21, 1994, to all persons except those persons to whom it was made immediately effective by Priority Letter AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;07, issued on August 25, 1994, which contained the requirements of this amendment. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 21,1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before January 3, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;10&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137. The applicable service information may be obtained from Robinson Helicopter Company, 24747 Crenshaw Blvd., Torrance, CA 90505. This information may be examined at the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Elizabeth Bumann, Aerospace Engineer, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, Propulsion Branch, FAA, 3229 E. Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806&hyph;2425, telephone (310) 988&hyph;5265, fax (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 25, 1994, the FAA issued Priority Letter AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;07, applicable to Robinson Helicopter Company R22 series helicopters, which requires an inspection and repetitive visual checks for slippage of the tail rotor (T/R) drive, and replacement of the T/R gearbox, if necessary. That action was prompted by two incidents in which the T/R output key (key) was not installed between the output shaft and the output pinion during assembly of the T/R gearbox. The key is required to prevent the output gear from rotating on the output shaft. Both incidents resulted in slippage of the T/R drive. On June 2, 1994, Registro Aeronautico Italiano (RAI), the Airworthiness Authority of Italy, issued RAI AD No. 94&hyph;131 to require a daily inspection to determine if there had been any slippage of the T/R drive between the output shaft and the output pinion. This condition, if not corrected, could result in slippage of the T/R drive, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. The FAA has reviewed Robinson Helicopter Company R22 Service Bulletin (SB) # 74, dated July 18, 1994, that describes procedures for determining slippage of the T/R drive using a 35-lb. load on the T/R blade and checking for correct alignment of dots that have been marked in accordance with SB # 74, dated July 18, 1994. The FAA is issuing this AD to require the initial marking of dots and an inspection prior to further flight, rather than within the next 20 hours time-in-service (TIS) as specified by SB # 74, dated July 18, 1994. Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other Robinson Helicopter Company Model R22 series helicopters of the same type design, the FAA issued Priority Letter AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;07 to prevent slippage of the T/R drive, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. The AD requires the installation of alignment marks, an initial inspection prior to further flight, daily pre-flight visual checks for slippage of the T/R drive, and replacement of the T/R gearbox, if necessary. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. This AD is considered to be an interim action. The FAA is considering further rulemaking to require opening the T/R gearbox and verifying installation of the key as the terminating action to this AD.
