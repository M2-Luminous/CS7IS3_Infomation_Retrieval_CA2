According to the joint statement, both sides informed each other of the situation and activities of their parties and exchanged views on the matter of developing relations between the two parties and international issues of mutual concern and reached a complete consensus of views.

The WPK expressed support to the stand of the CPC (M-L) demanding respect for the sovereignty of all countries and all nations, dissolution of all forms of aggressive and predatory military and economic blocs including the NATO and the complete abolition of all kinds of mass destruction weapons. The CPC (M-L) highly appreciated the great exploits of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who have strengthened and developed the WPK into an invincible political organization of leadership and made it possible to steadfastly defend and advance the socialist cause in whatever situation by firmly rallying the entire people around the party. The CPC (M-L) expressed deep concern over the adventure of the U.S. authorities to put pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea while breaking the promise it has made at the DPRK-U.S. talks and held that the United States should pull all nuclear weapons out of South Korea and stop the projected deployment of "Patriot" missiles and the nuclear war exercises if it wants a fair solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It also expressed firm solidarity with the Workers' Party and the people of Korea in their struggle to realize national reunification in the form of confederacy based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments on the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity. Both sides expressed common will to unite, cooperate and further strengthen solidarity with communist and workers' parties and other progressive political parties of different countries of the world on the principle of advancing the cause of working class of the whole world to victory while bearing responsibility for the revolution of their own country with independence as an important idea of unity.
