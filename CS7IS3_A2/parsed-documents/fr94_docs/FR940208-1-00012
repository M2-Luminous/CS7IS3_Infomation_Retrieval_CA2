FR940208-1-00012 FR940208-1-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [IN5&hyph;1&hyph;5192; FRL&hyph;4835&hyph;5] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Indiana AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: On January 11, 1991, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) submitted amendments of its source monitoring rules and sulfur dioxide (SO2) rules to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions. Because of unsupported emission limit relaxations and enforceability deficiencies in the amended State regulations, USEPA is proposing to disapprove this SIP revision request. DATES: Comments on this revision and on the proposed USEPA action must be received by March 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR&hyph;18J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Onischak at (312) 353&hyph;5954. (It is recommended that you telephone before visiting the Region 5 Office.) Copies of the SIP revision request and USEPA's analysis are available for inspection at the following address: Regulation Development Branch, Regulation Development Section (AR&hyph;18J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Summary of State Submittal On January 11, 1991, IDEM submitted its amended source monitoring rules and sulfur dioxide (SO2) rules to USEPA as Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions. The submittal amends 326 Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) Articles 3 and 7. Because the rules contain enforceability deficiencies and unsupported emission limit relaxations, USEPA proposes to disapprove the January 11, 1991 submittal. II. Analysis of State Submittal Indiana's revised monitoring rule consists of 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1, 3&hyph;2.1, and 3&hyph;3. The revised sulfur dioxide rule consists of 326 IAC 7&hyph;1.1, 7&hyph;2, 7&hyph;3, and 7&hyph;4. The following paragraphs describe the individual rules. 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1 requires continuous emission monitoring for sources in several categories, including large fossil fuel-fired steam generators, sulfuric acid producers, and catalytic cracking units. Fossil fuel-fired steam generators of greater than 100 million British Thermal Units per hour (MMBTU/hr) heat input capacity are required under this rule to continuously monitor their emissions for opacity, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and oxygen or carbon monoxide content. The rule allows IDEM's Commissioner to require additional sources to use continuous monitoring equipment. This rule contains the minimum emission monitoring requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P. 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1 requires facilities to report excess emissions quarterly, and allows 3-hour block averaging of gaseous measurements. This averaging time is consistent with the SO 2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Facility owners must keep all monitoring records on file for 2 years. These requirements are consistent with 40 CFR part 51, appendix P. The rule requires facility owners to submit to IDEM written standard operating procedures describing calibration and quality control procedures for the operation of all required continuous emission monitors. The rule also sets forth conversion factors to be used with monitoring data. 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1 refers to 40 CFR [part] 60, appendix B for the performance specifications of the required monitoring equipment, and specifies that where reference is made to the ``Administrator'' in 40 CFR [part] 60, appendix B, the term ``Commissioner'' is to be inserted for the purposes of this rule. Such substitution is allowed by USEPA, according to 40 CFR part 51, appendix P, paragraph 3.1. The USEPA has set forth explicit criteria for the Commissioner's modification of the rule's requirements in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. However, ``Commissioner's discretion'' language that USEPA finds unacceptable for the reasons described in section III below appears in other portions of 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1, e.g., 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1&hyph;1 (waivers) and 326 IAC 3&hyph;1.1&hyph;2 (alternate instrument response settings), and renders these rules unapprovable.
