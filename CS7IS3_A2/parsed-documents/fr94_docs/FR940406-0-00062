Real Property Screening When the Department of Defense no longer needs to retain real property at a closing base, the Department is required to dispose of the property in accordance with the prescribed screening process in the General Services Administration property disposal regulations and the new expedited process authorized in Title XXIX. This process permits DoD entities, other Federal Agencies and homeless providers to identify property they would like to acquire when the base closes. The screening process for real property requires the Department of Defense to identify first what it needs to retain. Any property excess to the Department of Defense is then made available to other Federal Agencies. Property not needed by other Federal Agencies is then identified as surplus and reported to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for a determination of suitability for homeless use and publication of such properties in the Federal Register . Property that has no homeless interest, as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), will then be available for transfer by either direct sale to the public, negotiated conveyance to the local redevelopment authority, public benefit conveyances for airports, schools, ports, etc., or the new economic development conveyance discussed in paragraph 5. of this summary. The Military Departments will work with the other Department of Defense Components, Federal Agencies, homeless providers and reuse planners, early in the closure process, to sort out these requests. This new process will provide for the early identification of property which will become available for reuse. This information is critical to the local redevelopment authority's ability to design a realistic redevelopment plan. Agreement with proposed uses, other than for McKinney Act homeless use, is at the discretion of the Military Departments who have been delegated disposal authority. 2. McKinney Act Screening The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act is a statute designed to permit recognized providers of assistance to the homeless to receive a high priority in acquiring unneeded land and buildings on Federal properties. Buildings and land on closing bases provide excellent opportunities for homeless providers to acquire the infrastructure they need to establish their programs. This section of the interim final rule describes the new process, specifically tailored for base closure properties, that will expedite the screening process with homeless providers and will result in the early identification of their needs. The expedited screening process will be pursued in a proactive manner. The Military Departments will work with communities to identify eligible entities and conduct timely outreach seminars to educate homeless providers with respect to the land and buildings that will be made available and the process for making a formal application to HHS to acquire such land and buildings. The early identification of homeless assistance requirements will permit communities to develop reuse plans that fully accommodate homeless needs, while permitting early identification of the remaining property for quick sale to create jobs, a Federally-sponsored public benefit conveyance, or conveyance to a local redevelopment authority for economic development purposes. 3. Local Redevelopment Plan The early formation of a local redevelopment authority is critical to the successful reuse of the base. The primary focus of the local redevelopment authority should be developing a comprehensive local redevelopment plan. This plan should embrace the range of feasible reuse options that will result in rapid job creation. The local redevelopment plan will generally be used as the proposed action when the disposing Military Department conducts the environmental analyses required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 4. Jobs-Centered Property Disposal The new property disposal process described in this section and in paragraphs 5. and 6. of this summary, is designed to rapidly create new jobs. In most cases, that will occur through conveyances for economic development, without initial cost, as described in paragraph 5. However, in a few cases, an entire base or a substantial portion of it will have a high value and hence a ready market for development. In such cases, market sale of the property may be the most effective way to rapidly create new jobs.
