Father Abessole left Gabon after last February's disturbances which led to nine deaths. The National Lumberjacks Rally [RNB] party leader was welcomed by about 100 enthusiastic RNB supporters on arrival at Libreville Airport where policemen had taken position. Father Abessole made no statement on arrival. The opposition leader left Libreville for Paris on 8 March officially to "rest and to contact his friends," an opposition spokesman announced. His departure followed four days of violent disturbances, from 21 to 24 February, in several parts of Libreville's residential districts during which nine persons, including two soldiers, were killed, according to an official report. The government had accused Father Mba Abessole and his party of being responsible for the disturbances that had flared up following a strike called by a labor union close to the opposition. During the disturbances, security forces had, notably, stormed the opposition leader's residence in Libreville in his absence. The state of alert which banned demonstrations and a curfew were reimposed following the disturbances. The state of alert was lifted on 8 April.
