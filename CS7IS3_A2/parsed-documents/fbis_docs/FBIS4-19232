This year, the shops remain closed in Diyabakir, Kurdistan's secret capital. The Kurds' New Year celebration does not take place -- out of fear of the Turkish military. There is a German BTR-60 armored personnel carrier near Diyabakir. The photograph shown here was taken three weeks ago. A former colonel of the National People's Army [NVA] and expert on tank technology has now confirmed the research done by Monitor. [Begin ex-NVA Colonel Lotahr Mann recording] These tanks, which are BTR-60 PB armored personnel carriers, clearly come from the stocks of the former NVA. Proof of that are the changes that have been made on the vehicles, in particular regarding external lighting, but also those changes that were made on the vehicles in connection with the transition to the licensing regulation under the FRG traffic code, such as rearview mirrors. Thus, it is quite clear that these vehicles are not deliveries from the former Soviet Union or from Russia, but that these are clearly German tanks. [end recording] Only two weeks ago did we visit several towns and villages in Turkish Kurdistan again. After just two days on this trip, we identified German military materiel in six different places [video shows a map of Turkey on which Elazig, Maden, Ergani, Tatvan, Silvan, and Hasankeyf are marked]. Nevertheless, despite all the photographs, television pictures, and eyewitnesses, the foreign minister is still denying everything. [Begin Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel recording] I have really tried to clarify the matter. We have never managed to get direct proof. [end recording] [Monitor moderator Klaus Bednarz] Two weeks ago, I sent Foreign Minister Kinkel a video tape with the Monitor cast of last November, which documented the use of German tanks against the Kurds. One week ago, I received the response that the tape had been forwarded to the FRG Defense Ministry for examination. We have not heard anything since then. How long do the gentlemen in the Defense Ministry actually need to recognize their own tanks?
