What Will Come of It?"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Here is how deputies commented on the Crimean problem behind the scenes. Anton Buteyko: The Ukrainian Supreme Council has the right to dictate its will and should do this, while other entities must obey. Crimea is an entity subordinated to Ukraine. In a situation like the one that has recently developed in Crimea, which can be qualified as a violation of territorial integrity and national sovereignty, the law "On State of Emergency" provides a solution. The introduction of that law is also envisioned by international laws, however UN bodies have to be informed about such intentions in an appropriate manner. I do not think that we should resort to these measures now, however such a possibility should not be ruled out. The draft law suggested by the president is just another postponement, while we are expected to make concrete steps. Leonid Kuchma: The essence of the Crimean issue lies in the economy and not in politics. I am an advocate of negotiations and vaster economic independence. Look what is going on in Crimea: The adoption of a soft tax policy has caused an inflow of capital. According to my data, more than 600 billion karbovantsi have recently been transferred to Crimea by means of Ukraine's commercial banks. Crimea should suspend its decision regarding the constitution, while the Ukrainian Supreme Council should adopt a ban on the use of force. With regard to the proposals to create the Constitutional Court -- can our legislature create it? In our state politics is ahead of the economy. Ukraine is actually approaching collapse, because with an economic plunge of 50 percent (this is how production has shrunk in Ukraine's light industries), states usually disintegrate. Borys Oliynyk: The Crimean issue should be resolved by means of the Constitutional Court. However a limited period of time should be set aside for forming this court. I do not think that anybody would dare blame us for failure to do everything in our power to peacefully resolve the conflict. Introduction of presidential rule in Crimea is out of the question; we should act in line with the logic of our resolution. However we must determine certain time limits for a response from Crimean authorities.
