As part of its conspiratorial and treacherous policy, the Fahd regime has adopted a disgraceful position by supporting the agent and renegade secessionists and trying to polish their image and present them to the international community as a party that is equal to the legitimate Yemeni authority. Thus, the Saudi regime made feverish moves in the Security Council through Fahd's ambassador in Washington Bandar Bin- Sultan, who is known for his cheap and exposed contacts with U.S. and Zionist intelligence organs before and after the 30-state aggression against Iraq. By its recent move in the Security Council, the Saudi regime, which has a disgraceful record of conspiracies against every Arab unionist project and every national authority, is adding a new act of treason to its innumerable acts of treason against the Arab nation's higher interests and is flagrantly revealing its plot to bring foreign forces to Yemen, just as it did in Hafar al-Batin before the aggression against Iraq. Saudi Arabia has been the principal enemy of every Arab unionist project. The Arabs will never forget how the ruling Saudi family plotted against Egyptian-Syrian unity and how it paid millions of dollars to mercenaries and traitors to undermine that unity and cancel the United Arab Republic. Today, the recent past is repeating itself, and in the same way and through more wicked means, the agent regime in Riyadh is moving to destroy Yemeni unity, fragment Yemen, create differences, and ignite war among the sons of Yemen in order to satisfy its U.S., British, and Zionist masters. The Yemeni people suffered greatly from the Saudi rulers' plots against the Yemeni revolution in 1962. That family fears that the Yemeni revolution may encourage masses in the Arabian peninsula to mobilize their energies, wipe out the agent regime, and end its hateful role in conspiring against the fateful Arab causes, including the Palestine question and a series of revolutions and uprisings in many arenas of the Arab East and Arab Maghreb. After the revolution succeeded, despite the Saudi conspiracy, and the Yemeni people were able to preserve the republican system by offering many sacrifices in lives and money, the agent rulers in Riyadh went crazy and backed every plot to upset stability in Yemen and disrupt its people's unity. Fahd, a cheap agent and offspring of a family with a long history of treason, will win nothing from his conspiratorial step and his treasonous moves except curses and eternal disgrace, and the Arab masses will continue to believe that the Yemeni unity and every other similar step will remain too strong to be harmed by the cowards, who have lost their pan-Arab identity and their national zeal and who have turned into mere dolls in the hands of the arch enemies of the Arab and Islamic nations. Yemeni unity will remain an eternal reality amid the clamor caused by agents in the Security Council and their dirty games. Yemeni unity was established to last. This is the course of history despite agents like Fahd and his page, Bandar.
