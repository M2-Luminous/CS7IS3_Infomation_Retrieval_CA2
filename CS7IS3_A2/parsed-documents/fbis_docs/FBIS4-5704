Han stopped off in Tokyo on his way to Moscow to meet with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-general Hans Blix, who is in the Japanese capital to attend a conference. During the one-hour meeting, the foreign minister reminded Blix of the March 31 U.N. Security Council presidential statement urging all involved nations to engage in dialogue with North Korea, and suggested that the IAEA make the first offer to negotiate with Pyongyang, officials at the South Korean Embassy said. He proposed that if North Korea still refuses inspections early next month, the IAEA should report Pyongyang's non-compliance based on technical information, the officials said. IAEA inspectors went to North Korea last month but were denied access to critical areas necessary in determining whether Pyongyang diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful uses.
