Chief Etiebet, in the course of his trip, met and held talks with the Qatari minister of energy and industries, Shaykh 'Abdallah al-'Atiyah, who is the current OPEC president. Both ministers are reported to have agreed on measures to check the sliding oil prices which have resulted in a drop of about $4 in the price of Nigeria's Bony Light crude. In an international press briefing, Chief Etiebet described his talks with Qatar's minister of energy as successful: [Begin Etiebet recording] We resolved to tackle these areas with a view to making sure that overproduction is reduced to its minimum if not completely eradicated, and quota arrears are meant to make sure that what will come out in our meeting on March 25th will be enough to bring up the price to a comfortable level for the producers again. We are very serious and very determined in this area. I would not like to read or say exactly the figures but we definitely think that we should work from anything from between five and 10 percent until production (?goes up). [end recording] Chief Etiebet also paid a courtesy call on the Amir of Qatar. [Begin Etiebet recording] Our head of state, General Sani Abacha, asked me to (?deliver a message) and convey his best regards, his greetings, and to congratulate you and your sovereign (?noblemen) of your country, which is seen as one of the richest and most peaceful in the world. [end recording] (?Later), the minister and his delegation went to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While in Saudi Arabia, Chief Etiebet held talks with his Saudi counterpart, Muhyi-al-Din Nazir. The minister and his delegation have since returned to the country.
