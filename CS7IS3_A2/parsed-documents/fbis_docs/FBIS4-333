A statement on Thursday [7 April] by the NPKF said Col Duma Mdutyana, until the disciplinary action its chief of staff, was "deseconded" from April 5 after the force's commander, Gen Gabriel Ramushwana, was informed that a court case was pending against him. The other two officers relieved of their duties are Lt-Col George Sibanyoni, now former officer commanding Battalion 1, and media laison officer Capt Johan Loots. Both Col Mdutyana and col Sibanyoni had joined the NPKF from the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, MK]. The statement said Col Mdutyana was facing a charge of drunken driving in an NPKF vehicle following an incident on March 20. Col Sibanyoni, who was also dismissed on April 5, faces a possible charge of culpable homicide following a motor accident in Mamelodi, Pretoria, on the weekend of March 11-13. One person died in the accident. Col Sibanyoni was apparently driving an NPKF vehicle at the time. According to the statement, Capt Loots of the South African Police was dismissed when it was established he had issued a press release in the name of NPKF public relations officer Maj William Bisho, without the major's permission. "(Capt) Loots also falsely claimed to have the permission of the NPKF GOC (general officer commanding) to organise a press 'open day' at De Brug on March 23, 1994 during the process of (troop) evaluation." As a result, media coverage had been unsympathetic. Capt Loots is also accused of breaching the powers of his position by dealing with the media without authorisation.
