Companies with their own communications networks, like Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) and Korea Highway Corp., will be able to take part in exclusive circuit projects such as cable television from next January, Yun told reporters after reporting his communications agenda to the president earlier in the day. The fences between general and specific communications sectors will be torn down, paving the way for all the telecommunications companies to jump into other communications businesses, Yu said.
