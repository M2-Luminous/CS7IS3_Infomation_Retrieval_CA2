He said this in response to the proposal made by the Chechen Foreign Ministry to the Russian Foreign Ministry. A Chechen diplomat referred to the fact that while crossing the border official government delegations of the Chechen republic "face obstacles." According to Suvorov, under Article two of the Resolution of the Russian Supreme Soviet of March 1, 1993 the status of the Russian state border is given only to administrative borders with republics of the former Soviet Union. This article does not apply to Chechnya. Currently, there are no Russian border troops along the administrative border of Chechnya and the Russian-Georgian border at its Chechen section. In this connection, no obstables to citizens, transport or cargoes can be posed by border guards in these parts, Suvorov said.
