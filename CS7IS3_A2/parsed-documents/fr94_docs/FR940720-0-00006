FR940720-0-00006 FR940720-0-00001 2. Fees for Reciprocity Comment. The NRC charges Agreement State licensees who provide services in non-Agreement States, ``reciprocity fees''. A few commenters indicated that they were opposed to the fees for reciprocity, particularly the proposed fees for revisions to information submitted on the NRC Form-241 filed by 10 CFR 150.20 general licensees. They stated that fees are an unnecessary burden and suggested that the NRC reconsider its decision to increase the current fees and add additional charges for reciprocity licensees. They stated that these costs would have to be included in proposals for work in non-Agreement States and that, as small firms, they could not absorb such costs and remain competitive with larger firms offering similar services. One commenter suggested that the fee for revisions to NRC Form 241 be established at $25 to $50 per revision rather than $200 as proposed. Commenters questioned whether the establishment of the reciprocity fees is an effort to restrict survey activities to the home-State of the company because the additional costs do not make it feasible to even consider bidding for projects out of the state. Commenters claimed that this allows larger, wealthier companies the opportunity to bid for and secure out-of-state work. Other commenters supported the reciprocity fees, including the proposed fees for revisions. They encouraged NRC to assess fees for services provided specific classes of licensees and to reduce the costs classified as overhead. Response. The NRC is adopting the approach contained in the proposed rule as this is consistent with the Congressional mandate that, to the extent practicable, a class of licensees bear the costs of providing regulatory services to them. Other approaches suggested by commenters would have the effect of shifting the costs of reviewing revisions to Form 241 to other classes of licensees. Agreement State licensees requesting reciprocity for activities conducted in non-Agreement States or in offshore waters are subject to 10 CFR 150.20. The first time within a calendar year that an Agreement State licensee conducts activities in non-Agreement States or in offshore waters, it must file a completed NRC Form 241. Revisions to the initial NRC Form 241 are filed for review and authorization when persons using the 10 CFR part 150.20 general license either add locations of work, use different radioactive material or perform additional work activities in a non-Agreement State. Information submitted to the NRC by the 10 CFR 150.20 general licensee that clarifies or deletes specific locations or work sites, work site contacts, or dates of work is considered by the NRC to be a clarification, not a revision. Changes in the equipment to be used under the 10 CFR 150.20 general license do not require a revision if there is no change in (1) activity to be conducted, (2) the radioactive material to be used, and (3) if the Agreement State license authorizes the new equipment. The fee of $700 for the initial filing of Form-241 is the same as that assessed in FY 1993. The fee of $200 for revisions to the Form-241 has been added to this final rule. The reciprocity fees established by the NRC are not intended to restrict companies from doing work in non-Agreement States. The fees will allow the NRC to recover the costs it expends in reviewing initial applications and revisions filed by 10 CFR part 150.20 general licensees. That is, the fee is intended to recover the cost of identifiable services to a specific applicant in accordance with OBRA&hyph;90 and the IOAA. Fee Category 16 of 10 CFR part 170.31 has been revised to add a fee of $200 for each revision filed by Agreement State licensees. The revision fee will be due at the time the applicant files a revision to information submitted on the initial Form-241 with the NRC.
