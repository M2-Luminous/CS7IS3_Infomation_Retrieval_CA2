FBIS4-33422 "drlat109__a94013" FBIS-LAT-94-109-A Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 ANNEX Cuba Mexican Press Highlights Salinas Visit Mexican Press Highlights Salinas Visit PA0506034594 Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 1440 GMT 4 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PA0506034594 Havana PRENSA LATINA Spanish BFN [Text] Mexico City, 4 Jun (PL) -- The Mexican press today highlights several recent developments here in support of Cuba, particularly the announcement of a visit to Havana by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and a resolution issued by the Latin American Economic System [SELA] condemning the U.S. blockade against the island. EL DIA affirms in an editorial column that the Mexican president's visit to Cuba confirms Mexico's right to expand its international relations and exercise its sovereignty to establish or strengthen its relations with every country of the world. The article adds that Mexico's position illustrates that we are not willing to bend under the United States' intervention policy. It also states that the U.S. trade embargo against the island and the so-called Torricelli Bill can only be the brainchild of "a government that lives in a barbaric era, ignoring law and morality." In addressing U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli's visit to this country, EL DIA affirms that the legislator was sent home with nothing to tell. "He went home empty-handed and full of resentment." The same paper, in a front-page story, highlights the SELA resolution approved here yesterday protesting the U.S. blockade against Cuba. It also publishes a letter from the group known as Let's Go for Cuba praising the gesture made by Mexican legislators of all parties to donate one day's pay to purchase crude oil for the island. The letter announced that the group will cast off with the "third solidarity shipment" to Cuba at the end of this month. The newspaper LA JORNADA carries a front-page headline that says "SELA Calls for Lifting of Blockade Against Cuba" and an editorial column on the resolution the organization issued against the U.S. trade embargo on the island. According to the daily, SELA spoke out clearly against Washington's measure. Furthermore, says the editorial, the organization's decision to protest the blockade "constitutes recognition of its blatant inappropriateness and its undeniable interventionist nature." It stresses that the step taken by SELA morally discredits the blockade's validity, while it rallies 27 American nations around an issue that has been the reason for conflict since 1962. Mexico's daily EXCELSIOR also devoted a portion of its front page to the organization's decision, with a headline reading "SELA Demands That the United States Lift the Trade Embargo Against Cuba." EL SOL DE MEXICO publishes the same headline: "SELA Demands That United States Lift the Trade Embargo Against Cuba." A headline in the economic section of EL NACIONAL states: "27 Nations of Latin America Speak Out Against the Blockade Against Cuba."
