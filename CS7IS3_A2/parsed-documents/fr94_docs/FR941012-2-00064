Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Public Law 92&hyph;463, notice is hereby given that the Science Advisory Board's (SAB's) Environmental Engineering Committee (EEC), will meet on the morning of Wednesday, October 26 and on Thursday and Friday, October 27&hyph;28, 1994.

At this meeting, the primary activities of the EEC are (1) to review the Use Cluster Scoring System of the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics; and (2) complete its plans for fiscal 1995. The proposed charge for the review is: 1. Are the methods used to define the chemical in a use cluster adequate? 2. The main goal of the UCSS is to screen chemicals/clusters by using easily obtainable data to set priorities for OPPT. Given the limited nature of this goal, are the data sources used in the UCSS appropriate? What additional data sources could be used? 3. Are the data sources used in the UCSS appropriate to bin chemicals into high, medium, and low categories? 4. Are there other general areas/criteria (such as waste generation that should be included in the UCSS? 5. Is the manner in which chemicals and clusters are scored appropriate? How does the SAB recommend the EPA treat the uncertainties associated with the system algorithms and the data sources themselves.
