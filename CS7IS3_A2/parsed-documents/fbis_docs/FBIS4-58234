Justifying the military aggression against the forces of the 3d Brigade in 'Imran, which began on 27 April and continued today, did not require this revolutionary statement, which proves to our people and the whole world that the speech by the president in Sab'in Square was clearly directed toward planning aggression and launching civil war, and was a hysterical declaration of war against everyone. The Presidential Council statement was issued to confirm this, by asserting that the 'Imran operation was to be a lesson to be taken note of by anyone with ambition. The family's council has discarded its latest facade, revealing its intention to reject the plan to merge forces, which had been proposed by the defense minister four times over the past few years. The Army merger would prevent the officers of the al-Ahmar clan from continuing to dominate the Armed Forces, and would expose the corruption and smuggling caused by the looting of soldiers' pay and food, the threats and abuse of soldiers, the creation of thousands of nonexistent positions in every unit, and the gaining of control over most military supplies. The merger would have provided the Armed Forces with professional capabilities, would have freed them from the circle of family and tribal loyalties, and would have turned them into a real shield to protect the homeland and its constitutional institutions. It would appear that the ultimate aim of rejecting the Armed Forces merger and returning their [word indistinct] was to isolate and direct blows against them, as happened in Abyan, Harf Sufyan and 'Imran. However, the heroic defensive efforts of the 3d Brigade in responding to the treacherous attack against it, and the foiling of successive attacks upon it, will make the gangs of the ruling military family pay a high price. At the end of the day they will suffer disgrace and utter defeat. What makes one anxious concerning the council statement is what it says about democracy and the rule of law. The family tramples on this every day, and boasts of having come to power with its pistol and the property of others, so that there should never again be democracy. It arrived to where it is now through the blood of the leaders and heroes of Yemen, through internecine tribal strife, and by setting the country ablaze through a series of assassinations during the run up to the elections. It spent millions in government and private funds to corrupt and destroy the elections. It then set out to destroy the results of the elections and undermine the unity of the work of the constitutional institutions, while planning the assassinations of its members and cadres, so as to return to totalitarian presidential rule. This is what it is attempting to restore by digging with its bloodied fingernails, so as to discard all talk of constitutional amendments and attempts to reform the regime. After state institutions readied themselves to take up their constitutional responsibilities, by establishing security, stability, and by providing the people with a decent standard of living, it poised itself to threaten the country's safety and independence. Today it is working to cripple national consensus and the pledge and accord document, which has received both national, Arab, and international support, and which had led everyone to hope that state institutions destroyed by the ruling military family would be put right. That family has destroyed everything in the country, so as to have the people, placed for years under an autocratic military regime and controlled by a partitionist oligarchy, returned unwillingly to such a system through chaos, destruction, and war, while entrenching in the minds of the people the idea that it was the family which had brought unity and democracy. The ruling military family decided to slaughter democracy on its glorious anniversary, 27 April, when the president, in Sab'in Square, declared indiscriminate war on everyone, on the Yemeni Socialist Party -- which he had achieved unity with through the dialogue commission -- and on the parties and political forces of the nation.
