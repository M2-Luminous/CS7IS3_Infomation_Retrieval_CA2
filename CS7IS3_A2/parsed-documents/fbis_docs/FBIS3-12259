['Abd-Rabbuh] Actually, there will be a great impact because the first thing we now want from the world and from the Israeli side is not just words of denunciation and condemnation. We are waiting for two urgent measures: the first is a Security Council meeting and the adoption of measures stressing the illegality of the construction and presence of settlements on Palestinian land. The second is the immediate disarming of the settlers because these criminal gangs--gangs of murderers--represent a time bomb threatening and undermining any steps toward peace. [Al-Hashani] Has the PLO received response from any Western countries to holding a Security Council session? ['Abd-Rabbuh] Some preliminary responses have been received by noon today and we expect some more... [Al-Hashani, interrupting] Were they positive? ['Abd-Rabbuh] Some were positive and we are waiting for other responses.
