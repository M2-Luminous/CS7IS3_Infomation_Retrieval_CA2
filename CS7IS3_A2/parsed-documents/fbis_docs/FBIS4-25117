The official made the remark in answer to a question on the Chinese Government position on the integration of Hungary and other Central European countries into NATO, and a possible eastward expansion of the North-Atlantic organization. This was the first time that a senior Chinese source had taken a stand on the issue. At a press conference held in Beijing for Central and Eastern European correspondents, the same senior official said China understood Hungary's desire to become a full member of the European Union and this way strengthen its links with other European states. However, the Chinese Government hopes Hungary will not forget about its eastern links while integrating into Europe, he added.
