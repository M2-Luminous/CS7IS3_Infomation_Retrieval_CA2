With the approval of the Xinjiang Autonomous Regional Higher People's Court, nine of them, including Huang Jianchao, Feng Xiaojiang, Wang Wei, and Bai Liang, were sentenced to death and executed immediately. The criminals harshly punished by the law on 28 January committed numerous crimes which incurred the extreme and intense indignation of the people. Some committed cases of manslaughter, one after another, in revenge and then conducted counterrevolutionary propaganda and instigation when they absconded to avoid punishment; some killed innocent people after robbing them of money; some formed a gang and, more than once, used coercion to rob taxi drivers of their takings in spite of the law; some raped women in broad daylight.
