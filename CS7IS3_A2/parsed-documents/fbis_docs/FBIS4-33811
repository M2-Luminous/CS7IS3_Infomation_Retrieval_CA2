Paul asserted that "the Governors Island Agreement continues to be the foundation for a solution to prevent new, very harsh and painful sanctions, which hurt all Haitians." He added that "it is vital for Gen. Cedras to recognize the need to respect his commitments." Clinton announced a ban on commercial flights to begin on 25 June and a ban on banking operations with Haiti. He also ordered the return of most of the U.S. citizens residing on the island. Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies (close to the socialists), condemned the sanctions President Clinton implemented. He charged that it was a "racist, irrational, and an unprecedented decision." Appalled, Monde asked: "Tell me which U.S. citizen can live on $50 a month." He was referring to the maximum amount Haitians living in the United States are authorized to send to their relatives in Haiti. "I insist. The international community's strategy tends to punish those who voted for Jean Bertrand Aristide (the exiled president), who are the poorest," he said.
