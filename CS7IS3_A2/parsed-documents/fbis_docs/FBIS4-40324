Vasile Stati, doctor of history, was elected president of the movement. Arcadi Dziubinschi [name as received], one of the movement's leaders, declared to BASA that after the first year of activity "Pro Moldova" has about 500 followers. "We fight for the consolidation of Moldova's sovereignty, recognition of the notions of `Moldovan people' and `Moldovan language'," stressed Dziubinschi. He declared that "Pro Moldova" is not a party-like movement and is opened to the representatives of any political formation. "We are ready to accept into our organizations even the representatives of the People's Front -- of course all those who would reject the ideals of unification," declared Dziubinschi. In his opinion, "Pro Moldova" is unique because it is the first time a political movement has given priority to the idea of "Moldovanism."
