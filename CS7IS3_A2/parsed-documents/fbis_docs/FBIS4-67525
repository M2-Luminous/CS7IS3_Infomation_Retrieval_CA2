Most of the environmental damage in the ex-GDR was caused by planned economy considerations. The GDR wanted to increase industrial output at all costs, and was never genuinely concerned about a clean environment. The Institute of German Industry says major investments are required to clear the damage. The lowest estimate is 82.8 billion marks [DM], the highest is DM521 billion. The widest range of estimates concerns the removal of old waste. The cost of performing this operation is estimated at between DM3 billion and 270 billion. The operation would entail either the elimination of acute dangers, for instance by erecting fences around contaminated lakes, or comprehensive cleaning-up work, such as the excavation, cleaning, and recultivation of soil. In the GDR, enterprises were supplied with quantities of energy equal to the quantities they had consumed during the previous period of reckoning, a practice that led to senseless waste. Therefore, an enterprise that consumed its coal supply sparingly could expect to receive less coal for the following period. In this way, energy was wasted without regard to the environment, says the report. Therefore, private households also felt no encouragement to economize on energy.
