[passage omitted] Here is an exclusive interview with Admiral Jean-Luc Delaunay, a top officer in the French Navy in the Indian Ocean. He spoke to Fabrice Le Quintrec from the ship Le Var: [Begin recording] [Delaunay] We evacuated 300 people from Aden today and 200 people from Al Mukalla, a small port 500 km from Aden, including a group of French tourists. We have four ships taking part in the operation: A repair ship, an oil tanker, a landing craft, and a dispatch boat, which we have brought from the Persian Gulf. All this is taking place without any panic because the harbor authorities in the aforementioned ports are making things easy for us. Meanwhile, the French Army evacuated about 250 people from Sanaa, whom they sent to Djibouti. [Le Quintrec] Admiral, how many French or foreign nationals remain to be evacuated from Yemen? [Delaunay] We believe that there are very few French nationals and European nationals in Aden. We believe that there are about 30 French nationals, whom we will evacuate tomorrow morning. [Le Quintrec] Are you going to stay in the area for a long time? [Delaunay] No, it will mainly depend on the number of French nationals. If we manage to evacuate these last French nationals tomorrow -- and only the French consul in Aden will be able to tell us -- there is no reason why we should prolong our stay beyond then since we will have accomplished our mission.
