The Yaounde authorities say they have not been informed about the holding of a summit between Abacha and Biya although unofficial sources report that a summit will be held between President Paul Biya of Cameroon and General Sani Abacha of Nigeria and that the two leaders will meet in a few weeks time with their Egyptian counterpart, Husni Mubarak, the current OAU chairman, in Abuja. Nigerian Foreign Minister Babagana Kingibe has expressed surprise at this news and in Yaounde, the minister of communication and government spokesman says he has not been notified of this meeting which is rather expected to take place in Togo. Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni, Cameroon's minister and government spokesman, speaks to Raphael Badinga: [Begin Kouomegni recording] We in Cameroon believe that normally the host country should be Togo since the Togolese leader came to Cameroon and went to Nigeria in connection with the dispute, and his foreign minister went to Cameroon and Nigeria. The Nigerian minister also came here for three days and we worked on the assumption that Togo is offering mediation. We are, therefore, surprised to learn that somehow Nigeria has chosen Cairo because Nigeria has not informed us of any such development and Egypt has not notified us of any invitation to Cairo. Normally, we should be informed, even discreetly, by Nigeria or Egypt. We should negotiate the date, procedure, and subject of discussion together and then we should announce this simultaneously in Yaounde and Lagos or simultaneously in Yaounde, Lagos, and Cairo. That is the procedure in international relations. [end recording]
