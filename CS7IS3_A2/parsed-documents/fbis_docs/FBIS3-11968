When asked about his first activities as a member of the security cabinet, Parrinello Blanco outlined his emergency plan and emphasized that we cannot expect a miracle, meaning Guatemala cannot become the safest place in the world in 24 hours. He clearly said he will be strict, but he will abide by the law. He added that under his leadership, he and the security forces will respect human rights and work with honesty and without arrogance, disrespect, or abuse. Nevertheless, he said that although no miracles are expected, he is sure his emergency plan will make it possible to stabilize the country's security sector in two months. He explained that this entails orienting all crime prevention measures in three specific areas. The areas to attack are kidnapping, drug trafficking, and the crime that is now part of the citizens' daily lives -- attacks on bus passengers and pedestrians, for example. Minister Parrinello Blanco said that although violence and crime affect all Guatemalans, they mainly afflict the poorest people. The majority of them take to the streets and only protect themselves by making the sign of the cross and putting themselves in God's hands. I am interested in establishing conditions that protect everyone, particularly the people who worry about traveling by public transportation or walking to the bus stop or those who are being mugged at this moment. He insisted that his main goal is to improve conditions for everyone's safety but special emphasis will be given to the masses who carry their bimonthly pay or the money to buy the children's medicine or food in their pockets. Generally speaking, Minister Parrinello Blanco said he intends to act firmly so the state may guarantee the life and assets of all citizens. He also said he will act "with honesty and integrity, and without disrespect, abuse, or arrogance. We will be strict, but we will abide by the law," he insisted.
