With the Bosnian business Russia is back in force on the international scene, and you are publishing with Albin Michel [publishing house] a very interesting book, full of revelations, entitled "On the Razor's Edge," where you write about the recent failed coups. So that is at least two reasons -- there are plenty of others -- for inviting you to speak to us this morning. Moscow is a living city again: Everywhere you can see new shops, but the economic situation is still very worrying. What do you want to say to the West this morning in order to get real help? [Yeltsin] I don't want to persuade people any more. Look at the results. I have spent more than two years trying to persuade them -- nearly three. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten much from this. I am not going to try to persuade anyone anymore. Let the world and the Western countries, and their leaders understand for themselves that the situation in Russia influences the situation in the world as a whole, and whether it deteriorates. In general, we can carry out all our reforms by our own efforts. [Giesbert] Don't you feel basically, that the West has cast you off? [Yeltsin] It isn't so easy to cast me off. I will fight. Perhaps I will cast off my opponent, my rival. As for fate, the fate of Russia is set, and Russia will not turn away from the path it is following. Will there be aid from the West or won't there be? What we are talking about is this: We have to eliminate two-thirds of the strategic nuclear missiles as soon as possible, and to do this we need huge sums of money. Of course we don't have the money. If the West wants us not to have these missiles, then support us; if you refuse, if you want to live continuously in fear of these missiles, keep your money! [Giesbert] So you are saying that if we don't help you, there is likely to be chaos? [Yeltsin] No. You have understood it the wrong way round. Even if the West does not help us, Russia will follow its path of renewal and democracy based on a market economy, and respect for human rights at an international level. [Giesbert] In your opinion, is Helmut Kohl the statesman who has best understood Russia today? [Yeltsin] I have great respect for Bill Clinton, but he simply has not yet had enough time to study Russia in a serious way. Helmut Kohl, simply by virtue of seniority as chancellor, has had a real chance to get a good knowledge of the former Soviet Union and Russia. There is no such international scale to say one is better than another. [Geisbert] When we read your book, "On the Razor's Edge," it is clear that democracy is still fragile in Russia. Do you think there is still a danger of a coup? You have spoken optimistically, but anyone reading your book has the impression that things came very close to disaster. [Yeltsin] Well, of course, these two coups were an attempt to divert us from the path of democracy. But now I cannot see any serious forces which might hinder us on our path. Of course, as in any other country, there are communists, reds, and so on, who have their own program, who hinder us in a way. For example, we have signed a document on public accord, and of the 248 organizations -- parties, existing structures, movements, and social organizations -- which took part, 245 signed [the document]. The communists didn't sign. I am just sorry, and sorry for them, that they are the ones losing out, because they keep saying: We are for the people. But they did not sign the document on accord in Russia, to ensure that there should not be a civil war. [Giesbert] You have not talked about Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the abominable Zhirinovskiy. Isn't he a threat? [Yeltsin] No. [Giesbert] Are the Russians too intelligent to return to demagogy? [Yeltsin] Our people suffered more than anyone else from fascism in the war against fascist Germany. We lost 20 million people in it. [Geibert] A personal question, Mr. Yeltsin. When we read your book, we have the impression of a strong man, decisive and determined, but who is also able to question himself. Why do you disappear from time to time as you do? [Yeltsin] No, I am in good health. I am not ill. I do not miss work for health reasons, but there are important questions, important problems, documents that have to be worked on. For example, the treaty on public accord. It needed very special preparation. I took leave for 12 days, part of my annual leave, that I certainly have a right to take. I never use all of my annual leave. But in spring I take 12 days or so, and 12 or so days in the fall. Usually I use these vacation times to prepare important initiatives of work on some problem or other. I don't disappear anywhere, and I don't go away. [Geisbert] What are the main mistakes made by the West in the problem of former Yugoslavia? [Yeltsin] Of course, if we had united at the very beginning, if we had worked out a common viewpoint and approach as to how to put an end to this situation, we would have settled this situation much faster in a peaceful way. That is the most important thing. We all, we and the United States, and the United Nations and Europe, we were all too late. Once the fire had been kindled, it was much more difficult to put it out. [Giesbert] Today, the historic responsibility lies with you, because it depends on you. [Yeltsin] You mean Yugoslavia? [Giesbert] Yes. You are the arbiter. Because you are [word indistinct] led, because you are the only ones who can still talk to the Serbs. [Yeltsin] Well, yes, but there are not only the Serbs there. There are the Muslims and the Croats and other peoples. And then, we have gotten rid of our imperialist ambitions. We could not put pressure on them with our full weight, but with all of us together we could arrive at an agreement. [Giesbert] Basically, you see the fault as lying with the Serbs today? [Yeltsin] No, with all of those involved. [Geisbert] Mr. Yeltsin, let me recall the title of your book, published by Albin Michel: "On the Razor's Edge." What are you going to do now? Play tennis? [Yeltsin] I play on Tuesdays and Saturdays. [Giesbert] Are you going to take a freezing cold bath today? [Yeltsin] Yes, indeed. I do that every day. [Giesbert] Thank you, Mr. Yeltsin. Have a good bath and a good day.
