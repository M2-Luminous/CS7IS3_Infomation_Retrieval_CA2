This was reported to Interfax by a well-placed Gazprom source. The company's current gas supply to Moldova amounts to 5.7 million cubic meters a day. This year Moldova has not paid a single ruble to Gazprom, compensating for Russian gas partly in food supplies. A Russo-Moldovan agreement signed at the end of 1993 commits Moldova to supplying to Gazprom $145 million worth in food stuffs and consumer goods in partial payment for the delivery of up to 3.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas. Moldova now pays $80 for 1000 cubic meters of gas. To transport Russian gas across Moldova into Romania costs $1.5 per 1000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers of pipeline. Meanwhile, the talks between a Belarusian Government delegation and Gazprom officials, scheduled for mid-April, have been put off indefinitely because of the signing of a monetary integration accord. During the negotiations the sides were to look over the fulfillment of a Russo-Belarusian protocol on paying off the debt for Russian gas. This accord was signed on March 15, 1994.
