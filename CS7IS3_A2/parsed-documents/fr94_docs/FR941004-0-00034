FR941004-0-00034 FR941004-0-00011 Public Comment and EPA Response Besides responses from the State of Louisiana, the EPA received one comment on the proposed June 21, 1991, rulemaking in response to publication of the proposed approval. The Ohio EPA, Division of Air Pollution Control, submitted the following comment. The comment has been paraphrased to reflect what the EPA believes is an accurate summary of the commenters' concerns. In order for ERC to be valid, the 1977 process change should have occurred after the SIP baseline year in effect for ozone at the time of the submittal. This would ensure the emission reduction as surplus. The proposed rulemaking did not identify the SIP baseline year in effect when this bubble was submitted to the EPA on October 19, 1983. The EPA may want to require the affected storage tanks to meet the RACT regulations in the future ozone SIP without the benefit of the 1977 process change. EPA Response : The final ETPS of December 4, 1986 (51 FR 43814) sets out current policy for approving bubbles. The EPA policy differs depending on whether the bubble is in a nonattainment area with an approved attainment demonstration (NAWAD) or a nonattainment area lacking an approved attainment demonstration (NALAD). When this bubble was submitted to the EPA on October 19, 1983, Plaquemine and Iberville Parishes were considered NAWAD. With the subsequent SIP call on May 26, 1988, these two parishes were considered part of the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Statistical Area and, therefore, were converted to NALAD. The EPA has determined that different requirements should apply to a pending bubble in a SIP call area, such as this one. Namely, the existing bubble can continue to use the baseline that was consistent with the assumptions in the original attainment demonstration. For this bubble, the EPA interprets the baseline as the emission level established by the underlying Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) regulation. RACT, in this case, is determined by the regulation approved by the State of Louisiana in 1980 which requires incineration (a control device). This control device was already installed when the process improvement resulting in the additional reduction of VOC was made in 1977. The additional reductions result from the process improvement before the incinerator, thereby reducing the amount of VOC going to the control device. To be valid for trading purposes, an emission reduction must be surplus, enforceable, permanent, and quantifiable. First, Dow has shown that a significant VOC reduction was achieved, beyond what was required by RACT, by the process modification. Second, the emission reductions were made enforceable when the State issued to Dow a modified permit [Permit Number 1838T(M&hyph;2)] on October 16, 1991, that delineated the terms of the emission trade. Third, the emission reductions are permanent since the process change is permanent. Finally, the ERC's are quantifiable in that the VOC emissions can be calculated and the reduction in waste gases produced by the process can be measured. Therefore, the emission reduction credits associated with this bubble are valid. With regard to requiring the affected storage tanks to meet the RACT regulation in future ozone SIP's, much of this has already been accomplished. Waste gas vents (emission point 2L) have been rerouted for recovery by the ethylene recovery unit under State Permit Number 2032. The tanks used for hexane storage (emission points 8S and 8T) have been replaced by pressurized tanks under State Permit Number 2033. One of the methanol tank vents (emission point 6L) will be rerouted for recovery under State Permit Number 2037. Only one methanol tank vent (emission point 8X) remains uncontrolled as originally proposed. Emissions from this vent have been revised from 1.37 tons per year to 2.04 tons per year based on an increased turnover rate. Final Action The EPA is taking final action to approve the alternative emission reduction (bubble) plan for the Dow Chemical Plaquemine facility as submitted by the Governor of Louisiana in a letter dated October 19, 1983, and amended with a permit number 1838T(M&hyph;2) dated October 16, 1991, and State assurances provided in a letter from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality dated September 17, 1991.
