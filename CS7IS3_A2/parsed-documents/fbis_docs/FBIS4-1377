The government announced that the disarming of the civilian population was to begin on 25 April. Our colleague, Salvator Nvuyekure, met the prime minister, who elaborated on this: [Begin recording] [Nvuyekure] There is no question of decreasing pressure on the suburbs, where the disarmament operation currently is being implemented. After the ultimatum expired on 24 April, military forces for carrying out the operation were put in place. Since 24 April, efforts have been made to minimize the damage, so that innocent people are not victimized. Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko gave assurances that the operation is continuing, that it has not been halted. Military pressure continues so that, according to the prime minister, people gradually will hand over their weapons. The operation is related to re-establishing peace and security. There will be no backpedalling. [Kanyenkiko] Regarding this issue, the operation will continue as planned. We would like to limit human and material damage. This justifies the steps taken since 25 April to establish contact with the people who are involved in this issue, in order to make it easier to hand over the weapons. We do not want innocent people to pay the cost if armed groups take them hostage. If this peaceful method does not succeed, [words indistinct] arms must be carried out. [Nvuyekure] Some people say the armed groups and the security forces are negotiating. [Kanyenkiko] There are no negotiations. Between who and who? There are no negotiations at all. But as I told you, since 25-26 April we have been trying to talk to our representatives so as to find the best way of getting the weapons without human or material losses. There are no negotiations. This is just a method chosen to carry out the operation without losses. [Nvuyekure] [words indistinct] on the period that you will have to wait, one week, two weeks. [Kanyenkiko] You know, the management of a country calls for some degree of calm. That means that we shall try all possible means. After that, force will be used to maintain the law. [end recording] That should make it clear. There should be no more speculation or false rumors. The disarmament operation is under way. In principle, it must continue throughout the entire territory of the Republic.
