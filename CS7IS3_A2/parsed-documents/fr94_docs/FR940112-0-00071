FR940112-0-00071 FR940112-0-00020 In addition, we normally provide a delay of 30 days in the effective date for documents such as this. However, we may waive the delay in the effective date if we find good cause that adherence to this procedure would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to public interest. We believe that it is unnecessary to provide a 30-day delay in the effective date since the Conference Report language, as discussed previously, indicates that no further administrative action is necessary to effect the first phase of implementation, and section 4003(b) of Public Law 101&hyph;508 prescribes specific effective dates for the remaining two phases. The regulations in this interim final rule with comment period merely conform to the effective date requirements set forth in section 4003(b) of Public Law 101&hyph;508. Therefore, we find good cause to waive the usual 30-day delay. C. Collection of Information Requirements This document does not impose information collection and recordkeeping requirements. Consequently, it need not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). D. Response to Comments Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on FR documents published for comment, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider all comments we receive by the date and time specified in the DATES section of this preamble, and, if we proceed with a subsequent document, we will respond to the comments in the preamble to that document. VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis A. Executive Order 12291 Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impact analysis for any interim final rule with comment period that meets one of the E.O. 12291 criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that will be likely to result in_ •An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; •A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or •Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. This interim final rule with comment period is considered a major rule under E.O. 12291 criteria based on our cost projections for the next 5 Federal fiscal years (FYs). The following discussion constitutes a regulatory impact analysis. This interim final rule with comment period implements section 4003 of Public Law 101&hyph;508, which contains a provision that expands the timeframe for folding preadmission services into the Part A payment for the subsequent inpatient stay. The first sentence of section 1886(a)(4) of the Act is amended to include certain preadmission services, furnished by the hospital, or by an entity that is wholly owned or operated by the hospital, up to 3 days before the date of the patient's admission. This provision becomes effective in three phases. The first phase, effective November 5, 1990 through September 30, 1991, included services furnished the day before admission. This phase merely represented a statutory reiteration of the existing policy. The second phase, effective January 1, 1991, included diagnostic services that are furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission. The third phase, effective October 1, 1991, includes other services related to the admission that are furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission.
