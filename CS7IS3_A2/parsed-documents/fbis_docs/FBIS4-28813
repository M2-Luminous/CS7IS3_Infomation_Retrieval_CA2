The aid consists of 6.45 million dollars to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 2.4 million dollars to the International Committee of the Red Cross and 150,000 dollars to the World Health Organization, the ministry said. The conflict in Rwanda has been expanding and intensifying since disputes erupted between government and anti-government troops in early April. The ministry quoted UN sources as saying more than 500,000 people have died as a result of the fighting and massacres, while about 3 million people have either left their homes or fled to Tanzania, Burundi, Zaire and Uganda. But despite efforts by humanitarian organizations, the victims of the conflict are in disastrous condition because of the lack of food, drinking water and medical goods, the ministry said.
