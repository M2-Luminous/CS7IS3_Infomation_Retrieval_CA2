She had planned to visit Carazo, where drivers began demonstrations this morning. President Chamorro had been scheduled to inaugurate a few paved streets, some remodeled schools, and visit San Sebastian Basilica. Just after 0800, Carazo joined the transportation strike as more than 100 taxi drivers blocked the roads coming out of Jinotepe, which affected 95 taxi routes in the department. Currently, the government is meeting with four transportation sector organizations at the Presidency. Only two chambers and two federations that are members of the National Transportation Council, which was created by a government initiative, are attending the meeting. The drivers are discussing problems such as the increase in fuel prices and the repeal of laws and ministry resolutions that establish new taxes. At noon today, the Los Parrales-Vallejos group of the National Transportation Commission broke off negotiations with the Chamorro Government. The strike is gaining strength. Drivers have incited violence and tension in some main streets of the capital. Since this morning, the union of taxicab drivers has deployed vehicles and sparked demonstrators in places such as the Senderi, Repustula 15, and Rubenia neighborhoods and in the Ivan Montenegro Market. Armed with knives, taxi drivers have punctured the tires of those taxis that have dared to continue their regular operations.
