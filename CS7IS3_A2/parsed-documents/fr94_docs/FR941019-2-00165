FR941019-2-00165 FR941019-2-00088 The new oil lubricating system would contain approximately 200 gallons of oil and would eliminate one of the two lift pumps and its components, which should result in a decrease in the number of potential leakage sites. Of the four potential leakage sites, ARD vents and lower RCP motor leak detection system piping do not contain oil under routine operating conditions. The upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD are pressurized only during a brief period of motor startups and shutdowns. The lower guide bearing thermocouple wells are passive in nature. If leakage were to occur during normal plant operations, the oil would channel to the drain pan. Any lobe oil leak which may not have been fully captured could potentially run down the RCP motor onto hot Reactor Coolant System surfaces. However, the flammability characteristics of the oil, flashpoint of 452 ○F, and an auto ignition temperature of 500 ○F&hyph;700 ○F, that would be used in the lube oil system, reduce the likelihood that the oil will readily ignite upon coming in contact with hot RCS piping surfaces. Additionally, if the oil leak became ignited, the fire would be localized in the area of the leakage and detected by the thermal fire detectors. Fire protection features for the RCP motors include three temperature heat detectors with 190 ○F setpoints located over each RCP. Any localized fire in the area would result in an alarm function in both the reactor building and annunciate in the main control room. Additional indications of potential RCP fire are provided by control room alarms on low level oil, low oil pressure or high vibrations. It is expected that the control room operators would evaluate these alarms associated with the RCP and its lube oil system and initiate fire brigade entry into the reactor building to investigate and fight the fire. The reactor building is equipped with an internal firefighting standpipe hose station system and fire extinguishers are appropriately distributed throughout the structure. RCP firefighting would be accomplished by using either portable fire extinguishers or water from a hose stream or a combination of both. Access to the four RCPs for firefighting can be accomplished by making entry into the ``D'' rings. The existing Crystal River Unit 3 RCP motor lube oil system in a nonseismic system. The new RCP lube oil system and lube oil collection systems would be seismically qualified to withstand an SSE. Therefore, if an SSE were to occur, the system is not expected to fail. Based on the design features of the new RCP motors and associated lube oil collection systems, there is reasonable assurance that the RCP lube oil system will not lead to fire during normal and design basis accident conditions or present a major fire hazard during a seismic event. In addition, based on the present level of fire protection provided for the RCPs and the fact that the plant has a trained fire brigade, if a fire were to occur in the area of RCP lube oil system ARD vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD, lower motor leak detection system piping, and lower guide bearing thermocouple wells, there is reasonable assurance that the fire condition will be detected and mitigated. IV For the foregoing reasons, the NRC staff has concluded that the licensee's proposed implementation of the RCP lube oil system with the four potential leakage sites (the ARD vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD, lower motor leak detection system piping, and lower guide bearing thermocouple wells not equipped with an oil collection system) will not present an undue risk to public health and safety and is consistent with the common defense and security. The NRC staff has determined that there are special circumstances present, as specified in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), such that application of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III. 0, as it relates to the oil collection at four specific sites in the RCP, is not necessary in order to achieve the underlying purpose of this regulation. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), an exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants Florida Power Corporation an exemption from those requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III. 0, relating to oil collection in the RCP. This exemption is applicable only to the four potential leakage sites in the RCP lube oil system: the ARD vents, upper oil supply lines from the lift pump to the ARD, lower motor leak detection system piping, and lower guide bearing thermocouple wells. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant adverse environmental impact (59 FR 48338).
