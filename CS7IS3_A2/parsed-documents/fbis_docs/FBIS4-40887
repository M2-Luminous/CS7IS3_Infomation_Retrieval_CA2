There is no doubt, however, that this visit will become a hallmark in the history of the young Ukrainian state. Having signed the agreement on Ukraine's partnership and cooperation with the European Union [EU], Leonid Kravchuk, speaking figuratively, opened for our state the door to Europe. The meaning of this step will be fully assessed in the future. Meanwhile, we want to emphasize that Ukraine was the first of the former USSR republics to make this step. Both in Ukraine and near abroad, certain people view the "Luxembourg breakthrough" as definite orientation by Ukraine toward the West. However, is this actually so? Speaking at a news conference at Seningen Palace, which served as the Ukrainian president's official residence, Leonid Kravchuk underlined that we have equal interest in good-neighborly relations and mutually advantageous relations with all nations -- East, West, North, or South. Shortly after those statements, speaking at Boryspil airport, the president placed special emphasis on the development and consolidation of Ukrainian relations with Russia. Thus, our state is by no means going to curb these. On the contrary: It is in Ukraine's vital interest (probably just as in our eastern neighbor's interest) that our relations consolidate and are of a stable and mutually advantageous nature. However, would it do any harm to our state if it finds new promising directions for cooperation, including in a westerly direction? I think that the answer to this question is evident. Yet, once we asked it, let us cite the opinions of renowned experts to find out how Ukraine is going to benefit from cooperation with the EU and what possibilities are opened by the Luxembourg agreement. This is how the URYADOVYY KURYER question was answered. European Commission Chairman Jacques Delors: "This is a very important agreement for Ukraine. It will help Ukraine consolidate its sovereignty and carry out a gradual, and what is more, soft transition to an efficient economy in the interests of its people. "I would like to especially single out this point for your readers: Ukraine is the first of the former USSR states to sign an agreement with the EU. Before the signing, we held detailed discussions with the Ukrainian president about the acute problems facing your state, and how to expeditiously make the agreement work to help Ukraine resolve these problems. I want to add that both I and other European Commission members will everything in our power to achieve this goal." Borys Oliynyk, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council Commission for Foreign Affairs and CIS Relations: "I believe that Tuesday 14 June is indeed a significant day, and not only for Ukraine, but for all of Europe as well, because we are returning to Europe. Or rather, not returning but turning our face toward it, because we often turned our back on it. This is not an ordinary everyday event. It is opening new prospects for us. I am not going to sink in euphoria. Today, the Ukrainian president pointed out that we have secured a base. This is correct, but we now have to `grow roots' in this base. The return to Europe does not mean that we are turning away from our other neighbors. No matter where our partners are geographically located, we have to turn our face to them. This would be honest policy." Oleh Slepichev, Ukrainian minister of external economic relations: "The very name of the agreement explains its meaning -- it deals with both cooperation and partnership. Take trade and economic relations for instance. Ukraine needs markets, including European markets. However until now, the European market was for all intents and purposes closed to us. First, it is being protected with quotas, and second, with the so-called antidumping legislation. The agreement gives us the chance to overcome this barrier and enter the European market. This will help shore up our production and improve the quality of exported goods. On the other hand, the signing of the agreement amounts to Ukraine's breakthrough to GATT. Support from GATT members is very important to us, and the EU is among the most influential members of this organization. Besides, it is vital for Ukraine that it is recognized as a state undergoing a transition from centrally managed economy to a market. This would give us the chance to enjoy GATT privileges for a certain period of time, regarding the selling of our products on foreign markets. In other words, the Luxembourg agreement is our great political victory." Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Makarenko: "The agreement lays the political-legislative groundwork for Ukraine's relations with EU states, which would be equal to, civilized, and advantageous for us. Work on drafting this document was very strenuous and lasted for almost a year. There was a series of talks and expert conferences in both Kiev and Brussels. The negotiation process was significantly accelerated after the issue of eliminating Ukrainian nuclear weapons was resolved. What is the essence of the 14 June agreement? This is quite a voluminous document comprising 100 articles and a number of provisos. The introduction to this document emphasizes that EU states recognize Ukraine's independence and support its sovereignty and territorial integrity. A significant portion of the agreement deals with the issues of Ukraine's trade and economic relations with the EU, including, in particular, the issue of a transitional period in trade between them. This period is to last until 31 December 1998, after which Ukraine's admission to the free trade zone could be discussed. Thus, the agreement opens broad prospects for Ukraine's existence on the European continent. The decisive word is to be had by the Ukrainian legislature, which has to ratify the agreement." This is what our and foreign senior officials think about the agreement. As we see it, despite all the nuances, the general conclusion made by them is: Integration with the EU is not only advantageous for Ukraine -- it is imperative. Even more so since sooner or later all European states will approach and join the EU. Europe does not have any other option. Russia is closer than anybody else to following Ukraine's example. This may happen in near future. Yet, our state was the first to make this step. How can one explain why it was Ukraine that was given this chance? I have asked Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to answer this question. President Kravchuk: "Two factors must have had their effect on this matter. The first is the political, international factor. This is a confirmation of the role Ukraine is currently playing. I think and hope that European and world nations have seen the persistence of our domestic and foreign policies even in such extremely complicated situations as the resolution of the problem of nuclear arms, relations with our neighbors, the Crimean issue, or the division of the Black Sea Fleet. Everybody sees that Ukraine is acting in accordance with the law, the Constitution, abiding by the principles proclaimed by the United Nations, its Security Council, and the CSCE. This cannot pass unnoticed. Thus, by signing the agreement, not only respect toward Ukraine was demonstrated, but also our state's actual role in the European process marked. There is also the other, so to say, technical side -- our departments, including the Foreign Ministry, worked more efficiently [than foreign ones] to achieve this goal." Europe, in which world wars have flared twice in this century, for the last 50 years has been building relations on norms that are civilized, peaceful, and generally acceptable for all the states. The EU, which comprises the Western states of our continent, has become an influential force in this process. The mission of the young Ukrainian state, which is establishing its position in the world and, primarily, in the European homeland, is to find the shortest way of rapprochement with the EU. From this perspective, Leonid Kravchuk's 14 June visit to Luxembourg and the documents signed there should be viewed as an event of European scale and historic significance.
