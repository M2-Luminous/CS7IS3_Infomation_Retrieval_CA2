An important statement was issued following the meetings of the political forces' dialogue committee. Following is the text of the statement: In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. A statement to the nation's people issued by the political forces' dialogue committee on 13 January 1994: Praise be to God Who says: And hold fast, all together, by the rope which Allah stretches out for you, and be not divided among yourselves [Koranic verse]. Peace and blessings be upon the master of all prophets, the messenger of love and guidance, who said: No believer shall be considered a believer until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself. Our esteemed people: Our beloved country is experiencing a sharp political crisis which has threatened all the Yemenis' dreams for a unified, democratic, and developed society. Had it not been for the grace of God, the wisdom of the sons of Yemen, and the sincere sentiments of its brothers and friends, Yemen would have gone down a road which would have distressed its lovers and pleased its haters. Governed by the logic of reason and wisdom, the Yemenis have opted for dialogue and tolerance rather than stubbornness and blind fanaticism. They have also opted for avoiding rather than obeying destructive tendencies. All political forces went to the dialogue table after agreeing on adopting dialogue as the sole way to resolve the crisis and to settle differences. All parties have agreed to renounce all forms and means of violence. The political forces' dialogue committee has started its work by setting up committees which will work to halt the media, security, and military repercussions. This is order to provide a calm atmosphere that is committed to a logical and serious dialogue. The political forces' dialogue committee has laid down the necessary measures to halt these repercussions. Despite the continuation of some repercussions and some parties' violation of the committee's past decisions, the political forces' dialogue committee has continued its work effectively. This is out of its concern for the supreme objectives and to pay no attention to trivialities. Through its continued meetings in Sanaa and Aden, the polticial forces' dialogue committee reached a full agreement on most issues raised for dialogue. They dealt with the essential causes of the frequent political crises and the need for radical solutions to ensure that they do not reoccur. The political forces' dialogue committee has placed on the table all views, papers, and proposals that have been raised by political forces from inside and outside the authority. The dialogue committee has received important documents on the foundations of the building of the modern Yemeni state, the state of law and order and institutions, a state that is based on justice, equality, freedom, democracy, and decentralization of the local government system. Such principles are based on the Islamic faith and law and respect for human rights. The political forces' dialogue committee had been eager to accomplish its work within a period not to go beyond 10 January 1994. However, in view of the nature of the dialogue, and out of their concern about reaching a complete agreement, the political forces have decided that more time is needed before such an agreement is reached. It has set 18 January as a final date for the political forces' dialogue committee to finish the document of pledge and reconciliation, to set a mechanism and a timetable for its implementation, and to agree in principle on the place and date of the ceremonies of singing the document. The political forces' dialogue committee stressed that the document is an advanced and important step. However, the implementation of its contents is the most important step that is being impatiently awaited by our people. In view of the importance of following up and monitoring the steps of implementation, the political forces dialogue committee must continue to exist as a popular committee to follow up the steps of implementation and to monitor the abidance of the parties to the coalition by the timetable of implementation. The committee should keep the masses apprised of the progress of implementation and should specify the stands of all parties on it without equivocation, concealment, or deception. Pledging before God and the people to be sincere in its proposals and faithful in its actions, the political forces' committee asks the parties that have some reservations to put them aside in the interest of the homeland. It also asks all parties to avoid anything that would spoil the climate of the dialogue and exacerbate the situation. They should abide by all the measures that the committee has approved and vowed before the people to respect. Whoever disowns his pledge, violates his commitments, or drags Yemen down a road that neither satisfies God nor the people--be it through verbal abuses, violations, or failure to implement what has been committed to--will be held responsible before history and the people. God testifies to our sincere intentions.
