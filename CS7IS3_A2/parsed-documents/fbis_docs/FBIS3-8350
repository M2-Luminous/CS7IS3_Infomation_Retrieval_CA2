We talked to him about the present situation in Herceg-Bosna, the tasks of the ministry of defense, the Croat negotiating position, the future of the Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and many other issues. A Long Chess Game [Marusic] Mr. Soljic, there have been many changes following the session in Livno, Herceg-Bosna. Do these only concern new people who should improve the former positions, or a fundamental change of Croatian policies in and toward Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Soljic] Many reporters attended the session of the Chamber of Representatives in Livno, and public reports of the Presidential Council sessions and the sessions of the Government of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna are regularly issued. There are no other facts whereby I could give a more complete answer to your question than what the aforementioned bodies have already said about it. I see this whole issue as a chess game that will be played for a long time, and I cannot give a final assessment on the basis of one or several moves. The basic aims of the policies of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, I believe, Croatian politics as well, will not be questioned. The Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina can be certain that every inch of Croat land is taken into consideration, as is each Croat in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it is simply impossible to satisfy each individual interest here -- as not all Russians will live in Russia, all Germans in Germany, or all Serbs in Serbia, so not all Croats will live in the Republic of Croatia or in the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, but, with the existence of the Croat state and the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, the freedom and the rights of all the Croats outside these areas will be guaranteed. We will achieve the maximum possible in this situation. [Marusic] Let us summarize: The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna (after all) remains the foundation-stone of Croatian policies in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Soljic] That is our orientation, and it will not change. There is no sovereignty without territory. [Marusic] Nevertheless, many, particularly the opposition, which has been especially hard on the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna policies, have assessed the placing of Boban's mandate "at the disposal of the present" as the defeat and ruin of a policy -- the policy of the "Herzegovinian lobby," as they like to say. Mr. Budisa's [president of the Croatian Social Liberal Party] comment was that "the Herzegovinians do not realize that Yugoslavia has fallen to ruins, but that they will still not live in Croatia." [Soljic] I would like to send all those who disagree with the policies of Herceg-Bosna, and who question this idea, to central Bosnia, so that they can ask the Croats there if they support Herceg-Bosna and if they mind the "Herzegovinian lobby." As far as Budisa's statement is concerned, it is possible that Herzegovinians will not be in Croatia -- it is one of the realistic variants. However, if the Croatian state exists, they will be freer than they have ever been. Otherwise, the positions of part of the opposition is quite unfair, whenever the Croats in Herceg-Bosna are at issue. If they do not appreciate the contribution of the Croats of Herceg- Bosna and Bosnia-Herzegovina to the fact that the Croatian state exists, and that it will exist, then there is nothing to discuss there. We have shown how much we love Croatia at the referendum, when we simply voted against our common sense -- for Bosnia- Herzegovina, just so that Croatia could exist. It is sad that whoever does not bear that in mind, appreciate and respect it, should declare themselves a Croat. [Marusic] You have been elected defense minister from among very strong competition. Certain circles were somewhat surprised by your nomination. What is your position on that, and what is the truth about your appointment to the position of defense minister? Can a successful businessperson be a successful defense minister? [Soljic] I would not like to talk about the reasons for my appointment -- those who elected me should talk about that. I can only say that I am honored. Both those who held this position before me, and those who could have been appointed instead of me are people who are implementing a program. I am certain that I will find a way to have all of them help me in carrying out this task, which, at the moment, is the most important one for all of us. I belong to neither a formal party, nor to any non-formal group. I do not agree with any division of Croats on a regional or any other basis, other than that concerning whether a person supports our general policies, whether they work and want to work, and nothing else. The answer to the second part of your question is yes -- I will do my best, and let others talk about the results. If I or someone else decides that I am not carrying out my duties satisfactorily, there will be ways of solving that. I will accept it as reality, because any job in politics is a seasonal one: Everyone who is elected will either be replaced, or their mandate will expire. More Rights Than the Mojahedin [Marusic] What do you intend to do when you begin your duties -- will you start from where your predecessor left off, or with something completely new? What has not worked so far, and how should it be corrected? [Soljic] I never start from the assumption that the world starts with me, and I respect what has been done well, but I will try to improve what has not been done well. Reorganization is under way, and I believe we will complete it successfully. I do not want to analyze the causes of certain mistakes -- I can only say that many of them were made for objective reasons -- from entering the fight spontaneously to certain people growing tired and the fighting becoming complicated.... I cannot say that it has been bad, it is just that the circumstances have changed, and a new organization needs to be found for the new circumstances, for which we will need new people. [Marusic] How do you view the frequent accusations in the past several months concerning open military involvement of the HVO in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Soljic] I have not met either a formation or an individual whose superior is anyone other than myself. Defending the territories of Herceg-Bosna is the moral right of the citizens of the Republic of Croatia -- our citizens did the same at the beginning of the war in Croatia. However, we are not asking them to, and we will not do so, because there is no need. There are enough Croats who are originally from Herceg-Bosna and want to come to Herceg-Bosna from Croatia and defend their homeland. They have much more right to do so than, for instance, the Mojahedin. Let the same hold for us and the others. [Marusic] What are the chances of peace in Mostar? Whose city will it be, and what about the establishment of a protectorate? [Soljic] For, when the question arises what the capital of the "Serb republic" is, or what the capital of the Muslim people is, there are not many dilemmas, I would like to ask everyone who has a different opinion what the capital of the Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina is indeed. There is no other possible answer than the city of Mostar, since the Croats, too, have the right to a city that has a university, an airport, and the rest of the city infrastructure. Therefore, Mostar will remain the capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. As far as concerns the citizens of Mostar who are of Serb or Muslim nationality, I believe that Mostar can offer them more as capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna than as a city in any other republic. We will try to find a satisfactory solution for the coexistence of all three peoples in these areas. There will be no coexistence on the basis of brotherhood and unity, but only on the basis of partnership. In all this, the establishment of a protectorate represents another goodwill gesture on the part of the Croats. [Marusic] Lately there have been many meetings of the Croat and Muslim representatives (Frankfurt, Washington), and the ceasefire agreement has been signed by generals Roso and Delic. However, reports from the ground still talk of new Muslim attacks. [Soljic] There have been many cease-fire agreements. Judging by experience, I am not sure this signature will be the right one. Nevertheless, one cease-fire must be the right one. However, the situation in which there are three players is very complicated, and in these areas there is also the conflict of interest of the superpowers and the neighboring countries. Try as we might, it is not only up to us to decide. However, much depends on our power. There is no such criterion, if applied the same way to all, that would leave the Croats unsatisfied. The Croats simply never had the intention to take what does not belong to them. [Marusic] Under the pressure of the United States, the existence of Bosnia-Herzegovina is viewed exclusively through the alliance of Croats and Muslims. It seems that the international community is prepared to acknowledge the results of the Serb aggression. Do you believe in the restoration of the Croat-Muslim alliance? [Soljic] Generally speaking, it is wrong to talk of a single solution in politics. As far as the international community is concerned, it simply recognizes force or power to a greater or lesser extent, and this will be the case with the results of the Serb aggression. That is certain already. It will perhaps not be to the extent the Serbs expect, but as soon as aggression is acknowledged, it is a bad sign. Regarding the latest proposals for a federation/confederacy, I think that the representatives of the Croat people will be able to find a satisfactory solution. Indeed, when there is a war, it is difficult to discuss an alliance or friendship. However, a way will have to be found of living one next to another, or one with another -- that is a matter of politics. The Croat experience of life in a community has mostly been bad. However, I think that a way will be found that will suit the Croat people best and that is possible in this situation. We Will Stop All Offensives [Marusic] If these peace initiatives fail, it is certain that in the next few weeks the great spring Muslim offensive, which has been announced, will follow. Will the HVO be able to defend the Croat territories if this offensive occurs? [Soljic] There should be no doubt about the defense of the Croat territories. We were able to stop one of the most powerful armies with hunting guns and tanks at Siroki Brijeg with our bare hands, and there should be no doubt about whether we can stop a Muslim offensive. We are certainly capable of doing so. The weakness that occurred at the beginning of the conflict with the Muslims, when we entered it unprepared for a classic Muslim betrayal, cannot happen again. The Croat people can be certain that these territories will be defended.
