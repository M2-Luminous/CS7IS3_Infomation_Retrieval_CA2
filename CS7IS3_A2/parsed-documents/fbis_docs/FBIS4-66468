(SJAC), announced the results of its survey of aircraft procurements made by the Defense Agency during the period of FY90 through FY94 (based on the budget request amounts). According to the survey, although the procurement amount in FY90 consisted of ¥355.3 billion from domestic suppliers and ¥4.2 billion from overseas suppliers, the latter being only about 1% of the total amount, the percentage of procurement from overseas gradually increased as a result of the need to correct the Japan-U.S. trade imbalance; in FY93, the domestic procurement was cut to ¥189.4 billion, or about half of what it was previously, and the overseas procurement was sharply increased to ¥117.3 billion, accounting for about one-third of the total amount. The overseas procurement in FY94 is expected to remain at a high level of ¥113.9 billion. All defense-related manufacturers here are quite concerned about the sharp increase in the share of the overseas procurement in addition to the general tendency of defense budget reduction. While the total aircraft procurement in FY90, mainly consisting of the frontal equipment, was ¥359.5 billion, that figure dropped to about ¥270 billion in FY91 and FY92 as a result of the end of the Cold War. The amount increased in FY93 and FY94 because of the fact that the procurement of two AWACS [airborne warning and control system] (about ¥55 billion) was included. It continued to grow in FY93, rising to ¥306.7 billion, and it is expected to be about ¥337.1 in FY94; however, it is still lower than FY90. Domestic procurement also dropped from its peak in FY90 to ¥189.4 billion, or about half of the peak value, in FY93. In FY94, however, it is expected to recover to ¥223.2 billion. Overseas procurement, however, sharply increased to 38.2% in FY93 and 33.8% in FY94, from 1.2% in FY90. There is a difference of night and day between the trends in the domestic and overseas procurements.
