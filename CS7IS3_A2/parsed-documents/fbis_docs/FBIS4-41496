The meeting is also attended by members of the two cabinets and legislators of the two republics which are members of the Russian Federation. ITAR-TASS learnt from sources close to the North Ossetian president that the sides are discussing a procedure for returning and settling refugees and displaced persons at places where they predominantly lived in the villages of Chermen, Dongaron, Dachnoye and Kurtat in the Prigorodnyy district, North Ossetia. The sides are to sign a document called upon to settle the problem. The document says that, in compliance with the decrees of the president of the Russian Federation and the Kislovodsk agreement, the North Ossetian Government and the Ingush Government will create, with direct participation of the temporary administration, conditions for a comprehensive solution of the problem of refugees and displaced persons, in line with the principles of mutual respect, racial peace and accord, territorial integrity of the republics and observance of law. The leaderships of the North Ossetian Republic and of the Ingush Republic as well as the temporary administration proceed from the premise that both residents in the four villages and returning residents will take obligations to abide by the laws of the Russian Federation and the North Ossetian Republic, to refrain from kindling ethnic stife, to recognise the territorial integrity of the North Ossetian republic in the existing administrative territorial borders and to fulfill decisions of legal bodies of power and administration.
