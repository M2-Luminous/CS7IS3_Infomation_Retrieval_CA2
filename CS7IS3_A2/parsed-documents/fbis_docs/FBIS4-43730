At 12 billion marks, exports only reached 30 percent of 1989's level, the Federal Statistical Office announced in Wiesbaden today. The office said the political and economic changes in the former Eastern Bloc states were responsible for the fall in exports. Exports to these countries had dropped to 20 percent of the level of 1989 but still made up 52 percent of eastern German exports.
