"Korea International Tourist Corporation in Macao" is the name of North Korea's such office in Macao. In the mid-seventies, North Korea opened it to attract foreign tourists to Pyongyang and to promote its trade with other countries. Many people have so far denounced, however, that this office has played a great role as a base of the North Korean intelligence organization's overseas activities in Southeast Asia without doing its own business, such as tourism and trade. Recently this office was closed and stopped issuing visas for tourists to go to North Korea. It is, therefore, very significant. On 30 March, a female clerk working in this office said to a person who visited there to apply for visa: "We no longer handle visa or consular business in Macao. If you want to apply for a visa, you should go to Beijing, China." She also said that "North Korean officials in the office had already left Macao for Beijing." North Korea's past kidnapping of actress Choe Un-hui is a model case of its overseas operational activities through the office in Macao. Actress Choe was kidnapped by North Korean agents in Hong Kong in early 1978, then transferred to North Korea via its office in Macao. The overseas activities of the North Korean Macao office reached the peak of its intelligence activity with the explosion of KAL [Korean Air] 858 by Kim Hyon-hui in 1987. Kim Hyon-hui studied Chinese language there, as well as received a training course to adapt herself to capitalist society from July 1985 to January 1987, immediately before the explosion of KAL 858 took place. Since the incident by Kim Hyon-hui, the Macao Government has expelled some North Korean officials from Macao and kept an eye on the others who worked in the office because of the ROK Government's strong protest. As a result, since then, the office -- which at one time had more than 30 employees -- have reduced the number of its employees by ten. Also, the number of North Korean residents in Macao have decreased from 380 to 100 since the late 1980's. It has not been disclosed why North Korea has closed down the office in Macao. It can be assessed, however, that North Korea could close the office under the following reasons: the reduction of its value as a base for overseas intelligence activity, the rapid reduction of foreign tourists to North Korea through Macao since the North Korean nuclear issue has emerged, and the difficulties in maintaining the office as a result of its economic situation.
