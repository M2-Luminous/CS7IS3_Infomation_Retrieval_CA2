The comptroller general made his statement before the legislature's Budget Commission after Christian Democratic Party legislator Gabriel Arosemena asked him about the possibility that the government would declare a national moratorium to delay payments to the IFIS [international financial institutions] and would use those funds to compensate for the budget cuts. Chen Barria emphatically denied such steps would be taken and he warned a national moratorium declaration would result in worse conditions than those trying to be resolved with the budget cuts. The comptroller general indicated that 37 cents of every dollar that enters the public treasury is earmarked for IFIS payments. Chen Barria warned that Panama is a country which needs foreign credits to make investments because it cannot accomplish much with its internal savings. The comptroller general met with members of the legislative commission to evaluate the consequences of the budget cuts that were made as a result of the delay in disbursements by the IFIS. The disbursements were delayed because Panama has not met the IFI's demands. After reaching an agreement with the comptroller general, the budget commission decided to suspend a move to reject the budget cuts until a meeting with ministers and other cabinet members is held. Legislators will meet with members of the executive branch to seek alternatives to save some investment projects in the districts, a sector which suffered a drastic $46.5 million cutback. Chen Barria said the legislators should first establish which district projects are most important and then meet with ministers and agency directors to determine if they can make adjustments within their remaining budget to carry out some of these district projects.
