Willy Claes, on an official visit to that country, encouraged his interlocutors to associate themselves with Europe. On Tuesday evening [5 April] he directed the Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra, which had included the Symphony in D minor by Cesar Franck on the program. During his visit, the Belgian foreign minister met President Zhelev, Acting Prime Minister Matinchev, National Assembly Chairman Yordanov, and his counterpart Stanislav Daskalov. The declaration signed by the two foreign ministers after their talks called for "stronger political dialogue, military (...) and economic cooperation in a better atmosphere." During a news conference, Claes dealt with the theme of the enlargement of the European Union [EU] and the Bulgarian authorities' aspirations to benefit from it. "You have signed an association agreement with the EU which must be ratified by the member states, in principle before the end of this year," he said. "This agreement must be considered as the final step before membership. The EU does not negotiate integration with other blocs but with individual countries (...) and makes no distinction between the countries of Central and East Europe. The process is being delayed because the 12 member states are not ready to receive candidate countries. Once agreement has been reached about Europe's future, which is to lead to a political union and at the same time to economic and monetary union, once effective decisionmaking methods have been found, we will be ready to discuss enlargement with the countries of Central Europe." So, Claes made an appointment for after 1996. He thinks that for the time being, no East European country is capable of joining the EU. A double message filtered through his comments: He recommended making maximum use of all the cooperation formulas in the association agreements with the EU, rather than bearing all the obligations linked to membership. At the same time, he linked political and economic integration and military integration. The Belgian foreign minister also referred to the difficulties Bulgaria experienced following the UN embargo against Serbia and Montenegro. "Europe is providing indirect compensation," he said. "Bulgaria has received some ECU240 million in aid for its balance of payments." In a few weeks new aid measures should be taken, he added. But in his eyes, it was of course more important to "obtain as quickly as possible a peace agreement that could normalize economic cooperation in this region." Finally, Claes was very pleased about the success of his visit. He said he was happy to have met "people who want to realize a political democracy, but who still have important work to do in the field of economic reforms." He expressed his conviction that Belgium could help Bulgaria both from the bilateral and multilateral point of view so that it could belong to the "great European society based on the respect of human rights and democracy."
