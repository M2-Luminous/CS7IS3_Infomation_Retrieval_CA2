FR940830-0-00005 FR940830-0-00002 Currently, strawberry plants are imported into the United States only from Canada and Israel and only by one importer. Furthermore, this importer is not a small entity by Small Business Administration standards (having 100 or fewer employees). Therefore, prohibiting the import of strawberry plants from all foreign countries except Canada and Israel would not have a significant economic impact on small entities. No currant plants are now imported into the United States from New Zealand. Prohibiting their import from New Zealand thus will not have a significant economic impact on small entities. Finally, we were not able to obtain any information on the domestic production or import of either species of Howea ; we believe this is because Howea is neither produced domestically nor imported on a large scale. We anticipate, therefore, that prohibiting the import into the United States of both species of Howea from everywhere except Lord Howe Island, New South Wales, Australia, will not have a significant economic impact on small entities. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0579&hyph;0049) Done in Washington, DC, this 24th day of August 1994. Lonnie J.
