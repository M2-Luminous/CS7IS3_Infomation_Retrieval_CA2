[passage omitted] "We strongly deny that the Khmer Rouge recaptured the base. The news...is exaggerated," Cambodian military spokesman General Nhean Manou said. "The Khmer Rouge have shelled us every day with 300 to 400 rounds since February 19 and we have withdrawn some men from the frontlines at Anlung Veng," he said. But another military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said government troops were under heavy pressure and were forced to withdraw to positions up to 10 kilometers (six miles) to the south and west of the base. The 10-kilometer line is the position where the government troops launched their offensive last August. Western diplomats said they could not confirm that the Khmer Rouge had taken the base but said it was possible as it was difficult for the government to send supplies to the men stationed in the remote and inhospitable area.
