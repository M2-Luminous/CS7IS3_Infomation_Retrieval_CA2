According foreign news reports, the U.S. State Department released an annual report on terrorism on 9 May. In the report, the State Department cited totally distorted and fabricated material and tried to brand our country as a terrorist state. The U.S. Administration publishes an annual report on terrorism every year, putting the label of terrorism on other nations which do not meekly obey it. This is a customary practice for veiling its ill fame as the biggest breeding ground of state and individual terrorism. Today the DPRK is the main target of U.S. terrorism. The United States has persistently hatched every conceivable plot against it. The U.S. State Department abused the DPRK again over the terrorist issue. It is an anachronistic act based on the U.S. hostile policy for impairing the image of the DPRK and stifling it, as it has done over the nuclear issue. The DPRK rejects all manner of terrorism, proceeding from the fundamental principle of the chuche idea that sets greatest store by human dignity and value. It also opposes any act encouraging and supporting terrorism. The world community well knows of this. The United States, known as the chieftain of terrorism, should mind its own business, instead of impudently trying to brand other nations as terrorist states. This would be better for the United States itself.
