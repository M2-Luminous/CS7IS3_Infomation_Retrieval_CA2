The document contains proposals for concrete forms of cooperation with NATO. It stresses the need for the Slovak Army to attain such a degree of "compatibility and inter-operability" which is necessary for smooth cooperation and for Slovakia's later integration into the NATO military structures. Slovakia is interested in cooperation particularly in the areas of defense planning, legislation, command and management, human resources management and crisis management, deployment of armed forces for humanitarian assistance and in the case of nature disasters, communications and information systems, in logistics and in military science and research. Slovakia has been the sixth country to submit its presentation document in Brussels and the first former communist country to publish the document in full and to give it to journalists.
