This has played a decisive role in maintaining the pace of economic development in our province. To continue the rapid development of town and township enterprises, we must make a breakthrough in enhancing our understanding. We must have sense of crisis and emergency. Party and government leaders at all levels must place the development of town and township enterprises on their agendas. Main leaders must grasp it personally. They must persist in the idea of doing two types of work simultaneously. They must grasp the development of town and township enterprises, and lose no time in improving them. As far as measures are concerned, they must adjust their targets of struggle to ensure the fulfillment of the task of increasing these enterprises' production output value to 150 billion yuan. It is necessary to open up markets, increase product sales, and establish sales teams for the markets for town and township enterprises. It is necessary to carry out activities of emulation and appraisal through comparison so as to create a situation of each and every enterprise trying to overtake the other. It is necessary to put the enhancement of management level on the agenda. Management must be put on a scientific and modern basis, and efforts must be made to attach importance to training qualified personnel so as to increase the quality of working personnel in town and township enterprises.
