Treasury Bonds Too Must Be Marketable and Adapted To Demand Any new product that enters the market will have to stand the test of the market. If its sales are sluggish, the first check should concern itself with the product itself, for instance, whether consumers find price, quality, style, or after-sale services acceptable or not, how well the world is aware of the product, whether it has been sufficiently publicized, whether it has made an impression on the minds of the people, and how the product ranks in its competition with similar products. If there is nothing questionable in these respects, the product is bound to find favor in the eyes of the consumers. The accuracy of this principle has indeed been well revealed in the course of marketing treasury bonds since 1981. In its present era of sustained economic development, China is faced with an extremely serious contradiction in the supply and demand of capital funds for its entire economic operations. Raising capital for its construction projects, through an appropriate amount of borrowing, in order to stimulate the economy toward sustained and solid development has, therefore, become a matter of major significance. This year the task of placing treasury bonds will be further enhanced beyond the foundation laid in 1993. Faced with this grim challenge, we must free ourselves from old ideas, update our concepts, and we must also, while consciously and firmly resolved to develop the socialist market economy, become highly proficient in matters of placing government bonds, so that the sale of government bonds will proceed more actively and more effectively in the new year. Issuing government bonds amounts to fiduciary borrowing by the state and the government from the people, and establishing with the subscribers to such bonds, on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis and on certain conditions, a relationship of creditor and debtor. Buying government bonds and paying taxes are two completely different concepts. Characteristic of the former is its voluntary and remunerative nature, while the latter is compulsory and without remuneration. If these two concepts are confused and become mixed up, actual work will end up in devious aberrations. The voluntary character is therefore an unshakeable principle in government bond subscriptions. In marketing the bonds, it is not sufficient to have the masses regard buying government bonds as doing one's bounden duty or merely as a patriotic act, they must rather fully understand and recognize it as a profit-motivated investment alternative. As the socialist market economy is developing further and as the people are becoming ever more knowledgeable about financial matters, this alternative of acquiring government bonds is becoming a more rational alternative. Under the past system of the unitary planned economy, financial assets of China's citizens showed up only as savings deposits, while now, the investment tendency is toward shares and high-yield bonds (government bonds essentially occupy an insignificant place in the vast majority of households). There is here actually an imbalance in the structure of financial assets of households. During 1993, in spite of a large-scale political mobilization and of raising interest rates twice, the issuing of government bonds still did not proceed satisfactorily, and this is a matter that deserves serious thought. Ample consideration to the economic capability of the masses to take up bonds and to the psychological threshold of the masses must be precondition before we zealously strive to create the macroclimate that is needed for the successful placing of government bonds. History has proven that the effective way of propagandizing government bonds is not to merely stress the financial advantages for the government or the financial advantages for the investors. The correct way is, on the one hand, an intensified mobilization of political thought, and, on the other hand, continuous arousal of investment fervor among the masses. This is the only way to gradually nurture a healthy investment attitude. It should not be a matter of the government wanting me to buy government bonds, but rather that it is I who needs to buy government bonds. 2. Serious Efforts To Improve Operations, Perfecting the Image of Government Bonds To ensure timely fulfillment of this year's task of placing government bonds, it is in my opinion necessary to do a good job in the following respects: A. Governments at all levels must foster an overall point of view and a long-term point of view, to doubly cherish the reputation of government bonds. Intensified political propaganda must be incisive and meticulous, must be fastidious about method, while the sentiments of the investors must also be fully respected. Oversimplification and overeagerness for quick results are short-sighted and will in the end impair the investment enthusiasm of the masses, will be psychologically counterproductive, and will fester like an incurable disease. If repeated efforts still fail to achieve fulfillment of the task of placing government bonds, the deficiency must be made up in some other way, based on a comprehensive improvement of the investment climate. B. Reaffirming the principle of the priority of government bonds. Higher government agencies must delegate to lower fiscal and financial departments the authority to impose punitive restraints against capital-raising activities that violate the principle of the priority of government bonds. Against obstinately self-willed units, the government should take a clear-cut stand in exposing them through the news media, and if necessary even freeze the funds these units may have raised, and hold them until the requirements of the government bond sales have been met. C. We must exert great efforts in opening up a secondary market for government bonds. In a certain sense, the secondary market for government bonds is also a kind of post-sale servicing of this financial commodity. The more lively the secondary market gets, the more outstanding the performance of the post-sale service, and the higher the reputation of government bonds. For this purpose, we must effect a comprehensive regulation of the financial order, then exert a major effort in initiating a secondary market for government bonds, and accomplish a benign cycle of interdependence and mutual support between the secondary and the primary market. For the purpose of protecting the legitimate interests of the investors, the government should intervene, as necessary, with the intermediary organs dealing in government bonds, prescribing the minimum rate to be paid by purchasers of government bonds and demand that listings be subject to supervision by the general public. D. Rational determination of the interest rate of government bonds. In China this determination must consider the attractiveness of bonds for investors, and consideration must be given at the same time to the costs of raising capital and the capability of public finance to repay capital and pay interests. In Western countries, the general level of interest rates of government bonds is not at all high (in some countries it is somewhat lower than the interest for savings deposits of the same quality), but they are made attractive by exempting interest income from such bonds from taxation. Investors can therefore still expect good profits from the purchase of government bonds. However, since China's tax system is not yet in perfect condition, the treasury bonds, though by themselves quite attractive, are now making a poor showing. Starting out from the Chinese realities, it would be appropriate to set interest rates for treasury bonds two or three percentage points higher than the interest rates for savings deposits of the same quality. E. Adjusting the irrational denominational structure of treasury bond. The irrational denominational structure of the treasury bonds is also a major impediment to the sale of these bonds. An investigation has shown that the general situation of Chinese households that are presently capable of buying government bonds is such that most are of middling financial capability, with few at the extreme ends. We must therefore start out from this fact in determining the denominational structure of treasury bonds. A scientific determination of this structure would not only benefit their marketing but also reduce printing expenses. It has been computed that printing bonds in the three denominations of 50, 100, and 1,000 yuan would meet the needs of investors in the various income brackets, and printing should best be at the rate of 20, 70, and 10 percent, respectively. 3. Issuing Bonds at a Premium Might Be Tried The issue of government bonds has by now been resumed for 13 years, since 1981. Issues have always been at face value, with repayment of principal and payment of interests on maturity. Investors have become somewhat tired of the same old appearance of the bond issues, which for a long time have lost the stimulating attractiveness of something new. To create a new image for government bonds and arouse new buying fervor among investors, it might be tried to issue government bonds at a premium. The advantages would be: A. Enhanced incentive to buy government bonds. From the psychological viewpoint of the investor, rather than gaining a portion of interests by means of a large amount of initial investment, it might appear a better way to invest only a part of the capital and at due date receive a fixed sum. Laying out a fraction and having it grow to a large sum is generally the psychology of persons intent on saving. If a 3-year government bond pays 14 percent interest, a 1,000-yuan bond will have grown to 1,420 yuan, principal and interest, at maturity. If the bond, on the other hand, would have been issued at a premium, the bond of 1,000-yuan face value could have been bought for about 705 yuan (getting back to the capital amount according to the formula: capital and interest = capital + capital x interest rate x time. To overcome the trouble that odd fen amounts would present at the time of issuing the bonds, it should be permissible to make appropriate adjustments and round off capital figures as much as possible to whole yuan numbers, within the limits of the interest rate). At maturity the bond would be redeemed at face value. Even though the same amount would in the end be gained whether issued at face value or issued at a premium, there is a big psychological difference as far as the investors are concerned, and this new style of the financial commodity may act as an increased inducement for investors. B. It is beneficial for medium-term and long-term investing, it will also prevent indiscriminate large-scale dumping. An investor who has bought government bonds at a premium will thereby have decided on obtaining his profit at maturity. In general, an investor will not abandon his profits halfway. This kind of stability will greatly contribute to an increased trust in and reputation of government bonds. C. Simplification of procedures, facilitating cashing in by the general public. Cashing-in of government bonds has always been troublesome for public finance and banking departments. Most of the general public have also often resented the much too cumbersome procedures of filling out forms for payment, for interest calculations, and for make-up funds [pei kuan 6792 2949]. If bonds were now issued at premium, payment procedures would be extremely simple. The teller would only have to check whether the government bond is genuine and whether it has matured, and would then cash it at face value. The bond would be redeemed in exchange for cash. This heightened efficiency of cashing-in would eliminate lining up in long lines at the counter. It would really create favorable conditions for the next round of bond issues. D. Simplification of accounting procedure, improving accounting quality. When issuing treasury bonds at premium, cashing-in of bonds would not involve computing capital and interest, it would merely require verifying the year, the bond, and the amount, and this would significantly reduce calculations by the teller and be beneficial in helping to avoid accounting mistakes. E. It would create favorable conditions for the flexible adjustment of time limits for government bond issues.
