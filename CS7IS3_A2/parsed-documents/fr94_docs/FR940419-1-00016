FR940419-1-00016 FR940419-1-00006 An ALJ's decision and order that have not been directed for Commission review, or a decision of the Commission following such review, also may be challenged in the appropriate federal appellate court. Sections 11(a) and (b), 29 U.S.C. 660(a) and (b). Filing a petition for appellate court review does not automatically stay the employer's abatement requirements. Id. In extraordinary cases, however, either the Commission or the court of appeals may stay the final order at the employer's request. If stayed, the abatement requirement does not begin to run until the appellate court upholds the earlier decision of the Commission or the ALJ (i.e., to affirms or revise the abatement requirement) by issuing a mandate or an equivalent order giving legal effect to the appellate court's decision. Where a citation was vacated by the Commission or the ALJ, and the appellate court subsequently reverses that decision, the appellate court will generally remand the case to the Commission for entry of an order to affirm the citation. The abatement requirement then will begin to run thirty days after the date of the appellate court's order. Should the appellate court, in such cases, not remand the case for entry of a Commission order, the abatement obligation begins to run from the court's own entry of mandate or equivalent order. Settlement or withdrawal of a contest. At any stage of an ongoing contest proceeding, there may be a settlement of the case, in whole or in part, or the employer may unilaterally withdraw the notice of contest, in whole or in part. Under these conditions, the ALJ or the Commission will enter an order based on the settlement or withdrawal of the notice of contest. It is OSHA's legal position that, in some circumstances, withdrawal or settlement actions by employers become final orders by operation of law upon execution, without approval by the Commission. (See Cuyahoga Valley Ry. Co. v. United Transportation Union, 474 U.S. 3 (1985)). However, for purposes of determining the timing of an employer's abatement obligations under the proposed regulation, OSHA has elected to treat orders based on settlement or withdrawal in the same manner as other ALJ and Commission orders, i.e., the abatement obligation begins to run thirty days after the docketing of the ALJ order by the Commission or after the issuance of the Commission order, as the case may be. Should the parties phrase the settlement agreement such that abatement is called for by a date certain, or that the abatement period will run from a certain event (e.g., the date of execution of the agreement), the abatement date will be determined in accordance with the terms of the agreement provided no employee or employee representative contests the abatement period specified in the agreement. The existence of a Commission final order has a number of consequences for enforcement. If OSHA determines that an employer has failed to correct a violation on or before the expiration of the abatement date, OSHA may issue a notification of failure to abate. Section 10(b), 29 U.S.C. 659(b). A penalty of up to $7000 may be assessed for each day the failure to abate continues. Section 17(d), 29 U.S.C. 666(d). If, after a final order, the employer commits a substantially similar violation in a different location, or with a different piece of equipment, or with the same piece of equipment after a period of temporary abatement, the violation is classified as repeated and a penalty of up to $70,000 may be assessed. Section 17 (a), 29 U.S.C. 666(a). Further, the Secretary may file a petition for enforcement of a Commission order which has became final after a notice of contest, or after a failure to contest within fifteen working days. This petition is filed in the court of appeals and the court issues a decree enforcing the Commission final order. If the employer violates this decree, the employer may be subject to penalties for contempt of court. Section 11(b), 29 U.S.C. 660(b). The discussion above details the regular procedures for obtaining and enforcing final Commission orders with their concomitant abatement dates. In addition, there are procedures for modifying the abatement requirements of a citation due to employer hardship. Upon a showing by an employer of inability to complete abatement within the prescribed period because of factors beyond the employer's reasonable control, the employer may obtain a modification of the abatement date. Section 10(c), 29 U.S.C. 659(c). A petition for modification of abatement date (PMA) must be filed no later than the close of the next working day following the date on which abatement is required. If neither OSHA nor affected employees object to the employer's request, OSHA may approve the PMA and it then becomes a final order pursuant to section 10(a) and (c) of the Act. If either OSHA or employees object to the PMA, the case is forwarded to the Commission for adjudication. See 29 CFR 2200.37. The Commission may either accept, reject, or modify the employer's request for additional time and issue an appropriate order.
