"The current governing coalition is able to achieve pragmatic approach to problems and their solutions," he says, adding that if the mutual concessions inside coalition are compared, the interest of the government parties in preserving the coalition prevails. "Sometimes abstract principles must be subordinated to practical needs if they are considered more important. We bear responsibility for the Slovak voters that the democratic Slovak Government will hold the autumn parliamentary elections," he stresses. In this connection he points to the effort of questioning the elections by means of destabilizing the current government to which the debates on the "lustration" (or screening law which lays down that members of the StB, the communist secret police, cannot hold senior public offices) law are directed. He rejects the speculation that by refusing the principle of coalition and offering only places at its list of candidates to other groups the KDH would not want to head the anti-Meciar opposition. "The KDH was and is the backbone of opposition to Meciar," he stresses. "We just want to keep our own identity for the sake of the reformist forces in the next parliament," he adds. "It is obvious that the Democratic Left Party (SDL), as the legal successor to the Slovak Communist Party, has other ideas about the reforms in society than, let us say, the KDH," Carnogursky says. However, the SDL can be, with some modifications, considered a reform party in Slovakia, he adds. [passage omitted]
