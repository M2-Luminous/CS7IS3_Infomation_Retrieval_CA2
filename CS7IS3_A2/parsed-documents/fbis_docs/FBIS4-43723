[Kinkel] No! After the lost European election everybody in our party now knows what is at stake. Now we must fight back rather than complain. We are fighting for each and every vote. Without a strong FDP it will not be possible to continue the liberal-conservative coalition after 16 October. The alternative is: red-green -- or at least something just as bad: a grand coalition. [Koch] How does the FDP want to manage to get into the next Bundestag? [Kinkel] We are entering the election campaign with our own tax concept. We want to ease the tax burden on the citizen and the economy. This means that the solidarity surcharge must be reexamined after three years with the goal of abolishing it completely or at least reducing it gradually. [Koch] What about tax reductions? [Kinkel] Payroll and income tax must be reduced at all levels. Private households must be recognized as employers. Trade capital tax and property tax for companies must be abolished completely. This must be discussed in government negotiations after the elections. [Koch] Social Democratic Party [SPD] Deputy Chairman Thierse does not rule out a social-liberal coalition from the outset.... [Kinkel] The SPD is completely out of step. A debate about a red-green coalition cannot be silenced anymore. The initial upswing in the polls was false euphoria. Just before its party congress the SPD's leading team is not exactly personified confidence in victory.
