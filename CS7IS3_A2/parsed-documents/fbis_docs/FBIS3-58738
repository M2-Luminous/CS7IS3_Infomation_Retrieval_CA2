But they added that any NATO military action, particularly bombing to break the Serb blockade of the mainly-Moslem towns of Srebrenica and Tuzla, still depended on a go-ahead from UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. NATO's political executive, the North Atlantic Council (NAC), met Wednesday to follow through a decision at last week's summit of the 16-nation alliance to prepare for bombing raids on Serb positions around Srebrenica and Tuzla. Detailed plans for such raids were prepared by commanders of UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) last week and handed to Butrus-Ghali in Geneva on Monday. They are now being studied by the UN's special representative in ex-Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, who must then submit his recommendations to the UN and subsequently to NATO. A NATO spokesman said: "The council welcomed the close consultations established between NATO and the UN secretary-general, and his active and rapid response to the NATO (summit) declaration. "The (NAC) meeting agreed that the next steps lie with the UN, although the alliance stands ready to provide whatever assistance it can," he said. NATO sources said this meant that military experts of the alliance would work closely with Akashi on the bombing plans. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that Butrus-Ghali had accepted the "high political priority" of planning for NATO intervention and, if necessary, air strikes. The NATO summiteers threatened last week to bomb Serbian positions if Serb forces continued to block the relief of Canadian peacekeepers at Srebrenica, and the re-opening of Tuzla airport which is needed for UN aid missions. Butrus-Ghali has so far been reluctant to authorise the air strikes, fearing reprisals against UN forces in Bosnia and disagreements in the UN Security Council where Russia is against any escalation of the conflict. One diplomat said NATO officials had been working for months on detailed plans for military intervention in Bosnia. He said the plans could be put into operation almost immediately, pending only last-minute "fine-tuning" to bring them into line with specific UN requests. In a related development, the Dutch Defence Ministry said 21 soldiers are to leave Friday on a reconnaissance mission to determine prospects for sending a contingent of troops to replace the Canadian forces in Srebrenica. A statement said the 10-day mission would determine when some 1,100 personnel, including an air battalion, could be deployed to the eastern Bosnian enclave. A first reconnaissance mission some weeks ago failed to produce the necessary information, and UN officials asked the Dutch Government to organise a second mission.
