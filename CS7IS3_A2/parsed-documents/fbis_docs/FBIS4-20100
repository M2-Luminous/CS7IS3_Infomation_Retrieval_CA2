The leaks published by LA REPUBBLICA about the long conversation at the Quirinale [president's palace] between the head of state and the man who by now is regarded as his nominee for the premiership were confirmed yesterday evening by Berlusconi spokesman Antonio Tajani. A few lines, whose meaning is very clear: "Forza Italia Chairman Silvio Berlusconi is currently exploring a number of solutions to the question of guarantees, on the assumption that he might be entrusted with the task of forming the new government. One such possibility is that of an impartial guarantor. If we think in terms of a figure above suspicion and offering the guarantees of objectivity, independence, and honesty, we can only think of men of Giovanni Spadolini's stature." A guarantor is therefore part of the Knight's [Berlusconi nickname] plans. But what real powers will he have? Ever since Silvio Berlusconi left [President] Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's study, promising Italians that, together with a list of ministers, he will also bring his "guarantee formula" to the Quirinale, the guarantor dilemma has become the real knot of the crisis. This, even more than the Viminale [Interior Ministry] and even more than federalism, is the last hurdle between the Knight and the Palazzo Chigi [government seat], the last formality before being crowned "premier" of the second republic. [Passage omitted] The opposition, that is to say, the alignment that raised the problem of guarantees, smells a rat. "This guarantor story looks very much like a piece of mockery, an attempt to hoodwink Italians," [Segni Pact] Mariotto Segni remarked. Speaking on behalf of the Greens, [Greens' Coordinator] Carlo Ripa di Meana went as far as referring to a swindle: "Recently we have had our share of pasteboard guarantors, and of constantly infringed rules and practices. Now the idea of a superguarantor (whether Spadolini or someone else makes no difference), whose legal nature and authority are unclear, smacks of an attempt to betray the citizens' trust." "It is a lot of hot air, an absurd formula which makes no sense at all," PPI [Italian Popular Party] member Saverio D'Amelio said. Not even the League seemed very enthusiastic about the possibility of a guarantor: "We would like to know what powers such a guarantor would have," Francesco Speroni, the League's floor leader in the Senate, warned, adding: "The real checks will be political in nature, because Berlusconi is not going to be Il Duce [Mussolini], only the prime minister. Of course, if we ever have a government full of Fininvest men, the day they constitute a majority and pass a decree-law for immediate execution, then the problem will arise...."
