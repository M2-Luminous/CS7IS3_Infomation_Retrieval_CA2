Managing Director Jean Pierson, who yesterday delivered the first A-321 built in Germany to Lufthansa, said: "Since the Americans are sticking to their GATT accord, let us do as they are doing; let us adopt a system of indirect aid." According to the chief of the European consortium, this is a question of political will. "Let us organize research and development budgets by distributing tasks between Airbus member countries (France, Germany, Britain, and Spain) in order to avoid overlap, and let us adopt the U.S. system of research contracts, which for us at least presents the advantage of not having to make reimbursements." In light of the increase in the civil aeronautics budget of NASA, the main customer of U.S. manufacturers, by 30 percent to $1.1 billion, and that its second-generation supersonic aircraft efforts exceed Europe's by a factor of 100, Jean Pierson thinks that the message is being heard. Message Heard Following in the footsteps of French Industry Minister Gerard Longuet and Transportation Minister Bernard Bosson, German Economy Minister Gunter Rexrodt has promised to take measures by 1995. "The conditions should be the same for everyone, and not be detrimental to Europeans." After their recourse to international financial markets for the development of the A-321 (for an amount of nearly 3 billion French francs [Fr]), the Airbus partners (Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace, Bristish Aerospace, and CASA) will finance the A319 program from their own funds (Fr1.7 billion). "However, we cannot rest on our laurels. Now more than ever, we need our governments' support to ensure our future and to remain competitive," Jean Pierson warned. "As long as the European manufacturer meets our cost and performance criteria for the purchase of new aircraft," Lufthansa President Juergen Weber said, "we obviously will give preference to Europe." The German carrier, which has almost all Airbus versions in its fleet, currently is flying 78 European aircraft representing a total investment of 8.5 billion Deutsche marks, and it is expected to take delivery of another 33 aircraft. The only Airbus models absent from its inventory are the A319 and the A330.
