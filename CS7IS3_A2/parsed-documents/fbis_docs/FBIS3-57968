Will the Knight [Fininvest President Berlusconi nickname] announce his entry into politics on 10 January, and do so live on the RAI [Italian State Broadcasting Corporation] to boot? Many are convinced that he will in fact take part in a great "One-Against-All" [TV talk show], i.e. the Fininvest president against his critics, answering the why's, how's, and when's concerning the launching of his political battleship. For his part, Silvio Berlusconi said from his Arcore headquarters villa: "We are having discussions." Whereas Nicolo Querci, his loyal right-hand man, explained that "if anything, it would be on 11 January, not on the 10th; we are currently engaged in talks with Carlo Freccero, who is an old friend of Berlusconi's." The Fininvest boss made it clear that "the possibility that the announcement of my entering into politics will take place on that occasion, assuming there is one, can be ruled out." Why? Because the remaining doubts, which now center more on the timing than on substance, stem from "four good reasons." "To begin with," he explained, "I still have some hope left that the democratic forces will find a way of coming together. In the second place, however, it must be also taken into account that voters require new reference points, which are still lacking, and which I believe must be represented: 40 percent of Italians say they do not know whom to vote for." If these are the premises, the two other points appear to provide the conclusion: "To this," he said, "we must add the timescales required to discuss the no-confidence motion, and those for setting the election date." Only then, in short, will Berlusconi solve the puzzle. In the meantime, other bilateral meetings were being announced, among which "a short visit to Rome," as they said in sybilline fashion at Arcore. The Knight, however, does not stop even for a minute: "I would get bored...," he winked, and then went on to make a public proposal, which he defined as "a reflection on the government's latest measures," but also "an element of amalgamation around which a potentially victorious electoral coalition could unite." The proposal involved setting a "taxation ceiling." This is, in fact, one of the 40 platform points which "we are actively working on." The taxation issue, however, is a particularly sensitive, and particularly important, one. Berlusconi's proposal -- namely setting by law a ceiling on the income that the government can absorb through taxation -- is very similar to that originally put forward by [National Rebirth Pact leader Mario] Segni and supported by the League. Berlusconi said: "You cannot reconstruct public finances by increasing income without controlling expenditure. As a result of the budget Italians will have 67 trillion lire [L] less to spend on consumer goods or invest in savings, while the public sector will have an extra L67 trillion at its disposal. This resource transfer will not improve the situation of public finances and will cause our production system further difficulties." Was that a criticism aimed at Ciampi? "This is not a critism aimed at Ciampi, who had to act in an emergency situation," Berlusconi explained. "But, at this stage of the game, we must break with this system which has been implemented for far too many years by governments that, in the attempt to restore public finances to a healthy state, have increased public income," thus leading to "an overtaxed country." This is why, according to the Knight, "we must abandon the old system and introduce a taxation ceiling, set by law." Berlusconi was very much aware that this project was shared by potential allies: "Certainly, and I welcome this. The more points we have in common, the greater the chances of building a strong grouping." The latter, of course, will be opposed to [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto, because -- Berlusconi maintained -- "the Left has always refused to acknowledge that taxation was excessive, advocating instead new and ever increasing taxes and duties." This is therefore "where the major difference lies with the Left electoral coalition."
