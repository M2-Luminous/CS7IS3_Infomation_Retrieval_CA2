And will you work to hold this meeting in Khartoum? [Jad-al-Haqq] An invitation has been sent to the Egyptian foreign minister from Dr. Abu-Salih to visit Khartoum. The visit will take place at the right time. Without doubt contacts are being made so that the visit can be made and the committee's work resumed. That was among the aims of my meeting with Minister 'Amr Musa. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Some people say that Musa is refusing to visit Khartoum while the present government is in power. What is your opinion? [Jad-al-Haqq] That is not true at all. I stress that the foreign minister has accepted the invitation to visit Sudan, and he will make the visit at the right time, in view of his engagements and preoccupation in Cairo with following up the peace process and other issues. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Did you sense real seriousness from the two sides in tackling the problems and transcending the current phase of disputes which has occurred in relations in the recent period? [Jad-al-Haqq] I am always optimistic about surmounting any differences or sudden problems between the two countries. These problems are not difficult to solve. No problem is difficult to solve as long as there are sincere intentions and as long as the efforts are intensified. [passage omitted] [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you believe it is possible for the two sides to backtrack on the measures taken before the tension arose in relations -- both the measures taken by Sudan against the Egyptian education mission or the consulates, and those taken by Cairo against Hala'ib? [Jad-al-Haqq] I can confirm that it is not in anyone's interests to harm relations between two fraternal peoples. Not only that: I also believe in our relationship with Sudan. It is a relationship of kinship. The people of Sudan are our kinfolk and relatives, and no one can sever the bond of kinship. We the present generation must safeguard this relationship. This generation in both Egypt and Sudan must safeguard what our ancestors achieved and cherished for us. I can say that the unity of the Nile Valley and its people is the basis and foundation for the establishment, success, or continuation of any Arab unity or solidarity. Without doubt that is in the interests of the two fraternal peoples in Egypt and Sudan in view of the ties by which this region is characterized compared with other regions. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] How would you assess conditions in southern Sudan, especially in the light of what has been said about foreign endeavors and plans to separate it from the rest of the country and to establish a self-rule authority there? [Jad-al-Haqq] I can confirm that there is no doubt about Egypt's foreign policy, as it is committed to safeguarding Sudan's unity, territorial integrity, and the unity of its people. This is not limited to southern Sudan alone. It applies to all the Sudanese territory. It is a fixed and known position which stems from historic constants, namely commitment to safeguarding the territory and people of fraternal Sudan. Not only does Egypt support Sudan, but also defends it against any attempts seeking to separate any part of Sudan's territory and fraternal people. [passage omitted]
