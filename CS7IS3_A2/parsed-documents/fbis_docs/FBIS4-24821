If there should be any shortfall or evasion due to violations of regulations on the part of taxpayers, customs may ask the former to pay the tax within three years from the date of violations of regulations. If customs finds or confirms that there is an overcharge of taxes, it shall return the overcharged part immediately; taxpayers may also ask customs to return the amount overcharged within one year from the date of taxation. Article 8. Should there be any disagreement between customs and taxpayers, the latter shall first pay duties as determined by the former and then appeal to the former in a written letter for reconsideration within 30 days from the date of the issuance of the tax-paying certificate by the former. If the appeal is overdue, the former may ignore it. Customs shall work out a decision of reconsideration and notify the taxpayer within 15 days from the date of receipt of the appeal.
