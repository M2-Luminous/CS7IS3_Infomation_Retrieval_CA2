This, Song Ping stressed, is where the unifying force of the China Family Planning Association lies. Song Ping made the above remarks at a recently concluded family planning forum in Guilin, which was attended by the chairmen of provincial, municipal, and autonomous region family planning associations. In his speech delivered at the Guilin forum, Song Ping stated: At present, there are two prevailing views regarding China's family planning work, both of which are at once incommensurate with the realities of China and detrimental to China's family planning work. The first view is: Once China's economy is developed, China's population growth rate will drop as a result. Song Ping said: We should firmly bear in mind the per capita concept while pushing forward the country's economic growth. Should we fail to place population growth under control, we will definitely find it impossible to achieve faster economic growth. The second view is: Now that China has started building a market economy, population growth should also be regulated by the market. Song Ping said: China's basic national conditions have made family planning an inevitable choice for the Chinese people. Thus, governments at all levels across the country are duty-bound to regulate and control population growth. Any attempt to place population growth under market regulation would undoubtedly make it impossible for China to fulfill its population control targets. Under no circumstances should we slacken family planning efforts. Song Ping stated: As it takes years to transform ordinary people's population concepts, it is necessary to carry on family planning propaganda and education for years to come. Though family planning is considered beneficial to the country and the people, some citizens still harbor misconceptions about family planning and have yet to recognize the great significance of family planning work. In view of this situation, first and foremost, we should carry on patient, meticulous, and convincing family planning propaganda and education, integrate propaganda on the basic national policy of family planning with universal education on state laws, and energetically publicize the PRC Constitution and the PRC Marriage Law, as well as various locally promulgated family planning regulations in order that the broad masses of citizens will gradually take family planning as their unshirkable duty. Second, we should integrate propaganda on family planning with the popularization of knowledge of birth control and eugenic techniques with an eye on protecting the health of both mothers and infants and further improving population quality. Third, we should integrate propaganda on family planning with efforts to shake off poverty and achieve a comparatively well-off livelihood. At the moment, Song Ping noted, what the rural populace is most concerned with is finding effective ways and means of eradicating poverty and achieving a comparatively well-off livelihood. Family planning associations at all levels across China should take full account of this situation and actively try to provide the rural populace with better family planning services, thereby helping them further develop production and achieve prosperity. Family planning, Song Ping stressed, is a project about the human brain and body and about each and every aspect of a human family. This project comprehensively reflects a country's population culture. Family planning associations at all levels in China should therefore try to provide the broad masses of the people with comprehensive and varied services in terms of population growth control, population quality improvement, health protection for mothers and infants, civilized family building, living environment improvement, and so on. Song Ping stated: While family planning is being carried on, China will inevitably confront a series of problems caused by an increasingly aging population. In view of this situation, family planning associations at all levels in China should try to show more concern for senior citizens, actively advocate and implement an old-age pension system by joining hands with the departments concerned, help senior citizens tackle actual problems, and provide senior citizens with necessary financial assistance. Song Ping called for organically integrating family planning management with family planning education among the people; conducting down-to-earth family planning work; steadily pushing ahead with nationwide propaganda, education, and services relating to family planning work; and gradually regularizing and systematizing family planning work so that the broad masses of the people will more consciously carry out family planning in society. The forum was held under the auspices of China Family Planning Association and was attended by the chairmen of 11 provincial, municipal, and autonomous region family planning associations. Zhao Fulin, secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region CPC Committee, attended and delivered a speech at the forum in which he said: The fact that the forum is being held in Guangxi has given a powerful impetus to Guangxi's family planning work. Comrade Song Ping's speech to the forum has greatly enlightened Guangxi's family planning workers. After this forum, we will make every possible endeavor to implement and carry out the spirit of the forum. Liu Mingzu, deputy secretary of the regional party committee, chairman of the people's congress standing committee, and chairman of the family planning association, also delivered a speech at the forum in which he briefed participants on the work achievements of the Guangxi Family Planning Association. Participants in the forum also visited Tonghua village, Linchun County, Guangxi, a model family planning village commended by the Guangxi Family Planning Association.
