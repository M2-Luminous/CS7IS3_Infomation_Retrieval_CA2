On 3 January the aggressor groups tried several times to recover the city of Ocosingo by staging intermittent attacks which were repelled by the troops. The military personnel are currently -- at 1300 -- receiving sporadic fire from snipers in some buildings and on rooftops, mainly the Church and the Municipal Presidency. It is known that some other groups are still hidden on the outskirts of Ocosingo. Up to this moment, the number of casualties inflicted on the said group amount to 35 dead and an undetermined number of wounded. As has already been reported, they evacuate their wounded and their corpses when possible. Furthermore, 35 weapons, 15 grenades, a large amount of ammunition of diverse calibers, and knives, as well as silencers, gas masks, and radio equipment have been seized. In the military field of the 31st Military Zone, located 10 km southeast of the city of San Cristobal [De Las Casas], the military personnel have endured constant harassment from isolated shots and have captured, on those occasions, eight armed individuals who form part of the aggressor groups. These men, including a minor, were immediately delivered to the authorities of the Federal Attorney General's Office. During the night of 2 January, the aforementioned military installation, including the housing areas, received intermittent rifle fire from snipers. In San Cristobal [De Las Casas], the situation is completely calm. Up to this moment and since the beginning of the military operations, two officers and five soldiers have died and two officers and 14 soldiers have been wounded. On the other hand, 59 dead have been counted among the members of the transgressor groups, and eight of them have been captured. To these [numbers] we have to add the 27 deaths inflicted by the aggressor group on the civilian population and the local police during the takeover of the four municipal capitals on the first day of the year.
