In an interview with the Ostankino State Radio and Television Broadcasting Company, he said he had never accepted the NATO ultimatum on Bosnian Serbs as a way to solve the Bosnian crisis. "What is this ultimatum? We are not a member of the NATO," Churkin said, adding that it is the action of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Sarajevo and the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council, not NATO, that count. He said Russia and NATO are just beginning to learn how to establish "partnership for peace" and if NATO takes what he called "frivolous and absurd" action, a crisis could result in the Russo-NATO relations. He also was confident that the crisis in Sarajevo would end with all sides accepting a Russian proposal, which calls for the withdrawal of heavy weaponry by both the Serb and Muslim sides and the dispatch of Russian peace keeping soldiers, now serving in the UNPROFOR in Croatia, to Sarajevo to guarantee peace.
