Ajello visited Muhia yesterday, accompanied by the Mozambican peace negotiator in the peace process with Renamo, Armando Guebuza, Renamo's Foreign Affairs Secretary Jose de Castro, and several Western diplomats. Renamo fighters at Muhia complained to journalists about their food and housing. They claimed that insufficient food had been sent, and they were fed up with the monotony of a diet consisting essentially of maize and beans. The UN Operation in Mozambique denies that there is any food shortage in any of 35 assembly points currently opened. The food is supplied by the World Food Program [WFP], and the daily portion of the Mozambican soldier is higher than in any other WFP operation anywhere in the world. Mr. Ajello has been visiting the assembly points to see with his own eyes the real situation in those accommodation areas.
