Visockas, chairman of the Socialist Party. The candidate received 1,312 votes, or 70 percent of those participating. The inhabitants of Pravieniskiai were the most active: of 300 voters, 227 gave their votes to A. Visockas. Voting took place in all precincts, although some electoral commission members refused to take part in the elections, and no substantial violations of the electoral law were found. A. Zilinskas, secretary of the Main Electoral Commission, reported these facts as well as the preliminary voting results to reporters yesterday. The commission plans to receive all the official election documents today. They will then be verified. Correspondence ballots from abroad have also not yet been received (about 18 are expected). But the conclusion is already clear: a Seimas member has not been elected for the Kaisiadorys electoral district -- the election simply did not take place. This "pleasure" cost about 50 thousand litas. The fourth round of elections in Kaisiadorys should be held in half a year, in November.
