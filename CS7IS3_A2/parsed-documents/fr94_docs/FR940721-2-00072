FR940721-2-00072 FR940721-2-00036 System manager and address: Director, Division of Data Support and Enumeration, Office of Systems Requirements, Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235. Notification procedures: An individual can determine if this system contains a record pertaining to him/her by providing his/her name, signature, and SSN to the address shown under ``System Manager'' above. (Furnishing the SSN is voluntary, but it makes searching for an individual's record easier and avoids delay.) If the SSN is unknown or no SSN has been assigned because the evidence presented with the application is being verified or has been determined to be fraudulent, the individual should provide name, signature, date and place of birth, sex, mother's birth name, and father's name, and evidence of identity. These procedures are in accordance with HHS Regulations 45 CFR part 5b. Record access procedures: Same as notification procedures. Also, requesters should reasonably specify the record contents which they are seeking. These procedures are in accordance with HHS Regulations 45 CFR part 5b. Contesting record procedures: Same as notification procedures above. Also, requesters should reasonably identify the record, specify the information which they are contesting, and state the corrective action sought and the reasons for the correction, with supporting justification showing how the record is incomplete, untimely, inaccurate, or irrelevant. These procedures are in accordance with HHS Regulations 45 CFR part 5b. Record source categories: Information in this system is obtained from SSN applicants (or individuals acting on their behalf). The SSN itself is assigned to the individual as a result of internal processes of this system. System exempted from certain provisions of the act: None.
