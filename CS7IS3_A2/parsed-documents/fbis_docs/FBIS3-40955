Moderately optimistic about the nuclear agreement for the future since, according to him, the president has met Parliament's demands, Kravtchuk's adviser sees no progress being made on the dossier regarding the Black Sea fleet. The tripartite agreement between the United States, Russia, and Ukraine, signed last Friday in Moscow, was saluted yesterday by the European Union as "an important contribution to international security and stability," albeit on condition that it be implemented rapidly, failing which any delay would be considered with great anxiety. The practical implementation of the agreement effectively depends on the backing of the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev. Not directly, but with respect to the conditions that it imposed on the ratification of the Start I agreement on the reduction of strategic nuclear arms, and on the ratification of the treaty on nuclear non-proliferation, both of which Washington had laid down as preconditions. However, the Ukrainian leaders are proving relatively confident on these points. That is what was explained to us yesterday by Anton Buteyko in an interview given while passing through Brussels. However, he believes that the West is focussing too much attention on the nuclear problem and forgetting that other elements are emerging as definitely just as important. Consequently, he argues, the development of equal relations with the European Union would contribute to the stability of the region. Moreover, in his opinion, only Ukraine can check the pressure in Russia caused by new political forces like that of Zhirinovskiy. For, in his view, the renaissance of these fascist movements is a menace not only to Ukraine, but also to Europe as a whole. Delstanche: Do you think it will be easy to obtain the Ukrainian Parliament's support for the tripartite agreement on denuclearization? Buteyko: The agreement does not formally require ratification. On the other hand, when Parliament ratified the Start I treaty, it voiced a certain number of reservations, in particular concerning the security guarantee for Ukraine, and the provision of technological and financial assistance in the context of disarmament. In fact, it must be clear that when Start I was negotiated, all the arms to be destroyed had to be eliminated using the combined economic resources of the USSR as a whole, whereas now we would have to destroy them using our own resources. That, however, is impossible in view of the economic crisis ravaging our country. Furthermore, the destruction of this arsenal will benefit the Western nations at which the arms in question were aimed. Therefore, it is logical that they should contribute to that process, for we are contributing to their security. Then again, Parliament has asked for compensation for the material contained in the tactical and strategic arms handed over to Russia. In addition, it must be remembered that the negotiations were launched at the initiative of Ukraine, but that neither the United States nor Russia took our interests into account. It was Parliament's decision regarding the Start I treaty that provided a positive impulse in the negotiations. All the more so since we also understood that it was impossible to resolve certain matters on a bilateral basis. Horyn: Well, this high-ranking German official explained his idea in approximately this way. Ukraine is presently in a state of crisis. We do not have enough food. However, some 10 years will pass, and our state will finally be standing on its own two feet. It will be a competitor on European agricultural markets. At the same time, traditional exporters, such as Germany and France, will find themselves in a difficult situation.... I replied to those arguments by saying that had Ukraine remained within the empire, the entire Europe would have been compelled to spend huge amounts of money on armaments in order to insure themselves against the imperial threat. Europe would have trembled before the Moscow empire as it did after World War II. Ukraine is not only a dream of the people and the form of their survival. Ukraine is a factor of stability, peace, and de- imperialization in Europe. Ukraine must become a therapist of the imperial moods that prevail among the Russian people. The recent elections in Russia are disturbing. Pasichnyy: After all, the consequences of the recent elections in Russia have again placed before the world a threat of direct invasion from Moscow. Chauvinism is still alive, and it has now acquired features of communo-fascism.... Horyn: Yes, they showed that it is not only the ruling circles in the Kremlin that are infected with the virus of imperialism. Many Russians display deep nostalgia for the empire, because its very existence raised our neighbors in their own eyes. The results of the elections in Russia have also contributed to a change in orientations in the West's attitude toward Ukraine. Instead of diktat, we see a striving for a dialogue. Pasichnyy: Pan Mykhaylo, you, as chairman of Ukraine's Republican Party, are a candidate for deputy of the Supreme Council at the coming elections. What is the attitude of the Republicans toward Ukraine's nuclear status? Horyn: We believe that the very fact of nuclear missiles in Ukraine is a guarantee for us and a warning for all of our neighbors that they should refrain from playing with fire. We are not opponents of disarmament and we are not against dismantling those missiles whose service life has expired. However, in our opinion, 46 missiles must be left and dismantled only after all nuclear powers make identical steps. One more thing. Russia, after it received from us a large number of medium-range missiles, has not to this day paid us for the nuclear fuel -- this sum constitutes several billions of U.S. dollars. I, for example, do not agree that, while dismantling the nuclear warheads, we should also be compelled to dismantle the missiles themselves. They are our separate property -- they were built at our factories. We will be able to use them to protect ourselves from territorial encroachments by aggressors. I hope that the president will not hasten to sign the necessary documents that would fully disarm Ukraine. It would be an irreparable blunder.
