K.: "Hungarian President's Visit to Poland: Motion Requesting Membership in Union"] [Text] In the near future, Poland and Hungary will introduce motions requesting recognition of their full membership in the EU, said Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski after his meeting with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. The Hungarian leader began his three-day visit to our state yesterday. Hungary will most likely introduce a motion regarding its full EU membership by 1 April, and we will do so some time later, added the chief of the Polish diplomatic service. He also stated that, during an earlier meeting in the Belweder, the Polish and the Hungarian presidents discussed, above all, the international situation. Arpad Goncz and Lech Walesa agreed that their views on the subject coincide entirely, stated Olechowski. Both leaders acknowledge that regional cooperation is a "key goal" for the Middle and East European states. During his talks with Lech Walesa, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz stressed that, in addition to centrifugal forces, the Visegrad Group has "stable prospects for future development." Discussing cooperation among the Visegrad Group states, President Lech Walesa stated that "some [states] do not want to achieve some of the goals alone." He added that "not everything develops the way we would like it to develop" because "we are not doing things together." At the Belweder, the Polish president awarded the Hungarian guest with the Order of the White Eagle, and the Hungarian president, in his turn, awarded Lech Walesa with the Hungarian Great Cross of the Order of Honor. Premier Waldemar Pawlak, who was received by the Hungarian president at his residence, said that the subject of their meeting was connected with political and economic cooperation between the two countries. They also discussed the "Partnership for Peace" program. Recalling the negotiations addressing the Central European free trade area, the Polish prime minister disclosed the wish to speed up the realization of this agreement. President Goncz also met with Marshal of the Sejm Jozef Oleksy. The Hungarian leader spoke in favor of the admission of Slovenia and Croatia--after the war in former Yugoslavia is over--to the Visegrad Group. Minister Olechowski stressed that the "Partnership for Peace" program and joint efforts of NATO and the Middle and East European states to begin cooperating in military areas serve the faster rapprochement of the two states. The chief of the Polish diplomatic service added that, despite the closeness of their policies, the Hungarian and Polish Governments differ in treating ethnic minorities. "If the future of the Visegrad Group depended on only our will, it would have developed dynamically," said Olechowski. In his opinion, the governments of the two states believe that the slowing down of the development within this group is only temporary.
