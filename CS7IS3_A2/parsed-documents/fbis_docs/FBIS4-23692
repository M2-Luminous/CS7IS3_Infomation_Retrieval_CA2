Dr Hartzenberg and Freedom Front [FF] leader Gen Constand Viljoen met Deputy President Thabo Mbeki at Pretoria's Union Buildings on Monday to discuss the formation of a volkstaat. A joint statement issued afterwards said the CP was to make direct representation to the Constitutional Assembly regarding the formation of a volkstaat. The CP would also pursue the matter with the various parties represented in the government of national unity. It said the CP's request to negotiate directly with the government -- originally communicated to President Mandela -- would be conveyed to the cabinet for its consideration. "The meeting recognised the fact that the constitution provided for a mechanism and a process to address the question of a volkstaat," the joint statement said. But in a separate statement issued later, Dr Hartzenberg said the discussions had "digressed completely" from the spirit and agreement reached two weeks ago with Mr Mandela. During those discussions direct negotiation between the CP/Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] and the government had been agreed on. Other interested parties would be able to take part and a forum would be established for this purpose, Dr Hartzenberg said. "Today the standpoint was taken that all negotiations must be done through the volkstaat council [VC]. This is unacceptable to the CP and the AVF because the VC has been appointed only by the Freedom Front and because it is inherently limited by the... constitution as well as the agreement between Gen Viljoen and the ANC." Dr Hartzenberg said these limitations precluded full political independence for Afrikaners and a further interview would have to be held with President Mandela. In order to ensure a permanent solution and lasting peace it was essential the agreement already reached with President Mandela be honoured and executed, he said.
