The clearest example of this is the harm done to Turkey by the unfair blockade that the U.S. Administration has imposed on Iraq in the name of the UN Security Council. A few years ago, at the beginning of the unjust blockade on Iraq, we were the ones who were warning of its potential harm. Today, it is Turkish officials who are speaking about the harm that has been done to their economy and who are demanding the removal of the blockade on Iraq. This is not all. Turkish officials, beginning with President Demirel and Prime Minister Cillar and including several other senior officials, have expressed their concern about the adverse effects of the blockade on the Turkish people and economy, as well as its effects on living and security conditions in Turkey. The last to express such concern was Masoud Yilmaz, president of the Motherland Party, who called for the opening of the al-Khabur border post with Iraq. Addressing a rally in Shirnak [as transliterated] on the Iraqi-Turkish border, Yilmaz called for the resumption of border trade to improve economic conditions in the area. "The economic crisis and widespread unemployment in the area have reached an intolerable level," he said. What Yilmaz said constitutes the substance of Turkey's appeal to the international community to completely lift the oil embargo on Iraq. So far, Turkey has incurred losses amounting to $20 billion as a result of its participation in the blockade on Iraq. THE NEW YORK TIMES has quoted Turkish officials and foreign diplomats as saying that Turkey is going through a sharp economic crisis manifested by a drop in the exchange rate of the Turkish lira, deficits in the balance of trade, foreign debts amounting to $68 billion dollars, and an annual inflation ranging from 50-70 percent. The question here is: How long will the United States continue to ignore the will of the international community and the interests of its allies by keeping the unfair blockade on Iraq? There is no doubt that Washington faces growing international pressure due to world conviction that Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations under Resolution 687 and agreed to permanent monitoring under Resolution 715 and that it is now up to the Security Council to meet its commitments toward Iraq and apply Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, which permits Iraqi oil exports without delay. The unfair blockade on Iraq harms the interests of many world nations. Iraq has a solid economy and strong relations with many states. These states cannot possibly be compensated for their normal relations with Iraq. Thus, Turkey, Bulgaria, and many others can no longer endure the negative effects and results of the unfair blockade and continue with the dangerous U.S. game of maintaining aggression and savageness against Iraq. The blockade is besieging those who are imposing it. This fact is clear to the Iraqis who resolutely continue to rebuild their country and create new factors daily in order to overcome the negative effects of the blockade while also determined to inflict final defeat on the evil aggressors and to continue building their country under the flag of the great leader Saddam Husayn.
