When the crude oil pipeline from Ingoldstadt, Germany, to Kralupy nad Vltavou has been completed, they will quite certainly lose strategic importance altogether, he added. He said he rejected "the slightly naive interpretation" that selling the refineries to a foreign consortium would be more advantageous for the Czech Republic, because it would tie the country closer to Western Europe. Dlouhy says he supported the "foreign" option because it would in his opinion ensure a speedy transformation of the Czech petrochemical industry, so that it would be competitive in Europe. He says a foreign consortium was offering several advantages, such as solid know-how, capital "injections", an active trade policy and long-term ties to a crude oil transportation system. Dlouhy says that ministers finally chose the Czech variety because the consortium took a long time to present an offer which "a responsible government member could submit to the government." The idea that if the profits are not re-invested, they would most probably go abroad, was yet another disadvantage. When commenting on the Czech option, Dlouhy says that if there is systemic market pressure for a speedy increase in the productivity and competitiveness of the planned holding company, the Czech Republic will draw higher profits in the financial, employment, and other areas than those offered by the foreign consortium. He says that the ministries of industry and trade and of privatization will give preference to projects relying on production companies, not trading organizations. The Czech option does not exclude foreign capital input, Dlouhy stresses. "However, it is necessary to know in advance what will not be possible", he added. It is necessary to provide clear guarantees that strategic aspects will be respected, he concludes.
