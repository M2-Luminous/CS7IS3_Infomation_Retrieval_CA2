He also said that as the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] was bearing a heavier work load, he did not rule out the possibility that the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee would appoint new members to the PWC. Chen Ziying made these remarks when answering questions raised by reporters after he had attended the opening ceremony of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee today. He said: The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that the Chinese side and its British counterpart should make joint efforts to maintain the smooth transition of Hong Kong. The Chinese side has always called for handling things in accordance with the Joint Declaration, and its deeds always square with its words. The British side, however, has undermined cooperation between the two sides on the issue of Hong Kong's political system, which produced bad effects. The Chinese side wishes that its British counterpart would not undermine cooperation between the two sides in other aspects. When asked about the fourth new airport financing package, Chen Ziying said that the Chinese side was studying it vigorously. He stressed: Every problem related to the new airport should be solved by proceeding from the objectives of contributing to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and of fully implementing the stipulations of the Memorandum of Understanding on the new airport. All the suggestions made by the Chinese side have been written down in the Memorandum of Understanding as the consensus of the two countries, and no new demands have been set since then. Hence, as long as everything is done in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, a larger and better new airport will emerge very soon. When talking about the PWC's work, Chen Ziying said: The PWC has very heavy tasks to bear, and much work must be studied seriously. It is not enough merely to rely on the strength of the 57 incumbent members, so I do not rule out the possibility of recruiting more members in the future. Moreover, the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch are making preparations for recruiting the third group of Hong Kong affairs advisers, and the list can be published once the work is complete. On the other hand, Zheng Yi, deputy secretary of the NPC Standing Committee and deputy director of the PWC, said today that the PWC was handling its work quite smoothly and that the five special subgroups were vigorously accelerating their work. He said: As a work organ under the NPC Standing Committee, the PWC should report on its work to the NPC regularly. However, this topic has not been placed on the agenda of the NPC session this year. In the future, the PWC will report on its work according to the progress and requests made by deputies to the NPC.
