FR940426-1-00131 FR940426-1-00016 17 CFR Part 249 [Release Nos. 33&hyph;7056; 34&hyph;33921; International Series Release No. 656; File No. S7&hyph;13&hyph;94] RIN 3235&hyph;AG16 Reconciliation of the Accounting by Foreign Private Issuers for Business Combinations AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Commission is proposing today to amend Form 20&hyph;F to streamline the financial statement reconciliation requirements for foreign private issuers that have entered into business combinations. The proposed amendments would eliminate the requirement to reconcile certain differences attributable to the determination of the method of accounting for a business combination, and the amortization period of goodwill and negative goodwill, provided the financial statements comply with International Accounting Standards No. 22 ``Business Combinations'' as amended, regarding these items. DATES: Comments should be received on or before July 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comment letters should refer to File Number S7&hyph;13&hyph;94 and should be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. The Commission will make all comments available for public inspection and copying in its Public Reference Room at the same address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Wayne E. Carnall, Deputy Chief Accountant, Division of Corporation Finance at (202) 272&hyph;2553 or Richard J. Reinhard, Associate Chief Accountant, Office of Chief Accountant at (202&hyph;942&hyph;4400), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC 20549. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As described in detail below, the Commission is proposing to amend Form 20&hyph;F 1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''). 2 1 17 CFR 249.220f. 2 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. I. Method of Accounting for Business Combinations Accounting principles in most countries prescribe two basic methods of accounting for business combinations. One method, called ``pooling of interests'' under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'') and ``uniting of interests'' under International Accounting Standard No. 22, ``Business Combinations'', as amended in 1993 (``IAS 22''), provides generally for the retroactive restatement of financial statements at the combined historical costs of the merging companies. The other method, called ``purchase'' under U.S. GAAP and ``acquisition'' under IAS 22, provides generally for recognition of the acquired company's assets and liabilities at their fair value at the acquisition date. Under U.S. GAAP, as well as under IAS 22, the methods are not alternatives; rather, the selection of the method is based on specific criteria as they apply to the particular facts and circumstances. However, U.S. GAAP, IAS 22, and the accounting standards of most countries all employ different criteria for determining which of the two methods is applicable to a transaction. 3 3 In some jurisdictions, the pooling of interests method is not permitted, while in some other jurisdictions, issuers have a free choice as to the method to apply.
