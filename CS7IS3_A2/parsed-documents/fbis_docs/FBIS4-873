The minister of information, Professor Jerry Gana, made this known yesterday while briefing newsmen in Lagos. Prof. Gana explained that January was chosen to give the delegates at the national constitutional conference enough time to finish their deliberations. The announcement, according to him, will be the climax of phase two of the government's political agenda, which started with the constitutional conference. The minister said the government would not want to give a specific date for the handover because it did not know the regulations or the structure the conference would want the nation to take. Prof. Gana, however, noted that the constitutional conference, which was the first phase of the political agenda, would not go beyond December this year. He said the election of delegates to the conference will start in the first week of June, while the conference will convene on 27 June in Abuja.
