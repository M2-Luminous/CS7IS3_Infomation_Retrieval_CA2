This raises a number of issues that must be broached promptly and with a constructive attitude. The first issue, which has already been raised on various sides, concerns the matter of the television networks and, more generally, the information media that you own through the Fininvest group. This constitutes a problem, as is confirmed by the fact that, at your suggestion, the government has decided to entrust three experts with the task of preparing by September a possible supplement to existing regulations. But if the problem exists, its solution cannot be entrusted merely to the lengthy procedures of a study drawn up by a group of experts, the formulation of a legislative document by the government, and its subsequent examination by parliament. A temporary solution must at least be provided -- pending possible amendments to the law -- that will immediately ensure the independence of television networks and other media from the government. This is all the more necessary inasmuch as a campaign is under way for the election of the European Parliament on 12 June, in which there should be no repetition of the favorable conditions that your political group was able to enjoy during the recent general election campaign. I hope that in your speech to the Senate today you will be able to announce something specific in this regard. There is also a second important issue. It concerns the need to inform parliament and the public about the economic activities of which you are in charge. In the absence of accurate and exhaustive information in this regard, there would inevitably be suspicions concerning the motivations of all government decisions that could influence the course of any of these activities. For this reason I ask you to make a pledge in your speech to publish soon all relevant data in this regard, some of which by law have to be published in any case. I am referring in particular to the following: -- a statement of assets and liabilities for fiscal year 1993 of Fininvest Spa and the consolidated statement of accounts of the group belonging to it, together with an auditor's certification and, where necessary, accompanied by the corresponding documents for 1992; -- an analysis of the debts of the umbrella group and of the group itself, with special reference to identifying the private and public banks to which the group is indebted and the specified terms of these loans. It is obviously necessary to know this information, especially in the case of public banks; -- any debts and credits on the part of the umbrella group with respect to the companies that it controls; -- the final balance of the umbrella group and the consolidated accounts of the group, with an analysis of capitalized costs and of any revaluations carried out during the accounting period; -- a detailed list setting out the composition of the stock ownership of the Fininvest group, specifying which shares you yourself own directly and which you own indirectly and through which channels. Last, I think it would be correct to provide a complete list of electoral contributions whether in the form of money or in the form of any services provided by the companies of your group in support of the political movement that you lead. I am sure that you will understand that these requests are dictated not by an attitude of political contentiousness but, rather, by the need for openness common to all liberal-democratic societies -- a model that you yourself often cite. I take this opportunity to send you my best wishes for success. [signed] Giorgio La Malfa.
