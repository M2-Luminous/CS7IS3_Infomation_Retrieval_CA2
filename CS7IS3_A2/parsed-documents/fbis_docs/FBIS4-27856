Security Council resolution imposing economic sanctions on North Korea. The U.S. ambassador in charge of the North Korean nuclear affair, Robert Gallucci, met separately with his South Korean counterpart Kim Sam-hun and the Japanese Foreign Ministry's director-general of the Diplomatic Policy Bureau, Shunji Yanai. They are scheduled to hold a tripartite meeting Saturday morning to coordinate their positions on possible U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang. Following his meeting with Gallucci, Kim said that since the chance of measuring nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor has been lost, it is even more important for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct special inspections of nuclear waste facilities at Yongbyon. "There is no need to abandon dialogue with North Korea if suspicions over North Korea's nuclear intentions could be dispelled through (the IAEA's) special inspections," Kim said. Kim thus indicated that the international community plans to apply economic pressure on North Korea while demanding that it permit special inspections. Asked about the possibility of resuming dialogue with North Korea, Kim said that at this juncture it is important to propose and adopt a Security Council resolution on economic sanctions. But the Security Council's main aim is to resolve the dispute over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program, Kim said. "Therefore, dialogue with North Korea can be resumed depending on North Korea's attitude and if there is a possibility that the fundamental problems can be solved." South Korea, the United States and Japan are pushing a Security Council resolution on economic sanctions that could have a practical impact, Kim said. Kim hinted that the three countries would press for the resolution at the earliest possible date, grabbing the opportunity as IAEA Director-general Hans Blix is scheduled to explain the agency's inspection results to the council Friday afternoon. The Korean ambassador said he understood that U.S. and South Korean military officials are conducting close coordination in preparation for a possible rise in tension on the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, Gallucci held a special press briefing Friday and explained that the United States has already begun consultations with its allies on appropriate action against North Korea. "Thus far, with our brief initial meeting, I detect no differences between us and our South Korean allies," Gallucci said. He stressed that international sanctions against North Korea would not destroy the basis for resolving the issue. Gallucci said there were three ways to determine what happened in 1989 at the 5-megawatt reactor: -- by additional information provided by North Korea. -- by special inspection of the radioactive waste sites' operating history through non-destructive analysis of fuel discharged from the reactor. -- by reconstruction of the reactor operating history through nondestructive analysis of fuel discharged from the reactor. Blix has said that the third way has been irrevocably destroyed as a methodology for the IAEA and therefore the overall ability to ascertain what happened in the past has been seriously eroded, he said. But Gallucci was quick to add that "that does not mean (they are) destroyed." The IAEA, with the full cooperation of North Korea, could still get at it, he said. In effect, Gallucci hinted that there was room to resume negotiations, depending on the North Koreans' attitude. Asked about the purpose of economic sanctions, Gallucci said: "We are looking for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, we are looking for full NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] adherence (by North Korea), we are looking for full-scope safeguards, the acceptance of special inspections and the implementation of the North-South declaration on denuclearization."
