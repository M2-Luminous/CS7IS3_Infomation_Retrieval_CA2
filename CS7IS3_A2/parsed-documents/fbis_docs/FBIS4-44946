FBIS4-44946 "jpnea029___94026" JPRS-NEA-94-029 JPRS Near East & South Asia 29 April 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Flight Data Processing System Developed Flight Data Processing System Developed 94AS0284J Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 29 Apr 94 p 9 94AS0284J Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Text] Bangalore, April 28--The Bangalore-based National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) has designed and developed an Integrated Flight Data Processing (IFDP) system at a cost of Rs. 40 lakhs [rupees] for all types of Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR), commonly known as Black Box in aviation parlance, and Quick Access Recorder (QAR) used by Air India. According to Dr K.N. Raju, NAL director, the system, developed in a record time of nine months, is based on Tata Unisys U600/60 mini computer. It could be used to acquire data from four known sources of DFDRs and QARs simultaneously to speed up data acquisition. The system is also capable of processing the raw data, acquiring data from a specific GMT, data transcription, conversion of engineering units and display of selected parameters. It could also check on various parameter limit "exceedencies" during a selected flight. Dr Raju said the system developed at Air India's behest could also reply and analyse flight data recorded either on DFDR or on performance monitoring recorders (PMRs) to provide vital clues during investigation of accidents or incidents. It would now be available to other air taxi operators in the country following a Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) directive that it would be mandatory for these operators to have data from DFRs for at least three months. Stating that most of the private operators were not even maintaining the Black Box properly, Dr Raju said an additional feature of the system was that it contained a special event search monitoring and analysis software. The software sets up a database of all the detected events, allowing them to be interrogated by time period and aircraft registration with the output used to assess which operating techniques or other characteristics were causing erosion of safety margins. The routine information generated by this analysis was complementary to the assessments by pilots and would enhance air safety. The IFDP had provision to achieve the processed data on a mass storage media for potential applications such as engine health monitoring flight operation analysis and fuel efficiency monitoring. According to Dr Raju, the IFDP had a good export potential as it would cost 50 to 60 per cent less than the available data readers abroad. Further, it would also help the aircraft operators to get readouts of the black box within the country, as at present they had to seek sources from abroad for such readouts. According to Dr S. Nagabhushana, head of the Aerospace Lab of NAL, the laboratories had over the past five years developed expertise in the readout and analysis of both the Black Boxes--the DFDRs and the Cockpit Voice Recorders (CVRs) of aircraft including Boeing 737 and 747, Airbus A300, A310 and A320. The system for the Sundstrand Universal Flight data recorder (UFDRs) used by the 737 Boeings with air taxi services which would be available in a month's time. Dr Nagabhushana said though DFDRs generally confirm to the Aeronautical Radio Incorporated (ARINC) 573 standards, each aircraft was fitted with DFDRs of different makes, necessitating tailor-made systems both in terms of hardware and software. NAL had specialised in addressing these problems and had acquired indigenous capability to develop sophisticated readout systems. The related future plans before NAL included four dimensional flight path reconstruction, analysis of damaged tapes (accident investigation), realtime satellite data links using Inmarsat and development of solid state DFDRs used in Boeing 747--400s. The IFDP would be handed over to Air India here on May 4.
