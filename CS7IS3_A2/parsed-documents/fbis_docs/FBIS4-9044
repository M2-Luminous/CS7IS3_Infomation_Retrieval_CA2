Kleiman said that the decision was undemocratic as it came three days before he was scheduled to appear before the parliament's Education, Science and Culture Committee. This only proves that the government did not need for its decision facts or a matter-of-fact investigation into the circumstances of the publication of the daily REPUBLIKA, Kleiman said. He added that the present government had embarked upon the road of confrontation with anyone who was politically inconvenient for it. Kleiman, 49, was asked by the then government of Vladimir Meciar in August 1992 to establish Slovakia's first press agency. TA SR now has a staff of about 500 and an annual budget of about 90 million Slovak crowns (over two million USD). Under Kleiman it started to publish REPUBLIKA, the sole "pro- Meciar" national daily, which has run into a debt of about 18.5 million Slovak crowns. Deputy Premier Roman Kovac said the government had found out "that legal regulations were breached in the agency on several occasions." He cited the law on budgetary rules, the law on public fund collecting and lotteries, and the Finance Ministry's ordinance saying that business activities of organisations partially funded from the state budget must not end at a loss. Kleiman is mainly reproached for the publication of the daily REPUBLIKA, the only national paper supporting the former premier, Vladimir Meciar, which had a loss of 18 million crowns (about 545,454 USD) last year. TA SR's overall deficit was 25 million crowns in spite of a contribution of 35 million crowns from the state budget. Moreover, Kleiman agreed in March with the free transfer of REPUBLIKA to its editor-in-chief even though the paper is worth 10 million crowns according to experts. For the eight days during which the paper was owned by a private person, its operation continued to be defrayed by the agency. Kovac said today the future of REPUBLIKA depended on the new TA SR secretary general. "The government believes that equal conditions must be created for all papers in Slovakia. We think that privatisation is the quickest and best solution." The Meciar-led Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) today issued a statement saying that today's decision to dismiss 26 district mayors was "political normalisation reminiscent of the occupation following (the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in) 1968" and the beginning of political purges. The HZDS justified its statement by Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner's words that insufficient guarantees of the mayors' loyalty to the new government were the main reason for their dismissal.
