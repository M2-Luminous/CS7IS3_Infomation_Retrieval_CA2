In contrast to Moscow mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, who is openly opposed to "Chubays-style" privatization, outlying administrations are attempting to get around the State Committee for State Property Management quietly. But the goal is the same: to use privatization to turn state property into municipal property. Yesterday Aleksandr Lavrov, chairman of the Kemerovo Oblast State Property Management Committee, confirmed in an interview with a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent the intention of Kemerovo governor Mikhail Kislyuk to nationalize the oblast's processing industry. Mr. Lavrov acknowledged that the local government "overlooked" privatization of enterprises in the processing industry "in their haste." A portion of potential investors (participants in all stages of the processing and sale of agricultural produce), finding themselves outside the circle of privileged closed subscription to shares in processing enterprises, vented their rage on the oblast administration. For that reason, at a recent oblast meeting of agricultural workers Mr. Kislyuk told the offended parties that "the administration is prepared to resort to nationalization of processing enterprises, which will then make it possible to 're-privatize' them for the benefit of agricultural producers." However, in Mr. Lavrov's opinion the administration has no legal right to do so. Therefore there are most likely two options for the further development of events. The first is that producers will appeal to a court of arbitration, asking it to overturn the local government's decision to privatize processing enterprises. However, in that case the administration will be blamed for what happened and will lose its ability to improvise in the sectors of the economy that are most promising from an investment standpoint. Therefore it is clear that the regional authorities will insist on a different course of events. In the opinion of the region's leaders, the federal authorities should not only increase the regional quota for closed subscription on favorable terms to shares in processing enterprises, but also approve "from above" the region's initiative aimed at "preventing social tension" through "re-privatization" of enterprises. In that scenario, the local administration hopes not only to save face, but also to gain additional opportunities to redistribute the item that is in short supply, i.e. shares in enterprises that are attractive to investors. Furthermore, this second option gives the executive branch an exceptional opportunity to get control of (and hang onto) a controlling block of stock in highly profitable enterprises. It is also possible that in this manner the administration has commenced the realization of its plans to select the enterprises that will comprise the basis of the region's financial-industrial groups, whose operations will be controlled by the local authorities.
