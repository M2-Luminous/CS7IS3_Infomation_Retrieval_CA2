The language of efficiency was spoken at the work centers in Las Tunas and results can already be seen in many of those centers, which are directly linked to proposals made by the workers during the parliaments. This was demonstrated during the analysis at the meeting summarizing the workers parliaments process in the province. The Ministry of Agriculture [Minag], for example, has increased the personnel directly involved in production by 10 percent. Minag also hopes to reduce its losses during 1994. According to a preliminary analysis, only 14 of its 306 Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] will be unprofitable. On this, Pedro Ross Leal said: [Begin Ross Leal recording] Because if we are not more efficient with the resources we have, we have not solved any problem. That is where measures must be taken. [end recording] Approximately 117,000 workers participated in the 2,577 parliaments held in Las Tunas. Some of the ideas proposed were: increasing administrative demands; not subsidizing unprofitable enterprises; increasing the creation of UBPC; changing currency; and confiscating money and properties obtained through shady sources. At the conclusion of the analysis of the workers parliaments in Las Tunas, Pedro Ross gave the provincial CTC the banner declaring it foremost in the country in the financing of the Territorial Troops Militia.
