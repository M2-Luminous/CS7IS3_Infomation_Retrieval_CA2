Firstly, it pours cold water on those who still insist there is no freedom of expression in the Islamic Republic. Secondly, it boosts the morale of Iranians and their foreign friends when gloom and disillusionment get the better of them. Finally, it reminds world public opinion about the confidence and elegance of the elected president of Iran. In our part of the world you cannot find even a few heads of states or government who hold, what is now generally come to be termed as, `open' press conferences. Hashemi-Rafsanjani deserves congratulations for doing so, though the gaps between one press meeting and another have been widening. This may be rightly attributed to the chief executive's tight schedules, but his aides should ensure that the country's president receives journalists and commentators at regular intervals. It helps in boosting the nation's image. On Tuesday more than 100 journalists were at the presidential bureau shooting queries on everything from the dress code for women to alleged nuclear cooperation with North Korea. Local and foreign scribes shot a volley of questions, sometimes irresponsibly and outside acceptable norms of protocol. The president fielded them in his usual sophisticated manner. Our president's candor and self-confidence is envied in camps unwilling to accept Iranian realities. Irrespective of the fact that on several counts (mostly on the conduct of the economy) the president's point of view was not very convincing, of cardinal importance is the fact that Hashemi-Rafsanjani is a man who believes in what he is doing and sees no reason to conceal his thoughts. There was also a barrage of questions on Islamic Iran's foreign policy. In short, clear and simple language the president made it known that his administration is keen on building normal relations with the international community. The universal truth that knowledge often fosters tolerance and understanding was amply clear between the lines. Censuring the British Government for its misdeeds plus bugging Iran's diplomatic mission in London, the president said. "This wrong deed by the British has created an atmosphere of insecurity and mistrust in relations, which will have negative consequences." However, he added immediately that "we do not wish to see the existence of such an atmosphere among countries." Hashemi-Rafsanjani is now in his second, and probably last term of office. Opinion about his administration is mixed at home and abroad, depending on one's knowledge about pre- and post-revolutionary Iran. For the second time this week President Hashemi-Rafsanjani chronicled the achievements made under his rule and insisted that Iran's economic condition is not as bad as some would like to publicize. Millions of Iranians saw and heard their president say this on TV. Many must have exchanged glances in disbelief. Mind you they, like millions across our Islamic nation, are people who want the president to succeed. On this count however, they could not help but disagree with him.
