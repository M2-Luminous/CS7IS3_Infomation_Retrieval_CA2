While talking about Xi Yang's case with Lo Cheung-kwok and his group, Zhang Junsheng said: "I returned from the mainland on a business trip only last night. This morning, I heard that you wanted an appointment with me. To make the meeting as early as possible, we arranged for the meeting this very afternoon. I am sorry for the inconvenience, since it is a weekend. "Just now you talked about Xi Yang's case. That has been a very unfortunate incident, indeed. I put it that way because none of us hoped to see anyone breaking the law, nor did we hope to see such a penalty meted out for that matter. However, a penalty must be meted out to any lawbreaker according to the law. "I believe you must have read about a ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE dispatch today. This is basically a legal affair. From the related information available to us, we can see that the case in question involved the stealing of state secrets. In handling this case, the judicial department carried out an investigation, enforced custody, and interrogated strictly according to legal procedures. "Some people say that the reporter `intruded in an off-limits area by mistake' in the course of normal news coverage, consequently violating the law. Still others think that it was entirely a matter of press freedom. I do not think this is correct. This was by no means normal news coverage. When Hong Kong reporters go to the mainland for news coverage, they have to send an application beforehand. Take our XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch for example. We often help Hong Kong reporters conduct news coverage on the mainland. However, we have never received an application from Xi Yang to cover the People's Bank of China, nor have we ever made any arrangements to that end. To our knowledge, Xi Yang had never made any similar application to the People's Bank of China, nor had he gained permission to conduct news coverage on related issues, nor had the People's Bank of China appointed its worker Tian Ye to accept Xi Yang's interview. It follows that Tian Ye had no right whatsoever to provide Xi Yang with information on related matters. This being the case, this was not a matter of news coverage, not a matter of press freedom, but an issue of violating the law. "To handle a criminal case according to the law is entirely the responsibility and power of the judicial department, which brooks no interference. It would also be violating the law to interfere with judicial departments in ruling on a case according to the law. It would also be wrong to affect judicial fairness through creating public opinion to add pressure on judicial departments. People should refrain from turning a legal issue into a political one. It is my hope that the British Hong Kong Government will stay away from this matter, which is within the realm of China's sovereignty. On a television newscast, we saw Mr. Chris Patten say "The closer 1997 approaches, and the greater the number of similar incidents, the more uneasy people will be and the more Hong Kong residents will worry about the future." Such words are wrong, and intentionally sow discord. Actually, Chris Patten has hinted that Hong Kong residents will increasingly conduct law-breaking activities in the mainland. That is throwing mud at Hong Kong residents." Regarding the letter submitted by the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood, Zhang Junsheng said he would relay it to the relevant department.
