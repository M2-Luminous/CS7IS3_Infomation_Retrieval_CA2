Taiwan authorities sent Lin Wenqiang's family of four back to China aboard aboard the Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 later Friday. The hijacking, the first this year, is expected to prompt China and Taiwan to reopen talks on the repatriation of hijackers, which collapsed over sovereignty and jurisdiction issues, officials here said. Lin, 26 [age as received], a businessman from the southern Chinese province of Fujian, told Taiwan police he was persecuted by the communists in China and thus sought political asylum in Taiwan. Dressed as a Chinese police officer, Lin surrendered to police immediately after the airplane touched down at Taiwan's international airport, police said. The plane had been scheduled to fly from Chengdu in Sichuan province to the southern coastal city of Fuzhou. The plane carrying 130 people, including the hijacker, his family and eight crew, began the journey from Changsha, Hunan province. "They (the communists) persecuted me ... and repeatedly turned down my application to open a business," police quoted Lin as saying in the initial investigation. Lin and his family -- his foster mother Li Yuying, 68, his wife Wang Chunlian, 23, his two sons Li Zhanghao, 9, and Li Zhangyao, 11,-- were taken to the airport police department for questioning, police said. "Investigation showed that the family were previously not aware of what the suspect would do, and so they were sent back along with other passengers," Interior Minister Wu Poh-hsiung told reporters here. But the wife resisted being put back on the plane and had to be forced, police said. The jetliner and the 129 people, including family members and crew, returned to China four hours after the plane landed here at 10:43 a.m. (0243 GMT). Lin was taken to the prosecutor's office for further questioning, police said. "As the hijacking took place in Taiwan, we have the absolute right to handle the case here and try the suspect before deciding whether to send him back," Wu said. Hijacking suspects' trials have been the major source of disagreement in the repatriation talks by the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The spate of hijackings, involving 15 mainlanders, including Lin, has become a new source of frictions between Taiwan and China. The two have remained rivals since the 1949 Chinese civil war after which the defeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan. Both governments claim sovereignty over all of China. China and Taiwan, represented by their semi-official agencies, began negotiations in Beijing in August 1993. The second round of talks was held in China's coastal city of Xiamen last November, and the third round was in Taipei in December. "They are reluctant to recognize our legal jurisdiction over the handling of the hijackers here, including trying them in Taiwan," Chiao Jen-ho, vice chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), charged. SEF handles the negotiations on Taiwan's behalf. "I believe the latest incident would prompt the mainland to realize the importance of the issue and to hold further talks with us," Chiao said. Taiwan's cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Friday expressed regret over the incident and called on China to quickly reopen talks with Taipei to resolve the issue. Taiwan has so far sentenced six of the 15 hijackers to jail terms ranging from six years to ten years.
