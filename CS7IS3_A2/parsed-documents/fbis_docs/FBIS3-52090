In the letter, Sha'th details Chairman 'Arafat's remarks regarding the border crossings and the territory of Jericho which were discussed in the Cairo meetings. At the conclusion of the letter, Sha'th asks Shahaq to meet him on 3 January in Taba to continue negotiations on other matters. On the morning of 30 December, Sha'th sent a fax to Jerusalem in which he detailed the understandings made at the meetings of the Liaison Committee in Norway, France, and Egypt. The formulations were edited, but contained no substantive changes. In his second fax, sent in the evening of 30 December, Sha'th rejected the agreements described in the first fax, on 'Arafat's behalf. [passage omitted] The PLO chairman demands that when Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region go through the border crossings, they are to be inspected at the Palestinian counter, and not even see Israeli officers and policemen when they enter the self-government district. He is willing to accept that residents of the West Bank, outside the Jericho region, undergo an Israeli inspection as well. [passage omitted] 'Arafat demands that a multinational force be present at the border crossings, and that a Palestinian policeman with a Palestinian flag be placed on the Jordan River bridges. [passage omitted] In his reply, 'Arafat rejects the agreement regarding the size of the Jericho district, according to which the Palestinians will assume control over the Musa 'Alami farm, east of Jericho, the village of al-'Awja', and the Qarantal monastery -- a total of 55 square km. The Cairo agreement stipulates that the self-government will be given management rights over religious affairs at the al-Nabi Musa site and the right of pilgrimage under a Palestinian flag to the Muratas site of Jesus' baptism. The Cairo agreements also spoke of the establishment of joint projects on the Dead Sea shores. 'Arafat demands that all the places mentioned in the Cairo draft be subject to full "administrative control" of the Palestinian authority: al-Nabi Musa, the baptism site, and an area on the north western shores of the Dead Sea. 'Arafat also wants to connect the Jordan crossings to Jericho with routes that will have a special status. In his letter, Sha'th refers to "crossings," and not just to the Allenby Bridge. Israeli sources have said that the PLO wants similar status on the Damiya Bridge and, in the future, on the 'Abdallah Bridge, the reconstruction and reopening of which is currently being discussed.
