The spectral technology developed is a ``resonance Raman gain spectrometer'', and it is a high performance spectrometer that can grasp the chemical changes of polymers as they change on the ultra short time base of femtoseconds. The structural relaxation based on the photo-excitation of PDA was anticipated by other methods, but this is the first time that the structural changes have been substantiated experimentally. PDA is a low level semiconductor material, and it is expected that PDA will have applications in non-linear optical materials. It is thought that in the future this new spectrometer will be very powerful in the analysis of the functions and structures of non-linear optical materials. Up to this point, this type resonance Raman gain spectrum and temporal analysis type device had been a very difficult and awkward detection method, and the research group of Assistant Professor Kobayashi was the first to develop it as a means for observing the changes of molecular combinations of polymers that change instantly on the level of several hundred femtoseconds. The device has an actual temporal analysis capacity to measure the spectrum in several hundred femtoseconds. It is expected that the electron spectrum data relating to the principle chain structure relaxation of PDA will greatly expand the electron spectrum data gathered so far involving changes in polymers. However, it cannot be said that the electron spectrum directly reflects the structure of atoms and molecules, and it has been necessary to specify the structure by observing atoms and molecules using an oscillation spectrum based on their internal oscillations. As a temporal analysis oscillation spectral measurement methods, up to this point there have been: temporal analysis infrared absorption; resonance natural emission Raman dispersion; and the resonance coherent anti-Stokes Raman dispersion method or the so-called CARS method. However, in these methods of oscillation spectral observation, there are the problems of an insufficient temporal resolution and of a great amount of noise because the structural relaxation of polymer excitons occurs instantaneously on the femtosecond base. Therefore, these methods are lacking a decisive feature. With the new technology, there is very little background signal noise, and it has ultra high resolution on the level of several hundred femtoseconds. In the observations of PDA this time, as expected, signals were observed indicating that the structure of the free exciton changed by photo-excitation in less than 200 femtoseconds from the acetylene type to the butatriene type. The mechanism by which non-linear optical materials bring about these changes instantly will be clarified by the equipment developed, and conversely, the equipment will spur on the development of future functional optical materials by playing a role in the development of new non-linear optical materials.
