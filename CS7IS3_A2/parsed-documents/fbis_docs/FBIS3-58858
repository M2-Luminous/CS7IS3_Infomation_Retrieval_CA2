According to various surveys, 54 to 60 percent of Americans say they are satisfied with their 42d President. This is a dramatic recovery after a difficult summer during which George Bush's successor had fallen lower in his fellow citizens' esteem than any President since World War II. "America first," such was the tireless rallying cry of democratic candidate Clinton throughout his electoral campaign. The promise was kept. Mr. Clinton managed to get Congress to approve a budget that is a first step on the deficit-cutting road. He also pushed through a plan for penniless university students to retroactively finance their education through community service. Above all, he saw to the passage of the Brady Bill, which imposes a five-day wait on gun sales in order to check the buyer's criminal record and which had been stalled for years. A blueprint for health care reform -- the President's grand design, and that of his wife Hillary -- was unveiled. Mr. Clinton did not wobble on the essential aspect of it, which is offering health insurance to all Americans, regardless of their financial resources. Debate in Congress on the ambitious project will likely take up the better part of 1994. Even if the final result does not fulfil all hopes placed into the reform, M. Clinton can at least be credited with tackling a vital issue which his predecessors had cagily eschewed. The year 1993 ended with two successes as regards international trade liberalization: The passage by Congress of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and the successful conclusion of the Uruguay round of GATT. Mr. Clinton's intensive last-minute canvassing of Congress members in the former case and his ability to demonstrate a measure of flexibility so as to carry the day in the latter were major factors in these two victories. This year's weaknesses are to be found on foreign policy, with the exception of trade matters. In Bosnia and Haiti, after looking determined to act, Mr. Clinton backed down. He also let himself be foiled by General Aidid's stubborn resistance in Somalia. However, all this -- including his perhaps indiscriminate support to Boris Yeltsin -- hardly matters in the eye of his fellow Americans. Most important is the fact that Mr. Clinton's first year in the White House was also the one during which America reacquainted itself with economic growth.
