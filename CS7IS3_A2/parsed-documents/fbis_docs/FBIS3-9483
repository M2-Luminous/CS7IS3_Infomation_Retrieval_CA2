[Boban] The enemy is still trying to breach the defense lines on the Rujnica front. All their attempts hitherto have been thwarted. In some sectors the defenders launched attacks themselves. In the fighting, which is still in progress, the Serbian aggressor has suffered significant losses in manpower, more than 15 were killed and many more put out of action. Considering the ferocity of the chetnik attacks, new attempts to breach the defense lines should be expected. The soldiers and officers of the Bosna Operations Group are ready to protect their positions.
