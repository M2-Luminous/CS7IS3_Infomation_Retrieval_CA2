Ivan Samel, an editor, today asked PDL Chairman Peter Weiss about the content of the conversation. [Begin recording] [Samel] Mr. Chairman, the subject of your telephone conversation yesterday with the prime minister was a proposal to reach a compromise solution on the bill amending the existing law on the privatization of large enterprises. How did you react to that proposal? [Weiss] We are not against discussions. Nonetheless, we have already declared our position quite clearly. [Samel] We have heard that a part of that proposal was to link the privatization of large enterprises to the question of a vote of confidence or no-confidence in the government. [Weiss] We have envisaged such a tactical variant. In this instance, however, the main issue is the content of this law--in order to calm down the atmosphere surrounding privatization and in order that the law should provide guarantees for effective parliamentary and public supervision of the privatization process, with the aim that privatization ceases to be a bone of contention between political parties. Unless this problem is resolved, such suspicion will constantly destabilize any government. [passage omitted] [Samel] In your view, is there a will within the opposition to force the resignation of the government or cast a vote of no-confidence in it? [Weiss] Within the opposition, there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the way the government is governing the country. The government lacks a concept of economic policy; it has a bad, a very bad, image abroad, it is not sufficiently open, and there is not a rational division of labor in the government; and decisionmaking is being increasingly concentrated in the hands of one person, which is not solely a political problem because it is a problem of government operation. To put it simply, it is no longer possible for one man, however hardworking he may be, to be able to cope with such a number of problems within the time frame available. [passage omitted] [Samel] We have also learned that, during the telephone conversation, a proposal was made to keep this government in office until early parliamentary elections are held, which should take place at the beginning of this summer. [Weiss] We are in favor of early elections, but we do not see any reason for giving support to this government. [Samel] Are you going to hold separate talks with the group that has been created within the HZDS? [Weiss] We will hold political discussions with anyone who is prepared to resolve this political crisis in a democratic manner so that the power does not lie in the street but, rather, so that the citizens make the decision in the end, in early democratic elections.
