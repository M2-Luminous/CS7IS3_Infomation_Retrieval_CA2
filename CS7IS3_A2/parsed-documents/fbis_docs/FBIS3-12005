This new, weak terrorist act caused only damage. The attacks caused heavy damage, which has yet to be assessed, to a Credit Bank office in the Victoria district and to the CPT office located in the San Luis district. Several blasts, which were initially believed to be bombs, were also heard simultaneously in several points of the city. These blasts, however, turned out to be dynamite sticks that went off in the air. Shortly before the attacks, there was a power surge apparently caused by an unsuccessful attempt to sabotage the power transmission line that supplies Lima. Terrorist attacks have declined markedly since Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman was captured in 1992 and have declined further since Guzman admitted his defeat and sought to negotiate with the government in September 1993.
