[passage omitted] The government seems to agree that one must be prepared for anything and must react flexibly. At first, however, it seemed as if there were insurmountable differences between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Democratic Party: While the opposition had called for compromise with the North, including diplomatic recognition by the United States, in the interest of safeguarding peace, the government party seemed to rely on a policy of strength. The opposition assumes that this might have been supposed to be a gesture toward the military, which has gradually been out of politics under Kim Young-sam. Strength and striving for peace are not irreconcilable, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, one of the main actors in the Korean drama, said in an interview with this newspaper. Unfortunately, one has had to recognize that in the past, progress with North Korea was possible only if one negotiated from a position of strength. Like President Kim, Han, too, thinks that the military situation on the Korean peninsula is not more threatening than in the past. The possibility that North Korea will use nuclear weapons as soon as it has them cannot be ruled out. And even if this does not happen, nuclear weapons could become a means of permanent blackmail. Then one must expect the danger of military provocations with conventional weapons to grow. However, the greatest threat is emanating from the international proliferation of nuclear weapons, which is to be expected in any case, if North Korea has nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Han categorically rejected criticism from the ranks of the opposition Democratic Party that the United States has reacted excessively to the North Korean refusal to have its nuclear facilities examined by the IAEA and is pursuing its own interests in the region, which are not identical to the South Korean interests. On the contrary, Han says, the official policy of the United States is characterized by great patience. The U.S. Administration has done everything possible to promote negotiations, and for North Korea it would have been very easy several times to give in without losing face. South Korea has always advocated direct negotiations between the two Korean states; however, so far this has been in vain. North Korea rejects direct negotiations by arguing that the South has not signed the cease-fire agreement which put an end to the Korean war. Han referred to agreements that were signed by North and South Korea, among others one in 1992 in which they state that they will not acquire nuclear weapons. The South Korean Government has little enthusiasm about the alleged private trip by former U.S. President Carter to Pyongyang. The opposition, on the other hand, has welcomed Carter's efforts for mediation. If he returns with new proposals from Pyongyang, they will be examined thoroughly, Han Sung-chu said. The foreign minister expressed satisfaction about the international support for South Korea. So far, China's role has been constructive, the government in Beijing has promoted the negotiations in its own way. He also expressed satisfaction about the close cooperation with Japan. Even though Japan might have problems with the Korean minority who feel committed to North Korea, he is sure, nevertheless, that the country will follow the measures which the United Nations will decide, within the limits set by the Japanese Constitution. Han thinks that at the moment an international conference on the issues of this region would be of little help, even though he does not basically reject such an event. First, the current conflict must be settled and only then will there be the right time for international discussions, the South Korean foreign minister said.
