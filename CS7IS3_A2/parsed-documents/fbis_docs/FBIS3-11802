He pointed out that even though the Mexican Stock Market has seen a decrease in the number of transactions, this is a natural phenomenon because of the recent assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio [Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, presidential candidate]. In an interview, Gonzalo Altamirano Dimas said stability in the Mexican Stock Market will depend on immediate actions by the government. [Begin Altamirano recording] The interests of the country should prevail over other interests no matter how legitimate they may be. We want the death of Colosio to be cleared up and explained. We join the demand that exists. We want an in-depth investigation. Those responsible should be arrested and punished with the full weight of the law. We also believe the 1994 election process should be clean and legitimate. I believe it all goes together. Whoever wants to bet against this situation would be sowing uncertainty and possibly violence in the country. We do not want that. [end recording] Gonzalo Altamirano Dimas, president of the PAN in the capital, also said the PRI should have a new presidential candidate soon because he will have to conduct an intense campaign as the opposition is already getting the citizens' support. In addition, deputies from the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] rejected all kinds of violence and sent their condolences to the relatives of Luis Donaldo Colosio. In a news conference, the PRD deputies demanded a thorough investigation of the PRI candidate's assassination and demanded that those found guilty be punished. PRD Deputy Alejandro Encinas said the commission that will investigate the attack on Luis Donaldo Colosio has begun to operate and will be in Tijuana on Saturday to meet with the high-ranking federal authorities. The PRD deputy said the area where the attack took place will be studied and a detailed report will be drafted that will be submitted on Monday to the Congressional Permanent Commission, which will also hold sessions on that day. That is all we have for now.
