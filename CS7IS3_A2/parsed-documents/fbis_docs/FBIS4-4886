Present at the meeting were Secretary General of the Japan Committee for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea Hiroshi Wakabayashi, chairman of the Japan-Korea Association of Scientific and Educational exchange Kiyoo Nakakoji, honorary professor of Rikkyo University Yasusaburo Hoshino and other Japanese figures and Tokyo citizens, more than 200 in all. In his lecture at the meeting, Prof. Yashuhiro Maeda of Kitakyushu University said the Democratic People's Republic of Korea did not want a war and dealt with the United States on an independent principle. He charged that the United States was encouraging the Japanese and South Korean authorities to intensify the moves to isolate the DPRK. A resolution was adopted at the meeting. Noting that the demand of the International Atomic Energy Agency in the course of its recent inspection was a deliberate interference in socialist Korea, it said it resulted in creating a touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula which might lead to a war any time. It stressed that as long as the United States sought "world supremacy by strength," an anachronistic design, military tensions would be increased and the danger of a war would persist in the world. It urged the United States to renounce "the policy of strength." The resolution demanded that the Hosokawa government, instead of following the United States, make an apology for Japan's colonial domination and war of aggression, renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK, show all sincerity in liquidating the consequences of its colonial domination and make efforts for the resumption of the Japan-DPRK negotiation for the progress of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries on the basis of the joint declaration signed by the Workers' Party of Korea, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Social-Democratic Party of Japan.
