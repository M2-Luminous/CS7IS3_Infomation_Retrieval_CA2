On 7 March, the Hanoi Vietnamese communists ordered their lackey puppets in the two-headed government to claim once again that the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] had used Thai territory to defeat them on the Anlung Veng battlefield. This is a dirty and base accusation; no one except the notoriously cunning Vietnamese communists could think of playing the trick of the thief shouting: Stop thief! II. For what purpose did the Vietnamese communists order their puppets to level this accusation? It was based on the following: 1. Covering their most shameful and severe defeat on the Anlung Veng battlefield. The Vietnamese communists and their alliance have claimed various unreasonable pretexts to fool their lackeys into further inflaming the war to serve their strategic policies. 2. Covering the shipment of Vietnamese forces and armaments to Cambodia in accordance with what the Vietnamese communists call Cambodian-Vietnamese military cooperation, which they agreed upon with the puppet Chea Sim in Hanoi in early March. The Vietnamese communists have painstakingly implemented the strategy and tactics of launching attacks in western Cambodia and shipping Vietnamese men and women to the eastern part of the country. 3. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] and the NADK have always respected and will always respect the Kingdom of Thailand's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They have never done anything that affects the Royal Thai Government or the Thai people. The PDK and the entire Cambodian nation and people want to coexist peacefully with all neighboring countries, especially Thailand and the Thai people, who respect other countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Thais are different from the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government, who -- relying on the Vietnamese communists and the Western alliance -- have implemented the policy of further inflaming the war, both inside and outside the country, and then denounced other people without any sense of responsibility. [Dated] 9 March 1994 [Signed] The NADK spokesman
