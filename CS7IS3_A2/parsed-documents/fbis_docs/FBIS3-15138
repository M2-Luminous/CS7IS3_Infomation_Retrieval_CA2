On the first day of the 17th round of Estonian-Russian talks yesterday [1 March], Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin, the leader of the Russian delegation, continued to link the withdrawal of 2,600 Russian servicemen from Estonia with social guarantees for [Russian] military pensioners [living in Estonia]. Svirin told Estonian Television yesterday that Russia is prepared to present a schedule for troop withdrawal if Estonia agrees to sign an agreement concerning social guarantees for military pensioners and their family members. The Estonian Foreign Ministry says in its statement today that such action is in conflict with UN and CSCE documents according to which Russia has taken upon herself the obligation of withdrawing her troops from Estonia unconditionally. Ambassador Vaino Reinart, the Estonian delegation leader, regrets that Russia wants to initial the two agreements as a single package. The Estonian delegation requested also an explanation for the statement made on 28 February by Aleksandr Udaltsev, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, on the first day of the talks. According to the statement, it is too soon to talk about the Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia by 31 August of the current year. According to the Russian delegation, Udaltsev's position does not coincide with the official Russian position.
