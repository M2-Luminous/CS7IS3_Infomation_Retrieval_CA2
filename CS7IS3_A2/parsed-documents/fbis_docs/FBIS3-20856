General feelings of insecurity were on the rise until June 1991, when they culminated--a mere 11 percent of the population at that time considered its economic situation to be advantageous. Since that time, the satisfaction factor among the people is showing a rising trend. The most recent November investigations conducted by the Sociological Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and by the Center for Empirical Research (STEM) on "economic expectations and attitudes," contains proof of this: Their situation is characterized as being favorable today by every fourth household and virtually 73 percent of the population believes that the economic and political changes will provide subsequent generations with a better future than that which the communist regime could provide them. That is not altered in the least even by the finding that one-half of our fellow citizens continues to designate its standard of living as being lower than it was prior to November 1989. The creation of a democratic framework is the fundamental goal and, at the same time, represents the means of the reform. That postulate is also accepted by the majority of the people--71 percent of the citizens of the Czech Republic thought, in November, that society was developing in the proper direction and 63 percent even agree with the contention that the establishment of the foundations for democracy has already succeeded. Nevertheless, in this country the inclination toward a totalitarian method of thinking continues to survive. More than half of the population (53 percent) continues to agree with the statement that "it would be better for our country if, instead of discussions on various methods for solving the current situation, there were a firm hand and someone to clearly say what should be done." We even find a similar "discrepancy" between the continuing high support for the government, which espouses the ideas of economic liberalism, and the actual orientation of the majority of society, which is increasingly paternalistic. Whereas in June 1992 48 percent showed preference for the social market model, in which the state exerts a substantial influence over the economy, today that number has already risen to 59 percent. In contrast, ideas of a free market, in which the state is involved only to a minimum extent, is espoused today by only one-third of society (36 percent), which is 11 percent less than was the case last year in June. Despite an overall high standard of living, significant social and economic differences are a characteristic feature of the market economy. At first glance, even here it seems that our society is prepared for this situation. The majority of people agree with the claim that it is correct for "truly capable people to have lots of money, even millions" (75 percent) and that "differences in salaries should be even increased" (66 percent). At the same time, however, eight out of 10 people think that, in our country, "people grow rich primarily through dishonest methods." At the general sociological level, it can, therefore, be stated that in our society certain prejudices and embitterments against rich people continue to be strongly rooted. Incidentally, that conclusion is confirmed even by yet another finding of the investigation: a strong inclination within society toward paternalism. An almost banal answer exists to the question why Czech society frequently adopts paradoxic and confusing attitudes toward economic issues: The reason lies in the gradual profiling of disparate social strata, which can be demonstrated, in a simplified manner, by noting the difference between latent paternalism and liberalism. (These attitudes are designated as being latent because not a single one of them is openly proclaimed, but is, rather, the result of the analysis of responses to substantive questions.) We briefly define paternalism as over-reliance on the role of the state, even in areas of social and economic life which are primarily the responsibility of the individual. In the investigation, paternalism was therefore characterized by positive responses to questions such as: Should the state officially set prices more vigorously, should it assure everyone who wants to work a job, or whether the state should guarantee people a place to live? By contrast, the liberal orientation stresses the role of the individual in all spheres of life and, in the investigation, is characterized, for example, by the agreement with the contention that "everyone is primarily to blame for their own poverty." Data obtained in this manner indicate that, in our country, some 59 percent of the population are inclined toward latent paternalism, whereas 41 percent are inclined toward latent liberalism. And if we compare the data with the previously made statement--that six out of 10 people prefer the so-called social version of the market economy--then we find that virtually 80 percent of those who favor the social market economy actually visualize this concept as being the directive functioning of the state--much as we know it from the past. Not even the question as to the extent to which the paradoxic views of people and their inclination toward latent paternalism or liberalism are determined by their political orientations is without interest. The respondents in the investigation, therefore, were tasked to list their political orientation. The results indicate that a large portion of the people tend to identify with the political center. However, that group is not characterized by any kind of more compact orientation and their views are somewhat unclear and frequently confused. (And that is not to even say anything about the fact that 33 percent of the people with paternalistic views consider themselves to be rightist in their orientation.) A significant finding which has been statistically confirmed is also the fact that as "paternalists" as well as "liberalists" these people have their own socioeconomic hinterland, so to speak. Of course, there can be no talk of a unilateral "class" determinism, but, nevertheless, a certain connection between the attitude and the social anchoring of an individual is discernible from the investigation. The entrepreneurial and managerial layer, for example, is characterized by its liberal attitude, whereas the cooperative sector is paternalistic. Much the same is true of property: The more property a person owns, the greater the inclination toward liberalism. However, in addition to economic aspects, it is also possible to find additional statistically significant factors here which tend to influence the formation of views. In the liberally oriented group, younger people and people in their middle years up to 45 tend to predominate. Also, education is important: Virtually 74 percent of the respondents with a basic education are paternalistic in their orientation, whereas 57 percent of people with advanced school education are liberal in their orientation. Despite the fact that attitudes toward the reform are reflected in the social structure of society, it would be misleading to claim that this involves rigidly separated blocks. In other words: The investigation indicated that the differences are not so great as to enable us to say that the conflict between paternalism and liberalism is a dispute between the poor and the rich and that it thus seriously threatens the stability of the Czech Republic.
