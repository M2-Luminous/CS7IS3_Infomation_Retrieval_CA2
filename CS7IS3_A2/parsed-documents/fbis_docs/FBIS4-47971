Petrol filling stations have been running out of fuel, and there has been a spate of deaths. On the latest, Sola Odunfa reports from Lagos: [Begin Odunfa recording] At least eight persons died in a petrol tanker fire in Lagos yesterday. Two others suffered severe injuries. The casualties were members of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG, who were in a motorcade of about 22 fuel tankers from Yaba on Lagos mainland to the Lagos State Secretariat, about 10 km away to protest to the military administrator alleged harassment of their colleagues by state officials. The lead vehicle of the motorcade ran out of control and into the (?path) of the vehicle behind it. The two crashed and burst into flames, trapping occupants of their driver compartments. When the fire subsided two hours later, eight bodies were pulled out of the debris. Two other victims are receiving treatment for severe burns. The deaths bring to at least 13 the number of people killed in petrol fires in the past two weeks of severe petrol shortage in Nigeria. The shortage itself is easing as a result of supplementary import and consulted efforts by all agencies of government to stamp out hoarding and diversion of supplies from authorized outlets. In Lagos, petrol is being rationed to motorists at 30 liters per purchase in a bid to meet the available stock demand. Soldiers and policemen are supervising distribution and sales. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Labor Congress, NLC, has dissociated itself from the call by the human rights group, Campaign for Democracy, for its sit-at-home protest by workers and market women on Monday [9 May]. Reacting, NLC spokesman, Malam Salisu Muhammed, told journalists in Lagos that the planned protest was senseless. [end recording]
