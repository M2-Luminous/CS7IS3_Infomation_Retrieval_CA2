Karimov arrived for a four-day visit to Japan on Monday. According to the president, the key purpose of this visit is to promote economic cooperation between the two countries. "Japanese businessmen are very cautious in their approach to the tapping of the Uzbek market, which is new for them," Karimov said. "They have been carefully studying Uzbekistan for the past one and a half years, focusing their main attention to the assessment of the political stability in the Republic, which is an inalienable precondition for the development of economic cooperation. Now this work is nearing completion." Today, Japan is adopting important decisions on economic cooperation with Uzbekistan at government level. Some major Japanese private companies are getting down to business on the Uzbek market, the president added. At the same time, Karimov complained against the shortage of information on Uzbekistan in foreign countries, including Japan. He noted that the new Uzbek laws and government decisions, aimed at creating optimal conditions for the operation of foreign companies, were still unknown in Japan. In connection with the claims of the Japanese press that foreign companies were heavily taxed in Uzbekistan, Karimov said that there was an Uzbek law exempting joint ventures, in which there are more than 10 per cent of foreign capital, from state taxation for a period of five years. All customs duties on imported goods are fully annulled in the republic until 1 July 1995. "We have created all the necessary conditions for foreign investors," the Uzbek president said. Touching on his visit to Japan, Karimov noted that Uzbekistan was planning to study most seriously Japan's experience in restoring its economy after the war and to use it in the Republic.
