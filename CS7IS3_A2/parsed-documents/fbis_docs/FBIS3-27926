He said PBS leaders were willing to do anything to ensure their continued administration in the state, including the use of sentiments and creating hatred toward the federal government. The prime minister was addressing a dinner function organized by the Sabah Bumiputera [Indigenous]-Chinese chambers of commerce and industry in Kota Kinabalu last night. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir clarified that the political stability and peace was the main factor for the rapid economic development in the country, which is able to maintain a growth rate of eight percent for six consecutive years. However, according to him, this was the national average per se. States like Pahang, Johor, and Melaka have achieved a 13-percent growth rate, while Sabah has recorded the lowest growth rate -- just a mere four percent. The prime minister explained that the federal government has no ill intention toward the people of Sabah and the federal government will assist a state toward development for the benefit of all the people in that state.
