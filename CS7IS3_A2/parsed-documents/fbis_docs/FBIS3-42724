I had come to their home--the former residence of the Chechen-Ingush Obkom [oblast party committee], where General Dudayev's portrait is now displayed prominently--twice, but she was unable to talk, although she did try... The third time, apparently moved by the feeling that we have to talk somehow--after all, a person has traveled all the way from Moscow--she rose from a sofa where she lay lying covered with a plaid blanket and moved to a nearby chair. I expected the conversation to go one of two ways: once engaged in conversation about her husband she may again feel unwell and I would have to leave again, perhaps for good; or, on the contrary, reminiscences would perk her up somewhat, distract her from the continuous self-immolation that had been going on for many days now. Fortunately, it was the latter--as we talked, her face regained some color; being a direct and emotional person, she immersed herself entirely in the world she was talking about. [Moroz] Manana, when was the last time you saw Zviad Konstantinovich? [Gamsakhurdia] On 24 September. That was the day he left here. That was our last meeting. [Moroz] Did you talk on the phone? [Gamsakhurdia] We talked on the phone every day. [Moroz] When was your last conversation? [Gamsakhurdia] When they entered Zugdidi. After that all communications between us were cut. [Moroz] Who are "they"? [Gamsakhurdia] The Tbilisi junta and the Russian paratroops. [Moroz] What did you talk about? The events in Western Georgia? [Gamsakhurdia] No, we did not talk about the events because the conversations were listened to. He was simply reassuring me: "Do not worry, Manana, everything will be fine." He still had hopes that the Russian troops would be withdrawn from Western Georgia. I kept telling him: "Zviad, you are probably lying to me. You say everything is going well, but the television says entirely different things."--"No, Manana, this is not so. I am right in the thick of events. The people have rebelled. Everyone is for the president. So do not worry. These Russians will not be able to hold on here for long." It turned out differently, though. The Russians together with Mkhedrioni cleared out the whole of Mingrelia.[end Gamsakhurdia] I had heard this contention--that the Russian troops, "Baltin's landing," had been instrumental in the defeat of Gamsakhurdia's supporters--before I met with Manana Gamsakhurdia for this interview, from her household. I tried to say something timidly: The Russian soldiers only provided protection of railroads and communications, I said--but was mercilessly ridiculed as a victim of Moscow's propaganda. For this reason, this time I chose not to argue with Manana. [Moroz] When did you learn of your husband's death? From whom? [Gamsakhurdia] On 4 January. From a person close to us... [Moroz] How true is this information? Rumors are still circulating that Gamsakhurdia is alive... [Gamsakhurdia] You see, I would love to believe this more than anybody else. I am the closest person to him, and I am taking it hard... I do not even know how I will survive this all. But I had to believe it because my acquaintance told me everything, beginning to end. [Moroz] You have not seen, of course, the last note your husband left behind? [Gamsakhurdia] What note? There was no note. This is all conjecture. [Moroz] How did the children take the news of their father's death? [Gamsakhurdia] Oh, do not remind me of this! This is the second tragedy in my family. The younger one tells me: "Mama, when I get up in the morning I feel as if this is all a dream..." And the older one... I do not know how he will get through all this. He stays up all night and cries endlessly. And talks to him as if he were alive.[end Gamsakhurdia] Gamsakhurdia's sons--17-year-old and very tall Tsotne, and 15-year-old Georgiy, who looks very much like his father--of course do not approve of their mother's revelations in a conversation with a journalist. Their pain and suffering is their own personal business, something they do not display to outsiders. But, of course, it would not occur to them to say even one word of reproach to their mother. [Moroz] Does the younger one take it easier? [Gamsakhurdia] The younger one does not let me see his tears. So that I will not get upset and start crying, too. I found out that he goes out into the yard, sits behind the house, and cries there. The older one cannot help it. He is crying right now. And will keep crying all night--until 0800, 0900. He is crying and talking to him: "Zviad, I cannot accept it! Why are you lying there? Why do I still live?"[end Gamsakhurdia] Yes, this is inconsolable human grief, an inconsolable human tragedy. And the devil has prompted me once again, how many times is it now, to barge in on human grief, human tragedy, with idle journalistic curiosity. But such are the rules of the game, such are the rules of the profession. There are moments when the journalistic profession prompts one to immoral acts. It is a vicious circle: being a professional, one does immoral things. I should have thought about this earlier, when I decided to choose a journalistic career. "He says such words," Manana continues, referring to the older son. "He prays endlessly, from morning to night. They took the Bible and read it together. They beg our Lord to return their father to them alive--for our father to rise from ashes, they say, like Lazarus. This is a great tragedy." [Moroz] Zviad Konstantinovich was a busy man. Did he still find time to spend with his sons? [Gamsakhurdia] Time is not important in communication. He was like a friend, an older comrade to them. He found time for them... Sometimes he would come and kiss them late at night, when they were already asleep. And when he was leaving--oh, my, how they parted! How they hugged and kissed each other! [Moroz] Did they not want to go with him? [Gamsakhurdia] Oh, yes, of course... This is precisely the point. The older one cries all night: "Why did Zviad not take me there? I would die next to him! What do I need this life for without a father, without such a man! Zviad was a holy man for me."[end Gamsakhurdia] I talked to both boys. In conversation with a stranger, Tsotne did not display even a hint of any weakness. He answered the questions in a measured, somewhat dry manner. Among other things he said that at this point he does not plan to engage in political activities. On the other hand, again, this does not tell of his true intentions--only that he does not intend to reveal them to every stranger. He is a first-year student at the University of Chechnya. The Department of Philology, Roman and German languages--his father's specialty. It was his father who helped him prepare for the entrance exams last summer. The younger one, Georgiy, on the contrary, does not hide his career plans: "They are wrong to think that my father's death brought everything to an end!"--"Do you understand," I tell him, "what a dangerous road you want to take?"--"Yes, I do. I am not afraid to die."--"Do you not have any pity for your mother? Did she not have enough when your father died?" He is silent, staring in the air. On the outside, a regular teenager in a denim jacket and sports woolen cap pulled down over his forehead, edges rolled up like a loop. It is always shocking when a child, prematurely grown up, says words that few adults would utter. [Moroz] Manana, are you not concerned that the boys will also get involved in the political struggle now and will be in danger? [Gamsakhurdia] They already are in danger now. Shevardnadze is a kind of a man who will stop at nothing.[end Gamsakhurdia] Still, let us hope for the best. There are still several years to go. Lately, the world around us has been undergoing a complete makeover, beyond recognition, in a matter of two to three years. Who would think that one of the most famous Soviet dissidents, many times arrested, persecuted, and later elected president of Georgia by an absolute majority of the vote (87 percent), would end his life by putting a gun to his head in a God-forsaken mountain village, hounded and surrounded from all sides, and his family, alone and disconsolate, would be mourning the irretrievable loss of a loved one in a strange land? Perhaps in a few years everything will turn around in just as unexpected and strange way and the sons will not have to repeat the crusades of their fathers? [Moroz] Manana, how did you meet? To the best of my knowledge, you are 10 years younger than your husband. [Gamsakhurdia] Yes. What brought us together was the illnesses of our mothers. My mother developed cancer, and I was looking for a Swiss medication that at the time was not sold in the Soviet Union. It so happened that Zviad's mother, Miranda Gamsakhurdia, also had cancer at the time, and I learned accidentally that they had this medication. I asked whether they would share it with me. So one day Zviad comes and drops off a pile like this of packets of the medication. And a whole folder of materials on how to use it. This is how we met. [Moroz] Did you have a traditional Georgian family or was it different from other families? [Gamsakhurdia] It was a traditional Georgian family. It was also traditional in the sense that it had long traditions. Because his mother was a princess, and his father was a prince as well. As you know, he was a Georgian national writer. [Moroz] Which period of life was the happiest for you? [Gamsakhurdia] Which?.. Upon the passage of these 20 years--in October of this year we were to celebrate our 20-year wedding anniversary--it turns out that all periods were happy for me. Despite the fact that we were constantly persecuted and arrested twice. I mean, he was arrested twice. During our life together. Altogether he had been arrested four times. We went to internal exile together--Kizlyar Rayon in Dagestan... [Moroz] Was this a happy period, too? [Gamsakhurdia] Let me tell you this. It was very difficult there. Very. We spent 18 months there. Cold and hungry, the KGB constantly over our heads. He was not permitted to travel more than 10 kilometers from the designated point of exile. Every Saturday or Sunday we were visited by people from Neftekumsk who came to ascertain that he was still there. The conditions were terrible. In the winter, minus 40 degrees. Monsoon winds. And intolerable heat in the summer. All sort of insects, tarantulas... We were very poor. Despite all of this, however, I was the happiest woman in the world. Because we were together. Prior to that we had not seen each other for such a long time, and now we were there. This was 2 August 1979. [Moroz] That you had a lot of hardship in exile is to be expected. What about other times--you probably lived quite well? I mean, in a material sense. [Gamsakhurdia] I have never been interested in the things many women are interested in these days--dressing well, shining at receptions, travelling abroad... I did not travel abroad; I dressed as our budget permitted. I did not consider this a misfortune. Or fortune, for that matter. I repeat, I was the happiest woman in the world because I was next to such a man... [Moroz] Why did you not take the name of Gamsakhurdia? [Gamsakhurdia] My surname is Archvadze-Gamsakhurdia. You see, in our family there were three sisters--my parents did not have any sons. When I was still in 10th grade I promised my father I would keep his name as long as I lived. [Moroz] Did you discuss political issues with your husband? [Gamsakhurdia] No, we did not, but our life was such that whether we wanted it or not, everything revolved around politics. When a man is persecuted, when they show up at your house with a search warrant, when you are arrested, exiled, sent to Lefortovo prison, to a psychiatric ward--what else can you talk about? [Moroz] Did your parents try to talk you out of marrying Gamsakhurdia? [Gamsakhurdia] My parents had passed away by then. But my mother knew Zviad before we got married--they became acquainted after the incident with the medication. She loved Zviad very much, so naturally she would not have tried to talk me out of it. As for myself, I knew very well what I was doing. Even before we got married, whenever he visited me he brought various anti-Soviet literature published in Moscow. Such as the CHRONICLES OF CURRENT EVENTS. We reprinted and distributed it. I think that Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn and Alik Ginzburg will never forget that Gamsakhurdia was the first person to distribute the "GULAG Archipelago" in the Soviet Union. When he was arrested in 1977, the first charge against him was distributing the "Archipelago." Then later there was publication of the GOLDEN FLEECE and VESTNIK GRUZII [GEORGIAN HERALD]. I, too, participated in their distribution.[end Gamsakhurdia] A year and a half ago in this house, in an adjacent room, in the office of the head of the house, I spent two hours talking to Zviad Gamsakhurdia himself. Both then and now I kept, and keep, thinking that perhaps it would have been better if that difficult but romantic period of dissident life had lasted as long as possible? Actually, better for whom? After all, the world surrounding us has indeed changed for the better. Or at least it is on the way to such a change. Thanks to dissidents among others. But dissidents themselves suddenly started feeling uncomfortable in it. The simplicity of existence is gone: Here is an anti-people's, inhuman authority we have to fight against with all we have got. Should it be surprising that few of the former rebels have been able to adapt to these changes? [Moroz] You said that all the periods of your life with Zviad Gamsakhurdia were happy. Does the period when he became first Supreme Soviet chairman and then president not stand apart in some way? [Gamsakhurdia] It does, and probably for the worse. I was very upset when I learned that he had become chairman of the Georgian Supreme Soviet. At the time of his election I was in the audience. Maybe I had a premonition of what tragedy was in store for us in the future--I began crying. A journalist came over to me and asked why I was crying when everyone around me was jubilant. I said that beginning that day our family was ruined. Because Zviad took upon himself such a heavy cross to bear. Had we lived in a normal state, had Georgia not been occupied by a foreign army, had Georgia been a democratic independent country, it would have been different. True, when he became president I was happy because Zviad himself was happy. Because the absolute majority of the Georgian population supported him. I believed that now nobody could treat him like they treated, for instance, the disobedients in Vilnius. It turned out, though, that they had completely different intentions. What was in store for us was worse. This is what I could not anticipate. [Moroz] Still, you had bad premonitions... Did you not try to talk him out of this fight? I mean this time--this last period of his life. [Gamsakhurdia] In no way. Never. Because he had chosen this road since childhood, since he was 15. He was first arrested when he was 16. I had no moral right to be talking him out of it. How could I face him with an ultimatum: "You must stop fighting!"? This means he would have to leave Georgia. I was not capable of saying such a thing to him because I also love my motherland. I also wanted Georgia to be free, to separate from the other republics. And in the end Zviad's dream did come true. Why should I stand in his way? He took the road of Christ and the road of freedom. The road of purity and the road of love. [Moroz] How was your life in Groznyy? [Gamsakhurdia] Very difficult. Despite all the attention we were given here. The people came to love Zviad very much. [Moroz] Did you meet with President Dudayev often? [Gamsakhurdia] Very often. They were like brothers with Gamsakhurdia despite different faiths. He is also so upset now! And his wife visits us almost every day. They do everything possible to prevent us feeling alone here. [Moroz] Did you try to talk your husband out of going to Georgia last September? [Gamsakhurdia] No. This was the only time he ever deceived me. Although I would rather not see this word in a newspaper. He wanted to shield us somehow from this situation, not wanting to jeopardize the life of his sons. He told me: "Manana, I will go alone for now, and after some time--very soon--you will come with the children." I was waiting for that day. Can you imagine? I was waiting: Maybe he will send someone today, tomorrow... We talked on the phone, and I kept reminding him: "Zviad, what about it? Will you keep your word or not?"--"I will, Manana. It will be very soon." This is how he stalled for time. He knew everything beforehand and did not want to jeopardize his family. [Moroz] Do you have any property left in Georgia? [Gamsakhurdia] We had a house there. It was the house of Gamsakhurdia's father; we lived there. On 6 January 1992 Ioseliani, Kitovani, and their confederates plundered it, and then two months later burned it down. So there are only charred walls left now... And in the summer they even defiled the grave of Zviad's mother and father. [Moroz] How are you going to live from now on? Or do you not think about it right now? [Gamsakhurdia] I keep thinking about it. How am I to live now? I have no money. Absolutely. I have no home. My children are deprived of their motherland. They have nothing. All the clothes we have on, the Chechens bought for us. We came here with nothing. I was wearing a housecoat...[end Gamsakhurdia] When I was preparing for my trip to Groznyy, I was asked to take with me some money collected by Georgian businessmen living in Moscow for the Gamsakhurdia family. Many people made pledges. When I left, however, all I had in my pocket was my per diem allowance. Businessmen's love is as short-lived as popular love (this again refers to the 87 percent of vote cast for Gamsakhurdia at the presidential elections). [Moroz] Are you planning to return to Georgia? [Gamsakhurdia] As long as the junta is there--no. As long as Shevardnadze is there, I will not return.[end Gamsakhurdia] Fifteen-year-old Georgiy mentioned in his conversation with me: "Father is buried in a village... I cannot tell you which village it is."--"Is it not the village reported in the press?" I inquired, puzzled. "No, a different one." For several weeks now a tug of war has been going on between Zviad Gamsakhurdia's family and the authorities. The authorities insist on conducting a full-scale formal investigation of the circumstances of the former president's death, with the forensic expert evaluation required in such cases, autopsy, etc. Gamsakhurdia's widow is categorically against it. She consents only to visual identification of the body, after which it is to be sent to Groznyy. The authorities' logic: A man died under mysterious circumstances; the law requires that the cause of his death be ascertained. But there is also another logic: Zviad Gamsakhurdia died on territory where military operations were in progress; in essence he died like a soldier, and is there such a law that requires surrendering the body of a slain soldier to his enemies? There is no such law. There is, however, a rule dictated by the norms of humanism--to hand over to relatives the body of a dead person so that they may dispose of it at their discretion. This humanistic norm is what Manana Gamsakhurdia is appealing to. So far, in vain. The Georgia authorities for some reason staunchly refuse to meet the request of a woman devastated by grief; the report that official delegations shuttle from Tbilisi to Groznyy for negotiations while she is being difficult turn out upon closer look to be ordinary disinformation (I was a witness to this myself: On Friday "Ostankino" reported that a delegation from Tbilisi, consisting of representatives of the authorities and the procuracy, was on its way to Groznyy; what arrived, however, was a group of Tbilisi intellectuals, to express condolences to Gamsakhurdia's widow--that is all, I myself was present at that meeting). On 16 January, Manana Gamsakhurdia sent a telegram to Russian president Boris Yeltsin, to both chambers of the Russian parliament, the heads of other CIS states, as well as to the United Nations and the CSCE. She asks them to interfere, to influence the Tbilisi authorities, to help her to finally get the body of her husband so she can say a last "goodbye" to him and bury him in a Christian manner. Can it happen that this plea, too, will have no effect?
