He said that Moscow welcomed the understanding on holding the first summit of North an South Korea. Beliy noted that this idea was not new but until now it had never gone beyond the coordination stage. He thought that if all barriers were overcome this time, a new page might begin in the relations between the two Koreas. Beliy added that Russia still thought an international conference on the Korean peninsula had to be held. He explained that since the beginning of 1994 three crises had been about to break out in the peninsula. When it attenuated somewhat, it used to be followed by a stronger one, he said. For this reason, Beliy believed, a multilateral conference might work where bilateral talks failed. He did not think that the American-North Korean dialog would not necessarily be a success because the problems were too complicated to be solved quickly. This was the reason why Russia would press for an international conference.
