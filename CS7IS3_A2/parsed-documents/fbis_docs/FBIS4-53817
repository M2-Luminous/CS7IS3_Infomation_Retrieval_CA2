Speaking at a news conference with his South Korean counterpart, Han Sung-chu, Minister Ali Alatas said Indonesia, as a neighboring nation and in its capacity as the leader of the Nonaligned Movement, can only make an effort to hold a dialogue with the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, North and South Korea, and other parties such as the United States, Japan, and China. Indonesia hopes that through such dialogue the Korean peninsula's crisis can be fully settled without aggression. Meanwhile, the South Korean foreign minister also hoped that the conflict, which has become a concern in the international community, can be fully solved.
