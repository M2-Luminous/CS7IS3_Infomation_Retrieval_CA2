At a news conference Rugova described the agreement as the first step toward containing the situation and a peaceful resolution of the conflict, at the same time warning that developments will be more difficult on the ground [than in the negotiations] due to war wounds. According to him the question is whether similar things will happen in other parts of the former Yugoslavia, since, as he said, it [former Yugoslavia] should first be reorganized according to ethnic and political criteria. Rugova said different and new ways of [implementing] the agreement could not be ruled out. He voiced his party's position whereby first of all each one [each nation] should be a master in its own home, and then economic and other associations will be possible. The DSK president expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the discussion on Kosovo in the Belgian Parliament, in particular with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes's speech, in which, according to Rugova, he had said that Kosovo Albanians were now no longer satisfied with the Yugoslav Constitution of 1974 [that gave them the status of an autonomous province within Serbia]. The DSK leader interpreted this as a sign of support for the [ethnic] Albanian demand for an independent and neutral Kosovo. Rugova welcomed recent demonstrations of Albanians in European cities and confirmed that the organizers were the DSK and other Albanian associations.
