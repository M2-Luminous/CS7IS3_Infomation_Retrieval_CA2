It was created on March 13, 1989, one month after the withdrawal of our forces from Afghanistan. Today the AVU is a very large organization that brings together not only Afghan war veterans but also veterans of other local conflicts. The union operates in all the ex-Soviet republics (unofficially in Estonia). It has more than 1,200 primary organizations and 287 regional and 15 republic divisions with a total of 350,000 members. The AVU engages in extensive charity work to provide assistance to disabled Afghan veterans and to the families of fallen comrades. It has currently spent more than $500,000 to buy wheelchairs abroad. Two years ago the union began providing financial assistance to the families of fallen comrades in amounts of 100,000 to 300,000 rubles. Almost 3,000 production and commercial enterprises currently operate under the union's aegis. To mark its fifth anniversary the AVU has organized a new charity operation for which it has allocated more than two billion rubles.
