Large-scale farming is needed to cut the cost of rice production in Japan, said the officials at the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Ministry [MAFF]. Later this month the government is expected to compile the extra budget for the year ending next March 31 as part of its economic stimulus package. The extra money is needed to deal with the government's decision in December to partially open Japan's rice market, the officials said. The government made the decision when it accepted a proposal of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at the GATT-sponsored Uruguay Round of global trade talks. Under the proposal, Japan will be exempted from tariffication of rice imports for a grace period of six years, in return for which it will import 400,000 to 800,000 tons of rice a year as "minimum access" to imports. The ministry is seeking to expand the scale of rice farming by increasing the minimum size of a paddy field to one hectare from the present 30 acres, the officials said. Mechanization will also be promoted on rice farms through government-subsidized loans.
