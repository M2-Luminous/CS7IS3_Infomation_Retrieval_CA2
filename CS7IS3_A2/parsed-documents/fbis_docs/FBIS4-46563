Barykin; place and date of interview not given: "It's Painful To See How They're Selling the Motherland'"] [Text] Could I ever have imagined five or so years ago that I would be able to interview the counterintelligence chief so easily? All the more so because he has no patience with the mass media which, in his opinion, are responsible in many ways for some of the things that are happening in the country now? But V. N. Bobrov, colonel of state security, chief of the Department of Military Counterintelligence of the RF Federal Counterintelligence Service for the 8th Guards Army Corps, does have respect for our firm--VOLGOGRADSKAYA PRAVDA. Because in his words it continues to express the views of many, including the unfortunate, layers of, and it tries to speak the truth, no matter how bitter it may be. At the appointed hour I drove up to the famous "house with antennas" on Chekisty Square. Vladimir Nikolayevich received me in his modestly furnished office. The furnishings were limited to a huge map of Europe covering an entire wall showing the locations of the intelligence centers of the NATO bloc, portraits of F. E. Dzerzhinskiy and Yu. V. Andropov (despite the changes, the occupant of this office remains faithful once and forever to assimilated principles), and a pile of telephones on a little table, ready for instantaneous communication with the most remote points in the country and with the chief of the RF Federal Counterintelligence Service. No matter how I tried to steer it in the needed channel, our conversation, which went on for over an hour, wouldn't stay within its banks. Viktor Nikolayevich guided the interview away from slippery issues with a smile. Anyway, I soon became used to these "secrets of the Madrid court," and accepted the rules of the game. My first question touched upon a topic that was most painful to my partner in conversation: [Barykin] Would I be right in saying that these are the worst times for counterintelligence, now that the economy has been devastated and the army is disintegrating, now that there are huge holes in the borders, and now that people are trying to toss 70 years of history into the trash can? [Bobrov] "That's putting it mildly," my partner in conversation bitterly asserted. "Many military secrets have been sold for 30 pieces of silver (seven and a half dollars, if we convert this at today's rate), footholds have been lost in Europe, Africa, Latin America and the Near East, and our troops are scurrying out of Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Giving away state secrets has become so commonplace. Things can't get any worse," my partner in conversation sighed. "But no matter how they've tried to bring my department down," he continued, "it has managed to keep its secrets. There were enough clear minds around here that we managed to encrypt the archives and information on our agents long before the August coup. For example the BND (West German intelligence) is still trying to figure out the GDR's undercover operation. I can tell you that their efforts are useless." [Barykin] What are the strategy and tactics of counterintelligence today? [Bobrov] "Having managed to preserve its operation, our department is doing what it is supposed to be doing--protecting state and military secrets, providing counterintelligence support to the Armed Forces, determining their combat capability, and fighting terrorists and saboteurs, organized crime and the drug trade (unfortunately it has made its way into the army as well)." [Barykin] To the extent possible, can you offer any details about the activity of your department? [Bobrov] "Now that servicemen are being withdrawn hastily from the Western and Northwestern groups of forces, foreign intelligence is openly recruiting our soldiers and officers. We are trying to stop this work. Recall the notorious `Gorchakov case.' The ex-civil aviation pilot was recruited by the BND, he stayed behind in the FRG, and there he organized a local ring, trapping in his nets those whose eyes caught fire from the sight of dollars and Deutsche marks. Our fellow-countryman from Volgograd managed to fall in with them. Gorchakov tasked him to collect secret information from a certain unit in the Western Group of Forces. The sorry spy was caught red-handed and was shuttled over to Moscow, where he faced a military court. My associates and I had the occasion to question him in Lefortovo. "Unfortunately such recruitment of our soldiers and officers by Western special services is continuing, and it is proceeding more intensively. Not only our potential enemies--the special services of the USA, France and Germany--but even our former friends are showing keen interest in the new huge force grouping building up in the Northern Caucasus. Intelligence services of Ukraine, Moldova and the Baltic and Transcaucasian states are pricking up their ears, even though we had reached agreement with them not to engage in such activity. They are all interested in learning the scale of deployment of the new force grouping, its mobilization plans, its armament, combat readiness, and the morale of our soldiers. Our `friends' are also interested in the latest developments of our defense research institutes and plants. This is why military delegations from the NATO countries have started visiting Volgograd so much more frequently. All military attaches that visit us are in fact career scouts, and they have but one purpose--gathering secret information, and filling in the details that their associates in espionage failed to root out. "They come here like it's their home, behave impertinently, and capitalize on the possibilities offered by the conventional arms limitation treaty for their own ends. We naturally keep our eyes on all of them. Our operational possibilities allow us to do so. When it becomes necessary, we toss them some `bait,' lead them on a false trail, and establish who their contacts are. "As long as you've asked for the details," V. N. Bobrov said, "our department's sphere of activity includes the lower reaches of the Volga, and naturally, Kapustin Yar, which is also within the zone of interest of `friendly' special services. That's how far things have gone! A military attache is, after all, a military scout, he can fly into our city incognito, without any kind of permission, settle down with some family, and go about getting answers to questions he's interested in. "We also monitor the activities of foreign specialists employed in construction of military posts. There are no restrictions, you see, on their movements about the territory of another state. That's how it came about that we detained Turks, even in Kapustin Yar, under the guise of vocational-technical school students, with forged diplomas and passports. What were they doing in Kapustin Yar? "Korean specialists carry dollars from English banks in their suitcases in circumvention of tax laws." [Barykin] "One of the tasks assigned to military counterintelligence, as you yourself have said, is to fight organized crime in the army. Has all of this really assumed such a scale?" was may next question to Bobrov. [Bobrov] "Unfortunately, all of the negative processes that have affected the society are affecting those who work behind the high fences of the military. The army is disintegrating, discipline and the morale of servicemen are falling, and as a result, incidents occur--`dedovshchina' going as far as murder, shady bank transactions, and major misappropriations of weapons and explosives from military storage dumps. "Recently we fended off an attack on a certain military depot near Kotluban by persons of Dagestani nationality. They planned to kill the sentries and take large lots of weapons out of the oblast. To the honor of our division, in the 4 year's that I've been in Volgograd only one assault rifle has gone missing. We squelched an attempt to obtain several million rubles from a bank on the basis of a forged letter of advice." [Barykin] As I understand from this conversation, military counterintelligence has its "eyes and ears" everywhere. By that I mean undercover agents. [Bobrov] "As they say in cases such as this, we don't get paid to do nothing: Where necessary, we use special equipment and undercover assistance. These people are patriots who offer to help for something other than the sake of money. We simply can't offer them any incentives at market prices. All intelligence services of the world have their informants, and for some reason it's only in our country that the impression certain strata of the population sometimes hold of them is not as it should be. These people are a priceless treasure to us, and they help us a very great deal. Who do you think wrote the Old Testament? A scout! This was his first message to the Divine Center. Covert operatives--angels--helped him to gather the data. And the first counterespionage agent did everything he could to keep the message from the Center's scout from falling into the wrong hands." During our interview the telephone rang incessantly, and Viktor Nikolayevich's short answers--"I'm busy"--once again emphasized that this department has respect for our newspaper and its representatives. Nonetheless, in order not to abuse the counterintelligence agent's time, I cut short my list of questions. [Barykin] "Viktor Nikolayevich," I urged my partner in conversation to be open, "tell me honestly, are you sorry that you went into counterintelligence?" [Bobrov] "So far, no," the occupant of the office smiled. "Still, all of these years--and I've worked in this department for almost a quarter of a century--I've been unable to calmly accept those who are selling the country and its secrets. It's painful to see, believe me, and painful to hear that the KGB, and now the FSK, is looked at as some kind of monster. It angers me to hear that. The country was strong in its secrets, which our people have watched over at the cost of their lives. They were the first to fall under the knife of the purges of 1932, and NKVD divisions defended Stalingrad down to the last warrior. And it's not the fault of the rank and file of the KGB that it was headed by scum like Beria. There are many people like that in the MVD, and if you're looking for a true monster, consider what the MVD has transformed into. "I started my military career in the missile forces," the counterspy continued his narration when I asked him for a sketch of his biography. "I graduated from the appropriate schools. No, not the kind you're thinking of--missile schools. The KGB school and academy came some time later. Once I was summoned by KGB chief Kryuchkov: You're going to Afghanistan for a week, he told me. But as it turned out, I stayed half a year there. I worked on a special assignment in this country from the first day of commitment of our troops. After Afghanistan I worked wherever they sent me. In 1990 I moved with my family to Volgograd." Three years ago Viktor Nikolayevich became a grandfather. His daughter works in the tax inspectorate, his son-in-law is a military pilot, and his wife is a well known radio journalist. "No matter how difficult it may be for the motherland today, I believe that some sort of stability will nonetheless set in," the counterintelligence chief concluded the interview. "And I'll be happy if our department could make the contribution within its means to this effort. And one other thing. Please extend my deep regards to all war veterans in this holiday period. For saving the world from the abhorrent yoke of fascism. And this rain that is now falling outside this window is the tears of soldiers' widows that had not be fully shed during the war." What V. N. Bobrov said in parting is still fresh in my memory: "The English have a saying: My country, right or wrong. That is, our problems are for us to solve, and we don't need any `friends'."
