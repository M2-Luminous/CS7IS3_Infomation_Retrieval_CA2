On 4 November, Niihama city decided to remove the plant stoppage order; Sumitomo Chemical, which received that order, is expected to restart operations in a day or two and to switch to a shipping system in December over a trial operating period of about one month. As a result, the prospect for shipping restart from the end of this year to the beginning of next year is premature. Since Sumitomo Chemical's orthocresolnovolak epoxy fire, voices wishing for the early restarting of the semiconductor sealing material market have strengthened. While operations to restart the plant are advancing smoothly and the turmoil in the market during this period was avoided because of shipping support from another company in the same industry, the restart time of this plant was noted. Because of the stoppage canceling order of the local Niihama city, the operation of novolak facilities was restarted. This month it is expected to switch to trial operations to receive sample shipping and user evaluation and to make full scale shipping at the beginning of December.
