The incident in the coastal town of Juniyah came 10 days after a bomb attack on Our Lady of Deliverance Church in northern Beirut killed nine people and wounded 55 in the nearby Christian community of Zuk Mikha'il. Pope John Paul II pays his first visit to Lebanon in May and some political leaders have already voiced concern over his safety. The six-kilogram (13-pound) bomb was concealed in a gift-wrapped package placed outside the French cultural center in the Ghadir area of Juniyah, 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Beirut. It was found by Chantal Mansur, a teacher at the center, who alerted the army, the French embassy charge d'affaires Bernard Letourneau told AFP. The army said an unidentified group had recently protested over a decision to move the French cultural center to another location. It did not elaborate. But Letourneau denied any plans to close down the center, which served as a consulate during the early days of Lebanon's 15-year civil war. He said the building was owned by the Maronite Catholic Sisters of the Holy Family, and they were renegotiating the lease which expires in 1995. "I don't know who the target was, the sisters or us. But it seems that this is the latest in a series of unfortunate attacks," he said referring to the February 27 church bombing. Letourneau added he had instructed the directors of all French cultural centers and schools in Lebanon "to be vigilant." An AFP photographer said army troops were stationed outside the center after the incident. Secretary General of the right-wing Phalange Party Karim Paqraduni -- which was devastated by a car-bomb in December which killed three and wounded 100 -- said he expected more attacks. "Thanks to God today's attack was aborted. But I expect more bombings. They are part of a cycle which is aimed at the destabilisation of peace in Lebanon," Paqraduni told AFP. "Christians feel they are the victims of such terrorist acts and these attacks will continue as long as the assailants go unpunished," he added. The investigations into the church bombing and into the attack at the Phalange headquarters have made no headway. Paqraduni said a series of steps by the government to strengthen the country's security apparatus, including plans to bring back capital punishment, "are all good things as long as they don't remain ink on paper." Security measures have been stepped up in churches, mosques and schools in Lebanon.
