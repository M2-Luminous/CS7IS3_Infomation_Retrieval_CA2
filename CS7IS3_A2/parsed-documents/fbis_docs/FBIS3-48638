Testifying before the U.S. Senate Information Committee meeting on 25 January, CIA Director Woolsey said that the United States has sent and begun operations for a U.S. national intelligence support team on the Korean peninsula. The NEW YORK TIMES then reported that the United States will deploy Patriot missiles, commonly known as the "missile-killing missile," for the U.S. Forces in the ROK. These moves are surfacing at a time when the U.S. Congress, which began its new session on 25 January, deliberates over a new U.S. defense policy toward the ROK, including further withdrawal of U.S. ground forces. These moves particularly draw our attention because they show that the U.S. defense policy is taking into account North Korea's nuclear issue which is expected to be resolved sometime early this year. In accordance with the so-called "Bottom-up" plan of comprehensively reviewing post Cold-War U.S. defense policy, the U.S. Forces in the ROK submitted a report to the Department of Defense in November last year meticulously analyzing their defense capabilities, problems, and complementary measures. In the report, the U.S. Forces in the ROK noted a problem in the combat deployment of reinforcements from the U.S. mainland in the event of war on the Korean peninsula, and stressed a need for supplementary measures to cut off the enemy's spearhead of attack. Therefore, the strengthening of intelligence capabilities of the U.S. Forces in the ROK and the request for the deployment of Patriot missiles must have some bearing on this operational review. In particular, in the event of punitive military action against the North with North Korea's continued rejection of nuclear inspections, the Patriot missiles will be a unique military countermeasure to North Korea's Nodong-1 and Nodong-2 missiles. Even if the United States does not wage a direct military attack on North Korea, the presence of Patriot missiles can serve as a strong message on U.S. resolve to settle the North Korean nuclear issue. However, whether the deployment of the Patriot missiles can effect the success the United States desires is doubtful. The Patriot missiles were deployed for an actual war in 1984. Since they were first put to use in an actual war during the Gulf war, much has been said about their efficiency. While some evaluated the Patriot missile positively as a "ghost-catching missile," many people have pointed out that the Patriot missile's target-hitting accuracy is only about ten percent and that there are many problems in removing shell fragments. Whether the deployment of the Patriot missiles is suitable for the Korean peninsula's ground configuration should be reviewed. Some military experts hold that due to the lack of battlefield depth with Seoul less than 40 km away from the Armistice Line, the efficiency of the Patriot missile's air interception rate will not reach that of the Gulf war. U.S. intentions on enforcing the deployment of Patriot missiles in the ROK is somewhat doubtful as the deployment of Patriot missiles can aggravate tension between North and South Korea at a time when U.S.-North Korea nuclear negotiations are nearing conclusion and nuclear negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea are in progress. Furthermore, some point out that the deployment of Patriot missiles may be part of a "sophisticated sale strategy" of the Clinton administration aimed at handing over the Patriot missiles to the ROK Army following their deployment in the ROK by U.S. Forces. This claim by military experts is not entirely groundless when considering the Patriot missile system's price of $150 billion (120 billion won) and their narrow foreign market. Apparently, the inauguration of a U.S. national intelligence support team in the ROK derives from the U.S. policy to augment the intelligence-gathering capacity of U.S. Forces in the ROK as well as from their assessment that North Korea's nuclear issue is more serious than previously thought. In a testimony to Congress, Director Woolsey said that North Korea possesses enough plutonium to produce at least one nuclear bomb and that it has acquired the technology to load nuclear bombs on MiG-23 planes. This warrants the collection and analysis of more accurate and precise intelligence on the suspicion of North Korea's nuclear development. In particular, the importance of appraising and analyzing intelligence on the Korean peninsula is more actually felt when considering the fact that U.S. aerial photographs provided the intelligence on North Korea's two unreported nuclear facilities which caused North Korea to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
