Ukraine's Foreign Minister Zlenko declared this in an interview for Ukrainian journalists after the Council had ended its sitting in Istanbul. Zlenko believes that such gatherings facilitate an immediate and open dialogue with partners, offering the chance to explain a position more clearly, while at the same time allowing the state to win supporters on an array of urgent issues. Zlenko emphasized that this year's conference of heads of foreign political departments from 38 countries was, to a certain extent, a success with regard to greater understanding of existing problems and defining approaches to solutions. Zlenko expressed satisfaction with the fact that the statement adopted at the sitting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, which assesses the situation around Crimea, notes that the Crimean issue should be solved in compliance with the UN Charter and the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and with respect to Ukraine's territorial integrity.
