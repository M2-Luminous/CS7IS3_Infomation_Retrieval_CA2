Bossert and Lopez were sworn in yesterday by interim chief justice Julio Nazareno during a seven-minute ceremony carried out at noon in Central Courthouse. The ceremony was not attended by Justice Minister Jorge Maiorano, who allegedly has serious internal differences with a number of justices. Despite the fact that it was officially reported that the minister did not attend the ceremony "due to previous engagements," court sources said that Justices Enrique Petracchi and Augusto Delluscio had allegedly announced that they would not go if they saw Maiorano there. Maiorano later confirmed that he had not turned up the Central Courthouse to see Bossert and Lopez become new justices because he had been warned about Belluscio and Petracchi's decision. The new justices replace Rodolfo Barra and Mariano Cavagna Martinez, who are both to the Constituent Assembly. [passage omitted]
