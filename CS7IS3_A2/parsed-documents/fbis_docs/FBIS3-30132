Some officials just laugh off the arguments because in actuality, there is absolutely no possibility of Japan's altering its "three nonnuclear principles." However, a senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said: "So far, relations [between Japan and the United States] in the security arena have been stable. But if they become unstable, bilateral economic issues will also become complicated." It is feared that the nuclear arguments might become a factor to further intensify trade frictions between the two countries. A MITI source, who recently was asked in an unofficial meeting about the possibility of Japan's arming itself with a nuclear arsenal, pointed out, "It will be no surprise to the United States and European nations to see Japan, an economic and technological superpower, beginning to develop nuclear weapons." Since the cold war era, the United States and European nations have dangerously confronted each other backed by their nuclear deterrents. It seems that they never understand the special feeling, or antipathy, that the Japanese have toward nuclear weapons as the people of a nation that suffered an atomic attack. One of the reasons that the nuclear arguments have surfaced is the foreign countries' lack of understanding and their distrust of Japan's nuclear energy policy, which permits the nation to bring in plutonium from France and store it. The aforementioned MITI source said he was asked "why Japan has to store plutonium when it has no intention of developing nuclear weapons." In addition, the fact that Japan initially did not give its full support to an indefinite extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) has spurred the arguments. The NPT, which expires in 1995, allows only the current nuclear powers to possess nuclear weapons. Because of this, some Japanese Government officials and Liberal Democratic Party members asked, "Is it right for Japan to abandon a nuclear option while the DPRK is suspected of developing nuclear weapons?" The Foreign Ministry persuaded those who opposed the NPT's indefinite extension to agree to a plan to announce Japan's support for the indefinite extension at the G-7 summit meeting (Tokyo summit) last July. The ministry, however, failed to change Japan's conventional and vague stand on the NPT. Although the present coalition government decided to "support" the indefinite extension after it was inaugurated, this fact seems not to be fully known to foreign countries. Also, a successful launch of the H-2 rocket has deepened foreign suspicions because the rocket can be converted into a missile. Besides such developments, it has long been rumored in the United States and the ROK that Japan might equip itself with nuclear arms because of the DPRK's suspected nuclear program. Washington officially takes the stand that "Japan will not turn to developing nuclear weapons." However, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry recently stated that Japan and the ROK might begin to develop nuclear arms once the DPRK succeeded in its nuclear development. The problem is that such arguments have surfaced at a time when the Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks have broken down. The Clinton administration, which is irritated by the chronic trade deficit with Japan, is calling on Tokyo to accept its "numerical target" proposal. The administration's distrust of Japan has deepened. So far, bilateral relations in the security arena have remained stable, but the aforementioned senior MITI official noted, "Japan should express its intention to not develop nuclear weapons not only in words but also in deeds."
