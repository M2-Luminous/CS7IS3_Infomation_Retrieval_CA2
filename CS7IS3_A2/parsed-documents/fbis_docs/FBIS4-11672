Masses of our militant Palestinian people, sons of our people in the diaspora, sons of our Arab and Islamic nation, and free men of the world, 30 March 1994 is the 18th anniversary of Land Day. Our heroic Palestinian people are facing the ugliest conspiracy to liquidate their national cause through the Oslo and Cairo agreements in which 'Arafat gave in to all the Zionist-U.S. dictates and conditions, relinquished the Palestinian people's historical and national rights, and canceled all their sacrifices over 70 years. The Land Day anniversary this year falls on the 40th day of the massacre in the Ibrahimi mosque in steadfast Hebron. This massacre highlighted the reality and essence of the Zionist-'Arafatist peace when scores of glorious martyrs fell, and hundreds were wounded. The fascist Zionist army followed this with other massacres in the same city and the other occupied territories in response to the wave of popular wrath that unfolded throughout the occupied territories and which resulted in more heroes, martyrs, and wounded. This anniversary this year also coincides with the uprising of our militant masses in the 1948 occupied territories. This confirms the unity of our people, the unity of their land and fate, and their endless readiness for struggle to foil all the Zionist schemes to liquidate their national cause. Masses of our people, and sons of the land: This land has been yours since time immemorial. The signature of a defeatist traitor will not constitute an edict that changes the name of the owner of the land. The land is yours, and yours is the sea, the river, the valley, and the mountain. Yours are the oranges, grapes, figs, and olives. O Hebron, the deep wound of Palestine, the mother of martyrs, we shed tears on your doorstep but we will not give in. The pledge remains as it. O Hebron, you remain in the lap of Palestine and in the heart of the nation. The series of massacres the occupation army has carried out and is perpetrating under direct orders from Rabin -- 'Arafat's partner in the Washington, Oslo, Taba, Cairo agreement -- have stepped up the Palestinian popular call for the resignation of 'Arafat and his deviationist clique, for halting the farce of negotiations, and for toppling the U.S.-Zionist settlement course. The massacres have also led to the stepping up of calls for the withdrawal of the negotiating delegation, for the dismantling of the settlements, for international protection for the sons of our people throughout the entire occupied territories, for their right to determine their fate on their national soil, and for toppling the deviationist clique and its main emblem, which have placed our people and cause in this dilemma. The recent agreement with the Zionist enemy has constituted a cover for the Hebron massacre and what took place before it. All this confirms the unequivocal fact that coexistence with this enemy is impossible and that the struggle against it will continue. O people of Palestine inside and in the diaspora, o people of steadfast and mujahid Hebron: The popular situation caused by the massacre, and the militant momentum the heroic intifadah is witnessing -- in spite of the comprehensive siege and systematic acts of mass killing at the hands of Rabin's army gangs, 'Arafat's partner -- force the Palestinian and Arab nationalist and Islamic forces to understand the features of this stage and to work to develop struggle and jihad to higher and more effective standards on the ground. They must close ranks and adopt militant programs inside and outside the occupied territories in order to pull the rug out from under the feet of the capitulative leadership, to confront the onslaught, to restore respect to struggle and jihad, to put to use the furious popular sentiment, and to work to topple 'Arafat and his deviationist and relinquishing clique on the path of continued struggle and jihad in order to realize all objectives of the Palestinian people to attain full liberation and independence. Our observation of Land Day and the 40th day since the martyrdom at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque reemphasizes our adherence to the unity of the people, the unity of land, and the unity of blood that we will not relinquish no matter what the pressures, difficulties, and obstacles might be. We pledge to the souls of the martyrs -- the martyrs of Land Day in the Galilee, and the martyrs of the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron -- to remain faithful to their pure blood. We in the APF [Alliance of Palestinian Forces] emphasize that there will be no peace in the region without the collapse of the sin represented in the presence of Israel in the heart of our Arab and Islamic nation. We promise our people that we will carry out serious and unionist actions, burn the occupied land under the occupiers' feet, and topple the symbols of relinquishment, capitulation, and treason. On these two anniversaries, we ask our people to carry out the following activities: 1. In the occupied territories: To escalate the intifadah and emphasize the unity of land and people. 2. In the diaspora: To observe a general and full strike on Wednesday morning 30 March 1994 in all camps and Palestinian residential areas in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. To stage a sit-in in front of the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the diaspora countries on the morning of 5 April. We also call on the masses of our people to participate in the popular rally the APF will sponsor at al-Nujum Cinema in al-Yarmuk Camp, southern Damascus, at 1800 on Tuesday 5 April 1994, and to take part in all rallies that will be held in Amman, Beirut, Aleppo, Hims, and all Palestinian camps. O relatives of noble martyrs: Your martyrs are in heaven and will be a mercy for you and the nation. They will remain in the hearts. Hail to the souls of the our martyrs in Hebron, the Galilee, and Gaza, and all martyrs of Palestine and nation. Hail to all sons of our people in the homeland and abroad. Shame and disgrace to the fascist Zionists, shame and disgrace to 'Arafat and his deviationist clique, glory to the martyrs, victory to the fighting masses. [Signed] The Alliance of Palestinian Forces
