Following the "basic decisions" made in recent weeks, his position as chairman had strengthened, he said. This would also manifest itself in the Federal Convention and the presidential election in Berlin on 23 May. The FDP wanted leadership and would get it. Kinkel called the FDP Presidium and Federal Executive Board recommendation to the party congress, which will be held in Rostock early in June, to continue the Bonn coalition with the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] following the Bundestag elections in October, a "caesura." He said the North Rhine-Westphalian land party congress in Dortmund two weeks ago had also been a decisive event. At that congress, land chairman Moellemann was reelected with a relatively weak result, whereas Kinkel was feted ostentatiously. Kinkel said he was pleased with the economic recovery and the change of mood resulting from it. "I am happy to see that after a difficult starting period, things are improving for me, too; I feel that the party accepts me." Support for Hamm-Bruecher Kinkel vehemently contradicted statements that he and group chairman Hermann Otto Solms intended to bring their influence to bear on the FDP group in the Federal Convention to vote for CDU/CSU candidate Roman Herzog on the first ballot. He called such claims "nonsense." After each ballot of the Federal Convention, the FDP would carefully consider the course of events and draw its conclusions: "We will see what the situation is in the course of the process, and have a right to know what our partners have." Kinkel said he would hold many preparatory talks and would then submit his proposal in Berlin. He said the FDP supported its candidate, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, but he did not say whether this also held true for the third ballot, in which a relative majority is sufficient for the election of the federal president. Kinkel said Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher said in the Presidium on 1 May that she would "do what the party wants." Kinkel added that "quiet is required now." Therefore, he rejected any speculation. In Berlin, he would "say clearly what the direction should be -- without, however, overrunning the FDP." As he did with his coalition statement, he would also "make the final decision" following exploratory talks. He said he had invited the FDP land chairmen for 21 May. Kinkel indicated, however, that he would not leave the decision to a meeting of the land chairmen with Moellemann. "There is no imperative mandate, but the party leadership accepts that -- based on the preparatory talks -- I submit my proposal to the party group of the Federal Convention." Kinkel said he would bring up the FDP's wish that the protection of minorities should be anchored in the constitution as a separate article "in coalition talks," even though the CDU/CSU has so far rejected it. In addition, the FDP would discuss in coalition talks the "overall context" of dual citizenship and a law on the limitation of immigration. However, the FDP would not bring in the Bundesrat draft, which was rejected last week, as its own motion without the consent of its coalition partner, as some presidium members had demanded on 2 May. "We cannot force anything." Kinkel said: "We will not announce anything that cannot be implemented." He said the FDP did not make the continuation of the coalition "conditional on certain terms and does not build hurdles that may be insurmountable." Therefore, the FDP did not insist that its demands be accepted in the coalition prior to the Bundestag elections. However, the FDP would point out problems in the election campaign "whose solution the CDU/CSU has prevented." Kinkel said the FDP would fight to resume its goals in the new coalition: "we have the right to become a bit more critical, without endangering the coalition." The Rostock party congress should "not be a party congress of internal security," said Kinkel. The FDP did not dodge the issues of internal security. "However, I do not like it at all that the impression is being created that crime could be combated by laws." According to Kinkel, the Federal Government is only responsible for the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation and border protection, whereas the laender are responsible for combating crime. Therefore, one should address minister-presidents like Rudolf Scharping and Erwin Teufel and stop the "impudent hide-and-seek game" in which the buck is passed to Bonn. "Decision in the End Stretch" Kinkel said: "I am now increasingly enjoying the combination of the offices of foreign minister and party chairman; I am looking forward to the election campaign." He said that as a long-distance runner, he had learned that "a race is not decided in a curve or in the middle of the stretch, but in the end stretch." Kinkel claimed that his "stayer qualities and his optimism" were apparently successful. At its closed meeting, the FDP Presidium adopted "14 arguments for a strong FDP" to give the direction for the election campaign. The main points are the following: Austerity and consolidation course to reduce the state quota to the level prior to reunification by the end of this decade; privatization and deregulation; more flexible work hours and flexibility in connection with company pay settlements and more favorable conditions for people setting up new medium-sized businesses. There will be no inheritance and property tax increases, as the SPD is planning to introduce, nor will there be higher burdens for "higher income groups" in the form of a surcharge. The FDP seeks to lower all income tax rates and to abolish the trade tax. The FDP intends to counteract "slogans demanding special surcharges for high income earners." The FDP describes itself as the "party of the service sector, property, and technical innovation." "We are suffocating from our social system." With the introduction of a "citizens money system" [Buergergeldsystem], a certain simplification is to be brought about.
