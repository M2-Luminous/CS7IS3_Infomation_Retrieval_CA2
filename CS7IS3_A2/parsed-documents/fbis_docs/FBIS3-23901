According to Aleksandr Kuznetsov, head of the FCS administration's antiterrorist unit, the arrested persons, some of whom had participated in the defense of the White House in Moscow in October 1993, were making preparations for an armed attack on one of the Petersburg militia precincts to seize armaments. Afterwards, they intended to assassinate Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak, and to organize a raid on the House of Government in Moscow. Among those detained is Aleksandr Bogdanov of Petersburg rallies fame. The investigation continues. There are more than 30 organized criminal groups currently operating in the city on the Neva River who use the entire spectrum of intimidation methods: blackmail, threats, violence. The city is being divided into spheres of influence; there have been recorded attempts on the part of the criminal capital to acquire blocks of stock of a number of commercial banks and objects undergoing privatization. Administration personnel have identified and foiled activities of five criminal groups attempting to steal about 4 billion rubles [R] from city banks using forged documents. They also foiled the illegal sale of almost 5,000 units of firearms, and derailed the sale to a commercial structure of 5,000 smooth-bore rifles and 200 handguns. As was noted at the briefing, more than 1.5 million units of unregistered rifled firearms are currently in the hands of the Russian population. Also, while in the past such firearms had been mostly home-made, now the situation has changed--they are mainly factory-made arms, Western-made as a rule. The "leader" is the TT handgun made in China. Eighty-five bombs went off in the city in 1993, killing eight persons and injuring 29. "I will not be surprised if, having finished dividing property between criminal groups, the same groups start dividing political power," Aleksandr Kuznetsov said at the briefing. Another problem for law enforcement organs is smuggling. Last year as a result of Operation Trawl, the guardians of security returned to the state more than 2,500 tonnes of nonferrous metals, 6,000 tonnes of petroleum products, about 22,000 cubic meters of timber, and other goods worth a total of R5 billion. Unfortunately, this work is not effective enough because of the poor material and technical support of customs and border services on the border with Estonia. There is a widespread practice of bribing customs officials. Criminals use all sorts of transportation, including military transport aircraft. Contraband cargo is escorted by armed guards, who frequently consist of military servicemen and militia personnel, who more than once resisted representatives of authority and law enforcement organs. In conclusion the head of the FCS administration, Viktor Cherkesov, reported that recertification of personnel is expected to be completed before the end of March. Because the investigative department in the service has been abolished, the administration is switching to a new staff structure, while criminal cases currently under investigation have been transferred to the Procuracy. "There is no question that after the Ministry of Security was abolished, the ranks of the Petersburg administration got thinner. But our agency is not going to turn into a relic--we will continue working," said Viktor Cherkesov.
