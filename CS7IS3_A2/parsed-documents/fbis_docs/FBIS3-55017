[Slezevicius] I think that the statement made by the president yesterday on TV has an exceptional significance and meaning. Last year was important to Lithuania in all respects. We became a member of the European Council on 14 May and an intensive process of integration began into various economic structures of Europe, including defense structures. This is a long process. In June a decision was adopted in principle by the Council of Europe concerning the possibility of us concluding a free trade agreement with the European Union, as it is now called after the Maastricht Treaty. Therefore, yesterday's statement is a logical sequence of all the decisions and actions which have taken place previously. Our joint and coordinated position with our Baltic neighbors, Latvia and Estonia, has been voiced several times. This was done at the meeting of the presidents in Riga and Tallinn, at the meeting of the prime ministers, and in our declaration signed jointly by our minister of national defense and his counterparts on 13 September in Tallinn concerning our orientation towards NATO defense structures. This act [request to join NATO] is a logical sequence of our entire foreign policy. This is especially important at the present moment when we are the first former Soviet republic free of occupying armed forces. This is of great importance. We are now starting a cooperation with the above mentioned European structures on a different level. [Correspondent] Do you think we will join NATO soon? [Slezevicius] Indeed some politicians urged us to rush into NATO immediately. They believe that this is a very simple process. I think that we should not be too optimistic about this matter. This is a process, including, as it seems, one of the stages -- Partnership for Peace -- which is a new initiative put forward by the United States. We are convinced that this would be the first important step proceeding towards a new type of defense structures. On our part we are conducting very intensive negotiations with NATO leadership. Here the visit by Mr Linkevicius [minister of defense] and his meeting with Secretary General Woerner can be mentioned. A summit of NATO is to held in mid-January, following this the president is to visit Brussels. This will be the first visit by the head of a foreign country aiming at the discussion of all these questions. It is evident that our task is to intensify all these processes, which is what we are currently consistently doing. [passage omitted]
