Zhirinovskiy was referring to Jewish protestors who demonstrated on Monday outside the Russian consulate where he was staying. He spat at the demonstrators, threw clods of earth and threatened them with his "atomic revolver." On Wednesday the extremist MP, who was part of a Russian parliamentary delegation at the spring session of the Council of European parliament, said "I am leaving this country where the police fails to protect me from the attacks of Jewish extremists." Zhirinovsky adopted a low profile since Tuesday after being warned to behave himself by the French Foreign Ministry. He attended all parliamentary sessions quietly, but failed in attempts to take part in meetings of party groups. On Monday he had called liberal parliamentarians "CIA agents" and inside the the Council chamber, he denounced NATO air raids against Bosnian Serbs and suggested Russia should bomb European cities. When he arrived in France on Sunday, Zhirinovsky berated the host country and also Germany, saying Paris would be "an Arab city in 10 or 20 years" and Germany would be taken over by Turkish immigrants. "Soon, Russia will be the only white country left in Europe."
