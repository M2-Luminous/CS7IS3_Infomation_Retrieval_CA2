In an interview, Berisha again attacked our country and called on it to choose between the European or Byzantine trend which, he said, prevails in our country. Venizelos said that the European trend primarily means respect for the principles of a state of justice, respect for human rights and of course respect for the rights of the Greek minority in Albania. Beyond that, said Venizelos, I do not think that many strongly worded statements help to cultivate good relations between the two countries. The good relations, he continued, definitely depend on respect for the rules I mentioned above.
