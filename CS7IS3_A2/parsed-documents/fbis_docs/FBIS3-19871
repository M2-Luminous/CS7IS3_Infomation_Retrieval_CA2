According to Community observers, this request indicates that the possibility of referring Greece to the European Court has lost momentum. Correspondent Mairi Savva reports from Brussels: [Savva] EU Commission President Jacques Delors has sent another letter to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou regarding the FYROM. In his letter, Delors asks the Greek Government to raise the issue of the economic embargo at the EU Council of Foreign Ministers. Political observers in Brussels view this move as another goodwill gesture from the Commission, which right now does not want to lodge a complaint against Greece at the European Court. After the extraordinary Council of Ministers meeting ended, Delors and Theodhoros Pangalos, the alternate foreign affairs minister and EU president, gave a joint news conference. Unfortunately, no agreement was reached on the major political issue of how to make decisions after the EU expands. The Commission and 10 member states favor an arithmetical adjustment when decisions are made, with a special majority so as not to make decisionmaking any more difficult. Britain and Spain have strongly protested; and the European Parliament now may not ratify the expansion if this is done according to the solution proposed by these two countries. The issue will be discussed next weekend during the informal EU Foreign Ministers meetings in Ioannina, which will not deal exclusively with the great political problems that concern the EU, such as the former Yugoslavia and the situation in the Middle East.
