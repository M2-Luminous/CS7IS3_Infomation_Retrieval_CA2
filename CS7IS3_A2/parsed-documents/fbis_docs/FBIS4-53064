In a speech in Chiba, the Shinseito secretary general rejected any plans to do away with the intraparliamentary group "Kaishin (Innovation)" if it would entice the return of the second largest opposition party, which bolted from the coalition last month. "The ruling party must have this kind of confidence. We must be able to have confidence in our ideals and answer the expectations of the people," said Ozawa, the acknowledged architect of the ruling minority coalition. Earlier Monday, Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the Democratic Socialist Party, and Japan New Party executive Masao Matsuoka suggested the ruling coalition would be willing to withdraw plans for "Kaishin" if it would entice the return of the SDP. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will formally inform SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama on Tuesday of the suggestion and urge the SDP to rejoin the coalition. The SDP, however, has charged that there is still an "authoritarian character" to the current coalition and denied that there was any possibility of a return of the SDP to the ruling force. The SDP withdrew from the ruling coalition only hours after it had helped elect Tsutomu Hata premier, upset by maneuvers by other coalition parties to form the new political alignment without the party. Ozawa warned that in the event of general elections, the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party would win by a landslide and that the "only other survivor would be Shinseito." "We must not think only of the advantages before us and turn left or turn right. The socialists and Komeito were with us when we decided to proceed and we must think about achieving an historically great achievement," urged Ozawa. Ozawa dismissed suggestions by murayama and new party Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura that the House of Representatives be dissolved for elections under the current electoral system. "That is only the talk of people who do not have the right to decide on the dissolution. The cabinet will make that decision," said Ozawa.
