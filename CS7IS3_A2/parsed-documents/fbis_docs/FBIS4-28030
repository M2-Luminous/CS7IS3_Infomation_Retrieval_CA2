Policemen were named as the alleged perpetrators in 118, or 51 percent, of 232 human rights cases filed before the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) from January to March 1994, a CHR report revealed yesterday. The report approved for release by Human Rights Commission Chairman Sedfrey Ordonez, said local officials and employees placed a far second for being charged in 29 or 12.5 percent of the cases. They displaced the military who were charged in 19 or 8.2 percent of the cases. The CHR earlier ranked the police as the top suspects in human rights complaints last year, with the military placing a far second and local officials and employees a far third. But Interior and Local Government Undersecretary Alexander Aguirre reacted to the report, saying the number of human rights cases against policemen merely reflected the nature of police work, which require the arrest, detention, maiming or killing of crime suspects in defense of public safety. The latest CHR report also noted a decline in the incidents of human rights violations actually occurring this year, from 75 in January to 50 in February and 33 in March. Of these, 22 were murder, homicide and execution cases while the rest were illegal arrests and detention (17), rape (4), disappearances (3), torture (1) and other complains (115). Other suspects in human rights cases were civilians (11 cases), workers (6), professionals (4), paramilitary forces (3), New People's Army (2), other rebel groups (1) and other sectors (39). Metro Manila topped the list of regions with the highest number of human rights cases with 48, followed by Central Luzon and Eastern Visayas (40 each), Southern Mindanao (38), Western Visayas (37), Central Visayas (32), Cagayan Valley and Western Mindanao (29 each), and Central Mindanao (nine). Civilians topped the list of human rights victims, being named as such in 53 cases, followed by workers (41) and children, youth and women (29). Meanwhile, the CHR announced it has released over P [Philippine pesos] 1 million in financial assistance to 137 human rights victims in the first quarter of 1994. Ordonez told reporters most of the money, or P970,000 went to 97 beneficiaries as survivors' benefits, while P75,000 went to the medical needs of 15 beneficiaries, P4,340 went to the incidental and medical expenses of 23 others and the remaining P6,000 to two persons availing of the government witness protection program.
