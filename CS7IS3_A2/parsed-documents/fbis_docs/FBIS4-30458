Thillinandan] [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Monday [20 June] -- It is believed that Melewar Corporation Chairman Tunku Abdullah Tuanku Abdul Rahman used his diplomatic passport to enter Israel. According to sources, Tunku Abdullah could only have entered Israel by using a diplomatic passport because Malaysia has no diplomatic relations with that country. A Malaysian international passport cannot be used to enter that country because it is stated on the passport that Israel is the only country that cannot be visited. The sources say the Immigration Department is authorized to issue diplomatic passports only to diplomats, ministers, and royal relatives. Tunku Abdullah, the younger brother of Paramount Ruler Tuanku Jaafar, reportedly paid a visit to Israel recently during which he met Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. Meanwhile, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman contacted today did not rule out the possibility that Tunku Abdullah used a diplomatic passport for the visit because it is the only way to enter that country. "We are not sure, however, where he obtained a visa to enter Israel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not know positively when he left that country," he said. Israeli television is believed to have covered Tunku Abdullah's visit and his meetings with Israeli leaders on 17 June. AFP ran a similar report. Yesterday, Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said he knew nothing about Tunku Abdullah's visit and that it was made without the government's knowledge. The spokesman said Tunku Abdullah made the visit without the knowledge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. An early investigation showed that the visit was personal; he did not represent any party. "We do not know the purpose of his visit," he said. According to the spokesman, a report obtained by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs showed that Tunku Abdullah entered that country on 16 June but was not positive whether or not he had returned home. He said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not have the authority to question Tunku Abdullah because the matter falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Immigration Department.
