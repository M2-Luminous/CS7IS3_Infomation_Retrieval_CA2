He is convinced that this does not demonstrate the recognition of this person's authority, but is a manifestation of ordinary political games on the eve of the presidential election. "If Ukraine's voters elect someone other than Leonid Kravchuk or Oleksandr Moroz as president on 26 June, Leonid Kuchma stressed, then cooperation between the prime minister and the president will be fairly problematical." Leonid Kuchma did not rule out that the last week in the presidential marathon will bring much that is unexpected. In particular, in his opinion, contenders for the presidential seat will withdraw their candidacies. If Oleksandr Moroz does this, Leonid Kuchma expressed the hope that his [Moroz's] electorate will vote for Leonid Kuchma. In the opinion of Leonid Danylovych Kuchma, the forces supporting him in Ukraine's east and south should influence changes to the existing state of affairs more actively, when in fact western Ukraine is dictating its conditions to the whole of the 50 million-strong country. Leonid Kuchma maintained: "If I am not elected, this will not be a great tragedy for me. On the whole, I am returning to politics only in order to save Ukraine. Otherwise, I would not risk going into the corridors of power."
