At the meeting, principal leaders of prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities exchanged their views on the progress of last year's work, the experience they gained and what they learned therefrom, as well as their plans for the new year and their hopes and proposals for the autonomous region's policy on macroeconomic regulations and control. After hearing reports by leaders of various prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities, regional party Secretary Song Hanliang pointed out: Whether or not the reform, opening up, and economic development carried out by Xinjiang can be accelerated depends on the actual progress made by various prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities; and also depends on how the frontline leaders command and organize their men to implement the policies. He said: Our regional and border trade reflects that a market mechanism is gradually taking shape in Xinjiang. Guided by the principle of emancipating the minds, the government formulated a series of essential policies, which played an important role in providing services and improving infrastructural facilities in various ports. If the same thing is done in our industrial and agricultural sectors as well as to our infrastructure, we can achieve development with great speed and high-efficiency. Leading comrades of Xinjiang Autonomous Region, including Abulaidi Amudurexiti, Zhang Fusen, Wang Lequan, Keyum Bawudun, Zhou Shengtao, and Hailiqiemu Silamu, also attended the meeting.
