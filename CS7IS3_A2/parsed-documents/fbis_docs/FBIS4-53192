FBIS4-53192 "dreas096_m_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 18 May 1994 Thailand Problems in Relations With Cambodia Discussed Problems in Relations With Cambodia Discussed Cambodian Charges of Aiding KR Rebutted BK1805042794 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 18 May 94 p 6 BK1805042794 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday reaffirmed Thailand's policy of non-intervention in Cambodia's internal affairs, saying Thailand had no right to tell anyone what to do. "Thailand never interferes in the internal affairs of another country," he said. "The Cambodian request for arms assistance is a matter concerning only the donors and the recipients. Thailand cannot interfere or get involved." Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh said on Monday that Bangkok's opposition to overseas military aid for his government was hypocritical and amounted to unacceptable interference. Cambodian leaders have repeatedly accused Thailand of aiding the Khmer Rouge [KR] Through trade and by providing a safe haven on its soil. Thai authorities however, have denied helping the guerrillas. "When they (government troops) lose (on the battlefield), they always find a scapegoat or someone to blame," the Foreign Minister said in response to the Cambodian government allegations against Thailand. Foreign Ministry Director-General of East Asian Affairs Department, Don Pramutwinai, pointed out that Thailand did not object to the foreign supply of arms to the Phnom Penh government, as it had only expressed its opinion and goodwill to see lasting peace in Cambodia. "We just expressed our feelings as a neighboring country which has always been affected by the fighting in Cambodia. The provision of arms by outsiders would prolong the conflict and would absolutely not bring peace to that country," Mr Don said. Prince Ranariddh said Foreign Minister Norodom Sirivut had met the ambassadors of the United States, France, Britain and other countries to officially ask for military assistance to fight the Khmer Rouge. Defense Minister Wichit Sukmak commented that arms assistance was "the least appropriate thing" for the Paris Peace agreement signatories to conduct. His deputy minister Sombat Rotphothong said whoever wanted to assist Cambodia should consider whether that assistance would bring about peace in the country. Maj-Gen Sombat noted that the solution to Cambodian problems would only be reached through political means, not military support, "otherwise the Cambodian people would be the ones who suffer most." Gen Wichit reiterated Thailand's firm stand to see national reconciliation in Cambodia and the hope that the conflict would be settled through peaceful means. "If the fighting continues, the repercussions on Thailand could not be avoided for we share a common border. We have no involvement but are burdened with such negative results," he said. Asked if foreign military assistance would violate the 1991 peace agreement, Gen Wichit said such was the case because the accord aimed at reducing and controlling arms in Cambodia. "If there is still military support to one particular faction, the fighting will be prolonged and never end," Gen Wichit said. Meanwhile, Cambodian ambassador-designate to Bangkok Roland Eng was yesterday invited by the Foreign Ministry to discuss the invitation extended to Cambodia to attend the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) scheduled for Bangkok in July. Director-General Don quoted Mr Eng as expressing interest in participating in the meeting. However, Cambodia this year could not immediately join as they first need to have access to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation of the Southeast Asian nations and hold observer status. Mr Eng was also quoted as saying that he would take up his position in Bangkok soon. He told reporters after a 30-minute discussion with Mr Don that he believed Thailand would want to see roundtable peace talks held as soon as possible and the Cambodian government was trying its best to organize such a meeting.
