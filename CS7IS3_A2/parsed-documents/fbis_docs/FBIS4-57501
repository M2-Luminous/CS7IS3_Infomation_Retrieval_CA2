Cuban delegate Edgardo Valdes, who participated in the general debates of the sessions of the UN Committee on Information, described those actions as a clear violation of his country's sovereignty and of international regulations on peaceful coexistence among states. Valdes said those actions are also contrary to the information order promoted by this committee and contravene international rules and regulations on communications signed by all countries, including the United States. He recalled that at a recent conference on sustained development of small islands held in Barbados, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said "no single theory, model, or group of priorities can be imposed from abroad" and urged each society to choose its own path. This radio policy, however, is being used against Cuba, with the excuse of an alleged need to inform Cubans, claiming to have the authority to define what is described as a "free flow of information." More than 15 radio stations and one television station are broadcasting to Cuba, Valdes protested. "Cuba rejects the continuation of that practice and warns that no attempt to increase those broadcasts will go unanswered," he noted. Valdes added that as the U.S. Congress control office has admitted, programs broadcast by those stations "ignore the majority of positive news about Cuba, or they are reinterpreted or mystified," and that frequent calls are made to change the current political system. Valdes said there are 1.7 radios per family in Cuba, more than 100 international broadcasts can be heard, including VOA, and that 400 out of the 600 Western films shown each year are from the United States. He added that there is free access to publications of various kinds in libraries and document centers, the national television rebroadcasts CNN, CBS, and other networks' reports, while 120 foreign journalists live in Cuba and hundreds visit the country each year. "Even if this were not the case, no foreign government has the right to decide what the information policy of a sovereign state should be, ignoring the most basic principles of [words indistinct] Valdes stressed.
