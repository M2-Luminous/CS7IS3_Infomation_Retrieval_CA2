Olechowski said that the signed agreements were like "stones of which a new Europe was being built." He also stressed that they would contribute to building relations between the nations that liked each other. Earlier in the day, the two ministers held a meeting and chaired the plenary talks by the delegations of the foreign ministries of Poland and Slovenia. The talks were attended by Polish deputy minister for foreign economic relations Andrzej Bryt. The talks focused on preparing bilateral economic agreements which were planned to cover protection of investments, avoidance of double taxation, transport, transfer of social benefits and re- admission. Peterle said the agreements should be signed still this year. He stressed that the talks and decisions made on Monday were "a big step" designed to consolidate Polish-Slovenian and international cooperation in Central Europe on the Baltic-Adriatic line. The two sides also discussed the situation in the Balkans. In the opinion Peterle, the recent developments in Bosnia show there is a possibility of reaching peace. He expressed hope that the European Community would help limit or even solve the conflict. Peterle, who is holding both the post of foreign minister and deputy prime minister, said Slovenia was planning to establish its embassy in Warsaw. Poland announced at the beginning of January, 1994, that it decided to open its embassy in Ljubljana.
