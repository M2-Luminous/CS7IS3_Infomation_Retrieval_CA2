Asked about an adviser's comment on the possible resignation of the Cabinet depending on the result of Diet debate on reform, the top government spokesman said, "I neither confirm nor deny that." Shusei Tanaka, a special adviser to Hosokawa, said Tuesday the premier may disband the cabinet and step down if he fails to get the measures put into law. Four bills to reform the system for elections to the House of Representatives and curb corruption in public life were defeated in the House of Councillors last Friday. They had cleared the lower house last November. Hosokawa has staked his political fate on enactment of such measures by a self-imposed deadline of Saturday, when the current Diet session ends. To meet public expectations, ruling and opposition parties must do their utmost to ignore even major differences and accomplish a common goal of political reform, Takemura told a news conference. The ruling coalition and the opposition camp begin negotiations Wednesday afternoon to work out a compromise reform plan and get it onto the statute books before the close of the Diet term. Earlier Wednesday, the premier brushed aside speculation that he and his cabinet might resign, saying he has no plans to take such a step. Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Hosokawa should dissolve the lower house for a snap general election, rather than stepping down, if the political reform program fails to win parliamentary approval by Saturday. "I don't think the mass resignation of the cabinet is possible with such a high level of public support," he said. Hata also ruled out the possibility of carrying the government reform proposals over to the next regular session of the Diet, which begins next Monday. A government source said there is no consensus within the government about the resignation of the cabinet, adding that Tanaka was only expressing his personal views.
