FR940727-0-00025 FR940727-0-00011 13 CFR Part 121 Small Business Size Standards; Surety Bond Guaranty Assistance Program AGENCY: Small Business Administration. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: SBA is correcting the numbering of its final rule identifying a new size standard for the Surety Bond Guaranty Program, which was published in the Federal Register on June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28231). EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary M. Jackson, Assistant Administrator for Size Standards, Tel: (202) 205&hyph;6618. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 1, 1994, SBA promulgated a final rule amending the size standard in 13 CFR 121.802 for its Surety Bond Guaranty Program (59 FR 28231). The amended regulatory text was designated a paragraph (a)(3) of ยง121.802. However, in a previous amendment of ยง121.802, which contains size standards for SBA financial assistance, SBA had promulgated a new size standard for Small Business Investment Company assistance by dividing the text of paragraph (a)(2) into two separate paragraphs, paragraph (a)(2) for development company assistance and paragraph (a)(3) for SBIC assistance, and redesignating paragraph (a)(3), containing the size standard for surety bond guaranty assistance, as paragraph (a)(4). When promulgating its final rule amending the surety bond guaranty size standard, however, SBA inadvertently identified the amended regulatory text as paragraph (a)(3). This correction properly designates the amended regulatory text concerning surety bond guarantees as paragraph (a)(4). Correction of Publication ยง121.80 [Corrected] In the second column on page 28234 of the June 1, 1994 Federal Register, the amendatory instruction # 2 is amended by correcting the reference to ``paragraph (a)(3)'' to read ``paragraph (a)(4)'' and the amended regulatory text incorrectly designated as paragraph (a)(3) is redesignated as paragraph (a)(4). Dated: July 20, 1994. Erskine B. Bowles, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18158 Filed 7&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8025&hyph;01&hyph;M
