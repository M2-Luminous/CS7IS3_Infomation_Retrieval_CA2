Judging by radio talks of the crew and the air traffic controllers, a possibility of the plane's shot down in the Karabakh skies is minimum. The C-130 plane, an analogue of the U.S. Hercules or the Russian AN-12, belongs to the Iranian Defence Ministry. It came to Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport several days ago to bring 52 Iranian servicemen studying in Moscow. On Wednesday [16 March] the plane was expected to leave for Tehran, but the take off was delayed till Thursday night. The plane finally took off at 18:40 on March 17 carrying 32 passengers, including 19 family members of staffers of the Iranian Embassy in Moscow, and 13 crew members, and headed for Tehran. However, flying at a height of 6,300 meters at 19:54 the crew commander got in touch with the Petrovskoye separate homing radio station and said the plane's cockpit had turned depressurized and they are losing height. Some time later he reported that their height is 5,100 meters. The crew commander had an impression that the situation improved and climbed the height of 6,300 meters again. At that time an Aeroflot plane was flying in the opposite direction on its way from Iran. The Iranian plane commander informed the Russian colleague he had a permission to cross the Russian and Armenian state borders. The conversation registered in the area of the Dzhulfe populated locality was the last. After that the Iranian military plane lost contact with the air traffic controllers and the flying aircraft. Smoking debris of the Iranian plane and 32 dead bodies were found early this morning four kilometers away from Stepanakert. The Iranian side has requested assistance in the air crash investigation from the Sheremetyevo international services and asked local bodies not to touch the debris.
