FBIS4-52402 "dreas090_h_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-090 Daily Report 7 May 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Malaysia Mahathir-Clinton Talks on Bosnia, Asia Reported Mahathir-Clinton Talks on Bosnia, Asia Reported BK0705101394 Kuala Lumpur BERNAMA in English 0643 GMT 7 May 94 BK0705101394 Kuala Lumpur BERNAMA English BFN [From Azman Ujang] [Text] Washington, May 7 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- President Bill Clinton spoke Saturday of a dilemma facing the United States over Bosnia, including the collapse of the United Nations mission in the war-torn country if the U.S. unilaterally opted for tougher action to resolve the conflict there. Declaring that he had, since taking office, been in favour of lifting the arms embargo imposed by the UN, he said the danger in this was that it could lead to the collapse of the UN mission in Bosnia as other countries in the mission would pull out from Bosnia. Clinton, at a meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed at the White House here Friday, also sought advice on resolving the Bosnian and other issues. Malaysia's permanent representative to the UN, Razali Ismail, who also attended the meeting, cited Clinton as saying the U.S. could still supply the Bosnians with types of arms not bound by the embargo but this was bound to be resisted by other member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) as well as Russia. But Clinton assured Dr. Mahathir that the United States would continue to press for the lifting of the arms embargo at the UN, Razali told Malaysian journalists after the meeting. On this, Dr. Mahathir advised Clinton to persuade NATO members like France and Britain to agree to the lifting of the arms embargo which had placed the Bosnians in a defenceless position against Serb aggression. Dr. Mahathir said he could not accept the present UN helplessness over the Bosnian conflict and suggested that countries which wanted to pull out from the UN mission could do so to enable troops of other countries willing to help Bosnia to take their place. The bottom line is that if the UN cannot guarantee the survival of Bosnia, then it should be allowed to defend itself as provided for under Article 51 of the UN Charter, he said. Clinton also sought Dr. Mahathir's advice on how the U.S. could establish a credible partnership with countries of Asia while assuring the prime minister that it was not his policy to try to dominate. The U.S. is looking for a partnership without dominance and asked how this could be effectualised, Razali said. One advice Dr. Mahathir gave was that countries like Malaysia could accept criticisms and what was perceived as right or wrong as much as Malaysia had never hesitated to say what was right or wrong [as received]. Razali said Dr. Mahathir, however, drew a line between criticisms and arm-twisting. If coutries went beyond criticisms in order to force others to bow to their demand, then they were arm-twisting and this was unacceptable. He cautioned the U.S. president about such tendencies in Asian countries which are culturally very developed societies and which are resilent and their natural forces should be allowed to evolve towards their desired objectives, he added. Summing up the meeting, Razali said: It was not one of those superficial meetings and it was noticeable that President Clinton took a lot of trouble to explain to Dr. Mahathir the various aspects of his policies and, significantly, listened a lot to what the prime minister had to say and sought his advice on many issues. This would create better understanding on how each country looked at issues between themselves and the U.S. president showed overwhelming sincerity in wanting to improve U.S. relations with Malaysia, he said. Razali said Clinton and Dr. Mahathir also spoke about reforms within the UN in the context of peacekeeping missions. It was agreed that both the U.S. and Malaysia would initiatite these reforms, he added.
