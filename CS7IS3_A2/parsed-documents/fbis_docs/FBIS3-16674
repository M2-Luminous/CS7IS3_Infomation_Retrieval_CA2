The attempts of a Russian firm to ship this load through Lithuania to Germany failed for the second time. Our customs officials detained the train for the first time on 6 January at the Vaidotai station. Since the consignor had no permit from the Environmental Protection Department, Lithuanian officials turned the train back. After the attempt to bring the methanol in from Belarus had failed, the firm tried to do this from Latvia's territory. On Thursday, the cisterns arrived from Daugavpils to Radviliskis. From there they had to travel to the port of Klaipeda, and later by the Mukran ferry to Germany. However, Lithuanian customs officials detained the load again. According to F. Stankevicius, senior inspector of the Customs Work Organization Division at the Customs Department, Lithuania is currently negotiating with the Latvians on the return of the methanol. However, Latvia does not yet want to accept the load that is dangerous to the environment.
