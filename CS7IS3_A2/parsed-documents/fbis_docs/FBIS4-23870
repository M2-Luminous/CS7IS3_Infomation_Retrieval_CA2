According to the Guinean interior minister, the reports of a coup bid are totally unfounded. We have a report from Nicolas Balique: [Balique] Official sources in Conakry said this morning that the reports of a coup bid were, I quote, totally unfounded. On the other hand, the arrest a week ago of a dozen or so senior officers was confirmed, without the reason behind this being given. Among these officers was Commander Oulare, the deputy chief of staff of the air force, and Captain (Noumbouya), in command of the battalion of airborne troops. They were released today, Thursday, and it has even been pointed out that this afternoon one of them was due to lead the battalion with the task of welcoming President Lansana Conte back from the OAU [Organization of African Unity] summit. In fact these arrests are reported to have followed a secret meeting held by the group of officers, the subject of which was basically political, while it is noted in Conakry that a military man has an obligation to remain apolitical. It is impossible to establish whether a coup plan was indeed being considered. The release of the eight men may confirm the regime's desire to take the heat out of the situation [dedramatiser la situation] and to avoid the sound of boots being heard in Guinea once again.
