The meeting called for curbing indiscriminate fund-raising to ensure the fulfillment of the task of issuing treasury bonds as scheduled across the province. The task of issuing treasury bonds assigned by the state to Guangdong this year involves 6.71 billion yuan. By the 25th of this month, the province had issued 12.13 and 18.84 percent of the two-year and three-year treasury bonds respectively, ranking last among the provinces. The major reason why Guangdong has been slow in issuing treasury bonds is that some localities have indiscriminately raised funds and raised interest rates. The provincial government has demanded that the whole province take action to correct illegal activities of indiscriminately raising funds and that various localities complete the issuance of 50 percent of the two-year treasury bonds and more than one-third of the three-year bonds by the end of this month and to complete the issuance of all two-year treasury bonds by the end of May and all three-year treasury bonds by the end of June. This task should be grasped personally by the number-one men in party and government organizations in various localities and its fulfillment should be ensured by organizations at all levels. Responsibility shall be affixed to anyone who delays the fulfillment of this task. The telephone meeting held this afternoon was chaired by Governor Zhu Senlin. Vice Governors Lu Ruihua and Ou Guangyuan also spoke at the meeting.
