So says Mikko Paatero, provincial police commissioner. "An organized crime system requires the population's support if it is to function. We are a long way from having that in Finland," said Paatero on Thursday [17 February] as he presented the 1993 crime statistics for Turku/Pori Province. More Narcotics Crimes Crime seems to have declined in 1993 in comparison with 1992, judging from the statistics presented by Paatero. This is true of all types of crime except narcotics offenses, which were up from 374 to 493. But actually, that is also good news, says Paatero: the number of narcotics offenses reported always depends to a large extent on how hard the police have concentrated on combating drugs, and in Turku/Pori Province, there was a drive against narcotics offenses in 1993.
