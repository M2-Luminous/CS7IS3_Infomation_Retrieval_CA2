The rally supported a statement of the Kazakh Foreign Ministry, which lamented over another nuclear test in Lob Nor fraught with grave consequences for the regional ecology. Kazakh residents, which have lived through the 40 years work of the Semipalatinsk testing grounds, are especially concerned over the fate of future generations, as well as the neighbouring areas of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan which also have borders with China. "Our demand to stop tests in Lob Nor is not an interference in Chinese internal affairs," leader of the Attan Anti-Nuclear Movement Amantai Asylbekov told the rally. "It is concern over the health of millions of citizens of many regional states. It is alarming that the test was held by China while other nuclear powers observe the nuclear test moratorium." The peace march that began today near the Chinese Embassy will finish on 29 August in New York City near the United Nations headquarters. The Attan members together with U.S. anti-nuclear activists want to attract the public attention and pull efforts to achieve closure of all the nuclear testing grounds throughout the world.
