Determinations of the activity spectrum on a series of phages resulted in the identification of the (5')R*CCGGY as the target sequence, where * indicates the cleavage site, R = A or G, and Y = C or T. Specificity of Bse118 I identifies it as an isoschizomer of Cfr10 I. Maximum Bse118 I activity was expressed under the following conditions: 10 mM tris-HCl buffer. pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl[.sup]2[/], 7 mM 2-mercaptoenthanol, and 65ï¿½C.
