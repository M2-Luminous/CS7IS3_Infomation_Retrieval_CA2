They pointed out that while the GATT talks are deadlocked, a new forum called World Trade Organization has been established. This was disclosed by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas after the second-day session of the Nonaligned Movement's foreign ministers in Jakarta today. Alatas noted that there has hardly been any cooperation among the G-77 member countries during the seven-year-old Uruguay Round talks. As for the next chairman of the Nonaligned Movement, Alatas said Nicaragua had officially submitted its candidacy, but this country needs time to consult with Latin American countries.
