Jordanian Scholar Views Islam, Terrorism AL-AZHAR RECTOR, SCHOLARS ADDRESS ISLAMIC ACTION CONFERENCE An approximately 2,000-word report on pages 1 and 11 reviews statements made at the Islamic Action Conference, Present and Future, organized by the Islamic Universities League in cooperation with the al-Azhar Mosque. Addressing the conference, Al-Azhar Mosque rector Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq exhorts Muslims to "discard their dogmatic disputes, solve their problems, and build themselves" so they can take their place in "the new world order." He notes that divisions among Muslims would lead to destructive wars and negatively affect Muslim minorities in the world. He wonders if the Islamic nation is capable of confronting the "external and internal intrigues designed to sow dissension between the peoples and their governments." Al-Azhar University Vice President Ja'far 'Abd-al-Salam says that what is meant by Islamic action involves all deeds, writings, and moves aimed to teach the Islamic religion and spread Islam so that it will have the upper hand in the Islamic countries. He notes the importance of Islamic action in the media, particularly satellite media, to "spread true Islam" and dispel the "deviant image" of Islam. The media, he says, can do the job that Muslim armies did in the early days of Islam to propagate this religion worldwide. Dr. Muhammad Kamal, head of the Shari'ah College at Alexandria University, warns of the danger of Western information media organs, which convey a "distorted image of Islam and Muslims and oppose any attempt to correct it." Al-Azhar University professor Ibrahim 'Isa calls for an Islamic preparation of the education curricula in the Arab and Islamic countries. He warns against introducing foreign education curricula because non-Islamic curricula would "entrench the divisions and disarray" among the Arab and Muslim countries and "threaten their identity." AWQAF MINISTER, ULEMA ANSWER STUDENTS' QUESTIONS A 500-word report on page 2 elaborates on a gathering at the Law College in al-Minufiyah University between an enlightenment convoy led by Awqaf Minister Mahjub, a number of al-Azhar ulema, and some students. Al-Minufiyah Governor Counselor 'Adli Husayn says that there are "serious phenomena" in Egypt that need debate. He stresses that the youths are living in a time in which the cards have been shuffled, noting that the state should heed and answer their questions. Responding to a question from a student who notes that there are those who maintain that Egypt is an atheist state because it does not apply Islam, a psychology professor at a Cairo university says that the most serious menace is the sedition the extremist factions are trying to foment. He says that they "raise the slogan of Islam to subvert Egypt and strike at Islam." He urges the students to reject the extremists' ideas because their aim is to kindle sedition and not to promote Islam. On the stance of the state and al-Azhar on hostile trends, al-Azhar Mosque scholar Sayyid Sa'ud says al-Azhar is assailed because it refuses to condone the extremists's actions. He notes that al-Azhar will not serve certain ideology, noting that these extremists realize the influence and role of al-Azhar and that is why they assail it. GOVERNMENT SPENDS 200 MILLION POUNDS ON MOSQUES A 50-word report on page 2 cites Awqaf Minister Mahjub as saying that the government this year allocated $200 million pounds to build and renovate mosques throughout Egypt. He says that the government will spare none of the funds necessary to make the mosques look befitting the lofty status of Islam and to "purge them of extremism." 'AQIDATI CONVOY SCHOLARS EXPLAIN ISLAMIC VIEWS The paper features an approximately 2,200-word report on page 4 on 'AQIDATI enlightenment convoy's visit to the city of al-Dakhilah in al-Wadi al-Jadid. In a seminar attended by a large number of the city's inhabitants, al-Azhar scholar Sabri 'Abd-al-Ra'uf stressed that Islam has "nothing to do with terrorism" and that killing innocent people is rejected by Islam. The "evil faction" that does this seeks to "destroy the homeland," he says. 'AQIDATI Chief Editor al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf argues that when youths' issues are broached, we can find no authority or system better qualified to address all aspects of life than Islam. Dr. Haykal says that the "backbone of youths" in Egypt are the "al-Azhar youths." They are responsible for learning and teaching Islam. They are the safety valve of society, who are qualified to dispel the calls for extremism that threaten the nation. On women's work, Dr. Haykal says that there is no verse in the Koran that bans women's work, but, he notes, Islam exhorts women to dress and behave decently. Answering a question on the need for the 1 billion Muslim population to have a befitting standing in the world, Dr. Ibrahim al-Matnawi notes that an Islamic awakening is currently growing worldwide but "malicious enemies" are trying to make it a bloody awakening. He notes that there is great hope that the Islamic nation will unify its ranks and regain its strength. WRITER URGES AWQAF TO ALLOW PREACHERS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION In a 500-word comment by Basyuni al-Halawani in the "With All Frankness" column on page 6, he notes that during President Mubarak's era writers began to enjoy without fear a great deal of freedom of expression. Certain people criticized the state of affairs in the Awqaf Ministry to the minister himself, he says, adding that others criticized Egypt's religious symbols and establishments. He calls on the Awqaf Ministry to allow preachers to express their views freely and creatively and not to repeat mundane and banal sermons so that they may "win credibility" and fight the wave of extremism with "enlightened Islamic thinking." WRITER SLAMS U.S., UN, NATO INACTION IN GORAZDE In a 550-word comment titled "No Condolences in Gorazde" on page 10, Majdi Salim says that the Serbs advanced on Gorazde with Russian support, but the United Nations, America, and NATO did nothing to stop them. "The Serbs and Russians act, but the United States, NATO, and the United Nations just talk, " he argues. It seems, he says, that the mission of the UN forces in Bosnia is to protect the UN observers and watch the tragedy but not to protect Gorazde's 60,000 Muslim population from the carnage. JORDANIAN SCHOLAR VIEWS ISLAM, TERRORISM In a 2,000-word undated interview with Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Khayyat, former Jordanian awqaf minister and vice president of the Royal Academy of the Islamic Civilization in Jordan, on page 20, he answers questions on topical Islamic issues. He says that the majority of silent Muslims favor moderation, which is advocated by Islam. He notes that Islam has nothing to do with the acts done by groups that have "deviated from Islam's moderation and tolerance," and have resorted to violence. Discussing recent dialogues on religions between Christian and Muslim scholars, he says that these dialogues helped to clear the image of Islam. He notes that the Vatican instructed the clergy to denounce campaigns against Islam, notably Salman Rushdie's book "The Satanic Verses." He says that the conflict between Islam and Communism ended with the demise of Communism and disintegration of the Soviet Union.
