The head of government had a difficult time answering questions. Deputy Vladimir Chernyshev announced that he, as all the citizens of the Republic, for the past 64 months has suffered from difficulties caused by the transitional period and asked whether the government intends to use the population's money in reforms that are being carried out. According to him, without this it will not be possible to fulfill the targets. If only 32 ministers participate in building the market economy, the prime minister said, we will not achieve anything. It is important that the whole nation understands the need for the introduction of new economic relations and actively participates in this. With regard to the population's money, the government envisages restoring the people's trust in depositing their money in savings banks. Answering other topical questions Sergey Tereshchenko said that ministers are appointed in accordance with the existing Constitution. He himself never wrote a resignation application and does not intend to do so in the near future. Under the present difficult and objectively shaped conditions replacing the government will not lead to the immediate improvement of the population's life. The prime minister believes that the division of the former single administration into a presidential and governmental administration, and inclusion [word indistinct] of regional administrations into the latter one, is the right step under the present circumstances. It will contribute to a more effective implementation of a program aimed at speeding up reforms and lifting the country's economy out of crisis. As was reported earlier, President Nazarbayev suggested reducing the time of its implementation to 15 months. The methodology of defining expenditure and revenue parts of the state budget for the current year has been dictated by the target of bringing inflation down to 8-10 percent. With regard to spending connected with the creation of the military and naval fleet they could be explained by the need to protect the Caspian Sea borders. With regard to the issue of restoring benefits for certain categories of the population, Sergey Tereshchenko said, this has to be decided by deputies when they endorse the budget, and they should take into account the real financial capabilities of the state, since you cannot solve all the problems at once. The government thoroughly supervises the foreign debt of the state for it not to exceed the sum that could be repaid. Touching upon the subject of the Baykonur space range, the prime minister reminded of a relevant agreement that has been signed with Russia. After its ratification by the parliaments of both countries the republican budget will be replenished at the cost of the lease payment by the neighboring state. Our agriculture is still too costly. We spend 30-40 percent more per unit of produced good, compared to world standards. Under these conditions, allocation of credits to the agro-industrial complex is absolutely unprofitable. [Word indistinct] mineral fertilizers, new economically beneficial machinery and give it an opportunity [word indistinct]. The state keeps licenses only for 33 types of exported goods. He said that a change in the tax policy is expected. Taxes charged on entrepreneurial activity will be reduced and penalties for concealing profits will be increased. In reply to one of the questions, the prime minister said that it is economically unprofitable to stop the construction of a new presidential residence and sport complex. The decision on the construction of them was approved by the previous parliament. He also said that the implementation of the new program is not simple and it could only be carried out provided that the government and the Supreme Council join their efforts.
