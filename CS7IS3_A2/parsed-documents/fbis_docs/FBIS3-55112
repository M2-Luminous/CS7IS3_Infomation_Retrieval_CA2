It is easy to criticize government activities, but it is difficult to assume leadership, rule the state, make decisions, and foresee their consequences. This is why small and big political parties should come together to resolve these principal problems. Take inflation, for example, the devaluation of the Ukrainian karbovanets, the unjustifiably high exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and the Russian ruble. One of the sources of inflation is the erroneous postulate that the former can be curbed by restraining wages. It is only true in some cases, when wages exceed a certain reasonable level. However, in Ukraine, the situation is quite different. People's wages are so low that their purchasing power in fact equals zero. People are losing interest in work and discipline. Can anything be done to alleviate the situation? Undoubtedly, yes. This includes the functioning of customs offices on all the borders, an increase in wages on the basis of introducing a land tax, the introduction of a tax on the active part of enterprises' capital stock. These measures must be accompanied by the privatization of land and state property. Of course, monthly wages should be increased to a certain reasonable limit of say, $90. The next step toward curbing inflation is regulation of the nation's banking system. The ban on bank credits was a desperate measure and amounted to acknowledging complete disability to run the financial system. [passage omitted] Overwhelmed by our domestic problems, we seldom speak of our foreign policy. Unfortunately, the latter is conducted so inadequately that Ukraine's rating in the world community is very low. We are irresolute in our relations with Russia and the newly independent states. This important aspect will also depend on those who assume power. Political contests sometimes resemble military drills and children's games played by grown-ups. We should not look for harsh words leading to political divisions within society. We need an increase in mutual respect and trust on all levels. We are standing on the threshold of elections. We should rally around a centrist electoral bloc. [Pynzenyk] A lot of people are asking the same question: Can we overcome the crisis and halt the skyrocketing inflation? Do we have experts capable of leading our state to prosperity? I can give positive answers to all those questions. We have every chance of exiting the current situation. Many people believe that the latter is a result of reform. However, it is the irresoluteness and inconsistency of reform, as well as attempts to revert its progress that have caused the dramatic deterioration of the situation, impoverishment, corruption, embezzlements, and the flourishing of the shadow economy. Two major factors are determining the critical situation in Ukraine's economy: the leadership's lack of political will and professionalism. The problem of drafting a program for putting an end to the crisis does not exist. The problem lies in the high echelons' will to implement this program. [passage omitted] Unfortunately, time and again, we witness the mass incompetence of officials entitled to make crucial decisions. These people often hide behind beautiful phrases while, in fact, only caring about their own personal well-being. There are a lot of specialists in Ukraine ready to assume responsibility for changes in people's lives. However, no individual efforts can change the situation. There is the need for a team of professionals enjoying appropriate political support. Only professional resolute measures can save the situation. The experience of Poland, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, or Estonia proves that there is no option to such measures. Today, our people have a unique chance to create political prerequisites for reform (through the legislative elections) and to form (by means of the legislature) a professional government. We are the masters of our fate and we have no right to pass our hardships of today onto our children and grandchildren. [Kosiv] [passage omitted] We are being ruled by Russified turncoats who do not want to and never will consolidate Ukrainian independence. They are doing everything to prevent stabilization in production and banking, as well as to halt reform. State functionaries, red managers' corps, and the leadership of the agroindustrial complex use all available mechanisms to prolong their control over national property, because this property is easy to steal. We do not have to invent anything special. The Baltics, for example, were in a similar situation but they endured Russian pressure, launched market processes, and set out upon the path of civilized development. Will we be able to elect a Supreme Council able to form a government of the independent Ukrainian state?
