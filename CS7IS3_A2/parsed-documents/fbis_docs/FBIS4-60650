As a result of this war, northern and southern Yemen have sustained grave losses. There are many domestic, Arab, and international calls for dialogue. Isn't it high time for dialogue, and is Sanaa ready for it? ['Abd-al-Ghani] We did not want this war. This war was imposed on Yemen by the secessionist elements in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership. We always supported dialogue. We held a dialogue with the secessionist YSP leadership for nine months. We were ready to resume dialogue, but they discontinued this dialogue and started the fighting inside the Armed Forces. [passage omitted] [Birru] Both 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the YSP leadership declared the secession of southern Yemen. As was understood from remarks by Shaykh Zayid, president of the United Arab Emirates [UAE], the UAE implicitly recognizes the new Yemeni state. Shaykh Zayid said he received a telephone call from His Excellency 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Moreover, Shaykh Zayid warned President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih that Yemeni unity cannot be imposed by force. Do you expect recognition of the south Yemeni state by Gulf, Arab, or foreign states? ['Abd-al-Ghani] In fact, we do not believe the UAE has recognized the secessionist state or the secession declaration announced by 'Ali Salim al-Bid. The UAE has always been with unity, particularly Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, who supported Yemeni unity. We do not believe any Arab or foreign state will recognize this secession declaration announced by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, because it is unconstitutional. We do not want to impose unity by force, because unity was achieved through peaceful means. The whole Yemeni people in the southern, eastern, northern, and western governorates support unity. Those who are imposing state authority in the southern governorates are government forces. These forces are not from the northern governorates, but from northern and southern governorates. The northern governorates are not imposing unity on the southern governorates. There is readiness for unity. As it was achieved peacefully, it will continue so. All the Yemeni people support unity. [Birru] Do you hold the YSP, in its entirety, responsible for the war, or are you ready to hold a dialogue with elements in the YSP leadership in order to find a way out of this war? ['Abd-al-Ghani] We do not hold the YSP responsible. This is proven by the fact that parliamentary leaders from the YSP and leaders of the YSP branches in various parts of the Republic have issued statements against the secession declaration. We are ready for a dialogue with these leaders on the best ways to save Yemen from the war imposed on it. We are only against the secessionist elements that started the fighting and declared the secession. [Birru] The YSP leaders who called for dialogue are from northern Yemen. Have YSP leaders from southern Yemen announced their readiness for dialogue, or are you ready for dialogue with them? ['Abd-al-Ghani] Yes. We do not view the YSP as a southern or northern party. The YSP is represented throughout the Republic, and its members in the northern governorates outnumber those in the southern governorates. Those who issued a statement against the secession declaration were led by brother 'Ali Salih (?'Ubad), deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, who represents a constituency in the southern governorates. Doing the same were approximately 15 YSP leaders representing constituencies in the southern governorates. They issued a statement, along with their brother members of the YSP in the House of Representatives from some northern governorates. The truth is that the war is not one between the north and south, as people described it. In fact, elements in the YSP leadership rebelled against the state. These elements are being confronted by all citizens in the north and south. I believe that if you sent people to the southern governorates and asked the opinion of both the man on the street and the leaders, you would find that all people support unity and are against both the secession declaration and fighting, exactly like other citizens in the Republic.
