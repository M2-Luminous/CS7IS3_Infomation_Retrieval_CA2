This statement was made in an interview with INTERFAX by Anatoliy Lukyanov, member of the State Duma, who belongs to the unregistered Russian Way faction. Lukyanov commented on a televised statement by the former vice president Aleksander Rutskoy, who said that he is willing to lead those forces opposed to the president, which refuse to sign the agreement on civic accord. According to Lukyanov, "if, with the silent consent of Boris Yeltsin, the pro-president and pro-government press begins to harass those who refuse to sign the agreement, the authorities themselves will push them toward Rutskoy." The Yavlinskiy faction in the State Duma might also join the opposition bloc, he said. "We are open to union with all patriotic forces with which our positions coincide to some extent," Lukyanov declared. He referred to the fact that at the December-12 referendum not only the Communists, the Agrarians and the Russian Pan-National Union, but also the Yavlinskiy bloc, stood against adopting a new constitution.
