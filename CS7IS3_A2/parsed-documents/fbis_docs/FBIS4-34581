The Peruvian police have confirmed that no arrest warrant has been issued on Diaz Reategui. It was also confirmed that his Argentine residence permit is authentic. Diaz Reategui was detained at a hotel in the poor district of "El Bajo," near the bus terminal of the city of San Miguel de Tucuman. At the time of Diaz Reategui's detention, it was reported that he was participating in a meeting with other alleged guerrillas who escaped.

Ruckauf noted that those who were meeting with Diaz Reategui "had been spotted in other parts of our country, participating in public disorders."
