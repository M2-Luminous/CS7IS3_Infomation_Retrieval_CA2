The grand imam of al-Azhar, venerable ulemas, brothers and sisters, dear sons: Feelings of veneration and devotion engulf all of us at this meeting on this blessed night, as we derive the noble morals and deep lessons on the occasion marking the night when the skies inspired the Prophet, God's peace and blessings be upon him. Yes, this is the occasion when the holy inspiration manifested itself to the Prophet on the night the Koran was revealed--a night holier than 1,000 months. Our celebration of this occasion, which in our hearts and minds is associated with the greatest divine verses, is worthy of inspiring us with the best lessons and greatest preachings. How true God's words are in His holy book: "But teach thy message for teaching benefits the believers." [Koranic verse] We have the most noble potentials, with which we mobilize ourselves, and the best lessons, with which we train our minds, while reliving this glorious commemoration; it is for us to see these things as the Creator wanted us to see them through his holy Koran--as guidance and mercy for all people. We should turn it into an appropriate annual occasion, at which we pause to review the state of the nation. We hold ourselves accountable before others. We read our files and record of achievements before they are read to us out of our desire to rectify our steps, correct our trends, and work on overcoming the obstacles before us. This should take place on the basis of the noble Islamic values and correct Islamic morality that we acquire from the wise teachings God sent us in the form of a book which, without the shadow of a doubt, is guidance for the devout and a blessed message from the skies to the earth to light the path of progress and prosperity for all mankind. The Koran is the lighthouse leading to the haven of security and the shore of salvation for those who are oppressed and tossed around by the storms of disaster. This has been confirmed by historic developments throughout the ages when the Muslims were guided by its tolerant values and noble principles. They progressed, developed, and advanced as advocates of justice and goodwill until the light of Islam and its teachings dawned on the most important parts of the world. The Koran brought the Arabs out of darkness and ignorance into the realm of knowledge and civilization. It turned them from divided tribes and unrighteous paganism into a united and monotheist nation. It uplifted them from conflicts and divisions to the realms of accord, harmony, compassion, and peace. Islam then spread East and West and its minarets and banners rose everywhere. This clear victory was achieved thanks to the Koran's immortal humanitarian and civilized values, which Islam added to man's civilization. The most significant of these values are those of freedom, tolerance, equality, justice, fraternity, cooperation, love, and peace. Islam acknowledges the value of useful knowledge and appreciates didactic literature and sublime art. It exalts the value of serious effort and considers straightforward ethics as a basic part of religion and even the main goal of religiosity. A look at the affairs of the Muslim people today fills us with pain, despite the successes achieved by our Muslim people in many areas and the accomplishments attained due to the efforts of faithful leaders, the sacrifices of our martyrs, and the endeavors of good citizens. A look at the affairs of our people and reflection on our conditions would bring sorrow to our souls, agony to our hearts, and would puzzle our intellect. What pains us in our people's situation today are those negative phenomena that are completely alien to our nature and at odds with the tenets of our God-given faith. Among these phenomena are: First, ravaging conflicts; Second, disabling backwardness; Third, disrupting discord, destructive terrorism, fanatic extremism, rampant deviation, and misguided doctrines. Brothers and sisters, regrettably, we can see divisive conflicts in more than one place in the Islamic world. These conflicts take many and varied forms, ranging from tribal power struggles and ideological power struggles to ethnic power struggles aimed at domination. They sometimes take the form of material conflicts to satisfy ambitions. I don't want to specify these areas of conflict or name the leaders or rival factions or say anything that might be considered interference in others' affairs. But I would like to say with clarity and conviction that these conflicts have nothing to do with our religion. No way do they serve the interests of our nation. The impact of these conflicts is evidently destructive, disunites our nation, undermines our force, and offends the image of Islam. They cause the death of many innocent people, bloodshed, waste our wealth, and destroy our establishments. The consequences of these conflicts will weaken and exhaust our nation and drown it in misery and wretchedness and threaten it, God forbid, with annihilation. Strange that this struggle is taking place in several places in the Islamic world and is affecting and threatening us, despite the Koran's appeal for solidarity, call for collaboration, and prohibition of conflict and struggle. How great are the almighty's words: "And hold fast, all together, by the rope which God stretches out for you, and be not divided among yourselves." And his words: "And fall into no disputes, lest ye lose heart and your power depart." The disabling backwardness has many forms in the life of our nation and different forms among the people. There is scientific backwardness, which has made the nation's illiteracy rate among the highest in the world. There is cultural backwardness, which has led to a lack of awareness among many people regarding the facts and changes of the age and has led to an unwarranted conflict between adherence to origins and keeping abreast of modern developments or between adherence to the teachings of religion and expressing views on temporal affairs or even unjustly claiming that thought, modernization, and development are contrary to religion. There is also material backwardness, which has made many members of our nation importers, not producers or innovators, and deprived them of having their own means and applications appropriate for their conditions, the nature of their resources, and their manpower requirements. Puzzling is that all this appears in numerous places in our nation, although the Koran has urged the faithful to manage their own affairs and manage the creatures of the earth, and seek progress and the means for material, moral, and spiritual strength. The Koran also orders them to strive and work in every field of life, in building, in developing the universe, and in seeking education and knowledge. We must strive for scientific progress according to the almighty God's words: "Are those equal, those who know and those who do not know?" The almighty's words are: "Those truly fear God among his servants who have knowledge." The Koran is full of testimonial verses calling for advancing thought and elevating sentiments and advocating innovation and the subjugation of nature to the use of mankind. How numerous are the Koranic verses that advocate the need to use our brains, correct the view, develop the mind, elevate the sentiments by walking through the land, following the news of nations, taking lessons from history, and contemplating the beauties of existence, the magnificence of creation, and the wonders of the universe. We should remember that the first words revealed by God on that blessed night and the first words with which the heavens addressed the earth in those immortal moments were those sacred verses that open the eyes to the magnificence of the creation and call for knowledge and education. They, at the same time, glorify the most important tool for recording sciences, encyclopedias, and cultures. These sacred verses are the almighty's words: "Proclaim (or read) in the name of thy lord and cherisher, who created--created man out of a (mere) clot of congealed blood. Proclaim! And thy lord is most bountiful, he who taught (the use of) the pen--taught man that which he knew not." Islam has fought backwardness in all its forms and persisted in urging the Muslims to take their place at the front. But we see among the negative phenomena in our nation today this disabling backwardness that halts the movement of the nation and stands between it and the glory and advancement it deserves. As for the destructive terror, it is wreaking havoc in more than one area on the Islamic scene. Its conduct is wicked, criminal, aggressive, and shows disregard for human life. Its objectives are criminal. Its plans are bloody. Despite that, it masquerades in religious attire, hides behind a false claim of reform, and adopts deceptively attractive slogans. At the best of times, these slogans are words of truth but their objective is evil and misleading. But terrorism twists and deflects these slogans and takes them out of context to serve its criminal objectives and support its bloody plans. This is hypocrisy and those who practice it are the hypocrites whom God has condemned to eternal fire because they rephrase God's words and do what they do not state. What does religion have to do with the killing of innocent people? Where do reform and piety stand with respect to spreading panic and bloodshed? Where is the justice in shaking stability, fighting a war against people's livelihood, and hampering progress and prosperity? Where is the honesty and piety in behavior that contradicts all the teachings dictated by the pure Koranic texts and the noble prophetic traditions such as the sanctity of human life and preserving the rights of mankind to freedom? Where are the texts that sanction human bloodshed because they object to an individual's opinion or reject his ideas? Did not the almighty God say in precise verses: "Invite all to the way of thy lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious. For thy lord knoweth best who have strayed from his path and who receive guidance." Where are the texts that sanction the bloodshed of innocent people, including those people who have nothing to do with a specific opinion or way of thinking? Dear brothers and sisters, the holy Koran, which the hypocrites and terrorists use as their slogan and that has nothing to do with them, has stipulated: "If any one slew a person--unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land--it would be as if he slew the whole people." [Koranic verse] The terrorists claim the prophet of great Islam is their guide, while he rejects them and disassociates himself from them and has decreed that the sanctity of a Muslim's blood is greater to God than the sanctity of the Kaaba. He banned an individual from terrorizing his brother, even by merely directing a weapon at him or something that looks like a weapon and that frightens him. Terrorists and hypocrites add to their crimes of terrorizing, killing, and attacking innocent people one more crime: They explain religion for the sake of their vile objectives and exploit its texts for their destructive practices. They are lying to God and his prophet. They are oppressing God's people. "And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take." [Koranic verse] [applause] As for extremism, ladies and gentlemen, we see mental extremism and arrested behavior in many stances diverting some people away from moderation, which is the course of our religion and the call of our Koran. This extremism and stagnation cause negative behavior among those who adopt such a course, thus pushing them to fight others and misjudge moderates. It leads them to seclusion and isolation to the extent of secession. This also leads them to making enemies with society at times and to desecrating and attacking it at other times. Thus, hate driven by extremism becomes terrorism when it turns from a negative political stance into criminal and aggressive behavior. Extremism deflects Islamic behavior from the correct course because it obstructs social harmony, mental peace, and moderation. It leads to isolation and alienation and pushes individuals to resort to terrorism and to join bloody criminals and outlaws who have reneged on society and who attack peaceful citizens. These reneging extremists have distorted the image of Muslims. Many non-Muslims now judge Islam unfairly through the behavior of these extremists who belong to the nation of Islam. It is painful that this happens while virtues are at the core of Islam. The most important aim of worship in Islam is to teach Muslims moral values and good behavior. The Koranic verses and the prophet's sayings are replete with calls for adherence to sublime moral values and virtuous behavior. Brothers and sisters, these negative factors to which I have referred have obstructed the march of our nation, weakened it, and distorted its image. They have encouraged others to prey on this nation and have doubled the number of its enemies. As a result, some blatant forces have belittled some of the sons of our nation, cruelly torturing them, killing them brutally, and attacking their sanctities with barbarism. Because of these negative factors that have distorted the nation's image and increased the enemies of its religion some people have called for fighting this nation and eliminating it. Our nation cannot restore its prestige, retake its position, or catch up with the new world unless it gets rid of everything that obstructs its march, weakens it strength, and distorts its image. The new world is the world of the strong who are respected by everyone, whose words are heard, and whose rights are safeguarded. The new world is the world of detente and unity, not of division and conflict. The new world, brothers and sisters, is the world of progress and development, not the world of backwardness and stagnation. The new world is that of integration and interaction, the exchange of interests, and cooperation for a better future, not of contradictions and contrasts and the depletion of wealth and resources. The new world is supposed to be the world of security, stability, and peace, not of disturbances, threats, intimidation, and bloodshed. The new world must be a world of openness, tolerance, and brotherhood, not a world torn asunder by fanaticism and extremism. The new world must be one of human values and good behavior, not of lawlessness, deviation, chaos, and barbarism. All these values preached by the new world have been preached by Islam and Prophet Muhammad since the holy inspiration descended on him on Laylat al-Qadr [night of the revelation of the Koran] and throughout his mission, which he performed perfectly until he died and joined his God. If we want to correct our march and eschew our negative aspects, we have the verses of the holy Koran and the teachings of our great prophet to guide us so that we may forge ahead on the path of progress instead of remaining backward and stagnant. We can strive to achieve integration and cooperation instead of continuing with our contradictions and slackness. We must also promote a spirit of moderation in line with Islam's course and tolerance. We must first make morality and ethics the basis of our life, the framework of our activities, and the light of our behavior so that our way of life will be set right and so that our image will be corrected in others' eyes. We will thus be worthy of the Koranic verse: "Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind." [Koranic verse] Grand Imam and Rector of al-Azhar Mosque, O venerable ulema, brothers and sisters, you may agree with me that the best celebration of this blessed night lies in learning a useful lesson in its rich significance for our situation and our path. You may agree with me that our need for this lesson and significance is more pressing now than ever. Our nation, regrettably, is suffering from numerous negative aspects. Part of our nation is suffering from painful types of aggression and violation. These negative aspects and violations recently took a form that agonizes the hearts of the zealots and sincere people. Remedying these negative aspects and warding off violations lies, as I have often said, in following the values of the holy Koran and the example of our great prophet, may God's peace and prayers be upon him. On this blessed night and from the grounds of the al-Azhar Mosque, I appeal to my brothers, sons of the Islamic nation everywhere, each to play a role in reviving his nation as much as he can. I appeal to everyone to face up to his duty and responsibility. We are all shepherds and every shepherd is responsible for his community. The basis of reviving the nation lies in adherence to its holy Koran, the principles of its prophet, and the teachings of its religion. Foremost among these values, principles, and teachings are cohesion and adherence to God's path in a way that rejects divisive conflicts and that rises and achieves progress and rejects disabling backwardness. They should seek integration and cooperation so as to end the divisive contradictions. They should seek to establish security and consolidate stability and finish off destructive terrorism. They should spread a spirit of moderation and tolerance to prevent rigid extremism. And last but not least, they should strengthen straightforward ethics and honest behavior to prevent rampant deviation. Brothers and sisters, let us begin today, not tomorrow, to perform our duty in adhering to these immortal humanitarian Islamic values that will ensure our salvation. Let us work with the utmost determination to eschew our negative aspects and achieve our renaissance. This is a selfless call that I address for the sake of God and the interest of my nation. I hope my brothers will heed this call. All I want is to create reform. God grants success. May God's peace and blessings be upon you. [applause]
