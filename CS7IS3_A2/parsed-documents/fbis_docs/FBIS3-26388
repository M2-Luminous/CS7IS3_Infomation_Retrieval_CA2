According to reports from Ouagadougou, Li Yongqian, Chinese ambassador to Burkina Faso, made serious representations with the Government of Burkina Faso yesterday. He solemnly stated that as the Government of Burkina Faso had "restored" the so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan authorities, the Chinese Government lodged a strong protest with the Government of Burkina Faso and declared the suspension of China's diplomatic ties with Burkina Faso. Li pointed out that by doing so, the Burkina Faso Government had gone back on its solemn commitment contained in the communique of September 15, 1973 on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Burkina Faso that it recognized the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government representing the entire Chinese people, seriously undermining the existing friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries and the friendship between the two peoples. He announced that the Government of the People's Republic of China decided, therefore, to suspend its diplomatic relations with Burkina Faso as of that day.
