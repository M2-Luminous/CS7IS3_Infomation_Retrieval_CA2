They have held a rally demanding that a precise date be set for a referendum on the future of construction work on the Kostroma AES [nuclear electric power station]. A year ago local opponents of the construction near the city of Buy collected the number of signatures needed to demand a referendum in the oblast. But the leaders of the government ignored it and they are today pretending that "nothing of the kind is happening." That is understandable since the local authorities are pininng their hopes of major financial injections in the oblast's economy on the construction work. At any rate that is what the Ministry of Atomic Energy has promised. But the oblast environmental movement "Life" has no intention of backing down, and Oblast Governor Valeriy Arbuzov will evidently have to go to court in the near future as defendant in a case brought by the "Greens," who are charging him with opposing the holding of a referendum.
