Most different opinions are expressed on this development in various quarters, including legislators. Examining favourable arguments, the newspaper notes that any new elections will whip up a powerful wave of political struggle. The interests of the economy, production and the social sphere will again fall victim of politicis. Besides, new positive elements have appeared now: The public accord treaty was signed, and it was possible to stabilise inflationary processes. The president issued several important economic decrees and announced emergency measures to fight organised crime. All these raise confidence in authorities. The newspaper also quotes arguments "against": the very idea of extending legislators' powers needs amendments to the constitution, and this is possible only through a new nation-wide referendum during which passions will fly high. "It is impossible to deny that the very idea of Eurasia symbolises that the nations of today's so-called post-Soviet space have common destinies," chairman of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord Sergey Shakhray says in an interview with the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper today. "It is possible that public opinion will adopt another integration ideology. This is a question open for discussion. However, it is clear now that the Eurasian idea, as it was the case in the past, again became a banner of a very difficult `transition' period. This idea reminds, for the umpteenth time, our peoples of `their will for a common cause' awakening at the most difficult times of history. The same newspaper features an article by Aleksey Arbatov, D.Sc. (history), who writes: "The top priority of the Russian foreign policy is to promote independence and stability of new neighbouring states as well as the development of good relations with them on an individual basis. "If this is too expensive, we should invite to such a strategy other foreign countries in the framework of a new broad system of multilateral cooperation and security." The TRUD newspaper pays attention to economic problems. "the Russian economy has set a record," the newspaper writes. "However, we do not hear loud commentaries, let alone fanfares. "The record, as it is, is very significant: Russia reached the lowest level of inflation in may for the first time in two and a half years of reforms -- 6.9 per cent. It is the lowest in the past 30 months since november of the pre-reform year of 1991. "But the government is in no hurry to receive congratulations. Firstly, there is no confidence that prices will not start rise again in July. Secondly, and this is the main thing, the drop in inflation was achieved by an exorbitant price: Industrial production continues to fall, and this nation-wide fall is assuming more disquieting and dangerous nature." Commenting on the president's decree on urgent measures to protect population from banditry and other manifestations of organised crime, the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA notes: "The president's decree means nothing but emergency measures: Bandit groups appeared not recently, while the criminal code written long ago has article 77 entitled `banditry' providing for most strict punishment. However, nothing is heard about cases under this article, let alone court sentences...". The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper carries an interview with former Ukrainian Premier Leonid Kuchma touching on the problem of the Crimea. "Many try to show the Crimea's desire for independence as a result of the activities of pro-Russian political forces in the region," he writes. "Sure, there are such forces. But it would be inadmissible simplification to limit this problem only to these activities. "The general and presidential elections in the Crimea showed that the majority of population supports the present policy of the Crimean leadership and its desire for independent solution of problems. "I'm deeply convinced that tension around the peninsula is linked with the general crisis in Ukraine. We should frankly and with criticism point to two main factors estranging the Crimea from Ukraine. "The first is self-destruction of the Ukrainian economy. The second factor is politics. If we do not switch to regional bilingual practice and do not stop national-radicalisation of historical science, arts and public education, we shall witness conflicts in other Ukrainian regions as well." The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper features an interview with Colonel- General Valeriy Patrikeyev, commander of the Collective Peace- Keeping Force (CPKF) in Tajikistan. "Despite the emerging stabilisation of the situation in Tajikistan, I warn anybody that this will not prompt the CPKF to decrease its vigilance and combat preparedness. I assure all interested sides: This will not take place." The last stage of building the Argus platform began under the Russian programme "Mars-1996". The SANKT PETERBURGSKIE VEDOMOSTI newspaper reports that its development involves the all-Russian transport engineering institute, the author of many modifications of planet buggies. The platform will start operating when a station is put into an orbit of the Mars. The Argus is to direct equipment on definite points of the planet's surface, ensuring precise transmission of information. The ROSSIYSKIE VESTI claims that chemist Tamara Svishcheva carried out sensational experiments at Russian institutes. They corroborated a parasitic theory of cancer's origin, which was developed by Professor M. Nevedomsky and which was defeated in the 1960s. Its essence is that the formidable ailment is caused by one-cell parasites. It is they and not human cells that start avalanche multiplication in a weakened organism.
