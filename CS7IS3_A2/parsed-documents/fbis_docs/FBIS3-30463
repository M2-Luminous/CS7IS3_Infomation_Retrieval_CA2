Forty percent either knew nothing or had no opinion on the issue. Fifty five percent of the polled argued that Poland's bid for NATO is now the best policy for guaranteeing the country's security, and according to twenty two percent of the respondents, it would be best not to join any military alliances and become neutral. Only seven percent claimed that the best solution would be to seek a military alliance with other states. Almost half (48 percent) of the CBOS respondents believed there is no threat to Poland's independence, while thirty five percent stated the opposite. Fifty five percent claim that Russia had objected to Poland and other former "socialist block's" efforts to become a NATO member because it sought to regain influence over the states, one fourth of the polled thought Russia feared that her own security will be jeopardized, while every fifth person had no opinion on the subject. The survey was conducted on a representative sample of 1,226 adult Poles on January 14-17.
