Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations to determine whether imports of pipe fittings from France, India, Israel, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand (manufacturer: AST), the United Kingdom, and Venezuela are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value. ITC Notification Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the International Trade Commission (ITC) of this action and we have done so. Preliminary Determination by the ITC The ITC will determine by April 14, 1994, pursuant to section 733(a)(1) of the Act, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of pipe fittings from France, India, Israel, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand (manufacturer: AST), the United Kingdom, and Venezuela are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Pursuant to section 733(a)(2) of the Act, a negative ITC determination will result in the respective investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigations will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b). Dated: March 21, 1994. Paul L. Joffe, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
