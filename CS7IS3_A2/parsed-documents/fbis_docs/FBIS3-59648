It is one of the two steam generators that will replace those in the Kyushu Electric Power Co.'s Genkai nuclear power plant (Shige Ono, company president), the construction work for which is to start in May 1994. Mitsubishi Heavy Industry entered into the final stage of the production of the steam generator at its Kobe shipyard. This steam generator, called the "52F model," is the newest type of steam generator. It is 21 meters high and is made of an alloy of nickel, chrome, and iron. The ratio of chrome is higher than in conventional types of steam generators, so it will resist corrosion better. In addition, the steam generator has three fittings, instead of the usual two, to hold down the vibration of the 3,000 and some heat-exchange pipes that shake because of the energy when steam and water rise in the generator, and the materials of the fittings were changed to increase safety. The steam generator of the Genkai No. 1 plant will be replaced this time because damage in the heat-exchange pipes continues to occur. A training center was set up in the Kobe shipyard in April so that the steam generator replacement work will be done safely. Although most of the actual work will be done outside by remote operation, the replacement of the steam generator is being rehearsed over and over because the steam generator replacement work that will start in December, 1993, at the Kansai Electric Power Co.'s Mihama No. 1 plant will be the first such replacement in Japan.
