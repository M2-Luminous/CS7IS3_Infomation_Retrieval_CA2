At the forefront of these topics is the issue of sending envoys to Washington to examine a number of matters, particularly the need to guarantee international protection for the Palestinian people, as well as the need to take effective measures to disarm the settlers, to remove a number of settlements which have been hotbeds of tension, and criminal activities against the Palestinian people. These are necessary prerequisites before the resumption of the peace process, which came into being in order to provide security for the Palestinian people and the rest of the region's peoples. However, such security has been violated by armed gangs of settlers. Moreover, the measures which were taken yesterday by the Israeli Government do not constitute a practical step but merely an exercise to cover up the crime. For this reason, curbing the activities of settlers and the building of settlements in general, and the provision of international protection are fundamental requirements for the negotiations to take their natural course. Conversely, we have also been trying to table these issues before the UN Security Council; we are hoping that a resolution, which would guarantee international protection and the disarmament of settlers, will be adopted in an effort by the international community to help us to continue the peace process to its final conclusion.
