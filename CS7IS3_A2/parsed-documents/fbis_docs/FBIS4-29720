"Parties have turned from confrontation to cooperation, politically and militarily, in the months of the coalition government. This is the biggest favourable point in the last 20 years," Hun Sen told Inside Indochina. The interview took place before Interior Minister Yu Hokkri ordered the closure of the Khmer Rouge [KR] office in Phnom Penh, citing the failure of peace talks. Hun Sen denies that dialogue is superficial. He acknowledges there are disputes at lower levels of Phnom Penh's administration, but says they are not necessarily political disagreements between the main coalition partners of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia] and the Cambodian People's Party [CPP]. "Cooperation between Prince Ranariddh and me is good. We seem to be coming from one party," said the CPP's top man in government. "I do not mean all our officials have such good cooperation but differences between officials do not require many parties. I used to lead a government with one party and used to experience differences between provincial governors and deputy governors or ministers and deputy ministers who come from only one party." Hun Sen made clear that he believes the country's main problem is the Khmer Rouge rather than coalition politics. "I am fed up with this matter (of outlawing the guerrillas) because in such a state of hesitancy it's difficult for me to work," said Hun Sen repeating his wish to outlaw the Khmer Rouge during the next session of Cambodia's parliament. Cambodia's "second problem" is economic development although the stable Cambodian currency, the riel, in recent months shows people's increased confidence in the government's economic measures, according to Hun Sen. However, Phnom Penh officials say the Cambodian premier has much less confidence in the country's finance minister, Sam Rangsi. Officials say Hun Sen has spoken of Rangsi's trying to set up Western economic systems too quickly for Cambodia, despite the fact the finance ministry has support from world financial bodies including loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). "The third problem relates to restructuring our administration. Cambodia's civil and military administration are combined from three factions. That's why the number of civilian and military (personnel) today is more than our finance can support. "Before the same source of income was used to feed the people of the State of Cambodia (the pre-election government) but now the same source has to feed other people from other factions," Hun Sen said, explaining the chronic overstaffing of government offices. But last year's election results and the resulting coalition government with three main parties and their extra personnel is only a partial explanation for the government's overstaffing, according to independent experts. "This holds true to a large extent on the military and police sides with the merging of the FUNCINPEC and BLDP [Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party] forces with those of the pre-election government, but the civil administration was already way overmanned," a Phnom Penh-based diplomat said. More than two years ago a World Bank study noted: "The size of the administration is larger than public management norms recommend and creates problems of duplication and its root cause of overstaffing." Regular Cambodian government troops are estimated at 160,000 with a similar number of civil servants. These are figures which some experts say are around 10 times and twice as much, respectively, as appropriate for cash-strapped Cambodia. Independent explanations for such chronic overmanning focus on reasons of political patronage and corruption but, whatever the cause, Hun Sen admits such overmanning breeds inefficiency and corruption which in turn deters potential investors. "We have to do our best so investors can be confident, to secure stability for investment and put in practice the new code of investment, decrease tax and to cut short the paperwork. We have to get ride of corruption," Hun Sen said. His ideal is that foreign investment will create jobs and attract people from the state sector. This will allow better pay for the remaining government employees, reducing corruption. Numerous Cambodian businessmen and officials, as well as expatriates, have stressed the importance of dialogue among Cambodia's coalition leaders. Despite encouraging words from some officials the reality is bleak. A more worrying aspect is the image of apparent government impotence or at worst a lack of interest in the face of the overstaffed, inefficient state apparatus. "The danger of not tackling these issues is that you give the impression there is no political will or that people don't recognise the problems. That sends a very bad signal not only to the international community -- private sector and donor -- but also to the population," said an experienced international aid official working in Cambodia. As Hun Sen said: "Right or wrong is one thing but the important thing is to correct our mistakes."
