Dirandro has also seized valuable chemicals, war materiel, laboratories, houses, and communications equipment. To October 1993 the Dirandro has carried out 3,358 operations and arrested 4,353 persons. Dirandro agents who are active in the daily fight against trafficking say the breaking up of drug organizations throughout the country is the result of intelligence operations. Dirandro considers the Huallaga area to be important because it is one of the main regions where cocaine is produced. Dirandro agents say that the various police departments in the area cooperate closely in the capture of traffickers and use special intelligence equipment. Dirandro agents also operate in the Maranon, Tambo, Ene, Tambopata, and Aguaytia coca basins. Operations have been intensified to locate the production centers that harm the country in Caballococha and in the Amazon Trapezium. Peruvian Air Force planes control the airspace, complementing the land and river actions carried out by the other organizations. Dirandro is acting against the retail sale of drugs and the control of chemicals in urban areas. In accordance with Decree No. 25023, the police organizations implement the rules and regulations regarding chemicals and drugs and determine the control operations.
