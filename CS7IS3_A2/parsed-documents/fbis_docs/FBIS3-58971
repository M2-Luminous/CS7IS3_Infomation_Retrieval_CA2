Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, who during his follow-up address noted wide acceptance of the government's positions, accepted [Political Spring Chairman] Andonios Samaras' proposal to convene the Council of Political Leaders under the chairmanship of President Konstandinos Karamanlis as soon as conditions are right. Papandreou said that the resumption of a dialogue on the Skopje issue under the auspices of the United Nations depends on whether Skopje abolishes all offensive demands and decides not to choose a name that contains the word Macedonia or its derivatives. The prime minister was firm on the name issue and called on the European countries to stand by Greece, not for solidarity reasons but to maintain stability in the area. The differences raised by New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert regarding the government's foreign policy were minimal. In reality, Evert expressed faith in the government's positions. He warned that a possible dissolution of Skopje would be dangerous. Evert asked for the establishment of a permanent council on foreign policy, which would meet weekly. On the contrary, Political Spring Chairman Samaras strongly attacked the government and official opposition [New Democracy is the second-largest party in the Chamber of Deputies]. Samaras mainly criticized [former Prime Minister] Konstandinos Mitsotakis and the other political leaders for hypocrisy, inconsistency, and mithridatism [as heard]. He repeated his proposal for convening the Council of Political Leaders, which was accepted by the prime minister, and asked the Chamber of Deputies to adopt a resolution on the name issue, which will be send to the parliaments of European countries. The positions of Aleka Papariga, KKE [Greek Communist Party] general secretary, were radically different. The KKE general secretary proposed a dialogue with Skopje without raising the name issue. She said that, if during the dialogue Greek demands are not satisfied, the issue should be dealt with then. Former Prime Minister Mitsotakis also intervened in the discussion and criticized Samaras, calling him young and weak. Mitsotakis called on the government to return to a dialogue under the United Nations and not to bilateral talks. He described the direct dialogue with Skopje as a mistake and indirectly but clearly favored a composite name [that would contain the term Macedonia but not by itself]. [passage omitted]
