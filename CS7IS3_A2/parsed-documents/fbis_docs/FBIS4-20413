Since the mid-1980s to the present, opinions on this have varied in an ever more confusing trend. While the current "Resolution" ["CPC Central Committee Resolution on Certain Issues Involved in Establishing a Socialist Market Economy"] explains the rules for a modern enterprise system, laying down the civil obligations of a company's overall corporate assets, which is a crucial breakthrough in reform theory and policy, each has his own formula as to what actually constitutes a corporate-assets system. So while we have made a great breakthrough, to a modern enterprise system, we need to clarify fully what this actually means. In brief, a modern enterprise system is a modern corporate system, which involves two essentials: 1) It is a corporate system, established on the grounds of a corporate-assets system. A corporation [legal person] is a legal concept in contrast to a natural [ziran ren] person, with a corporation being not a person, but rather an organization. Such an organization is an independent legal subject, with the same rights and obligations as a natural person, having the same civil rights and liabilities, and the ability to sign contracts and bring and respond to lawsuits. 2) It is operated and managed by a corporate-administered structure (in the West called administration, or control and management). The functions of controlling and managing an enterprise can be undertaken only by a natural person with awareness and will, while a corporation is an abstract concept without awareness and will, which can be administered only by a natural person governed by an organizational structure. This organizational-structure system is called by Western economists a corporate administrative structure. This structure is composed of the three parts of shareholder meetings, a board of directors, and an executive body (generally an executive committee of executive officers headed by the president [general manager]). Shareholder meetings entrust assets to the board of directors, which operates them through management personnel. This is the so-called "tripartite" system. Executive personnel are restricted by the board of directors, which exercises supreme decisionmaking power, as well as being restricted by shareholder meetings, which are the corporation's supreme organ of power. These two points are the most crucial features of a modern corporate system. [passage omitted] [15 Feb pp 14-16] [Excerpts] In light of our experimental shareholding-system experience over the past decade, the establishment in China of a modern enterprise system, or a modern corporate system, has encountered several difficult problems. 1) The first difficult problem is the difficulty involved in property-rights demarcation. Changing our former system of nationalization to unify the whole country to a corporate-assets system involves ideological and technical difficulties, as well as the real difficulty of changing while considering vested interests. 2) The second difficulty is that involved in the process of establishing a corporate administrative structure. If we do not dovetail well our current cadre structure with a corporate administrative structure for companies, things will remain as before, making it impossible to establish relations of respective obligations and rights with mutual restrictions among shareholder meetings, boards of directors, and general managers. I once went to a foreign trade company, where I was told that cadres above the department level all needed higher-level authorization. This is not the case in a corporate administrative structure. 3) The third difficulty is how to deal with the historical-burden issues that have been unresolved for so long. Our historical burdens are mainly three: A) The loan problem, with execssive-debt operations unable to repay debts owed to banks. Debt burdens from previous contract periods are carried over and hung onto following contract periods, accumulating to the point where they are hard to resolve. B) Another is the social security matter, with social security actually being a type of savings. In our past big-pot system, social security costs were turned over to state revenue through profits and taxes, then converted to state capital for reinvestment, to form certain new factories. It should be pointed out that as part of current state-enterprise assets were established on the grounds of state liability to elderly employees, they should be returned to their ownership in a suitable form. Enterprises now conducting assets appraisals have not considered this part. So once social security is socialized and foundationed, former employees will not receive social security payments, which the state will be unable to assume either. C) In addition, there is the issue of an enterprise-run society. So we need to find ways to solve these problems. The first problem is how to establish a public-ownership-dominated corporate-assets system. 1. How are former state assets to be converted to state-share property, and what agency will represent this share property? The State Council representation as stated in the "Resolution" is too abstract, and we will eventually need a very specific agency as executor. The poor resolution of this matter shows up as our corporate-system transformation not having "bosses" to take charge, leaving the "working" plant managers and factory directors in charge, which is called "role reversal." 2) Current state assets are generally all undervalued due to existing problems in our current assets-appraisal theory, such as some being assessed at original value, others at net value, and inaccuracies in fact even when assessed at replacement value. An enterprise's asset value should be based on its profitmaking capability. This, of course, involves certain difficulties, as our lack of a capital market makes evaluation hard. We do not have enough professional agencies to do this work, with these agencies subject to existing problems in assets-organization form. U.S. law stipulates that legal and accounting agencies may not run companies, at most being allowed to form partnerships, to have unlimited liability. While lawyers and accountants earn much money, once they make a mistake, they can lose a family fortune in paying for it. I hold that our State Administration of State Property should assume a function similar to the German Trusteeship Office, acting as the representative of former owners, with all unconverted-system assets belonging to it, and it being in charge of the system conversion from state ownership to a modern corporate system. The system conversion could be done in a simple or complex way. The simple way would be after evaluation, to transfer state share rights to certain newly established, mutually competitive state holding companies. The complex way would be through auctioning, with the former bosses' representative (the trusteeship office) selling their share rights to other parties (holding companies). The money would all be transferred within national limits, with the purchasing money being provided by the state, and the sale money also having to be turned over to the state. The competitive process would make assets appraisals more accurate, bringing share prices nearer to real prices. This would differ from that in East Europe and the CIS, where the auctioning was to individuals, using instead a public-to-public approach, with this public being new property owners, such as holding and investment companies. While the "money" used in the auctioning process could also be separated from the existing monetary system, using stock-rights certificates as in East European countries, the stock-rights certificates would be issued not to individuals, but rather to newly established companies. This is all about how to deal with the state-property problem in the incorporation, system-conversion process, or to resolve the matter of the part combined between the government as the public-ownership representative and enterprises. In which case, how to deal with the issue of debt-formed enterprise assets is actually also one of dealing simultaneously with overevaluation. All who have learned double-entry bookkeeping tenets know that assets = liabilities + capital, or assets - debts = net assets = capital. This takes care of the state-share part. But another problem is that it includes debt, some of which needs turned into stock rights, with bank debt becoming stock rights. So when evaluating assets, while it may seem that the evaluated assets equal overall capital, this is not so. The money previously paid by former employees has turned in government hands into enterprise assets. So if this debt is not separated out in the current assets appraisals, where will these former employees go to get their money in the future? And who will be able to assume this debt? So while this part of state liability to former employees will certainly have to be separated out from assets in the incorporation process, who will it be separated out to? It will be given to foundations, with both stock rights and liabilities being given to foundations and stock rights being salable and purchasable, as they are a part of funds anyhow. In addition, the current situaton of industrial and commercial enterprises being generally short of registered capital, so dependant on bank loans to get by, also needs resolved. This needs to be dealt with by the former owners' representative (as suggested above, the trusteeship sector--the State Administration of State Property). I hold that three methods based on respective circumstances can be used to deal with it: some assets have absolutely no impact, so should be appraised and sold. The remaining debt-formed assets could be dealt with in two ways: some could be maintained as bank debt; some bank creditor rights could be turned into bank stock rights, to become bank holdings. This would involve mainly whether banks chose the British-U.S. system or the German-Japanese one. While banks cannot hold stocks in the British-U.S. system, they all can in the German-Japanese one, with Japanese banks being the most important shareholder, called the host bank. While we currently do not allow banks to hold stocks, which is clearly stipulated in the current tightening of macroeconomic control, we need to decide which system we will finally choose. The current general trend in the U.S. is that not allowing bank shareholding is wrong. Of course, bank shareholding has its own problem, that if the holding capital funds are not separated out from bank credit capital funds, they may affect bank assets quality. So while allowing banks to hold stocks, bank working capital--loan capital funds, need separated from holding capital funds. Once we accomplish the abovementioned two reforms to make stock rights of creditor rights, many new forms of public ownership will appear. 1) All types of social security funds. While their ultimate owners, beneficiaries, will be individuals, these individuals will be not decentralized, but rather joined together. Should such funds jointly established by many individuals be called public or private ownership? They are of course public ownership. The amount of such funds in a modern society is extremely large in scale. Shares held by U.S. pension and common funds make up over one-half of the capital of large corporations. 2) Bank shareholdings. Bank shareholding is the same in nature as mutual shareholding by other enterprises, in that if the bank itself has mostly public shares, its nature per se is the public economy. So after reform, the public form will no longer be the same, being mainly not public ownership, but rather publicly organized shareholding within definite limits by diverse representatives of all types. A current view in academic circles is that corporate shareholding cannot solve the problem, as using one's own money differs from using others' money, so that it is only the division to the individual that makes shareholders pay attention to capital operations. I hold that this view is too simplistic. In the development of all countries throughout the world to the present, in no country has natural-person shareholding become dominant. Of the major countries with market economies, pension and common funds dominate in the United States and Britain, accounting for 60 percent, while other corporate shareholding dominates in Japan and Germany, in which banks play a great role. In Japan, over 70 percent of major corporate stocks are controlled by other companies. When in Tokyo, Geoffrey Sachs, a Harvard University privatization advisor to East Europe and the CIS, responded to questions in this area. He said that turning all large corporations into individual shareholdings is certainly not the ultimate aim of or ideal model for reform. But to break the state monopoly on property rights, the best method is to divide up the cards. Any division method can be used to cut the Gordian knot. Once divided, markets will naturally help to form a good structure. Decentralization from state monopoly to shareholding by every natural person is a transition, in which stock rights will be gradually pooled. I hold that if we can move directly from our current state to a corrporate system in which corporate shareholding dominates, supplemented by individual shareholding, this will minimize the social impact, not necessarily going through the individual transition. If a particular method is most efficient, more suited to our social ideals, and more publicly sustainable, what could be wrong with it? Of course, if we do not have the skills or are ineffective at making a smooth conversion from public ownership to corporate shareholding companies, economic development laws will force us to the detour of first dividing up public assets to individual pockets. This is because the establishment of a modern enterprise system is not subject to shifts of will, to operate in a conscious or guided way, but rather occurs spontaneously. In fact, state assets are now being converted every day, with many being shifted to individual pockets. Of course, we cannot say that the disintegration of the former public ownership to unify the whole country is necessarily a bad thing. "Erosion" is not judgmental, occurring in each case according to respective laws. But I am very concerned that the current erosion might cause social problems. This is because increasing numbers of people, particularly grass-roots comrades, perceive that public assets are flowing to those with power and influence, while they are becoming a so-called "nouveau-pauve class." A comrade who works in a central research institute tells me that if this goes on, three to five years will bring a tiny group of rich millionaires along with hundreds of millions of paupers. While this may be overdoing it a bit, we need to note that a large gap betwen rich and poor can touch off social and political problems. If property and stock rights are not clearly delimited, corporate assets are not established, and these problems are not resolved, we will remain all eating out of the one big pot, with our management personnel not subject to the ultimate restraint of the owners, and a modern enterprise system impossible to establish. Even if we establish corporations, it will be impossible to operate them very well. As stated above, property-rights restraint is the ultimate restraint, without which things do not work, and even good management personnel turn bad in just a few days. [passage omitted] The second incorporation difficulty is the conflict between our current personnel appointment and dismissal system and the establishment principles for a corporate administrative structure. The international standard for corporate organization is that the owners (shareholders) transfer assets to the trusteeship of the board of directors, which represents the shareholders in managing assets. While the board of directors has full decisionmaking power from general policies and principles to executive personnel, such as presidents, when there is dereliction of duty or betrayal of trust, any shareholder can take action against the board of directors. Boards of directors appoint chief executive officers [CEOs], including presidents and vice presidents, with it being alright at times for board chairmen to serve as presidents. While boards of directors in the United States generally meet once a month, they meet less often in Europe. The chief duties of boards of directors are to formulate general policies and principles and oversee CEOs, such as presidents. While these executive officers have obligations and rights, deciding everything from investment to production, they are also subject to strict restraints, basically in three areas: 1) product-market competitive restraints; 2) capital-market competitive restraints (the most recent studies have come to the conclusion that share price changes have little restraining impact, while takeovers and buyouts have slightly more); 3) the established most effective restraint is the management-market competitive restraint. Regretably, this is a market that we have not established. Should we choose managers from the management market or appoint them from the organizational or personnel sectors? I hold that as a corporation is not a government organization, but rather an enterprise, management personnel appointments should firmly follow international standards for the corporate system. A current concern is that without control, there will be no future political control, which is not necessarily so. For instance, in Singapore, while the ruling party controls the government very well, senior responsible appointments in large corporations are completely according to international practice, with government control of boards of directors. But to strengthen appointment of directors for all-government-funded corporations, the government has a bureau-level director-appointment commission, chaired by the finance minister, and whose first member is Deputy Prime Minister Li Hsien Loong. Appointments of subordinate-company directors is left to shareholding corporation boards of directors, with certainly no signs that this method weakens ruling-party leadership. Strengthening party leadership, by adhering to the people's democratic dictatorship, and separating the party, the government, and enterprises, are two principles adhered to by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. This matter needs discussion by all. In addition, making stock rights out of creditor rights discharges certain burdens, while creating new forms of public ownership. This merits much attention. If the socialist system is to stand, it must recreate its property-rights system, so that it conforms to the property-rights socialization principle, while not being hampered by traditional public-ownership concepts. As how to establish a modern enterprise system grounded in the dominance of public ownership is a theoretical and policy matter of fundamental significance, it needs joint study by all.
