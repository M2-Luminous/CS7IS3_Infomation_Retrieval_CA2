FBIS4-68883 "jpusr056___94003" FBIS-USR-94-056 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 11 May 1994 INTERSTATE AFFAIRS CIS Committee Chairman Interviewed on `Near Abroad' States CIS Committee Chairman Interviewed on `Near Abroad' States Zatulin Denounces Correspondent's Version of Interview 944Q0365B Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 11 May 94 p 2 944Q0365B Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Letter to the editor from Zatulin: "I am not Bismarck, but..."] It is said that the average Frenchwoman can make three things out of any material on hand: a hat, an umbrella, and a tragedy. It was with interest that I acquainted myself with the attempt by Igor Rotar to present my views on the near abroad ("Become Our Satellites or Perish" in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 5 May of this year). It seems to me that this is a contemporary variant of how with the aid of uncomplicated tricks, misrepresentation, double entente, and rearrangement of words coming from me, direct speech under the heading of "Revelations" is transformed by a foreign correspondent into a tragedy or an Ems dispatch. At one time in editing an innocent text of a dispatch Bismarck precipitated the Franco-Prussian War. Naturally I cannot claim to be Bismarck or someone as important as he, but I categorically object against the situation where I. Rotar, acting as a guide and interpreter for his Japanese colleague at the meeting some month-and-a-half ago, now becomes wise at my expense, juggling the text which I have never seen. Such an interest manifests itself particularly in the way in which the question regarding Tajikistan is posed and the manner in which the correspondent patiently coaches "my" reply, sharing wisdom and truth. But unfortunately he cannot get an intelligent answer from his slow-witted interlocutor as to which is better: have one's head torn off or go on vacation. On the eve of Victory Day it is worth noting the fact that the word satellite in the newest Russian philology has a pejorative connotation which the word ally does not have at all and the author undoubtedly must know that. I leave "my revelations" of the type: "A small country must be happy that it is within the sphere of influence of a big power," as well as the abundance of military field terminology (such as "winning", "dying," etc.) on his conscience." I think that Russia, just as the USA and the entire world community, is not indifferent to the observance of the rights of an individual and not only a Russian one and not just in the YuAR [Republic of South Africa] but in the CIS as well. The topics touched upon in this piece constitute material for a long article and not a brief comment. I will limit myself to the observation that CIS countries are not bowling pins and Russian journalists, in the intervals between representation of foreign professional interests, should not attempt to place all of those in the Duma in moulds of Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy], even if they have been stored up for use in future articles. Respectfully, Signed Konstantin Zatulin, 6 May 1994 [From NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Editor] We are publishing the letter from Mr. Zatulin, but because of the conflicting situation that developed the editorial office will now be forced to carefully compare the text of the taped interview with what was published in the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA and then return to this topic. The editorial office, however, is certain that Mr. Rotar does not speak either Japanese or English and therefore could not have been "an interpreter for a Japanese colleague" as asserted by Mr. Zatulin. Nevertheless the editorial office is also entertaining those premises of Mr. Zatulin which are illegitimate.
