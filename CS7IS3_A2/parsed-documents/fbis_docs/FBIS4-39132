The Russian Government was advised to step up efforts to create a free trade area and customs and payments unions in the CIS. Federation Council members said that industrial decline throughout the CIS was due largely to the break up of economic links. The CIS Statistics Committee said that overall economic decline in the Commonwealth was characterized by a reduction of the gross domestic product on the whole in the CIS by 26% over the past two years, including by 30% in industry and 11% in agriculture. The Statistics Committee said that industrial output had gone down by 10-18% in Ukraine, Belarus and Turkmenistan since 1991, 24-31% in Russia, Moldova, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan and 39-60% in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Georgia. Sergey Glazyev, who is chairman of the State Duma (lower chamber of parliament) Committee for Economic Policy, told the Federation Council that the Free Trade Agreement signed on 15 April this year must be put into effect, all the more so because of its benefit for Russia. The CIS market accounted for one fifth of Russia's foreign market and it was in the former USSR states that Russian goods were most competitive, he said.
