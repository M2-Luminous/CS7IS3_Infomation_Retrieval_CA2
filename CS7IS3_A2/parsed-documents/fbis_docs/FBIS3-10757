The PNC will be in charge of La Union, Morazan, San Miguel, Usulutan, San Vicente, and Chalatenango Departments and their corresponding municipalities. The PN will be in charge of San Salvador, La Libertad -- excluding the seat that will be under the PNC -- Santa Ana, Sonsonate, and Ahuachapan Departments and their corresponding municipalities. Security will focus on the individuals responsible for handling and transporting electoral material, which will be done via private trucks. Magistrate Eduardo Colindres explained that the Electoral Tribunal has solicited bids so the most appropriate company in terms of cost and security considerations can be chosen to provide the service. The PNC, not the Army, will provide security for the transportation of electoral material. Colindres said: "The Electoral Code indicates that the PNC will be responsible for security. We have therefore reached an agreement with them to do so." Unlike previous elections, the 20 March elections will take place from 0700 to 1700 in both urban and rural areas. On election day, police officers will maintain a discreet distance from the voting place, never standing near voting tables or areas where voters could be moving about, Colindres explained. In addition, the Electoral Tribunal will have at its disposal several helicopters that will transport personnel and original tally sheets from limited access areas to San Salvador. The heliport will be set up in a parking lot in front of the Presidente Hotel, the cite of the election control center. The aircraft crew will carry out only this mission. In other words, documents will be handled only by Tribunal personnel, international observers, and party delegates, if necessary. There is no risk. The aircraft will have enough fuel for a nonstop flight, so en route technical stopovers will be unnecessary. In addition to security at the Department seats, the PNC and the PN will provide security for the 262 municipalities in the national territory and on the routes where electoral material could be transported or where personnel could pass with electoral material. The PNC and PN rank and will be linked through communications radios so their chief can learn of any incidents anywhere in the country. The two institutions will be supplied with vehicles and radios with a range wide enough to cover the entire country. Although it has not been officially decided, it is possible that a specific number of soldiers could be deployed on some roads as a deterrent in case of an emergency. As of yesterday, meetings were still being held to discuss the security plan. In La Libertad Department, the PNV will provide security for the (Nueva San Salvador or Santa Tecla) seat, while the PN will be responsible for the municipalities and the road to the seat. There are some places labeled former conflict areas where FMLN groups are known to have their rank and file organized. One example is the Perquin road to Sabaneras, where an "entrance" is controlled by FMLN groups that restrict passage. It is said that this place has difficult access. The PNC will also be in these places, consulted sources said. Regarding statements by some groups organized by political parties that they are "security for the votes," the consulted sources said there is no danger as each party is responsible for the actions of each of its members.
