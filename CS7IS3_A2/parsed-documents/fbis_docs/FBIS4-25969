People pay special attention to the preferential policy intended for enterprises of the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone. Vice Mayor Zhao Qizheng, who just came back from the national bonded zone work forum held in Tianjin recently, brought home the latest news: We should manage bonded zones according to international norms. We should regard bonded zones as the linking points between or the integration of international and domestic markets and guide bonded zones enterprises toward the large international market. Zhao Qizheng pointed out: Based on the national bonded zone work forum guidelines, the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone will soon make its new regulations public to help the bonded zone play a more effective role.
