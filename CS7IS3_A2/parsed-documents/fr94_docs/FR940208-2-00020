FR940208-2-00020 FR940208-2-00015 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;120&hyph;000] Koch Gateway Pipeline Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff February 2, 1994. Take notice that on January 31, 1994, Koch Gateway Pipeline Company (Koch Gateway) tendered for filing proposed changes to its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1. Koch Gateway states that this filing proposes changes to the rates for Koch Gateway's existing transportation services. This filing is being made in accordance with Section V(B) of the Joint Stipulation and Agreement entered into between the parties in Docket No. RP92&hyph;235 (62 FERC 61,290 (1993). The tariff is being revised to make those changes which are necessary to conform this tariff to meet the operational needs of both the customers and Koch Gateway. Koch Gateway proposes an effective date of March 1, 1994, for the applicable tariff sheets, anticipating that the Commission will exercise its authority under Section 4(e) of the NGA to suspend the effectiveness of the sheets for the full five month statutory period so the applicable sheets are allowed to be made effective August 1, 1994. Koch Gateway states that the rates reflected on the proposed tariff sheets are based on a cost of service of $195.7 million. This reflects the annual operating costs which Koch Gateway expects to incur utilizing a base period covering the twelve months ended September 30, 1993, adjusted for known and measurable changes anticipated to occur during the nine-month period ending June 30, 1994. Koch Gateway's is proposing an overall rate of return of 12.55 percent based on a capital structure consisting of 31.47 percent debt and 68.53 percent equity and a claimed return on equity of 13.05 percent. The overall cost of service represents a $8.5 million increase in the cost of service which formed the basis of the rates approved by the Commission in Docket No. RS92&hyph;26. In this filing, Koch Gateway proposes to use the same cost allocation methodology and rate design which the Commission approved in Docket No. RS92&hyph;26. This methodology includes the classification of fixed costs under the principles of Straight Fixed Variable (``SFV'') rate design methodology, the utilization of seasonal maximum daily quantities (``MDQ's'') for the No Notice Service (``NNS''), allocation of costs to the contract storage services, retainage of the six 100 mile rate types and designing ITS rates on a 125% load factor basis. Koch Gateway is also proposing several changes to its tariff as a result of experience gained the first few months of operations under Order No. 636. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a petition to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211. All such petitions or protests must be filed on or before February 9, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
