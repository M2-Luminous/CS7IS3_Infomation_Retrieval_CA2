The ambassador was accompanied by a delegation of senior European officers. Hambley publicly incited against resistance and said: We had the opportunity today to meet President al-Hirawi along with a special military delegation of European officers whose task is military training. I think the United States strongly believes that it is very important for Lebanon to have a strong army able to control all Lebanese territory. He added: President al-Hirawi is very concerned about developing the Army's military capability. Our contacts fall within this context and General (Porman) is with us. Commenting on the south, Hambley said: This issue is on our minds. It is important that we should not let these groups hamper the peace process by continuing attacks, especially those that inflame things in the south. We are now trying to concentrate actively on the peace talks in Washington and hope to work together to avert any complications. On his contacts yesterday with Prime Minister al-Hariri on a request from Secretary Christopher, Hambley said: Undoubtedly, our governments had intense contacts last night. We will continue these contacts. I do not wish to elaborate on these talks but our governments are trying to follow up the situation and make new moves through the Washington talks. Asked if the request to halt resistance in the south is now a United States' demand, rather than an Israeli one, he replied: This was a misconception of the U.S. message. I stress the call to halt violence and the need to pursue the talks, because they are the only solution. The U.S. ambassador and the European officers delegation met Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul. President al-Hirawi earlier received Army Commander General Emile Lahhud, who briefed him on reports coming into headquarters from the south. They also discussed issues concerning the military institution.
