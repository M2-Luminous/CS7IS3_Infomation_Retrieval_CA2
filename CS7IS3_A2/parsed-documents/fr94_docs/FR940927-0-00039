FR940927-0-00039 FR940927-0-00006 One commenter states that the AD should allow for incorporation of an engine heater/de-humidifier to be installed on low utilization engines when not in operation. This type of device would reduce the accumulation of moisture in the engine, which can cause disk corrosion. The FAA concurs in part and does not dispute that an engine heater/de-humidifier would probably reduce the moisture content in low utilization engines. This type of device, however, would need to be tested to produce data to quantify its effect on moisture and associated disk corrosion. Since this data has not been submitted to the FAA, it cannot be included in the AD. One commenter agreed with the rule as proposed. Since publication of the NPRM, the FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. This final rule AD references the latest revision of the ASB. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes that include elimination of the borescope inspection and associated tables, changes to the compliance intervals, elimination of the records search, addition of the optional eddy current probe inspection, addition of the adjustment for mixed utilization, and simplification of the utilization determination, are introduced in response to comments received to the NPRM. The format of the compliance section is revised to incorporate the above changes and to simplify the readability by eliminating duplication of compliance instructions that are now included in PW ASB 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. The FAA has determined that these changes do not increase the economic burden on any operator, however, the economic analysis has been recalculated to reflect the total scope of the compliance program. The FAA has also determined that the above changes do not compromise the safety impact of the compliance program and do not increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 11,119 PW JT8D&hyph;1, &hyph;1A, &hyph;1B, &hyph;7, &hyph;7A, &hyph;7B, &hyph;9, &hyph;9A, &hyph;11, &hyph;15, &hyph;15A, &hyph;17, &hyph;17A, &hyph;17R, and &hyph;17AR turbofan engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that approximately 6,815 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, and 2 work hours will be necessary to determine the utilization rate and type of surface treatment. Based on domestic fleet-wide data, the FAA estimates that approximately 8.7% or 593 engines are considered to have low utilization rates. Approximately 8.6 work hours will be required to remove these engines from the aircraft, 500 work hours to tear down, deblade, and to reassemble the engine, and 8.6 work hours to reinstall the reassembled engines. The FAA estimates 69% of the removed engines will require scrapping the disks. The FAA assumes that three disks per engine may require replacement, and the cost of a new disk is approximately $7,000. The average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, and a forecast 20-year compliance program, the annual cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,308,958. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air Transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [AMENDED] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;20&hyph;01 Pratt & Whitney: Amendment 39&hyph;9029. Docket 92&hyph;ANE&hyph;44. Applicability: Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D&hyph;1, &hyph;1A, &hyph;1B, &hyph;7, &hyph;7A, &hyph;7B, &hyph;9, &hyph;9A, &hyph;11, &hyph;15, &hyph;15A, &hyph;17, &hyph;17A, &hyph;17R, and &hyph;17AR turbofan engines installed on but not limited to Boeing 737 and 727 series, and McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 series aircraft. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent fracture of the high pressure compressor (HPC) disks, that can result in uncontained release of engine fragments, inflight engine shutdown, and airframe damage, accomplish the following: (a) Within four months after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), determine the fleet and sub-fleet average engine utilization rate for the 12 months of operations prior to August 17, 1994, the issue date of PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6038, Revision 5, in accordance with paragraph 2.A of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. (1) For fleet or sub-fleet average utilization rates that are equal to or greater than 1,300 hours per year, and equal to or greater than 900 cycles per year, perform the following: (i) For engines or disks that are added to a fleet or subfleet after the effective date of this AD, and that were previously designated as low utilization disks in accordance with this AD, comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this AD. (ii) Designate all other stage 7 through 12 HPC disks as high utilization disks and comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this AD.
