Though this prediction might seem a self-fulfilling prophecy, unless there are unforeseen factors, it would be a mistake to believe that relations with the United States are totally devoid of major question marks. In fewer than five years the big disagreements have disappeared, at least for the foreseeable future, after the Carlos Menem government explicitly decided to abandon successive policies (neutrality in international conflicts, nuclear and missile development, objections to the world's economic order, and so forth) -- policies upon which Argentina has historically built the various levels of its relative independence. Yet while the overestimated ghost of Condor-2, or the threat, which has never been quite serious, of a nuclear proliferating Argentina, or of a country in default with the international financial system, have faded in the strange post-cold war atmosphere, there are at least three areas in which the two countries can disagree. -- International trade is today the most sensitive area. Through its efforts to adjust its economy to the demands of capitalism, Argentina has become the country in the hemisphere that is most strongly committed to the neoliberal model. In order to make this bitter medicine easier to swallow, Argentina bet strongly on the still unfulfilled promises of having access to productive investment, and of a free and rational economic order with a minimum level of equitability. Based on Menem's interpretation of the international situation, the two phenomena should occur under the leadership of the United States, the only superpower that survived the old order after the collapse of the socialist alternative. The U.S. power, however, is concentrated in the military sector, while its economic power has been fragmented and has been transferred from the states to the corporations, which are ruled by the ideology of big, fast profits. Old certainties, like the ones provided by the Bretton Woods system, have disappeared. In a recently published article Godman Sachs International Vice President Robert Hormats said that the truth is that the industrialized countries have not yet made the strategic decision to incorporate the 3 billion inhabitants of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia into an authentically open global economy and an authentically open international financial system. The administration of Bill Clinton last year attached strategic priority to the commercial issue by implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico (NAFTA) and by signing the GATT accord. But after attaining both objectives the Clinton administration has remained on guard, lying in wait for conflict, threatening Japan with the legislation known as Super 301, which contains all the arbitrariness imaginable, as well as the political weapons for a hot commercial war. -- Also regarding the economy, the United States still has, with respect to Argentina and also to other countries of the region, additional demands concerning rules for the increasingly critical and intangible intellectual property market (in Argentina, this situation is now being reflected by the pharmaceutical patents law), and for corruption. The problem of corruption has worsened in modern democracies, because it is a feature that opposes the concept of justice in the sociopolitical system of competitive equality that the market should provide. The U.S. case itself is highly illustrative. Clinton, who adopted the fight against state corruption as an electoral campaign banner and also as a U.S. foreign policy priority, is today, along with his influential first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, under the public suspicion of illegal acquisition of political funds. Even though no specific charges have yet been pressed, the matter is being investigated by a special prosecutor, and will soon be investigated by Congress. At any rate, the Republican opposition seems to have proven -- beyond all reasonable doubt -- that Clinton engaged in maneuvering to cover up the scandal that has been christened Whitewater. -- The problem of drug trafficking and its criminal consequences, such as the laundering of money in the enriched Latin American financial markets, is another matter that has yet to be harmonized by the two countries.
