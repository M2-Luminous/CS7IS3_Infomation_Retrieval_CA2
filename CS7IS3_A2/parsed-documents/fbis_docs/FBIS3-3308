The meeting is to be held under an agreement reached in Seattle last November when leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) met for the first time. Deputy finance ministers met in Honolulu earlier this month to work out an agenda for this week's financial meeting, the first of its kind. The meeting is expected to address some of the challenges facing the region, including ensuring non-inflationary regional growth, financing investment and infrastructure development, and promoting capital market development. However, no trade or investment breakthroughs are expected from the Honolulu talks. But some officials from APEC members believe that the talks will pave the way for future development. In all, more than 300 representatives and aides from the 17 APEC members have arrived here for the meeting. Chile will attend the meeting as an observer, pending full membership next year. APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, and the United States. Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong joined the regional economic forum as regional economies. Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli arrived here Friday and will hold bilateral talks with his counterparts from some APEC member states later today.
