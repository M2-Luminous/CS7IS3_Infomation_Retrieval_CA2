With President Kim's forthcoming Russia visit, which will follow his visit to the United States in November 1993 and to Japan and China in March 1994, it appears to us that he gives priority in dealing with countries that are most important to us. We hope that President Kim's tetragonal diplomacy will provide an important momentum for peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula and for durable peace in Northeast Asia. Since we cannot help but be concerned about the North Korean nuclear issue, we have great expectations of cooperation from strong neighboring countries that can exert considerable influence upon North Korea. In particular, we have many difficulties in building new relations with Russia because it still maintains political, diplomatic, economic, and military relations with North Korea that were established in the age of the former Soviet Union empire. Rapid improvement out of need and sudden cooling down have alternated in ROK-Russian relations mainly because Russia's policy on the Korean peninsula has been in a transition period. Accordingly, the most important task of President Kim's upcoming visit to Russia is to show Russia a new direction to completely free itself from the former Soviet Union's policy on the Korean peninsula. The ROK should become a country with which is worth trying to expand relations. To achieve this goal, we have to seriously reflect on the trials and errors in our relations with Russia, and humbly reassess Russia's potential. Although our expectations, amplified in those early days of improved relations between the two countries, have turned into dissatisfaction, we should not maintain our present view of Russia. We should know the fact that our efforts can give more room for interests that can be obtained in mutual cooperation with Russia. It is true that there are many delicate pending issues between the ROK and Russia. However, they might be minor problems to be solved through a long-term basis approach of relations between the two countries. Russia should also assume a fresh diplomatic attitude to achieve the goal it had when improving its relations with us while treating North Korea inhospitably. It is important for Russia to abandon the policy of putting South and North Korea on the scales and to pursue the true worth. We can also be very helpful to Russia. We should be mindful so as to prevent impolite happenings from hurting our self-esteem as it repeatedly has happened every time there is a summit. We have special interest in multifold diplomacy that President Kim Yong-sam will pursue after he visits all the four strong neighboring countries. We have been unilaterally influenced by neighboring countries throughout a long history. Now we have to grow up enough to influence our neighboring countries. This is not a mere illusion as long as diplomatic power is not in proportion to the size of the territory and population of a country.
