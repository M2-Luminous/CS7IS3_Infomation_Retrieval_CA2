Speaking to large crowds, Chissano mentioned the cases of Portuguese nationals currently residing in South Africa and Portugal as the ones returning to Mozambique, where they have launched a campaign to discredit the Mozambican Government. Chissano said the campaign is based on the old colonial principle that blacks have never been able to govern themselves. He said such people have always backed Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] in the destruction of Mozambique, though they never believed in the capacity of Afonso Dhlakama's movement to govern anything. The president of the republic said the destruction of the town of Lalaua, while it was under Renamo occupation for 45 days beginning July 1991, was ordered by those who have never accepted the country's independence. Chissano was referring to people who abandoned Mozambique before and after independence to settle in Portugal. The president of the republic warned the residents of the two towns that in the current multiparty system there are people who promote campaigns on behalf of their parties, promising to resolve the nation's problems in a short period of time. Chissano's speeches in Malema and Lalaua focused on peace, national reconciliation, and hard work on the basis of unity of all Mozambicans from north to south of the country. The Mozambican head of state accused those who claim that the Mozambique Government is formed mainly by southerners, of promoting division in the country. Chissano said that that was not true, giving as an example the various ministers included in his delegation who come from different parts of the country. Chissano added: Frelimo chooses competent people for government posts, regardless of their ethnic origin. Malema residents demanded from Joaquim Chissano that passenger services be revamped along the recently renovated Nacala railroad. Nampula residents often travel on tank cars and rail cars. The residents also complained about serious cases of police brutality at railroad stations. Asked to explain the lack of passenger coaches, the director general of the Mozambique Railroad enterprise said that there were 200 passenger coaches in 1975, but today there are only 46 throughout the country. The others, he said, were destroyed during the war. Chissano commented on this issue, saying: those who destroyed the rail cars should buy them, instead of asking us for money. As in his visits to Gaza, Sofala, and Tete Provinces, the president of the republic urged Malema and Lalaua residents to vote in large numbers during the October elections to choose the best representatives of the Mozambican society for the future government. Chissano returned to the city of Nampula this evening. Tomorrow, he is scheduled to leave for Nacala where he will assess the damage caused by the Nadia cyclone and address a mass rally. Chissano will meet the province's businessmen after his return from Nacala.
