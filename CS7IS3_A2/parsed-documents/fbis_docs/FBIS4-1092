Good evening, Afonso Dhlakama. Will you give us an assurance, here at Telejornal, that what happened in Angola will not be reenacted in Mozambique? [Dhlakama] No, it will not be reenacted, because we believe that the important thing in Mozambique is to attain peace, not to attain power. [Announcer] Even if the elections are unfavorable to Renamo and it finds itself prevented from attaining power? [Dhlakama] Certainly. My fight has been for democracy in my country, not for power. And I am well acquainted with the implications of democracy. [Announcer] Be that as it may, you have said on several occasions that Renamo has a proposal for the setting up of a national unity government, and that you would like to be Joaquim Chissano's vice president in the event of Frelimo winning the elections, which means that Renamo has designs on power. [Dhlakama] Well. I have a clear idea to put to the Mozambican people, recognizing that in Africa the course of democracy has been a hard one. I would like there to be neither victors nor vanquished. Hence, this idea of mine. As I have said before, should it win the elections, Renamo does not wish to govern alone, it wishes to govern jointly with the other parties. And the other parties, should they win, ought to do likewise. [Announcer] In other words, you have just confirmed what I said earlier on, that one of your goals is to hold office in the future Mozambican Government, regardless of the election results. [Dhlakama] Well, that is in order to avoid problems; in order to avoid problems. [Announcer] The kind of problems that arose in Angola? [Dhlakama] Not just in Angola, all over Africa, because in Africa so far we have been learning about democracy itself. I am of the view that democracy must be allowed to develop its own history in Africa. In Mozambique, for example, we have the history of our independence. That history of our independence went wrong, hence the civil war. So, in order to avoid...[pauses] So that democracy may develop its own history in Mozambique, it is necessary that, regardless of who wins the October elections, the victors should invite those also represented in parliament to govern together. [Announcer] Yes. What is President Joaquim Chissano's reaction to the ideas you advocate, to that kind of proposal? [Dhlakama] Well, so far we have not yet entered into negotiations officially. However, I have already been able to chat to him about it and I have not yet had a positive response. In the newspapers I have read that several government ministers seem not to agree to the idea. Nevertheless, I am optimistic, because now I am already living in Maputo, and all the intellectuals -- professors, economists and engineers -- support my position. [Announcer] Afonso Dhlakama. You have come to Portugal, you arrived in Lisbon today, to ask the Portuguese Government and businessmen for greater support. Portugal had already made available some $300,000 for a support fund for Renamo, to be managed by the United Nations. Is this not enough? What else have you come to ask the Portuguese Government? [Dhlakama] Well, the purpose of my visit is not to ask Portugal for cash. I have also come to confirm to the Portuguese people that the war is over in Mozambique, and also to reassure the Portuguese -- because up to now the people have been growing disillusioned with the situation in Angola -- to reassure the Portuguese that what has happened in Angola will not happen in Mozambique. Secondly, indeed, I have come to ask for general support for the Mozambican peace process. [Announcer] But what kind of support? More troops, more money? What kind of support? Logistical support? [Dhlakama] As you know, even Britain is already withdrawing from Mozambique, and I believe that there could indeed be an increase in the military presence of the Portuguese in Mozambique, even though they are already there training the Mozambican Army. Moreover, direct support for Renamo could be increased, because Renamo needs infrastructure. The Mozambican Government has planes, motorcars, money, and Renamo does not even have premises. [Announcer] Afonso Dhlakama, thank you very much for coming to Telejornal. [Dhlakama] Thank you.
