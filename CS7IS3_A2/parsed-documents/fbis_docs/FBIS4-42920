Berlusconi paid a visit to the Saxa Rubra television studio today in order to take part in a European election debate. Giovanni Masotti reports: [Masotti] There were smiles after the controversy: Silvio Berlusconi said that he felt at ease during his visit to the RAI. At Saxa Rubra he met Claudio Dematte and Gianni Locatelli, the chairman and managing director of the company, and immediately afterward was besieged by television cameras. Berlusconi was asked whether President Scalfaro's speech on freedom of information was a direct reference to his remarks: [Berlusconi] "No, I do not think so because if there has been one thing that the newspapers have not done during these past few days, it is to take dictation [from the government]. If they were writing in this way there would certainly have not been the arguments following what I said, for example about the RAI." [Masotti] The prime minister is not worried by the imminent lapsing of the RAI regulation on 28 June. He said the government had not yet dealt with the RAI issue. [Berlusconi] "As of next week we will begin to talk about the RAI and we will be begin to discuss the RAI with an attitude that will be completely open and with the respect that is owed to a company that has many advantages." [Masotti] The prime minister said that he had never envisaged exerting control over the RAI. [Berlusconi] "This idea has never even entered my mind. I have never thought that the government could want to have a RAI that was pro-government. This would be squalid if it were to happen." [Masotti] Berlusconi, who does not rule out the possibility of selling off parts of Fininvest, defended Giuseppe Santaniello, the media ombudsman. [Berlusconi] "The ombudsman has always fulfilled his mandate with a great independence and with, I must say, a lot of balance." [Masotti] The prime minister was friendly and open. In contrast, the atmosphere at the assembly of RAI employees that was taking place nearby, was less so. There was concern and great alarm. The editorial committees of the three channels stressed that public service broadcasting had to represent the whole country and all sections of society. They said that the right of citizens to the media was at stake.
