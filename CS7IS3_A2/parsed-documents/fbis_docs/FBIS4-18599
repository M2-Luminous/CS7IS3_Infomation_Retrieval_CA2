Gasoline tax is not to be raised any further. This is envisaged by a still secret concept that CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble intends to present this summer. In the medium term, payroll and income tax are to be reduced, investments are to be promoted, and a capital formation plan could open up additional leeway in wage policy for working people and trade unions. Schaeuble has declared the concept "top secret" (according to a CDU deputy). Finance Minister Theo Waigel (CSU) has not yet been informed. He is afraid of a discussion about tax increases before the Bavarian Landtag elections in September.
