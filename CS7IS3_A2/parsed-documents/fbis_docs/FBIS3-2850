The deputies, who are here attending the second NPC session, agreed that in recent years, talent loss has adversely affected economic growth in their respective regions and further widened the development gap between China's east and west. Government statistics show that every year thousands of professionals move out of northwest China, which covers Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai Provinces, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. For example, 10,000 scientists and technicians have left Qinghai province over the past six years. Moreover, the exodus has been increasing at an annual rate of 27 percent. The deputies aired their views on how to solve the problem. Zhang Wule, acting Gansu provincial governor, said, "I think, in the final analysis, market competition means competition for professionals and for scientific and technological progress." The exodus of professionals, he said, makes it very hard for west China, inhabited largely by ethnic minority people, to develop its rich natural resources, improve the competitiveness of locally- produced goods and eliminate poverty. Solution for the problem lies in changing the concept of managing professionals and reforming the personnel managerial system, he said. According to Zhang, it is imperative to formulate policies that will attract professionals to stay on. Mamatjan Amet, commissioner of Yili Prefecture in Xinjiang, said that over the past two years 6,000 intellectuals have left Xinjiang and many more are ready to go. He said this is due primarily to a widening of the economic and income gaps between the country's east and west. He called for government officials in west China to pay greater attention to the well-being of intellectuals and do everything within their power to let the intellectuals make the best use of their talent. According to Song Pengsheng, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Science and Technology Commission, one reason for the exodus is that intellectuals are not well respected in many parts of northwest China and that their working and living conditions are poor. Wang Yu, a senior engineer from Ningxia, emphasized the importance of taking all "possible and feasible" measures to encourage professionals from elsewhere to move to northwest China. Many other deputies agreed that, to solve the problem of professionals leaving for east China, the state should provide additional policy and financial support to northwest China.
