FBIS4-23708 "drafr114_c_94018" FBIS-AFR-94-114 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Mandela Announces Plans To Change Residences Mandela Announces Plans To Change Residences MB1006090194 Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans 8 Jun 94 p 1 MB1006090194 Johannesburg BEELD Afrikaans BFN [Report by Gallie van Rensburg] [Text] President Nelson Mandela has decided to take up permanent residence at Libertas in Pretoria. This means that Deputy President F.W. de Klerk will have to find a new residence. According to information released to BEELD, Deputy President de Klerk will occupy Overvaal, the former administrator's residence in Pretoria. Mr. Joel Netshitenzhe, President Mandela's spokesman, yesterday confirmed that President Mandela had decided on Libertas. President Mandela temporarily stayed at the Presidency on the Bryntirion Estate while he was considering a house in Pretoria. Mr. Netshitenzhe said it would depend on discussions between Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk when Mr. Mandela would move into Libertas. It could perhaps happen around the end of the year, after the close of the parliamentary session, BEELD was told. Deputy President Thabo Mbeki still lives in Johannesburg. He is considering various options in Pretoria. One of them is Goede Hoop, also on the Bryntirion Estate, a spokesman from his office said. The Presidency had earlier been the official residence of the state president in the days when South Africa still had a state president and a prime minister. The prime minister then lived at Libertas. When President P.W. Botha became the first executive president, he stayed on at Libertas. The Presidency had thereafter been used as a state guest house and a conference center. People who have been in both say the Presidency is a "coldish place with large rooms," while Libertas is a "warm and comfortable house." Mrs. Marike de Klerk, De Klerk's wife, helped to restore Libertas. Earlier this year the house was declared a national monument.
