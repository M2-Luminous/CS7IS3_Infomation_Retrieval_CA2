President Hirokazu Nakamura of Mitsubishi Motors, Vice President Naoyasu Kuroki of Mitsubishi Corp., and Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia signed a memorandum in Beijing on the same day. Mitsubishi Motors has not had a production base for finished cars in China, but hopes to secure a base for the future production of passenger cars by taking the form of a trinational joint venture with Malaysia, which has deep connections with the Chinese government. China is adding the obligation to have the local parts procurement rate over 40 percent when foreign affiliated firms enter passenger car production as a pillar of their new auto policy beginning in 1996. For this reason, "Proton," the joint-venture passenger car production company between Mitsubishi Motors and Malaysia made a proposal to the Chinese Government of market entry after local production of parts. The joint-venture parts plant will study export of parts to Malaysia also along with supply of auto parts in China. The location of the plant and production scale await conclusion of the investigation on forming a corporation and will be decided within the year. Joint-venture production by Japanese and Asian firms in China is an exceptional case. According to a Chinese Government source, there also is a proposal to build a joint-venture auto plant in Huizhou and to produce small passenger cars with a displacement of 1500 cc. Among Japanese auto makers, Suzuki has joint venture production of light autos in China, but Mitsubishi Motors will be the first major finished car maker to embark on joint-venture production of auto parts.
