The Japan Institute of Personnel Administration asked 1,052 major Japanese companies, including some which are listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. A total of 34.6 percent of the firms responded to the survey, which was conducted last October. Of the respondents, 16.8 percent said the number of their employees outstrips their earnings performance, the survey found. The figure contrasted sharply with the corresponding figure of 7.5 percent a year before. More than 41 percent of the respondents said their labor supply in relation to their business performance was "rather excessive." The corresponding figure for the previous year was 28.6 percent. The survey also showed that the larger the corporation, the heavier the labor burden. The recession was seen as weighing particularly heavily on manufacturers as opposed to those in the service or retail industries. About 36 percent of the respondents in nonmanufacturing sectors said they implemented some type of labor retrenchment programs in 1993, according to the survey. Of the figure, 77.9 percent said they refrained from recruiting new employees, followed by 70.6 percent which squeezed overtime hours of employees and 58.9 percent who transferred employees to subsidiaries or subcontractors. A total of 5.5 percent said they pared down their work force by recommending employees to voluntarily quit the company, the survey said. A total of 9.8 percent replied that they implemented temporary lay-off programs, the survey said.
