The second is an obvious upturn in economic performance. The composite economic performance of enterprises, on the basis of the 6 percentage point improvement in 1992 over the previous year, also clearly improved in 1993. The third is the breakthrough achieved in price reform. With the economic life of society rather stable, the prices of 80 percent of means of production and 90 percent of means of subsistence have been freed up. The fourth is the initial improvement achieved in the industrial structure, concentrated in the rather rapid development of tertiary industry, especially the soaring development of railroads and highways. The fifth is the rapid expansion of the opening to the outside, in the the broadening of the scope, as well as the use of foreign investment and the development of foreign trade, we have achieved great results universally acknowledged. Practice proves that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech was completely accurate. If we only conscientiously implement the spirit of his "speech," 1994 will be another year of rapid development for the national economy. We have conducted a rather scientific proof of this. Based on the economic model already established, we have calculated eighteen programs of the 1994 macroeconomic arrangement and after analyzing and summarizing them, we believe that despite the fact that there are several contradictions in the economic development, prospects are optimistic and it is totally possible to achieve rapid development. I. Guiding Thought of the Macroeconomic Arrangement Based on 1993 macroeconomic performance and proof of the feasibility of the 1994 macroeconomic arrangement, we believe that the guiding thought for the 1994 macroeconomic arrangement should be to continue to concentrate on improving economic performance, stress increased enterprise vitality and conversion of operating mechanisms, maintain the overall stable growth of newly added credit, and move the national economy toward more normal systemic circulation. At the same time, we should appropriately control the growth of overall investment in fixed assets of the whole society to ensure a basic balance in overall supply and overall demand in the whole society and correspondingly adjust the structure and continue to slant policy toward development of the transportation and energy industries and improvement in farmers' income. II. Appropriately Control the Growth of Overall Investment in Fixed Assets of the Whole Society In the last two years, investment in the fixed assets of the whole society has grown very rapidly. In 1992 the growth rate was 37.6 percent and the investment rate (the ratio of investment in fixed assets of the entire society to gross national product (GNP)) was 31.6 percent. In 1993 the growth rate is expected to be about 40 percent and the investment rate 37 percent, thereby causing the average annual growth rate for the five years between 1989 and 1993 to rise to about 20 percent and the average annual investment rate to reach about 30 percent. Without a doubt, the rapid growth in fixed asset investment has driven the rapid development of the national economy. In the two successive years 1992 and 1993, the growth rate of the GNP reached as high as 13 percent, causing the average growth rate for GNP for two successive years for 1989 to 1993 to reach 8.54 percent. Obviously, with the rapid growth of fixed asset investment in these two years, the investment rate has essentially been restored to normal and rapid economic growth has essentially been formed. On this basis, we believe that fixed asset investment growth should be appropriately controlled in 1994. It should not exceed 20 percent, taking 15-81 percent [as written] growth as appropriate. That is, controlling total investment in fixed assets of the whole society at about 1.25 trillion yuan to 1.3 trillion yuan, a nominal increase of 15-18 percent over the previous year. Discounting the price factor, the actual increase would be about 3-6 percent. And the investment rate would be about 34 percent, a drop of approximately three percentage points from the previous year. This way the essential balance of overall supply and overall demand could be maintained for the whole society and the sustained rapid development of the national economy could be maintained, causing the GNP to increase by about 11 percent over the previous year. The important thing is that while controlling the growth of overall investment, we decide to adopt measures to improve investment performance. In sum, we must adopt three important measures: The first is to make state enterprises truly become principal investment bodies responsible for their own profits and losses. The second is that new starts be linked to completion of construction and going into operation, the investment rate be improved, and the growth of new starts be controlled. The third is that, in accordance with industrial policy, differential interest rates be implemented on bank loans for fixed asset investment projects. III. Continue to Maintain Overall Stable Growth of Newly Added Credit To maintain the rapid growth of the national economy, based on the decline in the economic performance of state enterprises, the obvious increase in "triangular debt," and the difficulty of economic operations in the last half of 1993, while appropriately controlling overall investment in fixed assets of the whole society, newly added credit must be increased to a rather great extent, so that the systemic circulation of the national economy can operate normally. When determining total newly added credit, we must consider three factors: the first is the growth of the national economy; the second is changes in the prices of means of production and means of subsistence; and the third is the operating needs of the socialist market economy. So, in determining total newly added credit, we cannot simply indiscriminately apply the formulas of the past. According to our calculations, total newly added credit in 1994 should be between 560 billion yuan and 650 billion yuan, a growth rate of 22-25 percent, roughly equivalent to the average growth rate from 1984 through 1988. We should soberly consider that if the scale of newly added credit is too low, it will not be adequate to alleviate the current difficulties in economic operations and could quite possibly cause great damage. It is important that while increasing overall credit, we must pay attention to improving credit performance. We must adopt four measures: The first is that in total newly added credit, we must increase the ratio of circulation funds loaned to make current enterprises operate smoothly. The second is that, in accordance with industrial policy, we implement differential interest rates and adjust the credit structure to unify the credit structure with the investment structure. The third is to fully utilize domestic and foreign funds by flexibly applying such means as interest rates, bonds, and stocks and raise a large amount of domestic and foreign funds. If we can reach 500 billion yuan (including savings), it would be a great victory. The fourth is by rapidly establishing a new financial order that meets the demands of the socialist market economy system and permitting short-term interbank loans and various ways of raising funds, to make funds fully efficient. IV. Consolidate and Develop the Results of Price Reform and, Accurately Identifying the Opportune Time, Resolutely "Merge" Exchange Rates In the last two years, price reforms have achieved a breakthrough, freeing up 90 percent of means of subsistence prices and 80 percent of means of production prices. The "dual track" price system has nearly been merged into a "single track system" based on market prices. This reform should be considered worth the cost, a 12-13 percent rise in the retail price index for all of society in 1993 and maintaining a corresponding level in 1994. On this basis, we advocate totally merging petroleum and coal prices in 1994 with an approximate affect of about 1 percentage point on the retail price index, and we forecast that the retail price index for the whole society in 1994 will be 11-12 percent. So, we can say that a rational price system meeting the needs of the socialist market economy is essentially formed. Quite obviously, a rational price system demands a corresponding rational exchange rate system. So, we already have the basis for "merging" the exchange rate and should not miss the opportunity to adopt decisive measures and implement "merging" the exchange rates. The current issue is whether merging the exchange rates could trigger large price increases. Our research indicates that 1994 price increases would not be triggered by excessive demand or material shortages. The main reason that they would rise still would be the combined manifestation of the chain reaction from the rationalization of comparative prices formed in accordance with market mechanisms after prices are freed up. The 1994 retail price index for the entire society (11-12 percent) is calculated based on the above determination. So, the merging of the exchange rates should not have an obvious affect on the retail price index for the entire society. V. A Rather Large Increase in Citizen Savings Driven by Adjustments in the Interest Rate We once again emphasize that, based on China's national characteristics, credit is currently an important means of controlling economic operations and an important channel for banks to accumulate funds. The situation since reform indicates that the savings of urban and rural residents are a principal source for banks to accumulate funds. In the past five years, they have averaged approximately 70 percent of the year's newly added credit. Obviously, stable growth in the savings of urban and rural residents is an important factor in the stable growth of the economy. So, we must adopt effective measures to cause citizen savings in 1994 to return to the average levels (30 percent) of the last ten years. The most effective measure is promptly taking the initiative in adjusting interest rates in accordance with overall price levels to keep the interest rate on citizens' savings 2-3 percentage point above the retail price index for the entire society. That is, in 1994 interest rates on citizen savings should at least be adjusted up to about 13 percent, striving to have newly-added citizen savings reach about 450 billion yuan, making up 70-80 percent of newly added sources of credit funds. So, total newly added currency can be held within 200 billion yuan, an approximate increase of 34 percent over the previous year and roughly equivalent to the average increase from 1984 through 1988, extremely significant for the rapid stable growth of the national economy. If we analyze the average currency growth rate for the last six years (1989-1994), the growth rate is only 25 percent, still approximately eight percentage points lower than the 1984-1988 currency growth rate. Its affect on inflation is not clear. VI. Continue To Slant Policy Toward Development of the Transportation and Energy Industries and Increasing Farmers' Income In 1994, including 1995, a focus of the macroeconomic arrangement will be helping to accelerate the resolution of the "bottleneck" affecting the rapid, sustained, sound development of the economy in the 1990s. That is, we should implement policy slanted toward development of the transportation and energy industries and increasing farmers' income. In developing transportation, we should ensure that before the end of 1995, ensuring quality and quantity, we will complete the construction of the Beijing-Kowloon Railroad and achieve regular service and railroad transportation totals reaching 1.7 billion tons. The key to raising farmers' income is opening up farmers' avenues of employment. Not only must we put forth greater effort to develop rural enterprises, but we also must formulate preferential policies for converting the rural labor force to other industries. At the same time, we must further publicize science and technology on a greater scale and with higher goals and more strongly support and promote the effective "Spark Plan" and develop the rural information industry and effectively guide the farmers in developing production and striving for a rather obvious increase in farmers' net income, with the actual growth rate in the annual income reaching 5 percent or more. VII. The Key Is To Improve the Economic Performance of Large- and Medium-sized State Enterprises Enterprises economic performance is the basis for the performance of the entire national economy. Sustained, rapid development of China's economy must be based on constantly improving economic results accomplished by enhancing the vitality of enterprises, especially large- and medium-sized state enterprises and improving their economic performance. Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Central Committee, several effective and bold experiments have been made in this respect and remarkable results have been accomplished. In sum, we believe that the following few points are extremely important for enhancing enterprise vitality and improving their economic performance: 1. The aim of reform is to free up and develop productivity. Enterprises are the creators of social wealth and are productive forces. Therefore, the beginning and the end of all reform should be helping to enhance enterprise vitality and improve economic performance. Macroeconomic controls should conform to and serve this goal. We must conscientiously and resolutely implement the policy that "the central link in reform of the entire economic system focussed on the market is enhancing enterprise vitality, especially enhancing the vitality of large- and medium-sized enterprises under the ownership of the whole people." All thinking and measures that are divorced from this central point fail to grasp the main point and even run counter to intensification of reform. 2. In the 1990s, the guiding thought for intensification of enterprise reform still should be resolutely implementing the proposal made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in May 1992 when he was inspecting Capital Steel, that "we can only take the approach of relaxing. Turning on the water raises fish well." We believe that this is an incisive summary of more than ten years of enterprise reform and indicates the direction for further intensifying enterprise reform. 3. Creating an environment of fair competition has become an important component of intensifying enterprise reform in the 1990s. First, according to the principles of the market economy, tax burdens should be generally equal for all enterprises, including "partially or wholly foreign owned" enterprises. Here we should point out that the tax burdens of state enterprises should gradually move closer to those of "partially or wholly foreign owned" enterprises, rather than "partially or wholly foreign owned" enterprises emulating state enterprises. 4. More than ten years of practicing enterprise reform has proven that no matter what form of management state enterprises practice, they must first determine the relationship between state and enterprise responsibilities, rights, and benefits. This demarcation of responsibility, rights, and benefits essentially is the demarcation of social property rights based on the public ownership system. Making it explicit that state asset legal person property rights are carried out by enterprises and the ownership of the assets ultimately falls to the state is the essential content of the contract management responsibility system as it has developed up to now. It is compatible with such forms of management as stock systems and limited liability companies. On this basis, the management form of state enterprises can be diversified and gradually standardized. VIII. Forecast of Principal Indicators of the 1994 National Economy On the basis of the guiding thought and main points given above, after rather detailed proof, we have selected one out of the 18 plans for macroeconomic arrangement that we believe is rather feasible. The results of its principle forecasts are as follows: 1) Input Total fixed asset investment for the entire society: 1.25 trillion to 1.3 trillion yuan; total newly-added credit: 560 billion yuan to 650 billion yuan. 2) Output 1. Production GNP growth: 10-11 percent. National income growth: about 10 percent. Growth in total value of industrial output: about 19 percent; growth in total value of agricultural output: about 4 percent; growth in total grain production: about 1.7 percent. Output 2. Market and prices growth in total social commodity retail sales: 20 percent; increases in social commodity retail prices indices: estimated at 11-12 percent. Output 3. Banking and finance Urban and rural resident savings: growth 30 percent, new increases will be about 450 billion yuan (driven by adjustments in the interest rates and ensuring that it is 1-2 percentage points higher than price indices). New increases in currency circulation: growth 29-34 percent, increased amount 170 billion yuan to 200 billion yuan. Finances: revenue increase 12.6 percent; expenditure increase 11.2 percent. Financial deficit about 27 billion yuan, making up approximately 4.8 percent of treasury expenditures. Output 4. Foreign trade and use of foreign investment total imports and exports will be about US$224.6 billion, an increase of about 16 percent. Actual foreign investment used approximately US$36.9 billion, an increase of approximately 34 percent. Foreign firm direct investment approximately US$27.6 billion, an increase of about 46 percent. Output 5. Urban and rural resident livelihood Total employee wages: increase about 18.6 percent. Growth of farmers' annual per capita net income: 9 percent; Growth of bank wage expenditures: 25.2 percent. It can be seen that the above plan is directed at the problems existing in 1993 economic operations, giving prominence to credit increases to start normal operation of systemic circulation of the national economy and appropriately control the the growth of the scale of investment to ensure a basic balance in overall supply and overall demand, to orient the national economy in the direction of sustained, stable, rapid development.
