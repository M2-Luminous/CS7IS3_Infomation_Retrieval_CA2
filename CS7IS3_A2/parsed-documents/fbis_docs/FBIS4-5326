"The offensive ... is legitimate, unavoidable and most laudable," the king said in an interview in the bi-weekly PHNOM PENH POST. The government's recent seizure of Pailin was justified as a blow against the "de facto partitioning of the country and to prevent further destruction of the country's natural resources by the Khmer Rouge for their own profit and the gain of foriegn interests," said the ailing King Sihanouk, who returned here Friday after an absence of more than six months. The Khmer Rouge occupied the gem-and timber-rich area of Pailin in 1989. It has since served as their "capital" while it financed its guerrilla operations by selling mining and logging concessions to primarily Thai business consortiums. King Sihanouk said that if the government could hold Pailin, "with its wealth of minerals and timber, it would be a benefit of historic proportions for Cambodia." But he warned of a "double-edged sword" and pointed to the recent debacle at Anlong Veng, where government forces seized the strategic Khmer Rouge base only to be routed several weeks later when the guerrillas launched a surpise counter-attack. The consequences of a similar setback in Pailin would be "extremely grave and hypothetically could threaten the very future of our new regime," the king said. The 71-year-old monarch, who returned totally bald after months of cancer treatment in China, allayed widespread fears about the state of his health when he nimbly stepped down onto the tarmac of the capital's airport looking spruce and smiling. But later a scheduled meeting with Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan to discuss peace negotiations was cancelled. The Khmer Rouge's clandestine radio reported that the king told Khieu Samphan "it would be best" to postpone the meeting until June. The king said in the interview that it was difficult for him to arrange or broker peace negotiations as the government was continuing to gain ground and co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh or Hun Sen were not willing to talk with the Khmer Rouge.
