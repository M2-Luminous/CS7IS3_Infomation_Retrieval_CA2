FR940617-0-00016 FR940617-0-00003 §658.3 Applicability and exemptions. * * * * * (c) The Act and these regulations do not authorize the Federal Government in any way to regulate the use of private or nonfederal land, or in any way affect the property rights of owners of such land. In cases where either a private party or a nonfederal unit of government applies for federal assistance to convert farmland to a nonagricultural use, the federal agency should use the criteria set forth in this part to identify and take into account any adverse effects on farmland of the assistance requested and develop alternative actions that would avoid or mitigate such adverse effects. If, after consideration of the adverse effects and suggested alternatives, the landowners want to proceed with conversion, the federal agency, on the basis of the analysis set forth in §658.4 and any agency policies or procedures for implementing the Act, may provide or deny the requested assistance. Only assistance and actions that would convert farmland to nonagricultural uses are subject to this Act. Assistance and actions related to the purchase, maintenance, renovation, or replacement of existing structures and sites converted prior to the time of an application for assistance from a federal agency, including assistance and actions related to the construction of minor new ancillary structures (such as garages or sheds), are not subject to the Act. (d) Section 1548 of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 4209, states that the Act shall not be deemed to provide a basis for any action, either legal or equitable, by any person or class of persons challenging a federal project, program, or other activity that may affect farmland. Neither the Act nor this rule, therefore, shall afford any basis for such an action. However, as further provided in section 1548, the governor of an affected state, where a state policy or program exists to protect farmland, may bring an action in the federal district court of the district where a federal program is proposed to enforce the requirements of section 1541 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4202, and regulations issued pursuant to that section. 4. Section 658.4 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (c)(2), and by adding two new paragraphs (g) and (h) to read as follows: §658.4 Guidelines for use of criteria. * * * * * (a) An agency may determine whether or not a site is farmland as defined in §658.2(a) or the agency may request that SCS make such a determination. If an agency elects not to make its own determination, it should make a request to SCS on Form AD&hyph;1006, the Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form, available at SCS offices, for determination of whether the site is farmland subject to the Act. If neither the entire site nor any part of it are subject to the Act, then the Act will not apply and SCS will so notify the agency. If the site is determined by SCS to be subject to the Act, then SCS will measure the relative value of the site as farmland on a scale of 0 to 100 according to the information sources listed in §658.5(a). SCS will respond to these requests within 10 working days of their receipt except that in cases where a site visit or land evaluation system design is needed, SCS will respond in 30 working days. In the event that SCS fails to complete its response within the required period, if further delay would interfere with construction activities, the agency should proceed as though the site were not farmland. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (2) Sites receiving a total score of less than 160 need not be given further consideration for protection and no additional sites need to be evaluated. * * * * *
