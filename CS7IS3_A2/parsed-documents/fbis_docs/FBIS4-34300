According to Santos Aguilar's announcement, Colonel Mario Raul Hung Pacheco, formerly the commander general of the Public Security Force (FSP), is now commander general of the Army. Meanwhile, former Army commander General Guillermo Paredes is now inspector general of the Armed Forces, replacing Filander Armijo Ucles, who will now be an adviser to the commander-in-chief. At the head of the FSP is Colonel Roberto Lazarus Lozano, who was formerly chief of the Armed Forces General Staff, a post that will now be filled by Colonel Luis Alonso Villatoro Villeda. Also promoted was General Hector Castro Cabus, general commander of the Honduran Air Force (FAH), who will now be an adviser to the commander-in-chief. Currently at the head of the FAH is Air Force Colonel Oscar Servellon Moradel. It has also been announced that Police Colonel Julio Cesar Chavez is now chief of the FSP General Staff. The Directorate of the National Defense College is now headed by Artillery Colonel Jose Luis Nunez Bennet, who was formerly the director of the Armed Forces Command and Staff School which, as of today, will be directed by Colonel Jose Francisco Davila Nolasco, who was formerly the chief of Armed Forces General Staff operations. Colonel Julio Armando Pavon Rodriguez, who until yesterday was director of the National Defense College, is now assistant joint chief of staff, replacing Colonel Claudio Lainez Coello, who is now an adviser to the commander-in-chief. Colonels Jose Santos Ortez Pena, Luis Alberto Soto Ponce, Inocente Borjas Santos and Alberto Urcira Reyes, are now the respective heads of: the Office of Joint Chief of Staff Operations C-3, the General Staff Directorate of Civilian Affairs C-5, the Directorate of Recruitment C-7, and the General Secretaryship of the General Staff. Colonel Guillermo Pinel Calix, who was Armed Forces director of operations and maintenance until yesterday, is now director of Military Intelligence C-2. Military Spokesman Napoleon Santos Aguilar pointed out that Joint Chief of Staff General Lazaro Melanio Avila Soleno was confirmed in the post by Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir. Col. Santos explained that certain departments of the different branches of the Armed Forces can now be changed because the new chiefs and commanders have been authorized to do so. He pointed out that certain officers were appointed to advisory positions because their experience renders them more useful to the commander-in-chief. Col. Santos explained that this was not the case on this occasion, but certain officers who have reached retirement age must retire from the Army. "At this time, however, the officers of the Sixth Graduating Class have simply been appointed to advisory positions," he said. [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2137 GMT on 15 June publishes a similar a 300-word report on the changes within the Honduran Armed Forces hierarchy. The report says the changes are indicative of "difficulties" within the Armed Forces, and adds that "the Armed Forces have begun to get rid of certain officers who have been publicly accused of illicit enrichment."]
