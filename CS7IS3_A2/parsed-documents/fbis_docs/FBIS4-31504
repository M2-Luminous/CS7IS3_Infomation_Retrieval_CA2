Because of the increasing frequency of Expo events, we requested an interview with Honorary State Secretary Etelka Pataky Barsi, Expo commissioner. [Dioszegi] How far are the preparations advanced at the site of the expo? [Barsi] The construction of the underground infrastructure is nearing completion. One of the big buildings which will remain after the Expo is already under construction. The evaluation committee of experts made a decision a few days ago about awarding a contract to build the Hungarian pavilion, work on which will begin in July. The planning of the Austrian pavilion will also be finished soon; it will be planned and built by the Austrians, but after the Expo closes, that building will also become part of the university campus. The construction of the Lagymanyos bridge is going ahead at full speed. Within a few weeks preparations will begin for the construction of the footbridge as well. The plans for the sports and cultural center are also completed; it will house, among other things, a large-scale sports facility and a theater which can accommodate an audience of several hundred. These are only the larger projects; I will not even mention the smaller ones. Furthermore, the coordination of cultural programs is under way, because every day of the Expo will have one or more important cultural events. Every country will have a national day when it will be able to present the values of its own culture. [Dioszegi] While traveling in the countryside, one hears more and more often that people are preparing for the Expo. [Barsi] We invited bids for events before, after, and during the Expo, and more than 1,000 ideas and suggestions were submitted. The suggestions include an international meeting of cavalrymen, a scientific conference on great lakes, a festival of the Hungarian chess players worldwide, a jewelry world fair, a world fair of inventions, and a folklore show by seven small villages. [Dioszegi] How do foreigners react to our efforts? [Barsi] We held the first international meeting on our world fair in March. We found with considerable pride that in the entire history of world fairs this was the first time that two years before the opening of the exhibition, at the meeting of the organizing country, representatives of the foreign countries could receive an answer to every question, and they would be able to see how much progress was made. As a result of our preparatory work, 59 countries replied to our invitation. Only seven of them gave a negative answer. Positive replies came from 29 countries. Austria, Holland, Germany, and the Vatican have already appointed their commissioners. Some countries, such as Switzerland or Finland, have already reserved their exhibition areas. Approximately 23 countries consider it important to introduce themselves; they are looking at their possibilities and are working on their budgets. [Dioszegi] The question is unavoidable: Will the Expo be profitable? Will it be worth it? [Barsi] The budget of the Expo at 1993 prices is $1 billion. Of this amount, 31 percent will come from budgetary support as defined by law, 24 percent from direct income, 26 percent from state bonds, and another 19 percent from the lottery, privatization income, and the sale of real estate. Furthermore, I can assert that we are not building a "disposable" Expo. The use of everything is predetermined. By this I mean that the universities would have needed the buildings two decades ago already. The footbridge will be transferred to a Hungarian town. The portion of the M0 highway loop which is under construction now will relieve the crowded capital this year already, and the updated railroad between Budapest and Vienna will also continue to operate. These are only a few random examples. But if I add to this that at least 10 million visitors will come to the Expo and that they will stay here, use transportation, and eat, then taxes on the additional income from services and catering establishments can also be regarded--indirectly--as income from the Expo. In this way, it can hardly be a question whether it will be worth it.
