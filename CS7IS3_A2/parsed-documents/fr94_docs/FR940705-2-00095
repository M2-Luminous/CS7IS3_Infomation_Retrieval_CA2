I. Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding On June 2, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint alleging that Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc., Benson Chevrolet, Inc. and their co-conspirators conspired to unreasonably restrain competition among Casper, Wyoming automobile body repair shops in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1. The Complaint asks the Court to find that Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc., and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. have violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act and further requests the Court to enjoin the continuance of the conspiracy. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate the action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction over the matter for further proceedings which may be required to interpret, enforce or modify the Judgment or to punish violations of any of its provisions. II. Practices Giving Rise to the Alleged Violations Defendants, Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. are automobile dealerships operating in Casper, Wyoming. They each offer a full range of automobile repair services, including automobile body repair work. The Government contends, and was prepared to show at trial, that during the period beginning as early as December 1990 and continuing through at least July 1993, the defendants and their co-conspirators agreed, combined and conspired to unreasonably restrain competition among Casper, Wyoming area automobile body repair shops in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. These agreements, combinations and conspiracies consisted of discussions and information exchanges aimed at increasing the rates charged for automobile body repair services in the Casper area. For the purpose of forming and effectuating these agreements, combinations and conspiracies, Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc., Benson Chevrolet, Inc., and their co-conspirators, communicated with each other concerning the need to increase automobile body repair rates and, in conjunction with these discussions, disseminated to each other information concerning contemplated changes in automobile body repair rates. As a result of their discussions and exchange of contemplated changes in repair rates, coordinated rate increases were put into effect.
