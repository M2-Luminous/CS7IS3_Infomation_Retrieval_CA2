The recently held 2nd Congress of the RZM [Russian Zemstvo Movement] adopted movement's program, which will become its guideline for action for the next few years. Civil peace will not happen by itself or by edict. It will have to be patiently constructed out of different building blocks: Mutual understanding, kindness, the desire to meet each other halfway, and many, many other things. The Russian Zemstvo Movement may also become such a building block. In years past it often made itself known. The zemstvos [elective district councils in pre-revolutionary Russia] did more than just try to give the state a competent, skilled worker. Having their own income, zemstvos improved the life of their province, volost, city or village, based on the specific needs of society. In Kaluga Province alone, for example, by the beginning of the current century there were 200 hospitals under zemstvo management, which employed 4,000 doctors. The relative share of allocations for medical aid in the zemstvo budget comprised about 26 percent, and for education--30 percent. Funds for farm credit were established in the province, and craft industry was supported. A technical high school was built in Kaluga, craft and railroad vocational technical schools were established, as well as a school for doctor's assistants, and several men's and women's trade preparatory schools. The idea to recreate, and not to revive, the zemstvo under current conditions signifies not only the rebirth of the traditions of people's self-government. It is a rebirth of citizenship, state consciousness and togetherness. In short, it is that common bond which is still capable of saving Russia. The idea received support from the Russian Culture Fund and numerous local culture funds, the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Cities, the Moscow Confederation of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the Russian Orthodox Church, as well as from representatives of the administrations of a number of cities and regions. "Concrete endeavors--for the benefit of the Homeland and Russian citizens"--that is the slogan of today's zemstvo members. And they are ready to act immediately, relying on their own efforts. The movement has developed a number of programs which have taken into consideration the age-old experience, and which are directed toward the social and economic development of the regions. They are intended for a long-term period. Thus, the "Family" program provides for the organization of medical consultation centers, funds for aid to large and low-income families, and for the founding of zemstvo-operated maternity homes and children's pre-school institutions. (We might add, such a nursery school is already in operation in Krasnogorskiy Rayon near Moscow.) Particular attention is given to family welfare. In cooperation with the Russian Orthodox Church, old-age homes will be opened at the monasteries. Or, there is also the "Enlightenment" program. It includes the preparation and publication of textbooks on the Russian language, history and literature, books for extracurricular reading, and for stocking the libraries of schools and pre-school institutions. There are plans to create a wide-circulation and inexpensive series entitled "The Zemstvo Library," which will acquaint the reader with an anthology of Russian literature, and a series of monument-books in philology, art, philosophy and religion. One of the first priority tasks will be a program of vocational training for rural youth. Russia is strong in her provinces. These words have become almost an incantation. But how does the province live? The lion's share of what it earns goes to the federal budget. Only 3-4 percent is left for the local treasury. Just try to teach, cure and elevate culture on this money. In fact, it turns out that the local organs of self-government have neither powers and authorities, nor financial levers. Only a law on local self-government, on new land reform can grant the regions broad powers and authorities. The opportunity to help one's native city, village, or region attracts Russian entrepreneurs to the RZM. Without limiting themselves to the charitable bowl of soup, although this too is often necessary, they are investing capital in the construction of schools and kindergartens, in the restoration of architectural monuments and in the repair of hospitals. The leader of the movement, Yelena Panina, in October of last year instituted and is already paying out three monthly stipends in the name of Yekaterina Dashkova to women graduate students at scientific-research institutes of the Academy of Sciences. The company of Vladimir Sedoy, which is well known in Nizhniy Novgorod for its trade enterprises and practice halls, has built a school. For the present time, the attendance is comprised of only first and second grade children, but Sedov intends to expand and add on to it. The RZM is a public association. It is notable that Russian citizens themselves--teachers, engineers, scientists, and representatives of the creative intelligentsia--act as the initiators for organizing its local sections. As in the time of Minin and Pozharskiy, the first to act was Nizhniy Novgorod. However, the idea was soon picked up by Tver, Kaluga, Petrozavodsk, Ufa and Krasnoyarsk. As a form of improving local life, the RZM is capable of integrating in itself various national and ethnic peculiarities and traditions of the people living on a given territory. The Ufa Zemstvo, for example, has unified the Russian, Tatar and Bashkir communities. In the lobbies of the congress I had occasion to speak with its delegates and guests representing various strata of our society. "We, the communists," stressed Gennadiy Zyuganov, Chairman of the RFCP [Russian Federation Communist Party] Central Executive Committee, "view the zemstvo movement as a counterweight to our power. Our regional patriotic organizations closely cooperate with the local zemstvo sections." This thought was continued by the ottoman of the Kuban Cossack troops, Yuriy Serebryakov: "Today we are trying to take power into our hands by democratic means, and primarily to take control of our primary wealth--the land. We want to manage it ourselves, and not hand it over to be squandered away by yesterday's partocrats and today's sorry excuses for democrats."
