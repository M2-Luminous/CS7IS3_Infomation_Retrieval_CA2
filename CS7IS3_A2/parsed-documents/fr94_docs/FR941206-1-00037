FR941206-1-00037 FR941206-1-00006 The USEPA has observed that these three elements (i.e., offsetting growth in mobile source emissions, attainment of the RFP reduction, and attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) create a timing problem of which Congress was perhaps not fully aware. As discussed in USEPA's April 16, 1992, General Preamble to Title I (57 FR 13498), ozone nonattainment areas affected by this provision were not otherwise required to submit SIPs that show attainment of the 1996 15% RFP milestone until November 15, 1993, and likewise are not required to demonstrate post-1996 RFP and attainment of the NAAQS until November 15, 1994. The SIP demonstrations due on November 15, 1993, and on November 15, 1994, are broader in scope than growth in VMT or trips in that they necessarily address emission trends and control measures for non motor vehicle emission sources and, in the case of attainment demonstrations, complex photochemical modeling studies. The USEPA does not believe that Congress intended the VMT Offset provision to advance the dates for these broader submissions. Further, USEPA believes that the November 15, 1992, date would not allow sufficient time for States to have fully developed specific sets of measures that would comply with all of the elements of the VMT Offset requirements of Section 182(d)(1)(A) over the long term. Consequently, USEPA believes it would be appropriate to interpret the Act to provide the following alternative set of staged deadlines for submittal of elements of the VMT Offset SIP. Under this interpretation, the three required elements of Section 182(d)(1)(A) are separable, and can be divided into three separate submissions that could be submitted on different dates. Section 179(a) of the Act, in establishing how USEPA would be required to apply mandatory sanctions if a State fails to submit a full SIP also provides that the sanctions clock starts if a State fails to submit one or more SIP elements, as determined by the Administrator. The USEPA believes that this language provides the Agency the authority to determine that the different elements of a SIP submission are separable. Moreover, given the continued timing problems addressed above, USEPA believes it is appropriate to allow states to separate the VMT Offset SIP into three elements, each to be submitted at different times: (1) The initial requirement to submit TCMs that offset growth in emissions; (2) the requirement to comply with the 15% periodic reduction requirement of the Act; and, (3) the requirement to comply with the post-1996 periodic reduction and attainment requirements of the Act. Under this approach, the first element, the emissions offset element, was due on November 15, 1992. The USEPA believes this element is not necessarily dependent on the development of the other elements. The State could submit the emissions growth offset element independent of an analysis of that element's consistency with the periodic reduction and attainment requirements of the Act. Emissions trends from other sources need not be considered to show compliance with this offset requirement. As submitting this element in isolation does not implicate the timing problem of advancing deadlines for RFP and attainment demonstrations, USEPA does not believe it is necessary to extend the statutory deadline for submittal of the emissions growth offset element. The second element, which requires the VMT Offset SIP to comply with the 15% RFP requirement of the Act, was due on November 15, 1993, which is the same date on which the 15% RFP SIP itself was due under section 182(b)(1) of the Act. The USEPA believes it is reasonable to extend the deadline for this element to the date on which the entire 15% SIP was due, as this allows States to develop the comprehensive strategy to address the 15% reduction requirement and assure that the TCM elements required under section 182(d)(1)(A) are consistent with the remainder of the 15% demonstration. Indeed, USEPA believes that only upon submittal of the broader 15% plan can a State have had the necessary opportunity to coordinate it's VMT strategy with it's 15% plan. The third element, which requires the VMT Offset SIP to comply with the post-1996 RFP and attainment requirements of the Act, will be due on November 15, 1994, the statutory deadline for those broader submissions. The USEPA believes it is reasonable to extend the deadline for this element to the date on which the post-1996 RFP and attainment SIPs are due for the same reasons it is reasonable to extend the deadline for the second element. First, it is arguably impossible for a State to make the showing required by Section 182(d)(1)(A) for the third element until the broader demonstrations have been developed by the State. Moreover, allowing States to develop the comprehensive strategy to address post-1996 RFP and attainment by providing a fuller opportunity to assure that the TCM elements comply with the broader RFP and attainment demonstrations, will result in a better program for reducing emissions in the long term. On July 14, 1994, Illinois submitted to USEPA a SIP submittal to fulfill the first portion of the VMT-Offset SIP. A public hearing had been held on the submittal on June 22, 1994. The SIP submittal was found to be complete in a letter dated August 4, 1994. Illinois submitted a 15 percent plan SIP on November 15, 1993. In the 15 percent plan Illinois uses TCMs amounting to 2 tons per day for credit toward the 15 percent reduction. The Illinois 15 percent plan SIP revision request is not yet complete. The USEPA is proposing to approve the second portion of the VMT Offset submittal after final TCM commitments are submitted and USEPA makes a favorable finding of completeness on the Illinois 15 percent plan. Illinois will submit TCMs as necessary to meet post-1996 RFP and attainment at the same time as the post-1996 RFP and attainment demonstration SIPs. Evaluation of the State Submittal
