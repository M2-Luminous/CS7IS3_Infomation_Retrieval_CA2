Many questions have been raised concerning the issue. According to a bulletin released by the Colombian Air Force, the order issued unilaterally on 1 May by the U.S. Defense Department called for the suspension of satellite transmissions of the information obtained from the radars at the Air Force's control center. There has been no mention of plans to dismantle the tracking equipment or to continue supplying information to the Gringo government. A confidential source informed "AM/PM" that the radars are still being operated by U.S. personnel and that, in response to Colombia's request that the equipment be dismantled, the Defense Department requested a deadline of three months when the job can be done within a maximum of 10 days. The United States has decided to stop providing Colombia with information because it believes that Colombia has violated several international agreements by ordering attacks on strange airplanes, as strange as the Gringo military airplanes that frequently fly over Colombian territory without permission. An official decision is still expected from the two governments with regard to this situation, which is just another case of the Gaviria administration's confusing and mysterious international policy.
