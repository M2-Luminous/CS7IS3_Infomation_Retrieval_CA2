"There is no change in the government's stance that an exchange of inter-Korean special envoys is a condition for the third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks," said presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik. "What Vice Foreign Minister Hong said is his own private opinion," he noted. Chu tried to smooth the waters, claiming that Hong had spoken on condition that what he said was his personal viewpoint. But the rumblings about Hong were not pretty, especially since the controversy over Amb. Hwang Pyong-tae's bungling last week has yet to die out. Hwang, the ambassador to Beijing, irked the presidential team when he made it sound as if South Korean-Chinese cooperation would replace the traditional South Korean-Japanese-U.S. channel in handling the North Korean nuclear crisis. A presidential aide lashed out at Hong, saying he was concerned that the vice foreign minister's remarks might be erroneously taken as the government's new North Korea strategy. He also slammed recent leaks by responsible policy-makers of the government's negotiating tactics. "It appeared as if diplomacy and the national security policies were in confusion, more so because they made public the negotiating cards," this aide said. Taking a jab at the Foreign Ministry, he said it should be excluded in formulating the government's North Korea policy.
