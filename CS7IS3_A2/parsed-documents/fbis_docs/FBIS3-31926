[Begin Cifuentes recording] The peasants who arrived from different communities are still standing across from the U.S. Embassy building, waiting for an answer from delegates appointed by the president of the Republic to mediate the conflict. The meeting is taking place at the Labor Ministry with the participation of the labor and agriculture ministers, a human rights ombudsman delegate, and, of course, delegates from the Penny Foundation, AID, and STOJ. The worrisome part of this issue is that the U.S. Embassy has refused to examine the conflict in a reasonable manner. AID is part of the United States of America, it is part of the U.S. Embassy, and if AID donated $11 million to the Penny Foundation to set the land project in motion, we cannot explain why it is now claiming that it is not in any way involved in the conflict, which it says is strictly between the STOJ, peasants, and the Penny Foundation. The embassy tells us that if there are any problems we should file a lawsuit at the competent courts but our position is that the funds donated to the Penny Foundation should be supervised by AID, which is part of the U.S. Embassy.
