"The state is being surrendered, therefore all must be abandoned in order to deal with this issue," Zablotskiy said, having in mind the signing of the Belarusian-Russian documents on the monetary merger of both states. It is planned that the creation of the FNV will be discussed with other democratic organizations. Zablotskiy also stated that the BNF parliamentary opposition will demand that the 14th Supreme Soviet extraordinary session put on its agenda the issue of responsibility of the Belarusian Government leadership for the violation of the Constitution by signing the agreement on a monetary merger between Belarus and Russia. In particular, according to Zablotski, part 2 of Article 8 forbids signing international agreements that contradict the Constitution. Moreover, the Russian-Belarusian agreements of 12 April, while providing for the location of the money issuing center in the Central Bank of Russia, violate Article 1 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the Republic of Belarus will conduct its domestic and foreign policy on an independent basis, as well as Articles 141 and 145, which entrust the Bank of Belarus with the sole right to implement money and credit policy. All these violations threaten the very fundamentals of Belarusian statehood, said Zablotskiy.
