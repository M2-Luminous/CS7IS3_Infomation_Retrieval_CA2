Which option should actually be adopted? This is a great issue which has a bearing on the peace and development of the countries and regions concerned and also the world at large. Recently, the West has adopted the first option. On 9 February, the U.S.-led NATO issued an ultimatum to the conflicting parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly the Serbs, demanding that Serb armed forces withdraw their heavy weapons to areas 20 km away from Sarajevo within 10 days, otherwise NATO would launch air strikes against Serb armed forces positions around the city. Hence, the situation in the region suddenly became tense. Nevertheless, the international community believed that: NATO had unexpectedly issued an airstrike ultimatum, bypassing the UN Security Council, and was prepared to resort to force or armed threat before investigating and ascertaining who was responsible for the shelling of Sarajevo. This manner of doing things was inappropriate. If the NATO ultimatum is carried out, this will be the first military action taken by the organization outside its own defensive areas since its founding 44 years ago and also the first eastward shift of its defense areas. This will seriously affect Russia's strategic interests. Thus, the ultimatum aroused Russia's strong dissatisfaction and opposition. Russian leaders, including the president, prime minister, and the defense minister, issued statements one after another expressing opposition to NATO air strikes against Bosnia-Herzergovina. On 19 February, Churkin, special presidential envoy and vice foreign minister, emphatically told reporters: If NATO takes reckless action against the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina in disregard of Russian suggestions, this will lead to a tense situation in Sarajevo and also a crisis in the relations between Western countries and Russia. If the NATO ultimatum is put into effect, the peace process in Bosnia-Herzegovina will break down and all efforts for peace made so far will be wasted and the civil war will continue and there will be a danger of it further escalating and spreading. People are worried that a surprise attack may trigger a Balkan war. Since the outbreak of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2.7 million people have become refugees, supporting themselves and their families by relying mainly on international aid. However, air strikes will fuel the flames of war and the transport lines for the international aid goods and materials on which the refugees, who are living in hunger and cold, rely for their existence may possibly be sabotaged or cut off. If that happens, their lives will become more miserable. Bosnia-Herzegovina is different from Iraq. Once NATO puts its ultimatum into effect, it will possibly get so deeply stuck in the conflict that it will be unable to extricate itself because, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, many mountains are covered with thick forests and its geographical conditions are complicated. Therefore, the targets for attack are hard to identify and particularly most of the positions where the Serbs are well concealed. Thus, it is difficult for air strikes to achieve the desired results. Once the Serbs switch to the offensive, the personnel in the countries concerned in which the UN peacekeeping troops are stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina will become the selected targets of attack. Since air strikes will solve no problems, if NATO dispatches ground forces for a large- scale military intervention, it is possible for the organization to sink into the quagmire of a "Vietnam-style" or "Lebanon-style" war. In view of the abovementioned situation, the international community has universally opposed NATO air strikes against Bosnia- Herzegovina and the use of the NATO ultimatum as a means of settling the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. The Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict, which has lasted for 22 months, is currently confronting the danger of external military intervention and the expanding flames of war but the final way out, and the wisest choice, is a peaceful settlement through negotiations. In particular, the three parties in the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict recently agreed to form a union after the country is divided into three parts, letting the Muslims possess one-third of the territory and have access to the sea. Because the Muslims were dissatisfied with the plan and demanded more territory, the three conflicting parties still need to bargain over it. If the peace talks continue and a breakthrough is made, this will bring new hope to the peaceful settlement of the Bosnia- Herzegovina issue. Through frequent consultations between the United Nations and the various sides concerned, and also through diplomatic efforts, the Serbs pulled back 80 percent of their heavy weapons from the areas surrounding Sarajevo. NATO has decided not to carry out, for the time being, its plan to launch air strikes against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since last year, some "long-standing, large, and difficult" regional hot-spots, such as the Middle East, Cambodia, and South Africa, have made "historic breakthroughs" through negotiations and dialogue. This shows that so long as there is hope for peace, be it only a thin hope, efforts in this regard should not be abandoned. This way of doing things is advantageous to peace and development.
