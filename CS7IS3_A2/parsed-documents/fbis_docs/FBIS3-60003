The principal, a 29-year-old Swede, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for, among other things, aggravated drug crime. The other persons involved got varying sentences, from nine years in prison to suspended sentences. The network was uncovered in the spring of 1989, when two young men were caught at Arlanda airport with 4 kilos of cocaine in their baggage. The police were able to determine that the men had brought the drugs from Colombia, where a 25-year-old Stockholm resident had begun a trade in cocaine with Europe.
