This statement was made by the Mexican Bishops Conference [CEM] in a document charging the existence of a clandestine network fostering very close ties between the drug traffic, violence, and the arms trade. [passage omitted] In the document, titled "The Drug Traffic, Pastoral Concern of the Church," released yesterday by the General Secretariat of Bishops, the church explains that the consequences of clandestine drug production are clearly evident, namely: insecurity, anxiety, violence, and family disintegration. An atmosphere of terror is being created, with involuntary emigrations, threats, and pressure. It goes on to say that drugs provide fast, easy money gained through illegal means. This is causing a destructive change in the society's culture and way of thinking. Juvenile crime is rising, as is the loss of human lives due to murders, theft, and threats of revenge for those informing. As a result of all this, it notes, there is increased corruption and a growing decline in society's moral level. The document stresses that, in the regions where poppies and marijuana are grown, the rural production system is being upset, because the human and material resources that would normally be devoted to food production are being diverted to drug growing. It emphasizes that there is a completely organized clandestine network for providing seed, credit, and fertilizer; for technically monitoring planted and fallow fields; for collecting and distributing all the products; and for involving the Indian peasants. These drug trafficking networks, and even the individuals engaged in this trafficking themselves, have acquired a strong economic, political, and social leadership in our towns and regions, thus reinforcing our ancestral "cacique" system. It admits that, although the drug traffic has major production and distribution operations on the national territory, it is primarily a problem with international dimensions. It is in other countries, such as the United States, that the drug traffic's main decisionmaking centers operate, and the largest drug consumer market is located. The document continues, claiming that very close ties connect the drug traffic with violence and arms sales; adding that those joining it are risking their lives and those of their families. "Almost every day we hear of murders, to the extent that this violent situation has become commonplace in some of the country's towns and regions." And it cautions: "The extent of this problem reinforces the hypothesis that it would not be occurring if some authorities were not involved in drug cultivation, trafficking, and consumption. On the other hand, this hypothesis is difficult to prove, because of the furtiveness and cleverness of those associated with this phenomenon." It further claims that serious injustices are often committed in the campaigns against the drug traffic and drug addiction, affecting mainly simple peasants, Indians, and poor people. Because of a small amount of drugs that they produce or carry, they suffer abuse and spend long periods, even years, in jail, while the big producers and traffickers usually enjoy impunity. The document makes this depiction: "Drug consumption has increased day by day in recent years. It has now reached the rural areas, where, in the past, drugs were only produced, but not consumed. It has reached all ages: children, adolescents, and youths find themselves accosted by drug pushers in the schools and recreation centers. Unfortunately, very little is being done to prevent this." [passage omitted] It adds that the impotence of the isolated groups, even the national ones, and the willing complicity of certain authorities, have caused the solution to the drug trafficking problem to lie in society itself. It is the authorities' duty to heed the community's outcry and seek legal systems, both national and international, to provide a timely solution to the problem, in response to society's just demand. It does not consider the prosecution of criminals alone to be an adequate solution to such a serious problem. It also requires appreciation and esteem for the values that accompany and protect life, such as health care, wholesome recreation, family integration, social coexistence, citizens' participation, and the development of all the spiritual values, particularly those related to culture and religion. Finally, this document encourages all groups and institutions that are promoting love for life and nature, and those striving to help the victims of drug addiction.
