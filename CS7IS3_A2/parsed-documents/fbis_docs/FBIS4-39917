The program includes an interview with Shumeyko on the results of his trip. The date of the interview is not given. Shumeyko is seen seated behind a desk. Shumeyko says: "I would like to emphasize that the visit was, of course, approved by President Boris Yeltsin and the Foreign Ministry at every stage. In other words, it was a simple parliamentary exchange worked out beforehand at the highest level. "As to the issues we touched upon there -- and I had meetings with presidents, foreign ministers, heads of both chambers of parliament where a country had a two-chambered parliament, and with business circles, banks and so on -- as to, then, the whole range of issues we touched upon, they departed considerably from the usual sort involved in interparliamentary contacts. "And the fact is that the geopolitical situation itself obliges us to maintain contacts of this kind today. Latin America is a traditional interest of the United States. That's quite clear. But the fact is that the bipolar world model has disappeared and the two superpowers no longer exist. They remain great and strong powers, but they are no longer called superpowers in the sense that they used to be. The blocs that used to exist between them aren't there anymore. And the Third World which used to be called the Third World has changed completely. You and I saw that in Latin America where things have changed totally. "And so, although these are traditional zones of interest of the United States, the United States market cannot handle all the output they (the Latin American states) can produce today, however much it would like to. The Latin American countries have already shaken off their chains and are looking for partners. We're looking for partners, too."
