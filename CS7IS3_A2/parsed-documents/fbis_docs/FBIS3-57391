This is understandable since similar processes are also taking place in Russia. On the other hand, and this is very important, the future and the status of Russian-Kyrgyzstan relations depends a great deal on how successful we are in our movement toward transformations and the wise choice by our people of the main directions, values and priorities. Cooperation and friendly relations between the two independent countries should be built on this basis. I want to emphasize that we strive to strengthen friendly relations and wish for comprehensive cooperation with Kyrgyzstan, its president and the government in the interests of common goals. We are devoted to the deep historically based roots connecting the Kyrgyz and Russian peoples, the fruitful legacy of which could not only be preserved but also enriched. This is especially important in light of the fact that in many centuries of our history the fates of the citizens of Russia and Kyrgyzstan have become intertwined. We have already covered a major part of the path in building Russian-Kyrgyzstan relations. Its legal and normative basis has been created; a mechanism for realizing bilateral relations is being upgraded. Of course, we still have much to do in building our interstate relations, and should take into consideration the existing realities and common interests as well as the aspirations of the two countries toward preserving close relations, comprehensive interaction and mutual understanding. Like you, Askar Akayevich, I am sure that the considerable intellectual and professional potential of the Russian-speaking community residing in Kyrgyzstan could be used effectively in successful implemention of political and economic reforms, strengthening democratic [word indistinct] and maintaining the interethnic accord of the peoples of Kyrgyzstan. We understand that this is the goal of a state program aimed at stabilizing the status of the Russian-speaking community. It is being elaborated with the participation of different public forces of the republic. We highly evaluate, Askar Akayevich, your personal contribution to the development of Kyrgyzstan-Russian relations, your activity aimed at strengthening [words indistinct] and democratic transformations in the republic. I am convinced that only on the basis of real economic and political transformations, and by joining our efforts will we succeed in achieving progress and prosperity for our nations. In connection with this I confirm the readiness of Russia to continue rendering economic assistance and support to the fraternal Kyrgyzstan. I want to wish you, estemeed Askar Akayevich, success in your honorable work in the interests of multinational Kyrgyzstan. Together with you we are ready to do everything [word indistinct] to develop and strengthen friendship and cooperation. [passage indistinct]
