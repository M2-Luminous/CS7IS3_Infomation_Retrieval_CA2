This NRP demand was presented during a tour of the valley today. According to them, Palestinians are establishing settlements in the valley so as to endanger the Jewish majority there. Our territories correspondent Amir Hay reports: The amazing revelation made by NRP leaders in the course of their tour of the Jordan Rift Valley was that Arab settlements are being established without permits. About 500 people have recently settled down in improvised structures in the al-Jiftliq area, and several hundred other families squatted in the area, in the words of the Jewish residents, establishing three more such centers. They arrived mostly from the Tubas and Janin areas. [passage omitted] In less than three days, the Arab residents managed to set up an improvised mosque on the site. Jordan Valley residents claim that a 20-percent rise in unauthorized Arab settlement has been registered since the PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles was signed. [passage omitted]
