FR940527-0-00071 FR940527-0-00023 ยง2400.71 Fellows' participation in institute. Each Fellow is required as part of his or her fellowship to attend the Institute, normally during the summer following the Fellow's commencement of graduate study under a fellowship. ยง2400.72 Contents of institute. The principal element of the Institute is a graduate history course, ``The Origins of Constitutional Government in the United States, 1763&hyph;1803.'' Other components of the Institute include study visits to sites associated with the lives and careers of members of the founding generation and exposure to advanced teaching methods. ยง2400.73 Allowances and institute costs. For their participation in the Institute, Fellows are paid an allowance from non-federal sources to help offset income foregone by their required attendance. The Foundation also funds the costs of the Institute and Fellows' round-trip transportation to and from the Institute site. The costs of tuition, required fees, books, room, and board entailed by the Institute will be paid for by the Foundation directly but may be offset against fellowship award limits if the credits earned for the Institute are included within the Fellows' degree requirements. ยง2400.74 Institute accreditation. The Institute is accredited for six graduate credits by the university at which it is held. It is expected that the universities at which Fellows are pursuing their graduate study will, upon Fellows' satisfactory completion of the Institute, accept these credits upon transfer from the university at which the Institute is held in fulfillment of the minimum number of credits required for Fellows' graduate degrees. Satisfactory completion of the Institute will fulfill six of the Foundation's 12 credits of required graduate study of the history and development of the Constitution. Fellows, with the Foundation's assistance, are strongly encouraged to make good faith efforts to have their universities incorporate the Institute into their course programs and accept the 6 Institute credits toward the minimum number of credits required for their master's degrees.
