"The right to a draft deferment is granted for the duration of a citizen's studies within the limits of the normative timetable for the assimilation of basic educational programs under the set standard provisions for state and municipal educational institutions...." In other words, students at commercial nonstate higher educational establishments have no right to a deferment until the educational establishments receive their state accreditation! It should be recalled that deferments are issued once only -- in order for people to complete their studies! If a student gives up his studies or merely transfers to another higher educational establishment, his deferment ends. Even if there is a military faculty at the new establishment. That is the law. Currently there is no mechanism for implementing alternative service. This service is mentioned only in one place -- Article 59 of the Russian Federation Constitution. But there are currently no other acts of legislation on this service (where it should take place, or what the mechanism for its implementation should be). Legislators' Position The questions of the Russian Army draft are regulated by the law "On the Military Draft and Military Service" previously adopted by the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. Subsequent changes relating to the military draft procedure were made to this law by a Russian Federation presidential edict. The State Duma's Defense Committee believes that, following the adoption of the new Constitution, the law should be brought into line with the fundamental law. The committee is now doing corresponding work in this area. Moreover, work is under way on a legislative substantiation of the constitutional provision on alternative service. Some draftees who refuse to be drafted on religious or other grounds are currently subject to criminal prosecution in the absence of an appropriate law. The scale of this phenomenon is such that, in the opinion of certain representatives of the Duma Committee for the Affairs of Public Associations and Religious Organizations, it is possible to talk about "prisoners of conscience" in this country -- which is a direct consequence of the lack of a federal law on alternative service. Opinion of the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers "The law on education and the constitutionally guaranteed right to a professional education were violated last year," Valentina Melnikova, press secretary of the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers, says. "Edict No. 1573 `On the Military Draft of Russian Federation Citizens of Draft Age Studying By Day at Initial and Secondary Vocational Educational Establishments' was issued in October. The spring draft to the Army will again deprive many young people of an opportunity to get an education. And if this continues, then, in the opinion of sociologists and economists, the system of vocational and technical education in the country will be completely destroyed." Independent Lawyer's View "Under the new Russian Constitution citizens have the right to substitute community [grazhdanskiy] service for military service," Sergey Sorokin, chairman of the "Movement Against Violence" public organization, said. "The right to alternative service has been recognized -- back on 22 November 1991 -- and it is necessary to observe the law. There is no alternative service in Russia today, nor should there be! A draftee who wishes to opt for alternative service should stay home and wait for the notorious law on alternative service to see the light of day." From the Resolution of the International Conference under the Slogan "Rights of People in Uniform" It shall be deemed necessary to set up an organ of military reform, transforming the Defense Ministry into a political and administrative department headed by a civilian; the wording of contracts shall be revised with a view to increasing the state's responsibility for carrying out its obligations to servicemen; the number of combined and other units staffed by men from other units shall be reduced; the number of military educational establishments and the number of officers graduating from them shall be reduced; with a view to eliminating bullying and bringing about the spiritual revival of the Army and Navy in the transitional period prior to the reformation of the Army into a professional army, professional schools for noncommissioned officers or sergeants shall be established to ensure that they serve only on a contract basis; we shall strive for an end to the Army and Navy draft of young people with medical problems; we shall strive for the adoption in 1994 of a law on alternative service. Facts and Figures According to figures from the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Main Organization and Mobilization Directorate for 1993: The plan for the draft was 90.3 percent fulfilled, which is approximately the level of previous years. This year it is planned to draft 216,000 people to active military service in Russia (in the Russian Federation Armed Forces, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Russian Border Troops, and so forth). As of March 1993, 41,000 people had dodged the draft in Russia. The same year 470 people were convicted of draft-dodging and administrative proceedings were instituted against more than 10,000 draft-dodgers. As of today the Russian Armed Forces are at 58.9 percent of their full strength with soldiers and sailors. In 1993 some 120,000 "contract servicemen" were drafted to the ranks of the Armed Forces in Russia as a whole. In 1994 a Russian Federation presidential edict has given the Defense Ministry permission to draft 150,000 "contract servicemen." Some 20,000 have already been drafted as of today.
