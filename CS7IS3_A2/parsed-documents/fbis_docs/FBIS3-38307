Poul Nyrup Rasmussen sacrificed his social affairs minister, Karen Jespersen, whose ministry went to CD rebel Bente Juncker. Mimi Jakobsen takes over the Industry Ministry, along with her own Ministry of Business Policy and Coordination. Yesterday, neither the prime minister nor Mimi Jakobsen were making any secret of the fact that this is the last chance for the CD, which, in opinion polls taken since August, has been on the verge of disappearing from the Folketing. The rescue operation cost the two CD ministers, Arne Melchior and Svend Bergstein, their posts, while the previous transport minister, Helge Mortensen (Social Democratic Party), now moves into Arne Melchior's Communications and Tourism Ministry. The Transportion Ministry is being taken over by the man who had been the industry minister, Jan Trojborg (Social Democratic Party). CD Ecclesiastical Affairs Minister A.O. Andersen will additionally take over Svend Bergstein's Technology and Research Ministry. This means that the total number of ministers falls from 24 to 22. The reshuffle simply has the aim of strengthening the CD -- the government's policies remain unchanged, Nyrup Rasmussen stated yesterday. But the decision to allow the church affairs minister to take over Svend Bergstein's controversial Research Ministry has come in for criticism from the former Social Democratic Folketing group chairman and minister, Ritt Bjerregaard. "Research is incredibly important for the changes which Danish society is facing. Merging it with the Ecclesiastical Affairs Ministry is a miscalculation regarding the role such a ministry ought to play. Here the reshuffle has gone wrong."
