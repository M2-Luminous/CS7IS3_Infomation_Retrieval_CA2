The police said death had been due to natural causes, but members of the Muslim Brotherhood-controlled syndicate insisted he had died as a result of torture. Madani was arrested on 26 April and transferred to the prisoners' wing of Qasr al-'Ayni hospital a few days later, where he subsequently died. His family was informed of his death on 6 May and asked to collect his body. Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi vehemently denied allegations that Madani's death had been other than a natural one, asserting that "the man died of an asthma attack, and it has nothing to do with torture." Reported to have been a prominent member of the clandestine al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, Madani was heavily involved in defending its members before the courts and had on several occasions faced charges himself connected to militant Islamist activities. But according to Kamal Khalid, an independent member of parliament and lawyer, Madani had recently been trying to negotiate truce between the al-Jama'ah and the state. Khalid, in an interview with AL-AHRAM WEEKLY, claimed that shortly before his arrest Madani had approached him and asked him to relate to the security bodies a proposal to end the violence on both sides. Khalid added that Madani had told him the al-Jama'ah had realised that "certain foreign powers were using the confrontation to harm the country, and was therefore willing to end its attacks if the security forces did the same." The security officials Khalid approached with the proposal refused to discuss it however, he went on to allege. Islamist members of the Lawyers Syndicate hailed Madani as a martyr and vowed to avenge him. "Martyr have no fear, your death shall be avenged," the protesting lawyers chanted at the syndicate's headquarters on Tuesday. On the balconies of the syndicate's second floor stood veiled women dressed in black equally chanting slogans while some wept. Heavily surrounded by contingents of the anti-riot Central Security Forces, the syndicate headquarters in central Cairo was enveloped in banners, posters and signs denouncing the alleged murder of Madani. The lawyers threatened to take their protest to the streets, demanding a full investigation into the incident. Meanwhile the massive police siege to prevent the outbreak of demonstrations created havoc with the already congested traffic throughout central Cairo. However, and despite the fierceness of the slogans, the police stood and watched as the lawyers carried on with their protest within the syndicate's gates. Tuesday's angry protest was not confined to the Islamists however, but included leftists, Nasirists and a number of Wafdists. The head of the Cairo branch of the Lawyers Syndicate, leading Wafdist Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Aziz addressed the protest rally saying that Madani's death "strengthens our resolve and determination to defend freedom and liberties." He went on to warn, "It will not be the last unless we take strong and united action against such violations." Tuesday's show of unity did not heal the deep fracture in the ranks of the Islamists themselves however. Muntasir al-Zayyat, a prominent lawyer for members of the Jihad and the al-Jama'ah told AL-AHRAM WEEKLY after the protest that the Muslim Brotherhood members of the Lawyers Syndicate's Executive Council were equally to blame for Madani's death. "They should have taken more decisive action on this and similar cases," he said, adding that some 30 lawyers were still subject to administrative detention. Earlier, the Association of Islamist Lawyers, of which al-Zayyat is a leading member, issued a statement accusing the council of "complicity and cowardice". Commenting on the day's events, al-Zayyat criticised the council for failing to organise a street demonstration to protest Madani's death. He described the recommendations adopted by the council during the rally as inadequate. For its part, the council issued a number of resolutions demanding that an independent autopsy be conducted on Madani's body and that the culprits in his alleged torture be named and duly punished. It also demanded the release of all lawyers subject to administrative detention. It warned that unless these demands are complied with, it will call for a general lawyers strike next Sunday and for a peaceful street demonstration.
