They are of the opinion that they will have to adjust their projected investments and turnout and export goals downwards in case the present depreciation trend of the yen against the greenback continues. They fear that their business projects set for the year won't be able to be carried out as scheduled. To cope with the impact of the changing value of the Japanese currency on their business, they are strengthening their international financing teams as a way to reinforce their roles in estimating foreign exchange fluctuations. They are also groping for steps for each of their products to counter the clout of the yen's depreciation. But they are troubled as they have not found practical measures as yet. They estimated the exchange rate of the Japanese currency against the U.S. dollar at the onset of the year at 105-107 yen per greenback, while predicting the yen's value would drop in the second half of the year. They were unanimous in believing that even though the value of the yen against the U.S. dollar drops, the exchange rate will not fall below 110 yen per greenback. Based on their conjecture of how the value of the yen will fluctuate, they mapped out their business plans for the year including their export and total sales targets. However, their estimation of the yen's value against the greenback proved wrong from the start of the year as the parity rate hovers between 112-113 yen per collar at present. On Jan. 4, the exchange rate soared to 113.27 yen per dollar. It dropped to 112 yen yesterday. Some monetary experts even forecast that the parity rate would soon rise to the level of 120 yen per dollar. The depreciation of the Japanese currency to the 120 yen level will deal a deadly blow to Korean products in international markets. Last year, Korea enjoyed an estimated $15-20 million trade surplus on a current account basis, the first figure in the black since 1989, which was mainly attributed to the strong value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar and other major currencies in international money markets. A researcher at the Samsung Economic Research Institute predicted that the present low value of the Japanese currency would continue to persist for quite a while. He said that the prolonged depreciation of the yen will seriously afflict exports of such major products as cars, ships and electronics. It is generally expected that auto-makers, which regained their export competitiveness last year thanks to the appreciation of the Japanese yen, will be hit hardest. An official at Hyundai Motor said that the parity rate of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar is running in a disadvantageous direction for Korea quite contrary to general expectations. He worried that as long as the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar remains weak, it is inevitable for Korean cars to substantially lose their price competitiveness in the United States, the 12-member European Community and other advanced countries. Shipbuilders are also worrying about the deterioration of their business conditions because their Japanese counterparts are expected to recover their competitiveness due to the depreciation of the yen. Last year, Korea superseded Japan as the world's biggest shipbuilder, which was ascribed to the strong value of the Japanese currency in international money markets. Many business experts are apprehensive that as Korean shipbuilders are saturated with orders at present, they might lose their hegemony in the world shipbuilding market if Japanese makers go on the offensive by lowering prices of their products, taking advantage of the yen's lower value against the U.S. dollar. Textile makers are also expected to suffer from the depreciation of the Japanese currency. On their assumption that the value of the yen will continue to decrease against the U.S. dollar, Korean enterprises, mostly those affiliated with business groups, are endeavoring hard to lower their production costs and improve their productivity.
