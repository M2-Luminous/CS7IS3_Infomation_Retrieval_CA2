In particular, I understand that it is necessary to work out measures as soon as possible to deal with the recent economic situation. Moreover, while no decision has been made on the specific details concerning political reform, this term -- political reform -- seems to have been mentioned all around, and my concern is that such a situation may lead to misunderstanding in the international community. And when we turn our eyes to the domestic situation, we note that it has been voiced all around that political reform has to be carried out, and I think many people share serious apprehensions about the recent situation because no decision has been made on the details of the political reform. Anyway, while the people have persisted in demanding political reform, we have reached an accord -- shall I say the final accord at this point -- with Mr. Prime Minister on this issue. In reaching this accord, what I have called to my mind is the faces of many of our predecessors who have persistently tackled this issue and who have made efforts for this concern. As far as our party is concerned, there are many senior comrades, such as Mr. Masagoshi Ito. And while feeling gratitude for the efforts made by these predecessors, I have come to make this final resolution. And I would like to conclude my report by expressing my gratitude to those comrades who have cooperated with me and given me their support in making this final decision. Now, I would like to invite you to ask your questions.
