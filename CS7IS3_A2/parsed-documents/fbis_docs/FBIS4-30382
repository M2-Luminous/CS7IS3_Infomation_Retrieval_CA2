FBIS4-30382 "dreas123_h_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-123 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Malaysia Thai Ambassador Clarifies Stand on Al-Arqam Thai Ambassador Clarifies Stand on Al-Arqam BK2406123394 Kuala Lumpur NEW STRAITS TIMES in English 23 Jun 94 p 13 BK2406123394 Kuala Lumpur NEW STRAITS TIMES English BFN [From the "Letters" column] [Text] I refer to the report concerning the allegation that the Al-Arqam movement had established a 213-man armed unit being trained in several places, including Bangkok (New Straits Times [NST], June 16). I wish to inform the readers of the NST of the following: Freedom of religion is guaranteed under our constitution. All religions are freely propagated. There is an exceptionally high degree of tolerance instilled in the Thai people to the diversity of religious practice. If there are members or supporters of a religious order who practise their beliefs in Thailand within the law, they shall be entitled to all due protection. As regards the Al-Arqam movement, the embassy takes note that there are still differences of opinion within Malaysia and that a dialogue between the two sides holding opposing views has been advocated. On this matter, the Royal Thai Government has neither the policy nor the intention to interfere in the internal affairs of others, especially our neighbouring countries. With regard to the alleged training of the armed unit in Thailand, there has been no clear evidence put forward by any party. We not only would like to receive such evidence but stand ready to extend all necessary co-operation so that this issue would become transparent, thereby preventing any misunderstanding that may harm the cordial ties which have happily existed between our two countries and peoples.
