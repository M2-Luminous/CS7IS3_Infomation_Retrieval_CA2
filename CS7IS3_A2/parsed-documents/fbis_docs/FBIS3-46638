Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says: By "labor-management concord" Kim Yong-sam the puppet means that the workers must submit to the demands of the employers and their exploitation and plunder, not fighting to push demands such as wage hike. The analyst further says: In the first days of his office the traitor harshly suppressed the struggle of workers for such demand as higher pay by invoking even the "emergency arbitration power." In reiterating the deceptive doctrine on "labor-management concord" the reactionary nature of which has been brought into a glaring light, he hinted that he would force harder toil upon the workers and not allow labor movement at all. In the past ten months of the so-called "civilian" rule of the traitor Kim Yong-sam the South Korean workers have clearly realized through their experiences that his "commitment" to building a "society where the laboring people are well-off" is sham and he is a friend of the exploiters, not of the workers. If the Kim Yong-sam group tries to block the struggle of the workers by fascist crackdown, it will only precipitate the destruction of the "civilian government."
