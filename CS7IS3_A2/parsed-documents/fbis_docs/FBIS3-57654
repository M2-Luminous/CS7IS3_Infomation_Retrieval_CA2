This was reported on 26 January at the collegium of the State Committee on the Defense Industry by committee chairman Viktor Glukhikh. Export, according to him, should become one of the main sources of funds for the upkeep of the military production and research facilities because the purchases of armaments and military hardware, as well as budget appropriations for Russia's Defense Ministry, have been sharply curtailed. To be successful on the foreign market it is necessary to create a new system of organization of foreign economic activity by Defense Ministry enterprises. With this in mind, the State Committee on the Defense Industry has drawn up a draft law on Russia's military-technological cooperation with other countries, and a draft government decree granting to enterprises independence in foreign economic activities. Viktor Glukhikh thinks that the main role in the weapons market should belong to the developer and producer.
