The deputies managed without parliamentary discussions, the press, too, commented on the document rather sparingly. What did the financial inspection reveal? A total of 144 billion rubles were allocated from the budget for the organization and holding of parliamentary elections and the referendum. The actual expenses composed somewhat less than 112.3 billion. The table compiled after the results of the report reveals the exorbitant gap in the expenses on the election campaign between the associations of democratic and opposition flanks. Since the presentation of Vladimir Isakov who divided the sums mentioned in the column of expenses, the average "cost" of one deputy was deduced. As we can see from the table the lowest was in the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) (1.7 million rubles), the highest--in Russia's Choice (47.9 million rubles).

This statement may be disregarded, but it is impossible to disregard the fact that the entire opposition flank in their reports did not exceed the limits of 100 million rubles--the amount allocated to all election associations from the state budget. The election campaign, however, was financed through a minimum of four channels. First--the election fund, to the account of which the budgetary 100 million rubles are being transferred and (under the law) sponsors' contributions are received. This is the official channel that can be checked. But nothing prevents the election associations from keeping, on the account of the fund, exactly as much money, as was allocated by the state--not more. Because the sponsors, if they are of foreign origin, may use another way--settle the accounts of elections associations, for which the latter are not obliged to report back to the CEC. The third source of financing are the accounts of parties and organizations making a part of the election association, the CEC is not obliged to check them (and did not check). Finally, the fourth source is what we call "black cash." These receipts are not subject to any verification and, therefore, as though do not exist at all. It was the duty of election associations to report only on the expenses from election funds (they are precisely given in the table), and the duty of the Central Election Committee--only to check these reports. However, the CEC went further and tried to investigate the second channel. According to the statement by Tamara Petronavicius, head of the financial department, inquiries were made to TV and radio companies, leading printshops and even banks. All the non-state organizations preferred to keep mum (the law does not commit one to grant such information) but the state TV and radio companies responded to the inquiry. As it was to be expected, the services by sponsors who directly settled the accounts of election associations were enjoyed by all. Thus, the firm Premier paid 33 million rubles for radio broadcasts of Russia's Choice, the Mars company--62 million rubles for the TV publicity of the Democratic Party of Russia (DPR), and the Sokol leisure center--almost 75 million for the TV programs of the LDPR. However, the receipts "from additional sources" revealed by the CEC, proved to be unimportant, which shows the high professionalism of the "bookkeepers" of the election associations: expenses which can be easily checked (first of all for TV and radio broadcasts) were paid mainly from election funds. The sponsors' non-cash funds, according to experts, could be used to pay for printed matter, to lease premises, and other verifiable expenses. Naturally, there are no documentary proofs on the use of "black cash." Of course, it is possible that the services of, say, "collectors of signatures" were paid under the item "Other expenses," and five blocs--Russia's Choice, PRUA, Civic-Union, Russian Democratic Reform Movement (RDRM) and the LDPR did not pay a kopek to their canvassers. However, even the CEC won't take the risk of maintaining that what the reports represented were exhaustive data. Confidential sources close to the election headquarters of Choice and PRUA assure that the real expenses of these blocs are 3-4 times more than those published. It would be no exaggeration to assume that the expenses of other participants in the election campaign must be assessed in a similar proportion. According to official reports, the sponsors of Russia's Choice are leading banks and trade corporations specializing in export-import operations (the banks Stolichny Olbi-Diplomat and others). Similar structures back up Grigory Yavlinsky. The Centrist blocs "milked" former state enterprises and concerns (now formally non-state) thanks to extensive contacts among the directors. Even after inspection, the sources financing the LDPR remain a mystery: the "exposed" official sponsors are small, not serious firms, the other hypotheses published in various publications were not confirmed by any documents. Only communists and agrarians used their electorate for financial support: the former drew, as they put it, the party money--the fees of half a million members, the latter relied on the funds of transformed, but actually kept collective and state farms. It may be assumed that in the future, too, democratic blocs may count on strong financial "rears" and economic advantages over their opponents. But for success at the elections, as this past December has shown, big capitals are not enough. Significant in this sense is the disastrous failure of "centrists." The associations Civic Union and New Names that enjoined the covert support of Premier Chernomyrdin (New Names was financed by Gazprom) were not short of means. Despite this, they did not gain a single mandate. The financial report of the CEC presented democrats with yet another unpleasant surprise. Only three associations--Russia's Choice, Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc and Civic Union--were officially exposed as receiving donations from firms with foreign capital. It is noteworthy that in the report ascribed to the sponsors "of mixed blood" are the firms not only with British, American and other capital, but also the joint-stock company Aircraft industry (a former USSR Chief Directorate), as well as the joint-stock company Metalkhim (both financed the Civic Union): about 5% of the stocks of the first company belong to enterprises from the ex-Soviet republics, of the second, even less--only 2%. According to Tamara Petronavicius, the operating legislation does not always help to determine what firms must be considered as "with foreign participation." The CEC has prepared proposals for the new election law. It is suggested that hence the participants in elections must transfer all sponsor means to the accounts of election funds and only through this official channel all the payments must be effected. However, this demand can hardly be fulfilled: it is impossible to check everything that is printed in thousands of small printshops or on the duplicating machines of hundreds of thousands of organizations in different regions of the country. Just as it is impossible to keep an eye on all the broadcasts of private radio companies and cable TV channels... The obvious "approximation" of the financial report of the CEC explains the fact that it was taken by the Council of the Duma "into consideration." Most likely, the work of legislators will end on this point: the "poor" have outplayed the "rich" on all matters, including commercial, and both participated in the game according to the same rules and, therefore, are equally convinced that it is hopeless and dangerous to get at the roots of things.
