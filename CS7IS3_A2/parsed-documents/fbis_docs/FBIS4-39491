They demanded explanations who gave the working group the authority to sign the document. Crimean Parliament Speaker Sergey Tsekov said the parliament had just forgotten to establish powers of the group at the negotiations, and objected to criticism. In his turn, head of the working group Sergey Nikulin called the deputies' attention to the fact that every word of the document was well-considered and it carries no "wordings that impose obligations on any side." The final document was taken into account, and the parliament decided to set up a new working group to continue the negotiations. This time the group's powers will be specified by the next parliament plenary scheduled for 14 June.
