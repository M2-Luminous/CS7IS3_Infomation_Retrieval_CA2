FR941025-0-00031 FR941025-0-00007 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;02; Amendment 39&hyph;9034; AD 94&hyph;20&hyph;06] Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company CF6&hyph;80C2 Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;80C2 series turbofan engines, that requires a repetitive oil quantity check after engine start-up but prior to taxi, and installation of a flame arrestor plug support (FAPS) in the aft end of the center vent tube as a terminating action to the repetitive oil quantity checks. This amendment is prompted by three reports of uncontained engine failure due to separation of the fan mid shaft. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an uncontained engine failure and inflight engine shutdown due to fuel contamination of the oil system. DATES: Effective December 27, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from General Electric Aircraft Engines, CF6 Distribution Clerk, Room 132, 111 Merchant Street, Cincinnati, OH 45246. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register , 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Glorianne Messemer, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7132, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;80C2 series turbofan engines was published in the Federal Register on May 2, 1994 (59 FR 22565). That action proposed to require a repetitive oil quantity check after engine start-up but prior to taxi, and installation of a flame arrestor plug support (FAPS) in the aft end of the center vent tube (CVT) as a terminating action to the repetitive oil quantity checks. The installation would be accomplished in accordance with GE CF6&hyph;80C2 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;648, Revision 1, dated January 11, 1993, and GE CF6&hyph;80C2 SB No. 72&hyph;095, Revision 2, dated January 11, 1993. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the rule as proposed. One commenter (the engine manufacturer) states that in the Summary and Discussion sections the word ``and'' should be replaced with ``but'' to read ``*␣*␣* require a repetitive oil quantity check after engine start up but prior to taxi.'' The commenter adds that the word ``and'' may cause some confusion and lead an operator to believe there may be two checks. The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly. The commenter further states that in the Discussion section and paragraphs (a) and (b) of the compliance section the phrase ``*␣*␣* if the oil quantity indicates 5 gallons (20 quarts) or more'' should be changed to ``*␣*␣* if the oil quantity indicates 5.5 gallons or more on Boeing 747&hyph;200/300 aircraft or 22 units or more on all other applications.'' The commenter notes that this change would avoid unnecessary maintenance action. Operator feedback shows that there were too many aircraft making unnecessary trips back to the gate. The additional margin of 0.5 gallons and 2 units was established because there was no contamination when the previous limit of 5 gallons (20 quarts) was exceeded. Both quarts and liters are used by different operators, and in this situation the difference between quarts and liters is negligible. The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly. The commenter further states that in paragraph (d) of the compliance section the clause ``*␣*␣* replace the fan mid shaft assembly, the mid fan duct assembly'' should be changed to ``*␣*␣* replace the small diameter mid fan duct assembly (CVT).'' The commenter notes that GE CF6&hyph;80C2 SB No. 72&hyph;095, Revision 2, dated January 11, 1993, introduces into production a new fan mid shaft assembly, mid fan duct assembly (CVT), No. 6 bearing plug, preformed packing, and new retaining ring. That SB also provides accomplishment instructions to remove the small diameter CVT and replace it with a larger diameter CVT that will accommodate the flame arrestor. The SB does not require replacement of the fan mid shaft. The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly. The commenter further states that 14 center vent tube extension hardware kits have been provided to the fleet. Installation of the CVT extension in accordance with GE CF6&hyph;80C2 Service Evaluation Bulletin (SEB) No. 72&hyph;628, dated July 15, 1993, should be an acceptable means of compliance for this AD. The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly by adding a new paragraph (f).
