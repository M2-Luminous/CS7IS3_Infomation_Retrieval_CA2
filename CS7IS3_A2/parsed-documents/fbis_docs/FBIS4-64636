The EU, which is already finding it difficult to function with 12 members is welcoming four new members. It is doing so without having first amended its institutional mechanisms. The British concept of Europe has thus prevailed with German complicity. It must be said that this peaceful "anschluss" is electorally profitable for Helmut Kohl. But what have the French done? A European Parliament at the end of its session -- half of the deputies who voted in favor of expansion will no longer have seats after the 12 June elections -- has therefore ratified this European Munich [treaty]. Europe is hastily turning itself into a European free trade association 37 years after the Treaty of Rome. The British, who have constantly worked for this cause, have reason to rejoice. Only the French could prevent it from happening, for fairly petty internal political reasons. And yet, on 14 April, Valery Giscard d'Estaing [a member of the European Parliament] presented the problem as it should be presented. He very logically demanded that the reform of the EU's institutions should precede the approval of expansion. "The rejection of the institutional choice leads to the inevitable dilution of the EU," he said. Europe has failed to reform its institutions with 12 members. It is difficult to see how it could do so with 16 in the future. The French bear a grave responsibility in this matter. The attitude of the European deputies from the RPR [Rally for the Republic] is somewhat understandable. Most of them are so hostile to European unity that anything which undermines it pleases them. In so doing they are forgetting de Gaulle, who rightly refused Britain's entry into the Common Market on 14 January 1963, to prevent Europe -- for which he cherished real political ambitions (the Fouchet plan) -- from becoming a free trade area. But we cannot expect the general's heirs to have his grand vision. By accepting expansion, they have dealt a final blow to Maastricht. It does not much matter to them that in so doing they have killed Europe. God forgive them, they knew not what they did. The attitude of the UDF [French Democratic Union] is infinitely more worthy of condemnation. For strictly domestic reasons, because it does not want confrontation at a time when it is drawing up its list with its RPR partners, Dominique Baudis laboriously explained yesterday why he nonetheless accepted a vote which will certainly paralyze European unity. The mayor of Toulouse hopes that in future the European thread can be taken up again through a Franco-German "initiative." The CDU [Christian Democratic Union] has always had powerful arguments with which to win over its younger French cousins. For domestic policy reasons, Kohl's Europe is no longer that of de Gaulle and Adenauer, but the old and dangerous "Mittel Europa [Central Europe]." It is upsetting that the French Right is also lending itself to the destruction of a great idea in this way.
