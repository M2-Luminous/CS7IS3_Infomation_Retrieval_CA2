FBIS4-9824 "drlat064_s_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-064 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 Uruguay Minister, Intelligence Chief Say No ETA Links Exist Minister, Intelligence Chief Say No ETA Links Exist PY0104231494 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2148 GMT 1 Apr 94 PY0104231494 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Montevideo, 1 Apr (EFE) -- During a news conference, Uruguayan Interior Minister Raul Iturria stated today that the Uruguayan intelligence services have not discovered any indications of terrorist activities in the country linked to the Basque organization ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty]. The minister indicated that he had only called the news conference because of repeated media requests due to information published in Madrid newspapers regarding those possible links. He made it clear that in any case it was not a question of a new investigation, that it is a question of an investigation that was carried out due to the arrest of an alleged group of Spanish ETA activists in May 1992, and that the current investigation has come up with the same results. The minister added that he understood the Spanish authorities' concern regarding the delay in handing over the three alleged terrorists. Uruguayan courts now have granted the Spaniards' extradition because in a country with a strict separation of the branches of government, such as in Uruguay, that is an affair that pertains to the judicial branch, and the executive branch cannot interfere. "No one wants this type of situation, but they must be handled in a very balanced way if they crop up," Iturria said, and he added: "Terrorism is a serious evil, as we Uruguayans know, and we suffered a 12-year institutional rupture due its activities." Uruguayan intelligence services director Saul Claveria indicated in a separate conversation that his investigation regarding the charges of links between the ETA and the legal Uruguayan Tupamaros Party has come up with nothing that Uruguayan courts can term a crime. Claveria also indicated that the presence of alleged ETA members in Uruguay cannot be presupposed to be a reactivation of the terrorism this country suffered in past decades, "because the Uruguayan people and government are against subversion: We Uruguayans have suffered to much because of terrorism, and we do not want a repeat."
