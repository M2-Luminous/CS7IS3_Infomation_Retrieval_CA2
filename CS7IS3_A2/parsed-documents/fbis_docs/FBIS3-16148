Aldoshina, including recorded comment by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko -- from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] [Aldoshina] Kaliningrad Oblast will never become a demilitarized zone. This statement was made today by Vladimir Shumeyko, just back from the region. [Shumeyko] The world is so far organized in such a way that a sovereign state must have an Army. We have one, and it is our business, Russia's business, where this Army is stationed. If we believe it should be in Kaliningrad Oblast, that is how it will be. [Aldoshina] Shumeyko disagrees strongly with those who say Russian troops are hampering the development of the region's economy. On the contrary: Just three months after the edict on Kaliningrad Oblast was passed, the oblast already has several distinctive features of a free economic zone. Shumeyko believes the time has come to create conditions for competition for the right to work in the oblast, so that entrepreneurs putting their stakes on the opportunities of the free economic zone invest their funds in the construction of port facilities, the development of fishing, and in solving other local problems. At the same time, the status of a free economic zone requires that traditional relations between the center and the oblast should be changed. As early as this spring, a treaty on delimitation of powers is to be signed with Kaliningrad, similar to the one concluded with Tatarstan earlier. [Shumeyko] We will have to take a very close look at the text of the treaty: How many rights the federal government devolves to the region, and how many it retains; who is accountable to whom and in what way, for the operation of the oblast in the context of Russia as a whole. [Aldoshina] Kaliningrad Oblast becomes a kind of a testing range for new economic relations. That is why an entire government delegation at the deputy ministers level was working in Kaliningrad alongside Vladimir Shumeyko.
