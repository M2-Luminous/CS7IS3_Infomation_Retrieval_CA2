IZVESTIYA has been told this by informed sources at the Russian Ministry of Defense. As is known, 104 SS-18 missiles -- the heaviest in the world -- each with 10 nuclear warheads, and also Tu-95MS strategic bombers with 240 cruise missiles with a nuclear payload are stationed in that state. The situation on the nuclear technical bases where these specialized munitions are stored is becoming threatening. Particularly in the garrisons at Derzhavinsk in Turgay Oblast and at Zhangiz-Tobe in Semipalatinsk Oblast, where two missile divisions are stationed. The number of nuclear munitions laid in store [are] more than twice the permissible norms. The fire alarm system, the fire extinguishing equipment, and the electric wiring are literally on their last legs and virtually do not work. If, God forbid, some untoward situation were to arise, it would be problematic to get the nuclear warheads out of the building and also to extinguish the flames -- the consequences do not bear thinking about. Things are no better in the shop in which operational checks on the reentry vehicles of strategic missiles are carried out. For several months now it has been in a precarious [avariynyy] state. The end wall has come away from the building, and if it collapses it will bury beneath itself both nuclear warheads and people. I was told that there is no heating or water in the special premises of the missile technical bases. The technical contrivances for guarding these bases, the engineered structures -- or more accurately, the wire entanglements -- and the protection device along which high-tension current passes have been disconnected from the power supply network, and the mine fields and signal rockets are not activated when the perimeters of the guarded sectors are violated by wild animals and people. The guard subunits are not fully manned, and their training is at such a low level that you can only be amazed that no one has yet stolen a single atom bomb. Maybe this is only because it is so cold now in the steppes of Northern Kazakhstan and criminals do not feel like going after nuclear secrets. There is, in principle, just one reason for all these disgraceful things, which specialists call by the abstruse term "gross violation of the explosion-and-fire-safety requirements" -- the lack of an interstate agreement between Russia and Kazakhstan on the status of, and on the future fate of, the missile technical bases and the strategic missile troops stationed on the state's territory. Although Almaty does not consider itself the owner of these specific weapons and has announced that the state has subscribed to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a country which does not possess them, according to information from the same source, its officials prohibit the Russian military from taking them outside the republic to manufacturing plants and, moreover, do not permit the delivery to the garrisons of the necessary spare parts and tools or the equipment for carrying out repair work or the warranty servicing of nuclear munitions. The national bank of Kazakhstan does not have a ruble account to which Russia could transfer money to pay for the labor of its officers and ensigns or allocate funds for electricity or to ensure the garrisons' vital activity. Owing to chronic nonpayments, the missilemen regularly have their electricity cut off, and this, so specialists say, could result in the unpredictable behavior of the entire nuclear missile complex. "Things have reached the point," one of the officers who have arrived from Kazakhstan told me, "where our pay is smuggled over the border to us." But there is nothing to buy in the garrison stores even with the money that the officers do get -- they are completely empty. The mood among officers could not be worse. Virtually over half the nuclear specialists with top qualifications do not wish to sign contracts for military service here. Deserters have even appeared among officers, and 14 recent graduates of higher military schools went absent without leave from one of the divisions and have not turned up for service for several months now. Four of them are specialists on nuclear warheads. According to the information which the editorial office has, repeated requests from the leadership of the Russian Ministry of Defense to Kazakhstani Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko to help to organize the normal functioning of the nuclear missile installations located in the country have not produced any results. Written requests have not even been answered. Maybe the visit to Almaty of Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will get something moving. But the military is afraid that this process might drag on indefinitely. Nuclear weapons cannot wait endlessly.
