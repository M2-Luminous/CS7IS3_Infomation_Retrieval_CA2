The paper, quoting a reliable source at the Russian Foreign Ministry, said that Moscow "no longer believes in the possibility of an adequate political dialogue with the Bosnian Serbs. "The theories according to which (Bosnian Serb leader) Radovan Karadzic no longer controls his troops are false. It is obvious that there is a deliberate intention (on the part of the Serbs) to prevent any constructive dialogue between the warring sides," the paper said. The Foreign Ministry would neither confirm nor deny the SEGODNYA report. [passage omitted]
