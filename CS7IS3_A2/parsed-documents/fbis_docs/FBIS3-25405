Kemp and F. Piennar] [Text] Cape Town Feb 16 SAPA -- Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] chief negotiator Patricia de Lille on Wednesday [16 February] clarified her pronouncement that whites who wished to emigrate should be encouraged to do so, but elicited sharp criticism from the African National Congress [ANC] and the National Party [NP] for her stance. In an interview, Mrs de Lille said her comments to the International Press Institute [IPI] conference on Tuesday had been incorrectly interpreted in some reports and she had received abusive and threatening telephone calls. Mrs de Lille told about 500 editors and publishers attending the three-day conference that the media had "blown out of proportion" the emigration of skilled whites and had created the impression the white brain drain would bring the country to a standstill. "The media should rather encourage them to leave to create space for the majority who have been suppressed for centuries," she said. On Wednesday she said racist white professionals who were called on to implement a new government's policies would undermine and subvert those policies. "If they are unhappy to live under a black government they could be very destructive. Such whites should not be forced to remain, but should rather be encouraged to leave." Mrs de Lille said many white professionals who were now emigrating had been educated at taxpayers' expense. "The question must now be asked whether the people who are leaving have repaid that money." She said, however, the PAC's use of the term African did not exclude whites "because we believe in only one race -- the human race". Whites who accepted the democratic rule of a black majority and identified with Africa were also regarded as Africans by the PAC. But Mrs de Lille's statement at the conference drew sharp responses from the ANC and the NP. Irresponsible and inflammatory, said the ANC in a statement. "Encouraging mass exodus of whites ahead of the formation of a government of national unity contradicts the whole purpose of the agreement between all parties reached at the multiparty constitutional talks...it could only serve to destabilise the economy and thus heighten social tensions," the ANC said. NP Informationa and Media Director Marthinus van Schalkwyk said Mrs de Lille's statements indicated extreme racism and highlighted the PAC's short-sighted approach to future stability and economic growth. "The PAC's claim that they are not anti-white and that they represent all people who are truly bound to Africa is finally discredited by this statement. "A person such as Prof Deon Basson who appears high on the PAC's candidate list will surely, after this statement, no longer feel at home in an organisation which so clearly stands for black racism," Mr van Schalkwyk said in a statement.
