Dr. Bogsch is an old friend of the Chinese people. This is his 15th visit to China. Rong Yiren said: As China's economy develops and as its reform and opening deepen, it has become increasingly aware of the importance of protecting intellectual property rights. Since signing a series of intellectual property rights conventions, China has become more keenly aware of protecting intellectual property rights. We must strengthen education to let all our people clearly and correctly understand this. He pointed out: The symposium in Kunming on Asian copyright protection cosponsored by China's State Copyright Administration and the WIPO will provide a good educational opportunity. He continued: The Chinese Government supports the protection of intellectual property rights and will make constant efforts to improve work in this field. Dr. Bogsch said: The Chinese Government has adopted a prudent policy on intellectual property rights. The WlPO has cooperated with China for more than 20 years. The Chinese Government has attached great importance to enacting laws as well as rules and regulations governing intellectual property rights. This will bring benefits to China's foreign relations, to its economic development, and to its economic, trade, and cultural exchanges with other countries.
