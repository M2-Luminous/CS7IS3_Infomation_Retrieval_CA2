It stressed that the massacre was the logical result of Europe's failure and U.S. reluctance to fulfill commitments toward areas of conflict. In a statement today, the union said the massacre is consistent with undeclared intentions that are devoted to the ethnic liquidation and cleansing about which some countries are keeping silent. It also perpetuates several violations perpetrated by the Serb forces against innocent citizens, which were also ignored by the decisionmakers in the new world order. The statement added that the massacre, which took place at the same time as the meeting of the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva, highlights the Serbs' complete disregard for international legitimacy and human rights.
