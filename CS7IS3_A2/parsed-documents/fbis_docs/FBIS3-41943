The town of Volsk is situated a few dozen kilometers away from Shikhany, which hosts a test site of the Defense Ministry. At the moment, the Moscow city court is conducting closed hearings of the case of another former employee of the same institute, Vil Mirzayanov, accused of revealing confidential information on the production of chemical weapons in Russia. Uglyov said the weapons were destroyed in Shikhany by burying in the ground. Substances containing arsenic, in particular lewisite, were simply dumped into pits dug especially for this purpose. Such substances are supposed to lose their poisonous features in a short period of time. "However, the background level of arsenic in the region exceeds the maximum limit three times," Uglyov said. From August 1992 to August 1993, the number of illnesses went up by 1.8 times in the region, he said. Uglyov pointed out that the test site was situated not far from the river Volga and did not rule out the possibility of the poisonous substances' leakages into the water. The scientist said he had never received a response to his repeated appeals to the president and government to take measures to improve the ecological situation in the region. He pointed out that he had worked on the development of chemical weapons for 15 years. "If the detrimental consequences of the destruction of chemical weapons remain ignored, I will make public the poisonous substances' formulas and names, sources of raw materials, techniques of their manufacturing and combat use," Uglyov said. He said he was doing that only to draw everyone's attention to the health of people residing in the Saratov region.
