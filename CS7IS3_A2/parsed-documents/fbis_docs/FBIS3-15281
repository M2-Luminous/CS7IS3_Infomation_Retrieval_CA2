Speaking at an enlarged meeting of the Russian Government in the Kremlin on Friday [4 March], Shumeyko said "society is no longer held together by nation-wide interests. It gets increasingly differentiated", which exacerbates the crisis in the country. Shumeyko believes that many a law is not enacted at the local level, "the farther from Moscow, the lesser the enactment." This is caused by the lack of nation-wide interests, which leads to the discreditation of authority, he said. Emphasising the importance of strengthening authority in the country and restoring order, Shumeyko said the fashioning of a concept of national concord will invigorate authority and contribute to taking the country out of the crisis. The Federation Council chief is of the opinion that the government now is not in a position to adhere to nation-wide interests because it is being pressured by various lobbyist groups.
