Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front-Democratic Convergence-National Revolutionary Movement, FMLN-CD-MNR, coalition, said in a speech to the Salvadoran Chamber of Construction Industry that the country needs a policy to give every Salvadoran a dignified home. "We believe more emphasis should be placed on providing the necessary funds for low-cost homes," he said. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 16 Feb 94) Zamora said the government's indifference toward the investigation of corruption cases proves its complicity. He said the government "is guilty of a cover-up in connection with all these cases" because "the committee appointed to investigate" the cases did nothing. Zamora said the U.S. Congress decision to freeze $20 million in aid is a result of the current Salvadoran Government's failure to investigate the cases and punish the culprits.

The women proposed the creation of a women's ministry to protect women's interests.

Nationalist Republican Alliance, Arena, candidate Armando Calderon Sol stressed the peace achieved by the Cristiani Government will be consolidated when his ticket is elected. Christian Democratic Party, PDC, candidate Fidel Chavez Mena said he will change the direction of the economy, freeze prices, and eliminate the Value Added Tax. FMLN-CD-MNR coalition candidate Ruben Zamora said farmers will have access to credit, all the villages will have potable water, crime will be controlled, and the government will fight corruption. National Conciliation Party, PCN, candidate Roberto Escobar Garcia claimed the most important projects were carried out during the PCN administration; adding the same will be done during his administration. National Solidarity Movement candidate Edgardo Rodriguez Engelhardt said he supports a decentralized government with more local autonomy. (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 21 Feb 94 p 3) Approximately 26,000 demobilized Armed Forces members threatened to obstruct the upcoming elections if a series of irregularities concerning the payment of their compensations is not corrected soon. They claimed the government played a dirty trick because their documents state they have abandoned their posts. This has caused great discontent among the demobilized men, who are prepared to take up arms again and fight for their rights. (San Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 24 Feb 94) The UN Observers for El Salvador, Onusal, reported today 400,000 Salvadoran citizens will not vote in the 20 March elections although their names appear on the electoral lists. Supreme Electoral Tribunal President Luis Zaldivar questioned the veracity of the report because, in his opinion, no one can predict how many people will vote in the next general elections. The voters' registration list shows 2.7 million people are registered to vote, but the Onusal report said the list should have been purged because it includes people who live abroad and others who never showed up to claim their electoral card.
