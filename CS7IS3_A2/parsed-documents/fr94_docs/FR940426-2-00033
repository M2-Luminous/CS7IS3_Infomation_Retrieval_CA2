FR940426-2-00033 FR940426-2-00020 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;208&hyph;000] Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America; Petition for Declaratory Order April 20, 1994. Take notice that on April 12, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural) filed a petition for a declaratory order from the Commission approving implementation of a Settlement Agreement dated February 16 1994, (Settlement) executed by Natural, Dakota Gasification Company (Dakota) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The settlement relates to the contract dated January 29, 1982 between Natural and Dakota for the purchase and sale of synthetic gas (coal gas) produced from the Great Plains coal gasification plant located near Beulah, North Dakota (Coal Gas Contract) and to the contract between Natural and Dakota dated June 28, 1983 under which Dakota transports such coal gas for Natural (Transportation Contract). Natural seeks a declaratory order from the Commission that: (1) The Settlement and its implementation are in the public interest insofar as they affect jurisdictional services, rates and charges on Natural's system; (2) The Commission waives or amends Opinion No. 119 to implement the Settlement pricing provisions (such determination would also resolve a pending complaint insofar as it relates to the Natural-Dakota arrangements); and (3) Natural will be permitted to recover costs incurred pursuant to the Settlement and any payments incurred in connection with assignment of the reformed Coal Gas Contract through Natural's mechanism(s) under Order Nos. 636, et seq. for recovery of GSR costs in effect from time to time. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April 27, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
