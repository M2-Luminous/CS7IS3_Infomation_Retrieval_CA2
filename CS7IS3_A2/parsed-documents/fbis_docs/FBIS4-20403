The Northwest region, amid frequent contacts with the outside world, is determined to break through its "bottleneck" in traffic and communications, which are unsuitable for economic development, and accelerate the economic leaps of the five provinces and autonomous regions by gradually achieving unblocked road, railroad, and air transport and communications, thereby constructing a three-dimensional network of passages. In railroad construction, the building of the Lan-Xin multiple-track railroad, in which the state has invested 3.9 billion yuan, is expected to be completed ahead of schedule in 1994. On it, within the borders of Gansu Province the Qingshanbao-Zongjiazhuang and Dongming-Jilin sections will be open to traffic respectively on 15 and 20 December. The important competent parts of the Asia-Europe Land Bridge that runs through parts of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia--the 65 tunnels of the Baoji-Zhongwei Electrified Railway--have all been linked up. Furthermore, the plan to extend the Southern Xinjiang Railroad to Aksu will be finished in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period; after the Northern Xinjiang Railroad is formally incorporated in the the national railroad network, it will extend north to Karamay and Altay and south to Yining. When the time comes, the handling capacity for goods will be improved, threby promoting the economic development of the five provinces and autonomous regions in the Northwest. In road construction, all of China's longest road--the Lan-Xin Road--has been blacktopped, making it a national second-grade road surface. To change the situation in which it has few roads and a low road density, Gansu has put forward a plan for construction of a "double crisscross" road network, which is estimated to be completed in seven years from now. The rebuilding of the Gansu section of the Lan-Bao Road has been completed, and the vehicle speed per hous has been increased from the original 30 kilometers to 80 kilometers. To achieve as quickly as possible the "joining in the east and coming out at the west," Xinjiang has begun border post capital construction with the focus on building roads. Last year Xinjiang invested a total of 200 million yuan on building major international passages, and it will transform seven port roads, including (Baketu, Cui'enguosi, Alashankou), and (Tu'erduote). The expressway that goes from (Dahuangshan) through Urumqi to Turpan, for which the World Bank granted a loan of $115 million and for which there was a total investment of 2.3 billion yuan in Renminbi, and the total length of which is 285.5 kilometers, will be completed in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period. Up to now Xinjiang has built roads with a total length of 26,000 kilometers, the longest in China; 53 percent of its open-to-traffic road surface is high grade or secondary high grade, which puts it in first position among China's autonomous regions. The upsurge in development brought about by reform and the opening up to the outside world had spurred a considerable development of the Great Northwest Air Corridor. In this regard Urumqi will open domestic air lines to Wuhan, Kunming, Haikou, Shantou, Qingdao, and Ningbo, as well as Tacheng, Turpan, Hami, and Malan within Xinjiang's borders. Also, to fully display Xinjiang's geographical superiority, Urumqi will open direct passages to various places in the world: to the east, in succession opening air lines to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul, Bangkok, and Singapore in East Asia and Southeast Asia; and to the west, in succession opening international air lines to (Aoshi, Bikshikaike), Moscow, (Shengbidebao, Ashihabata), Kiev, Minsk, Karachi, and (Shajia). With Urumqi as the center, Xinjiang has formed a network of 30 air lines linked to 19 large and medium-sized cities in China and to 11 cities and counties in the autonomous region, thereby becoming in China among all the provinces and autonomous regions the one with the most airports and longest air lines. In the Northwest region the Yinchuan He [river] East Airport will be newly built; the Lanzhou and Guohuang airports will be expanded; and the Xining, Yulin, Ankang, and Hanzhong airports will be rebuilt or expanded. The post and telecommunications facilities of the five provinces and autonomous regions of the Northwest, under the concept of "great communications," have entered the completely new era of the satellite, microwave, optical cable, and programmatic control. With a total investment of 750 million yuan, the Xining-Lanzhou-Urumqi-Yining optical cable project, and the Turpan-Hetian, Urumqi-Yining, and Urumqi-Altay digital microwave projects, are being intensively constructed; and the large-, medium-sized, and small cities of Xi'an, Xining, Yinchuan, Lanzhou, Jiayuguan, Guohuang, and Urumqi have been put in the international direct broadcast exchange network.
