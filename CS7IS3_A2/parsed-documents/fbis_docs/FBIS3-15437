The bloc is headed by Georgiy Chanturiya, leader of the National Democratic Party. The opposition is campaigning against head of state Eduard Shevardnadze, the Civic Union organization headed by him, and the parliamentary majority. The reason for this unification is the ratification by parliament of the decision to join the CIS. Chanturiya and Co. believe that the speaker grossly violated the standing orders and flouted all the laws. A law suit has already been filed with the republic's Supreme Court. It is worth recalling here that the ratification took place to the accompaniment of whistling, cat calls, choice swearwords, and fisticuffs. The hall of sessions was like the central market when a thief has been caught and above all this uproar was heard the shrill voice of one of the deputies signing the anthem of the Soviet Union. If all these scenes are repeated out on the streets, and the leaders of the opposition movement are perfectly capable of doing that, the situation will get out of control. And the new alliance is in a very determined state of mind. The situation is being complicated by the fact that on 7 March Shevardnadze is flying to the United States at the invitation of President Clinton. It would be a good idea if he took David Zeikidze, Tbilisi's police chief, along with him. A year ago this conscientious state servant declared: "I get spat on whether I authorize a rally or not. So I shall disperse it!" In most cases he has kept his promise since then. In this connection one is bound to recall that the previous Georgian coup began precisely with the dispersal of a National Democratic Party rally. The leaders of the opposition parties have held a confidential meeting in Tbilisi. The audience adopted an appeal to the United Nations, the peoples of the world, and the governments of all countries. The appeal notes that the decision on affiliation to the CIS is illegitimate and the vote was held in conditions of terror. The ratification is called a "coup from above." The opposition leaders believe that such an important decision must be adopted only by a nationwide referendum.
