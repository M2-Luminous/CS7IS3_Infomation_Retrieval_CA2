The project is valued at ECU12 million ($13.6 million) and over the next three years will retrain 16,000 officers of the Russian Army in various aspects of Western management and marketing. Russian authorities officially requested assistance from the European Commission to retrain military personnel in mid-1992. According to figures presented to the Russian Government at the time, the number of officers to be discharged from the Armed Forces between 1992 and 1995 would number in the region of 50,000 annually. This does not include a total of over 30,000 men returning from Germany by 1994. To help the officers adjust to civilian life, a comprehensive training project was developed following detailed consultations with the Russian recipients. The principal aim of the project is to upgrade the qualifications of teachers who will work in 15 training centers established in various regions. Four hundred teachers will receive training in general management and marketing, including principles of the market economy and modern teaching methods. Of these, half will undergo additional training in more specialized areas such as management as it is applied to small and medium enterprises. One of the most important aspects of the training is that the teachers should become self-sufficient in the development of curricula to suit the needs of the local economies. Thirty-two teachers will specialize in this field, while a similar number will be trained as employment counselors. The intention is that by the time the project nears completion, the training centers will be able to retrain the 16,000 officers targeted by the projects. They should also be able to provide training in areas which meet the developing manpower needs existing in any particular region. Russian bodies involved in the project include the state committee of higher education and the Defense Ministry. The consortium of European companies chosen to implement the project is led by Elea-Olivetti, the Italian company's training branch, and includes other firms from various EU countries, such as GOPA [Company for Organization, Planning, and Education] for (Germany), ISVOR (Italy) and SODETEG [Company of Technical Studies and General Operations] (France).
