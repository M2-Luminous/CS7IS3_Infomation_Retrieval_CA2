On May 5, the car carrying Horn back to Budapest from an election rally in Miskolc ran into a truck parked on road No. 3 between Nyekladhaza and Emod. The party chairman suffered a fractured cervical vertebra, a broken wrist and a concussion in the crash. Dr. Katona said Horn is in quite a good condition, and he is returning to his family in Budapest. He will invariably need longer-term outpatient care and must undergo rehabilitation treatment, Katona added. Driver Istvan Mosolygo and the other passenger Jeno Zsidey have also left the hospital.
