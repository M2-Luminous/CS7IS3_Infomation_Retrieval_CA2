Bophuthatswana's "Information Service" mouthpiece quoted Mr Mangope as saying at a news conference in Mmabatho that the homeland government was 100 per cent behind the Freedom Alliance's call for a mediated settlement. "Depending on the competence of the mediators and the terms of reference, it is conceivable that an agreement will be reached before the elections," Mr Mangope said. He said Bophuthatswana's main concern was not to meet deadlines, but to find solutions. He told reporters that the Bophuthatswana parliament would have to decide whether or not it would contest the election. The Bophuthatswana cabinet had been unable to make this decision before the registration deadline on Friday because it first had to consult with parliament on the issue. The implications that participation in the election would have on Bophuthatswana's 16-year-old independence also had to be considered. He stressed that the value his country placed on independence and freedom was underestimated by people who believed that Bophuthatswana had not agreed to join the election was because it was afraid of defeat. "We have worked hard in this country to achieve what we have, and we are not prepared to give that away lightly," Mr Mangope said. Responding to a question on the spate of go-slows and strikes in the Bophuthatswana civil service, Mr Mangope said that the government had made contingency plans which would be implemented if necessary.
