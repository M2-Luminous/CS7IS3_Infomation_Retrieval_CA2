After several hours of tallks with Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union Bundestag group, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping said that domestic nursing care will be introduced on 1 April 1995 and in-patient nursing care on 1 July 1996. Contributions of 1 percent are to be collected as of 1 January 1995. In the representation of Rhineland-Palatinate in Bonn, Scharping said he hopes that the mediation committee will agree to the result. The Social Democrats will agree to the abolition of one holiday. An exemption was explicitly defined: Should one land not abolish one holiday, the employer would have to completely take over all contributions. Moreover, according to Scharping, it was further agreed that in the course of next year, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat will examine what has become of this provision in order to draw legislative conclusions if necessary. "It is important the laender are now free to consider the whole year what holiday they want to cancel," Scharping said. The agreement that has been achieved will result in a considerable improvement for the affected people. The compromise contains all Social Democratic ideas about nursing care benefits, including domestic and in-patient care, he said.
