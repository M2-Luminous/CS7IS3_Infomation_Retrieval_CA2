FR941130-0-00093 FR941130-0-00015 Section 675.4␣Allocation and Reallocation Comments: Three commenters discussed the proposal required by section 442(e) of the HEA that only an institution that uses at least 10 percent of its total amount of FWS Federal funds granted to compensate students employed in community service are eligible for reallocated FWS funds and that all the reallocated FWS funds must be used for community service. One of these commenters suggested that the Secretary should clarify this proposal in the regulations. The other two commenters expressed the concern that the provision that requires institutions to have a fair-share shortfall in order to receive these reallocated supplemental FWS funds presents a disincentive to institutions, with no shortfall, to strive for the 10 percent figure. The commenters suggested that the Secretary consider an alternative to the current process of awarding unexpended funds. They would like to see the fair-share requirement changed to consider also those institutions that meet or exceed the 10 percent rule, but do not have a shortfall. In addition, one of these commenters further noted that the use of the reallocated funds should not be restricted to community service wages. Instead, since the institution had already done 100 percent above the requirement, it should be allowed to use reallocated funds in any FWS program or for administrative costs. Discussion: Under current FWS regulations in §675.4, the Secretary allocates and reallocates funds to institutions participating in the FWS program in accordance with section 442 of the HEA. Therefore, this provision will not be codified in the regulations. Under section 442 of the HEA, the Secretary reallocates funds on a pro rata basis, i.e. , the amount of an institution's fair-share shortfall as a percentage of the fair-share shortfalls of all participating institutions with an unmet FWS request. The Secretary continues to believe this position to be the most equitable formula for awarding unexpended funds. The statutory provision that mandates this new rule for receipt of unexpended FWS funds, section 442(e)(1) of the HEA, provides that these funds will only go to institutions that expend at least 10 percent of their total amount of FWS funds (initial and supplemental) to employ students in community service jobs, and that the reallocated FWS funds must also be used only for that purpose. Congress amended this section to encourage students to participate in community service activities. Changes: None. Section 675.8␣Program Participation Agreement Comments: Several commenters believed that the jobs performed by an institution's FWS students that provide support services solely to the institution's own students with disabilities should be counted toward meeting the community service requirements under the FWS program. Many commenters believed that not to do this would cause an undue hardship for the institution. One commenter questioned why under the FWS program it is permissible to develop programs that support services to an institution's own students with disabilities yet under the community service component this is not allowed. Two commenters asked for consistency between the program participation agreement and the community service definition concerning the meaning of support services to students with disabilities. Discussion: Section 441(c) of the HEA under the definition of community service states that an institution may include as part of its community service component support services to students with disabilities. Section 443(b)(9) of the HEA requires institutions under the program participation agreement to assure that employment under the FWS program may be used to support programs for supportive services to students with disabilities. The Secretary believes the intention of the community service requirement in the statute is for an institution's FWS students to work with elementary and secondary school students as well as students attending other postsecondary institutions, and provide services to the disabled, and not just for an institution to provide services solely to its own students with disabilities. As allowed by section 443(b)(9) of the HEA, an institution may use FWS funds to provide support services to its own institutional students with disabilities. However, to be providing community service in accordance with section 441(c) of the HEA, the FWS students providing the service must be providing the service to students with disabilities in the community. The fact that the FWS students also provide the services to the institution's own students with disabilities would not necessarily prevent the job from being considered community service. Changes: The definition of ``community services'' in §675.2 has been revised to emphasize that the support services must be provided to students other than an institution's own students to satisfy the community service component of the FWS program. No changes have been made to §675.8. Section 675.18␣Use of Funds Community Service Waiver Comments: Section 443(b)(2)(A) of the HEA provides that for the 1994&hyph;95 award year and succeeding award years, an institution shall use at least 5 percent of the total amount of FWS Federal funds granted to such institution to compensate students employed in community service, except that the Secretary may waive this requirement if the Secretary determines that enforcing it would cause hardship for students at an institution. In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments regarding the conditions under which the Secretary should grant waivers of this provision. Some commenters believed that means and costs of transportation are major issues the Secretary needs to consider in granting a waiver. The commenters believed that students from low-income backgrounds do not have cars, and some institutions are located in areas that have no public transportation. One commenter believed that there are many institutions located in rural areas and that community service jobs may not be accessible. Some commenters believed it would be a hardship on institutions that could only locate community service jobs with agencies that could not afford to pay a portion of the non-Federal share. Other commenters wanted the Department to regulate the criteria that the Secretary would use to determine this waiver. One commenter expressed concern for the safety of students providing community service in some locations. This same commenter noted that performance of community service might conflict with student class schedules. One commenter believed that private technical universities have very few degree programs offered that are geared toward community service and that placements in this area are somewhat rare. Discussion: Section 443(b)(2)(A) of the amended HEA mandates that at least 5 percent of an institution's total amount of Federal FWS funds granted must be used to compensate students employed in community service jobs, unless the Secretary waives the requirement. Based on public comment, the Secretary does not foresee many instances in which a waiver would be granted. However, to allow flexibility to consider factors that are valid reasons for a waiver, the Secretary is not specifying the specific circumstances that would receive a waiver. The fact that it may be difficult for the institution to comply with this provision is not a basis for granting a waiver. The Secretary will consider providing more specific regulatory guidance on this issue as he gains more experience in processing these kinds of waiver requests.
