The Ukrainian parliament speaker informed Mr. Miller about the parliamentary elections' outcome and returns. As Mr. Plyushch stated, the 338 newly elected MP's have thus secured the parliament's constitutional majority necessary for its legal functioning. Repeated voting will soon be held in those electoral districts where no deputies were elected as a result of the [word indistinct] elections. As Mr. Plyushch noted, the new parliament reflects the worst political forces in Ukraine, but yet there is a hope that in the final analysis their actions will not be ruinous to Ukraine's sovereign statehood and that their concerted efforts will promote democratic political and radical economic reforms in Ukraine. To make out his case the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman referred to his meetings and talks with the freshly elected leftists, communists included, who reiterated their commitment to construction of a really independent, democratic and prosperous Ukraine. During the meeting issues of U.S.-Ukrainian relations as well as some international problems were touched upon. The two officials were unanimous in expressing the dire necessity to promote global and regional peace, extinguish armed conflict, and preserve intact European borders. The Supreme Council chairman thanked the U.S. ambassador for his concern over U.S.-Ukrainian economic relations, for helping alleviate the aftermath of Chernobyl, and U.S. humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
