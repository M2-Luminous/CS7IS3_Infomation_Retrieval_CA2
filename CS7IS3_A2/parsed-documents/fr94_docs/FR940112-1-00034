The rational for approving is set forth in this notice; additional information is available at the address indicated below. This action is being taken in accordance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act. DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Thomas J. Maslany, Director, Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107; Jerry Kurtzweg (ANR&hyph;443), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, P.O. Box 1401, Dover Delaware 19903. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lisa M. Donahue, (215) 597&hyph;9781. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Implementation of the provisions the CAA will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program, and submit this Program as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a Program are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments , in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. On January 11, 1993, the State of Delaware submitted a formal revision to its SIP. The SIP revision consists of a plan for establishing an SBTCP. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following program elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. The plan must also determine the eligibility of small business stationary sources for assistance in the program. The plan includes the duties, funding, and schedule of implementation for the three program components. Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DE DNREC) is authorized to create and administer the SBTCP. Delaware DNREC can create and administer the SBAP, and create the Office of the Ombudsman. Through an executive order, the Governor of the State of Delaware will establish the Compliance Advisory Panel. II. Summary and Analysis of SIP Revision Section 507(a) of the CAA sets forth seven requirements that Delaware must meet to have an approvable SBAP. Three requirements will be discussed in the first section, and the remaining four requirements, including the establishment of an Ombudsman, in the second section. 1. Small Business Assistance Program The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the CAA. Delaware has met this requirement by establishing a SBAP, with the responsibility of serving as a clearinghouse for information related to compliance methods and control technologies. Small businesses will be referred to state technical experts specifically trained to handle questions relevant to achieving compliance with the CAA. The SBAP will be coordinated through the Air Quality Management Section and will respond to inquiries from small businesses received through the ombudsman's toll-free hotline. Information workshops, industry-specific compliance publications, and roundtable groups are examples of planned outreach activities. A list of potentially affected parties will be developed in conjunction with the State of Delaware Department of Labor. The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. Delaware DNREC established a Pollution Prevention Program in 1990 which provides education, technical assistance, and financial incentives to improve environmental quality. Small businesses have access to Delaware's Waste Minimization/Pollution Prevention Information Clearinghouse. In addition to distributing pollution prevention guides, DE DNREC has established a Pollution Prevention Industry Roundtable to facilitate technology transfer between large and small businesses. To address accidental release detection and prevention, the Air Quality Management Section has been administering Delaware's `` Regulation for the Management of Extremely Hazardous Substances '' through the Industrial Disaster Prevention Group (IDPG). Facility visits and compliance discussions are a part of this program, as is the distribution of generic procedures to assist with compliance with the regulation. The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the CAA in a timely and efficient manner. Delaware has met this requirement through the Engineering and Compliance Branch (ECB) of the Air Quality Management Section. The ECB will identify applicable rules, determine whether a permit is needed, identify compliance alternatives, and explain the fees, application process, violations, and appeals, as needed. 2. Ombudsman Office The fourth requirement of section 507(a)(3) is the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary sources. Delaware's Secretary of DE DNREC is authorized to create the ombudsman's office within DNREC. The ombudsman will be appointed by the Secretary of DE DNREC and will report directly to him or her. The Delaware Office of the Ombudsman (Delaware Ombudsman) will be independent of the Division of Air and Waste Management and the Air Quality Management Section. The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the CAA. The Delaware Ombudsman will ensure that small businesses receive notice of their rights in sufficient time to evaluate compliance. Information delineating legal rights will be disseminated with the technical and compliance information by the SBAP. In addition, field inspectors will be trained to properly inform small businesses of their rights during site visits. The sixth requirement of CAA section 507(a) is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option of the state, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the CAA. The Delaware Ombudsman will develop procedures for referring sources to qualified auditors. A list of qualified environmental consulting firms who could conduct audits will be provided by the Delaware Ombudsman to small businesses. The Delaware Ombudsman, ECB, IDPG and Pollution Prevention Program may elect to provide qualified auditors, if available. The seventh requirement of CAA section 507(a) is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance, or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practices or compliance methods. Delaware's Office of the Ombudsman will receive written requests from a small businesses for modification of work practices. 3. Compliance Advisory Panel Section 507(e) of the CAA requires Delaware to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the state legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. Members of the Delaware CAP will be selected in the following manner for the first term, after which all will serve four year terms: (1) The majority leader of the Senate shall appoint one member for 4 years; (2) the minority leader of the Senate shall appoint one member for 2 years; (3) the majority leader of the House of Representatives will appoint one member for three years; (4) the minority leader of the House of Representatives shall appoint one member for one year; (5) the Governor will select two members for four years; and (6) the Air Quality Management Program Administrator will select one member for four years. The makeup of Delaware's CAP is prescribed as is required by section 507(e). The Delaware CAP will meet at least once per quarter. Any member absent from three consecutive meetings will be replaced. Administrative and logistical support for the Delaware CAP will be funded through the Delaware Ombudsman's office. The Delaware Ombudsman will also serve a Secretariat for the development and dissemination of CAP reports. In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP the CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel: (A) to render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree and severity of enforcement actions; (B) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; (C) to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP; and (D) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. (Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three statutes. However, since state agencies are not required to comply with them, EPA believes that the state Program must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general principles of these Federal statutes.) The duties and responsibilities described in Delaware's submittal indicate that the Delaware CAP will be responsible for all four of the activities listed above, except that the Delaware Ombudsman will disseminate reports. 4. Source Eligibility Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that: (A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; (B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; (C) Is not a major stationary source; (D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and (E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. Delaware's submittal duplicates the language of CAA section 507(c)(1) in defining eligible stationary sources. It also provides for the state, after consultation with the Administrator and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration and notice and opportunity for public comment, to include or exclude a category or subcategory of sources. III. Summary of SIP Revision Delaware has submitted a SIP revision requiring implementation of each of the program elements required by CAA section 507. As previously stated, the authority to implement the SBAP has been delegated to the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, Air Quality Management Section. Program implementation will begin no later than January 1, 1994. The Secretary of DE DNREC will appoint the Ombudsman by July 1, 1993 and hire the staff dedicated to implementing the program. An Executive Order establishing the Compliance Advisory Panel will be executed by the Governor of the State of Delaware by March 1, 1993. In this action, EPA is approving the SIP revision submittal by the State of Delaware. Accordingly, §52.460 is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart I&hyph;Delaware to reflect EPA's approval action and the fact that it is considered part of the Delaware's SIP. EPA is proposing to approve the Delaware SIP revision for establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environemental Compliance Assistance Program, which was submitted on January 11, 1993. EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this notice or on other relevant matters. These comments will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional office listed in the Addresses section of this document. Proposed Action EPA is proposing to approve Delaware's plan for the establishment of a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. In this action, EPA is approving a state program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the state. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistance Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
