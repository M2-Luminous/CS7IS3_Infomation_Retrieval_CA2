Security Council [UNSC] has failed to give the green light to NATO to launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, diplomatic circles in Belgrade said on Wednesday. They interpret this by the fact that a decision was not reached even after the two-day Security Council session on the Bosnian crisis and the NATO ultimatum. The diplomats believe that, in view of such an outcome of the Security Council session, the NATO bombardment of the Serb positions would represent an aggression, rather than a move towards a peaceful solution to the Bosnian crisis. The (un)expected [as received] outcome of the session also means that Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali was not given permission to order the NATO air strikes. China's Security Council representative openly said that Peking [as received] opposes the NATO bombardment. In talks with British Prime Minister John Major, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that a solution to the Bosnian crisis cannot be sought without Russia. The diplomats in Belgrade believe that Peking's and Moscow's firm stands were clearly decisive for the outcome of the latest Security Council session. In the meantime, the world has already started the countdown for the NATO ultimatum. In NATO bases in Italy there are as many as 170 war planes. Four more days remain until the deadline expires, but it is uncertain whether NATO will attack the Serb positions around Sarajevo without a direct Security Council decision. Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who was in Belgrade on Tuesday, said that the NATO ultimatum cannot be interpreted as directed only against the Bosnian Serbs. He claims that the ultimatum was given to all three warring sides. Papoulias' interpretation is identical to NATO's decision to threaten the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims with air strikes unless they withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo to 20 km away from the city's centre. However, everyone abroad is speaking only about the ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, while the Muslims and Croats are not mentioned at all. Croatia also faces sanctions if it fails to comply with a U.N. demand to pull out its regular troops from Bosnia by February 16. However, Croatia is hardly likely to meet this demand and it is even more improbable that it will be punished for this because some Western countries have already come up with reasons for Croatia's failure to withdraw. They are saying that the presence of regular Croat troops in Bosnia is good because they are "holding back" the Bosnian Croat forces.
