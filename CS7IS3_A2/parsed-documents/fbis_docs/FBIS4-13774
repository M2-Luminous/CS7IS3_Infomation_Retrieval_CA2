The motion to this effect was moved by the law minister, Syed Iqbal Haider. Initiating the debate, the leader of the opposition, Mr. Nawaz Sharif, was critical of the government's action and announced that the opposition will boycott the proceedings of the house till the measures taken in the NWFP are withdrawn and a special committee of the house headed by an opposition member is set up to investigate into the Mehran Bank scandal. He then led a walkout by the members of the opposition. Taking part in the debate, the law minister, Syed Iqbal Haider, explained in detail the circumstance that led to the present situation in the NWFP. He said steps taken in the provinces have been necessitated to protect and strengthen the democratic process, rule of law, and the Constitution. The basic issue in the NWFP is who enjoys majority. Only the majority has the right to rule the province. The law minister said the PDF [People's Democratic Front] emerged as the largest parliamentary alliance in the NWFP assembly following the October 1993 elections. [Former NWFP Chief Minister] Pir Sabir Shah, the law minister pointed out, formed the government in the province by purchase of loyalties, but could not satisfy the members who supported him. The PDF and independent members moved a vote of no-confidence against the chief minister in February when he lost the confidence of the majority. The law minister said tabling of the no-confidence motion was a constitutional step, but Mr. Sabir Shah did not face the motion in a democratic and constitutional manner. Syed Iqbal Haider said the order of the governor asking the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence was perfectly within the ambit of the Constitution. It should have been implemented in a democratic way. The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said with the election of the new leaders of the house in the NWFP assembly, sense of stability has surfaced in Pakistan's politics. The new leader of the house was elected following the delivery of verdict on the same issue by the Supreme Court and, therefore, the process contains no ambiguity, she said, adding the process has paved the way for strengthening democratic institutions and bringing about stability in the country. Talking to newsmen in Islamabad today, the prime minister said the opposition has reacted to the development in the NWFP by walking out from the provincial assembly. She said this is one of the methods of registering protests and it is the right of the opposition to protest, but we feel the rule of majorities is an important principle in parliamentary form of government. When her attention was drawn toward the opposition's demand for constituting a house committee on the affairs of Mehran Bank with its chairman from the opposition benches, the prime minister said the nation has witnessed massive loot from Taj Company, investment companies, cooperatives, corporations, and Mehran Bank scandal. She said we are not dealing with the matter on individual basis. We have authorized the State bank to plug all financial irregularities whether they are committed by politicians or by other citizens.
