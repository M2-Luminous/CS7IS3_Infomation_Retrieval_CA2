Furthermore, Greece has even threatened that it will prevent other neighboring states from helping the former Yugoslav republic. Indeed, Athens even wanted Bulgaria to join its punitive measures. Greece's desire to force Skopje to accept its conditions is understandable. One can also understand the Papandreou government's efforts to please radical nationalists, who accuse him of feebleness toward the former Yugoslav republic. However, why should other states that have good relations with Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] be involved in all this? The answer might be that the end justifies the means. Greece, however, seems to forget that one means of resolving problems is dialogue. Nevertheless, it appears that the dialogue will not be resumed soon, because Skopje has made resuming the dialogue with Greece conditional on the lifting of the embargo. Until then, as was the case with last year's blockade of the oil barges in Thessaloniki, Sofia will try to alleviate Macedonia's economic problems. Sofia will do this regardless of Athens' displeasure. After all, Greece still cannot forgive Bulgaria for being the first state to recognize Macedonia's independence. Naturally, Greece has the right to try to incorporate Bulgaria in its plans. On the other hand, Sofia also has the right to refuse to participate in those plans. Having been burned by fire in past because of other people's sins, however, Sofia should beware the new fire.
