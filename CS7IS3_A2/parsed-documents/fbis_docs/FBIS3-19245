This is even the case along the Rhine between eastern France and southwestern Germany. "Meaningful regional politics here must be politics that transcend the border," says Lord Mayor Boehme of Freiburg. The western limits of this city in Baden extend to within three kilometers of the Rhine and France. Stuttgart, the capital city in the Swabian part of the land, is located 80 kilometers by road to the east, already far enough, it appears, for estrangement and indifference to have set in. "Still today, I feel that it is a gift of history and a great stroke of luck," Boehme writes, that he is received "as a friend" in the department store in Colmar or in the city hall in Mulhouse or Strasbourg, and that he is able to discuss "our problems here without official posturing." Again and again, however, agency heads in Wuerttemberg, including some very capable ministers, have interfered with their friends' efforts. "Why should we give the French money to boot?" one of them said recently. Also the blissful coexistence of the German and French neighbors will suffer if a price is put on it. Municipal leaders and representatives from the German Upper Rhine region and Alsace recently held another of their periodic meetings. At issue was a project affecting both these regions which was to have cost 50,000 German marks [DM]. According to the notes taken by the lord mayor of Freiburg, the German side was represented by members of the land government in Stuttgart and their responsible officials, important people, since they administer the finances "and in the final analysis decide on the fate of the projects." Representing the French side were, above all, Alsatian mayors and their employees, in many cases "intelligent and distinguished" men, "fluent in both languages and at home in both cultures." "Well now, Mister Mayor!" Cautiously, at first, the pros and cons of the project had been discussed. At some point, however, senior public servant Mueller from Stuttgart could not remain seated any longer--he jumped up, fixed his eyes on the aged mayor of Colmar, Gerrer, and bellowed out: "Wouldn't just 30,000 do the trick?" The reference was to German marks. "I felt ashamed," recalls administrative chief Boehme, who was also a Bundestag representative for ten years and then a parliamentary state secretary in Bonn. All this might perhaps not even have been necessary. In 1945, the French had marched into the regions of the Upper Rhine and along the section of the river between Basel and Lake Constance, and this had brought not only privations. "We young people," recalls Boehme, who was born in Konstanz, "at that time ventured into the realm of French culture, a realm which from then one kept everyone from our generation firmly in its grip." And now the European internal market is offering opportunities which transcend the old boundaries. But business deals are not everything. To this day, European progress remains an administrative snail. The truth is that mayors, representatives, and district councillors from Baden feel closer to Strasbourg than to Stuttgart. Here, too, lies the serious crux of the "Baden question," a question which has now come back with a vengeance in the land. Freiburg is now growing and flourishing. When the smokestacks in Swabia were still vying with each other to see which one could put out more smoke, the services metropolis in Baden had been smiled at condescendingly. But it was precisely the small number of manufacturing trades which in the end made the community less dependent on economic fluctuations. Where until recently the city's effluents were still seeping into the ground, a new city district is being built, ten thousand people are to find housing there, soon the 200,000th inhabitant will be welcomed to the city. The city is going places, but where is there to go with its belly up against the Rhine? Karlsruhe is flourishing. With no-nonsense steadfastness, Lord Mayor Seiler brought an economic boom to the old royal seat, the likes of which very few German cities have experienced during the last ten years. But what else is there? In Karlsruhe is the royal residence, so the song of the Badeners goes, "in Mannheim, the factory." Mannheim, in northern Baden, will have to take care that it will be left with a few factories. Rastatt is bracing itself against decline, and Baden-Baden, once an internationally known spa, is losing its luster. One's own efforts, even the most forceful, are now increasingly encountering limits, complains Professor Seiler, a political economist respected not only in Karlsruhe. "We are being deprived of the centrality to which we are entitled." Early on, already, numerous land agencies, including free-lance chambers, municipal associations, and industrial organizations, were pulled out and moved to Stuttgart. It is true, Seiler stated, that the state theaters in Stuttgart claim more public funds than those in Karlsruhe and Mannheim combined. The flow into the Swabian interior has become ever stronger, he stated: DM1.4 billion of the land's money is to be spent on the expansion of the airport on Swabian soil. DM5 million, possibly a little more, is to be made available for a regional airport in northern Baden (in Soellingen). The list is a long one, and fiscal and tax law expert Boehme has no desire to go through it in detail. But he does want to talk about "centralistic stupidities." The central Neckar region, with its classical machine construction and automobile and automotive supplier industries, "all this is out," his agency maintains. For some time, already, decentralized, flexible structures have been required. What is needed more and more is an intelligent production that is compatible with the "environment and human beings." "This here," attorney Boehme, referring to the Rhine basin, is convinced, "this is the future." Here only the West European card can be trump. It is in the hands of the Germans and the French. Why does one not play this card? In 1953, Baden and Wuerttemberg were joined as states, naturally for reasons of expediency. As late as 1970, it had taken a plebiscite to placate the "old Baden" resistance that was still flaring up against the hyphenated makeshift construction of Baden-Wuerttemberg. But the land has never really become one--the financial and mental differences prevailing there, and the pride taken in these differences, have historical roots. The wish for more "freedom" and "autonomy" was heard much sooner in the grand duchy of Baden than in the rigidly regulated state of the Wuerttemberg kings. The promises of the French Revolution had their effect along the Rhine. Since then the Swabians have been viewed not only by the residents of Baden as efficient, but sometimes also grimly determined, workers. "Work imperialists," Theodor Eschenburg once lovingly called them. The residents of Baden see themselves mainly as quieter, more creative, and more imaginative. But again and again they have also been on the losing end, and not just in the dual confederation. They have always been willing to give in, even if only for a good glass of wine. Small occurrences in everyday municipal life in western European border regions are sometimes more revealing than polished papers of the government. Lord Mayor Boehme of Freiburg now plans to concern himself more with contacts with Alsatian politicians and with the project of a "Bi-Lingua-Zone," a project that is to promote linguistic understanding at least directly along the Rhine. Itinerant lecturer Oskar Lafontaine, who in other respects is not easily irritated, expressed concerns recently while in the region that Germany and France might drift apart permanently. Not far from Freiburg, in Colmar, Prime Minister Balladur recently raised his bushy eyebrows, sounded warnings against the creation of cross-border dependencies, and called on the residents of eastern France to strengthen the nation above all. The German-French border region--where the postulates of increased municipal capabilities to create and act, of autonomy, and of "subsidiarity" would have had a special meaning--feels itself without an appropriate role: Even along the upper Rhine, the "Europe of regions" has remained an icon. That, too, has caused old dissatisfactions to resurface in the extreme southwestern region of many.
