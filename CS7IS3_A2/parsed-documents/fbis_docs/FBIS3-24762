Thousands of Rhodies, as they are known, fled to South Africa. They are now worried about developments there and are thinking of returning, but the Zimbabwe Government has plans to tighten up its immigration laws. On the line to Harare, Alice Martin asked (Fry Mgazi) what the new government proposals were: [Begin recording] [(Mgazi)] Well, the proposals will be tabled in parliament very shortly, and there are four major ones that I would mention here: First of all, Zimbabwean-born noncitizens will lose their automatic right to live in the country, and, secondly, the government will now have the power to stop what are called marriages of convenience, whereby people get married in order to stay in this country. The other changes that are very interesting include the listing of a number of crimes, if convicted for which somebody can be declared a prohibited immigrant and, perhaps most interesting of all, is [word indistinct] 10 years for immigrants to be regarded as permanent residents. At present, it only takes two years of local residence in this country, but now it is going to take 10 years. [Martin] Who do you think these laws are aimed at? [(Mgazi)] The one that has raised eyebrows is the one that says that people will now lose the automatic right to live in this country, even if they are Zimbabwean-born noncitizens. Now, that is likely to affect most of all people who were resident in Rhodesia, then, because most of them were ex-Rhodesians who either emigrated to South Africa or Britain soon after independence. [sentence as heard] A lot of them have been applying to come back to Zimbabwe, unsuccessfully, but once this change becomes law, as it is widely expected to be in a very short space of time, then it is going to be extra difficult for them to come back and live in Zimbabwe again. [Martin] What is the position on their properties and their land? Would they just be trying to reclaim properties they had before? Is that what the point of this immigration law is about? [(Mgazi)] Not really, but when some of them left, they did not sell their properties. A large number of them did, but the majority did not. They either left relatives or friends in charge of their properties, so when they come back, it is not a question of them having to look for new properties as such. They will be coming back to their old properties. [Martin] What is public opinion like, on this issue? [(Mgazi)] Strangely enough, no voices of disapproval have been heard. I mean, it is two days since the proposal [word indistinct] were published in the government gazette, but as yet nobody has been heard to voice any disapproval of government intention to overhaul the Immigration Act. I mean, even the political parties who are known to oppose anything that government does....[pauses] If there is any resentment, it will be targeted at the ex-Rhodesians who left after independence because the main reason why they left was that they could not live under black majority rule and they decided to go to settle in South Africa. But black majority is imminent in South Africa, and they are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. [end recording]
