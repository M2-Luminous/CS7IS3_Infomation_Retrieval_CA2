However, Kravchuk felt the Russian and Ukrainian vessels must use different naval facilities. The Ukrainian fleet could be based in Balaklava. Kravchuk said he kept in touch with the Ukrainian delegation to the Sevastopol negotiations. He said the Russian and Ukrainian Defense ministers had agreed on a formula for the solution of the existing problems on the basis of the Yalta, Zavidovo and Massandra decisions. In Kravchuk's view, both the Russian and Ukrainian fleets must make use of Sevastopol's repair docks given that 82 percent of the Black Sea's infrastructure is in that city. If, however, the two Defense ministers failed to reach agreement, Kravchuk said he would meet to resolve the problem with his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin. The problem of the Black Sea Fleet is to be resolved at any cost, said Kravchuk.
