When it concluded, political observers described it as more of a political meeting than a technical one. This is because for the first time the despotic regime of Palestine was permitted to participate in an intraregional conference held in one of the Persian Gulf countries. This broke the traditional boundaries between the said regime and the conservative Arabs of the region. The Omanis do not seem very pleased with such an appraisal by political observers, because they sought to project the invitation for Israel to participate in the Muscat session as being within the framework of "a specialized task and to use that regime's experiences with regard to water use and nothing else." However, in a calculated move the Israelis sent their deputy foreign minister, Yosi Beilin--who is known for participating in covert talks--as head of the delegation, along with 19 correspondents. These preliminary actions indicate that although the topic of the meeting is water, this was merely a pretext for implementing a political purpose. Thus, Beilin's mission can be construed as part of the moves known as "confidence-building measures" in order to create a psychological atmosphere in the Persian Gulf region. [passage omitted] Perhaps at first glance the connection between the longstanding intention of the usurpers of Jerusalem to dominate the area from the Nile to the Euphrates and the holding of this conference on water may not seem very clear. However, if we think about it deeply we will see that they are steps in the same direction. This is because, with the Jewish government gaining a foothold in the Persian Gulf region and access to the markets and economies of the shaykhdoms in this region, this entity and its territorial covetousness can get a desired show case. Thus, in a way it can have the reins of the Arab reactionaries from the land of the Nile to the shores of the Euphrates at its disposal. The reactionary Arab shaykhs and rulers are fully aware that the breeding and multiplication of an evil spore such as Israel in the region will naturally pave the way for the infiltration of neocolonialism, the forerunners of which imposed that old Methuselah called colonialism on the people of the region in bygone centuries and in this century too. However, the real loser in this imbalance will be the same shaykhs and rulers who have been exposed by the Islamic awakening and who see their hereditary governments being swept away by the wind. The Islamic awakening will wipe out this neocolonialism when it comes into the arena with its sword, and it is here that yet another intifadah will emerge.
