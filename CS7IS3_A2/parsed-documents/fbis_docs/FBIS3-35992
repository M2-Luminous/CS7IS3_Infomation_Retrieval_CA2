Our station observer has the following comment on the outcome of his visit: The talks and meetings held in Beijing, as well as documents signed there, have shown that both sides have made important strides in strengthening and deepening the Russian-Chinese bilateral relations. They have formulated active measures including common understanding on developing their partnership in economic cooperation and trade, and have resolved important border issues. Eventually, they have agreed to hold the second Russian-Chinese summit in Moscow in 1994. In short, Russia's foreign policy has been attaching -- previously and currently -- top priority to Russian-Chinese relations. However, the impact of the Russian Foreign Minister's visit to China was not limited to Russian-Chinese bilateral relations. The Russian Foreign Ministry publicly reiterated that the Russian Foreign Minister's visit to China has striven to further strengthen peace and security throughout the whole Asia-Pacific region. First, from Russia's viewpoint, the Asia-Pacific region has become more and more important to Russia's future. Russia has in the past, as now, regarded relations with members of the Asia-Pacific region as multilateral. Therefore, Russia has maintained sound relations with all countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The same principle has been reflected in Russia's treaties with China, India, and the Republic of Korea, and in Russia's ties with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Russia's relations with Japan, with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and with other countries of the Asia-Pacific region have all been established under the same principle. Kozyrev said: At present, the Asia-Pacific region faces the least likelihood of large-scale conflicts since the end of the World War II. However, the threat exists in the region whereby new tense situations may occur, and existing tense situations may worsen. An example in this regard is the resumption of civil war in Cambodia. I believe that both Russia and China can facilitate an end to the bloody conflicts in Cambodia. Nowadays, other issues bothering the Asia-Pacific region include the possibility of extracting and developing abundant resources in the Pacific Ocean, including the extraction of undersea oil and natural gas that have already been discovered, and that have been termed as very massive. I should remind our listeners: Some countries of the Asia-Pacific region have, for a long time, failed to peacefully resolve territorial disputes over some coral islands in the South China Sea. Many border conflicts among countries of the Asia-Pacific region have yet to be settled. Religious and national radicalism still have an impact on the relations among countries in the region. In summary, just as Kozyrev stressed during his visit in China: If we do not promptly handle all these problems, we will face the danger of a very powerful explosion. The Asia-Pacific region has not been spared the threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons and rocket technology. First, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and rocket technology does not suit the interests of Russia, China, and India. Therefore, the unsettled nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is particularly bothersome. Russia proposed to establish, at different stages, a common security system in Asia. Russia proposed establishing a conflict- prevention center and a regional research organization that studies related work. Kozyrev's visit to China has demonstrated once again: While pursuing its foreign policy, Russia does not intend to facilitate a West-East confrontation, or to show favoritism to either side. Only by adhering to a balanced foreign policy can Russia safeguard its accomplishments in the international arena.
