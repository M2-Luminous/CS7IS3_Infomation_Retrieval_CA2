FR940819-2-00100 FR940819-2-00066 The Anticompetitive Effects of Microsoft's Conduct 35. Microsoft's exclusionary contracting practices have had the effect of excluding competitors on a basis other than competition on the merits and have thereby allowed Microsoft illegally to perpetuate its monopoly in the PC operating system market. 36. Through the unlawful acts and practices described above Microsoft has harmed competition, consumers and innovation: a. Microsoft has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the PC operating system market. b. Microsoft's exclusionary conduct has significantly impeded the ability of rival operating systems to compete in the PC operating system market. Competitors find it more difficult to convince OEMs to offer and/or promote their product and must incur greater marketing expenses to penetrate the market. Microsoft raised hurdles to fair competition even higher through unreasonably restrictive non-disclosure agreements. c. Microsoft's exclusionary licenses deprive rival PC operating systems of a significant number of sales that they might otherwise secure. These lost sales impede the ability of PC operating systems to develop an installed base sufficient to convince OEMs to bundle the new system with their hardware, to convince ISVs to write applications that run on the new system, and to convince users that the system is, and will remain, a viable alternative to the existing MS&hyph;DOS and Windows standard. d. Microsoft's conduct also substantially lengthens the period of time required for competitors to recover their development costs and earn a profit, and increases the risk that an entry attempt will fail. In combination, all of these factors deter entry by competitors and thus harm competition. 37. The harm to competition caused by Microsoft's unlawful conduct harms consumers. OEMs that do offer customers a choice of operating systems may charge customers a higher price for PCs with non-Microsoft operating systems in order to be able to pay the double royalty necessitated by the Microsoft per processor agreements. Thus, users who do not receive a Microsoft operating system are still, indirectly, paying Microsoft. 38. In addition, Microsoft's unlawful conduct has deterred the development of competing operating systems, depriving consumers of a choice of systems with possibly superior features. Similarly, the slower growth of competing operating systems has slowed the development and diffusion of applications designed to work on non-Microsoft operating systems and has limited choices of consumers and users of PCs. 39. Those injured by Microsoft's conduct will continue to suffer such injury unless the relief prayed for herein is granted. First Claim for Relief_Sherman Act ยง2 40. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 39 above. 41.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 39 above. 44. The licensing agreements and unnecessarily restrictive non-disclosure agreements described above constitute contracts and combinations which unreasonably restrain trade in the market for PC operating systems, which affect interstate trade and commerce, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง1. Prayer for Relief Wherefore, Plaintiff Prays For Relief As Follows: 1. That the Court adjudge and decree that Microsoft has monopolized the interstate trade and commerce in the market for PC operating systems in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. 2. That the Court adjudge and decree that Microsoft has entered into unlawful contracts and combinations which unreasonably restrain the trade in interstate commerce in PC operating systems, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 3.
