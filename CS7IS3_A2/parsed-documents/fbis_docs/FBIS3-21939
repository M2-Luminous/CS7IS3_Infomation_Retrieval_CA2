A street corner ambush Noon. 8 September 1993. In the busiest part of central Nanning, the capital of Guangxi, Gonghe Road was as busy as usual, with people going to or returning from work. The bustling about was never-ending. In front of the Telecommunications Bureau, an ordinary looking middle-aged man was squatting on his heels by a flight of steps, reading a newspaper. At a small cigarette booth to the left, a young man was haggling with the vendor over a slight rise in the price. Over 40 meters away, another young man was angry that his motorcycle was leaking oil. Two more young men were wiping away their perspiration with napkins, while complaining of the "too hot weather", and drinking from cans of chilled honey peach juice.... At 1240, a man in a T-shirt driving a woman's red "Haomai" brand motorcycle, with a fine black combination lock briefcase on its back, sped out of a small lane into Gonghe road, and rapidly proceeded north along Gonghe Road. Just at that moment, the middle-aged man who had been reading his newspaper stood up, seemingly aimlessly. Rolling up the newspaper, he slapped it twice against his palm. At once, the people who had been buying cigarettes, repairing the motorcycle, or having cold drinks all got on their motorcycles, and followed the red "Haomai" motorcycle. At that time, the man was radiant with happiness and immensely proud. Less than 20 minutes before, he had reached agreement with a big businessman from Guangzhou on a "deal" which had earned him several hundred thousand yuan in less than two days! With the money in his wallet, he was proud and happy, feeling as if he were suddenly sitting on a gold mountain. But it didn't last long. He saw that a car ahead of him was disabled, and with a lot of police "checking" there, he said to himself that it was "a collision--bad luck," and rapidly turned towards the intersection of Gonghe Road and Beining Street, trying to sneak away. But the five motorcyclists following him just surrounded him in the center of the road. Two strong young men jumped upon him from both sides, and handcuffed him tightly. Another young man quickly seized the black briefcase, took a fast look at the lock and with rapid and practiced movements opened, and then immediately closed it, a scornful smile on his face. The man suddenly changed from looking immensely proud to deathly pale, and began to sweat. He then was unable to stand, and collapsed. "Take him away!" The entire arresting process had taken only three minutes. It was over so quickly that bystanders were still unaware of what had happened. As recently as just one month before, the Nanning Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB) received some intelligence: Someone was selling large quantities of highly concentrated heroin in the metropolitan area. With perfect arrangements and controls, and after a 72 hour stakeout, the scene in the street occurred. The man reading the newspaper was the head of the drug enforcement squad of the Nanning PSB, Police Supervisor Second Class Xie Yiqi [6220 0122 1142]. The young men who participated in apprehending this drug dealer were the Assistant Head of the Drug Enforcement Squad Nong Jingyao [6593 6855 1031] and 10 other excellent detectives from the Drug Enforcement Squad. The street ambush in the end accomplished this: The confiscation of 12 parcels of concentrated "Double Lion Global Brand" heroin, 3,900 grams total. Calculated on the retail price in the United States black market at the beginning of this decade, 3,900 grams of heroin could be sold for $8 million. Even if it were sold in Hong Kong, it could still bring in tremendous profits of more than $3 million. But the police did not seem particularly happy about getting this large quantity of drugs. This was because the battle had only started. 2. Victory is followed by hot pursuit The drug dealer was taken into the interrogation room. There were only chairs and a table in the room, and the walls were painted a snowy white. The only thing catching the eye were eight words posted on a wall: "Leniency to those who confess their crimes and severity to those who refuse". The old, veteran detective Huang Feng [7806 2800], already greying at the temples, has piercing eyes even when he isn't mad. Now, he opened the black briefcase and lay the drugs on the table, staring at the drug dealer's eyes without saying one word. The young detective Li Kai [2621 0418] kept to the side, awaiting his time to pressure the criminal. The atmosphere in the room was very tense. Minute by minute, the time passed by. Gradually, the drug dealer's will fell apart, he could hold out no longer, so he yelled, "I want to confess! I'm guilty! I beg the government give me a break, give me a chance to do something worthwhile to make up for my crimes..." The drug dealer (called "A" from here on for short) confessed that he was 32 years old this year, of the Han nationality, with a junior middle school education. He was the son of a worker in a suburban Nanning work unit. In 1983, he was sentenced to three years for larceny, and was released in 1986 after serving his sentence. He then went to Ruili, Yunnan, where he married a local woman, and lived with her in housing of a work unit in a north Nanning suburb. Huang Feng interrogated him directly, "How many drugs have you sold in Nanning in all?" A was flustered, but still wanted to cover up: "Just the 12 parcels, no more than that, no more..." Huang Feng snorted. "No more than that? Would you like me to bring you a witness to confirm that? You had better be a little more clear-minded. We caught you out of a city of a million people; that's not something we did casually." A knew quite well that the business he was involved in was dangerous, so he was always very careful. He couldn't understand why he still couldn't shake the drug enforcement police off his trail, even though he had changed his expression and movements several tens of times over the past month. What had gone wrong? However, he did understand that since the PSB already knew so much about his activities, if he didn't tell the truth, he would suffer the consequences of "severity to those who refuse." In the end, A started to confess. After A had been released when his sentence expired, he moved to Ruili, Yunnan, and made his living by cheating, defrauding, and swindling. He very soon met a drug dealer named Yang Anquan [2799 1344 0356]. In July, 1993, A and Yang Anquan shipped 8,500 g of heroin from Ruili to Nanning and sold it there. In addition to the 12 parcels of 3,900 grams of heroin which had been seized, others had been sold, and 270,000 yuan in illicit money had been brought to Yunnan three days before. Before his departure, Yuan told A that he had another 20 parcels of heroin which he would market in Nanning later. From many years experience in public security work, Huang Feng was certain that A had not told him everything, so he kept on pressing him. "Tell me, who bought drugs from you in Nanning? Don't expect to sneak away!" This made A collapse. "Well, I...I thought of..." A had to confess more about his crimes. On the same night, five officers, including detectives Zeng Xuyan [2582 2485 1750] and He Daguang [0149 1129 0342], drove directly to the suburb of Yanzhiling, where they knocked at a resident's house. Just as they were going in, Zheng Xuyan shouted loudly: "Brother He! Brother Yun! How about we do some business!" The drug dealers Pan Hefei [3382 7729 7378] and his brother Pan Yunfei [3382 0061 7378] were playing cards under the light. Hearing the shout, they raised their heads. The men before them now had never come there before, so they were puzzled: "We don't know any of you brothers, and we don't know what kind of business you want us do?" Zheng Xuyan was still all smiles: "We're sure this business will be done. But I know you'll definitely be the loser in it!" He then yelled: "Go!" Acting in pairs, the four other policemen grabbed each of the drug dealing Pan brothers. They were easily handcuffed, then escorted to the police car. After nabbing the Nanning drug dealers, the tracking squad then began a long distance, direct trip to Yunnan. On 10 September at 1300, two police cars quietly left Nanning. Riding in them were the Assistant Head Nong Jingyao, and the rest of his outstanding detectives: Zhen Xuyan, Li Jiansheng [2621 1696 3932], Liao Bin [1675 2430], Tan Ping [6223 1627], He Daguang, Li Kai, Tan Yiqing [6223 0110 0282], Gu Wenyong [7357 2429 0516], and Li Shihong [2621 0013 1347]. They arrived in Yunnan in the midst of the rainy season. The road zigzagged through the tropical rainy forest, and for one 10 km stretch the roadbed had caved in, greatly delaying their driving time. To catch all the criminals in the case, the tracking squad continued their trip by day and night, despite fatigue and bad weather. When they arrived in the city of Ruili on 15 September, it was already dusk. 3. By intelligence and courage On the morning of 16 September, Detectives Tan and Li, in the guise of big businessmen, and along with the drug dealer A, checked into a very luxurious hotel in Ruili. The next afternoon, according to plan, they went with A to meet Yang Anquan at his home. Although Yang Anquan was only 27 years old, his long time in the underworld had made him very wary. He looked at the two businessmen suspiciously, and immediately rejected them: "I don't have any of that stuff, you'd better look somewhere else!" Afraid of losing his chance to atone for his crimes through performing meritorious services, A hurried to say, "Didn't you say you have 20 more parcels of the stuff? How can you deny it when I've brought these businessmen such a long way? Do you want to make us go back empty-handed?" Yang Anquan flatly denied it. "Did I say that? Maybe you heard me wrong!" Tan knew how to handle people like Yang Anquan: give them more latitude at first, to keep a tighter rein on them afterwards. Therefore, he said, "Since Mr. Yang doesn't want to do any business, why should we bother him? Let's go!" The three of them confidently started to leave. But just as the three of them were getting into their car, Yang called after them: "Wait a minute! Where do you live?" Detective Li smiled to himself; the fish was taking the bait. He pretended not to show interest: "In the xx Hotel, room xx. But since you don't have the stuff, why bother!" Yang Anquan tried to make up to them: "I'm sorry, I was boasting last time. Actually, the goods are there, but somebody else has them, and besides, the goods are in Myanmar. If you two want to do some business, I can introduce you." It was found out later that the reasons Yang Anquan refused right at that moment were, one, he was being cautious, and two, he wanted to get rid of A and keep all the profits for himself. But then when he saw how close A was to the "businessmen," he realized that was impossible, so he had to change his mind, and decided to share the profits with A. On 18 September, Yang Anquan twice went to see the detectives, negotiating with them as the representative of the owner. Tan and Li used high performing skills in bargaining with him. Yang Anquan said, "The owner wants you to pay a 60,000 yuan advance deposit." Tan replied, "Nonsense!" We haven't seen the goods yet, or him, so why should we give you 60,000 yuan up front? If you take off with the money, where do we look for you?" Li chimed in on Tan's side. "What? Are you dreaming, don't you know the rules? The money is handed over while checking the goods! It's always been done that way!" A, who was ambitious to earn merit points, also frequently interrupted to blame Yang Anquan. Seeing that the other side was so sophisticated, Yang Anquan believed they were real buyers. Expecting to make a great deal of money soon, his enthusiasm for this deal grew. At last, they reached an agreement to pay only a 30,000 yuan deposit, which Yang would pay for them, expecting to be repaid later. He would bring the owner of the drugs across the border the next day to contact them. B [the drug owner] was a large man, tough-looking and menacing. Many years of rough experience in the underworld had made him a typical desperado. But he was not suspicious this time, since he had safely done business with Yang Anquan on numerous prior occasions. So, as soon as he entered the room, he asked: "Did you two businessmen bring enough money?" "Name a price," said Tan. B lifted his middle finger. "200,000 yuan!" With a cold smile, Tan said, "We didn't bring that much. We initially agreed in Nanning that we would get the goods, so why should we have to bring so much money here?" B insisted that the goods would not be shipped from Myanmar unless he saw the money first. At the same time, our side insisted on not paying before seeing the goods. The "negotiations" broke up in discord. Nong Jingguang immediately reported the situation to the Nanning PSB, and his superiors there instructed him to accept the conditions. The following day, the detectives returned to the "negotiations", and told B that they agreed to his demand to "see the money before shipping the goods", but our side still insisted on "paying for the goods on receipt." Although the "negotiations" had succeeded, it was not easy to raise 200,000 yuan in cash in so little time. The drug enforcement squads of the Yunnan Dehong Dai Nationality Jinpo Autonomous Prefecture and the Ruili PSB gave them their full support, and helped their police comrades from Guangxi raise the 200,000 yuan in a very short time. On 24 September, a mysterious person unobtrusively entered a hotel in Ruili, carrying two heavy suitcases. On the afternoon of 25 September, when these two suitcases filled with cash were opened in front of Yang Anquan and B, these two money-loving people suddenly emitted spittle three feet in length--drooling with envy, they agreed with great pleasure to ship the goods as soon as they had returned to Myanmar. So, after 10 full days and 12 contacts, negotiations, and repeated arguments, Yang Anquan and B would send the real goods. At that time, it was only six days before the Moon Festival and National Day, a time when every family gets together to enjoy the moon and their affection for each other. This meant that the tracking squad would be far from Nanning and missing their families. On the night of the Moon Festival, when the beautiful bright moon had just risen, someone knocked at the rooms where the detectives were staying. The visitor gave them a package of food and said, significantly, "`Dad' let me bring you some moon cakes. `Dad' says that everything is O.K. at home, and he just wants you to concentrate on the `business' and come back home." Every detective in the tracking group understood that this was a gesture of caring on the part of their organization. It gave them such a warm feeling, eating the authentic Lianrong moon cakes from their hometown, and there was sweetness in their hearts. 4. All-out attack The days had passed, but B had still not returned from his secret trip back to Myanmar. Waiting on the Chinese border, Yang Anquan had grown anxious and worried. Had something gone wrong? Yang Anquan couldn't stand waiting any more, so he went to Myanmar. Nong Jingyao and his tracking squad held an emergency discussion: We still have the money, the drug dealers won't sneak away without getting the money. Because the money is their only objective, they will definitely come back for it. Finally, after another eight days had passed, Yang Anquan and B met again as arranged. They solemnly announced that the goods were all set, and would be shipped. What had happened was that during this time, Yang Anquan and B had been looking for cotton and rattan in Myanmar; the plan was to hide the goods inside cotton or rattan for shipment through China's border customs. On the morning of 18 October, B hid the drugs inside the cotton, and drove to the customs on the China border. When he learned that cotton was subject to a strict, 5-day quarantine examination, he became frightened and quietly went back. It was really a problem. The tracking group reported it to the Dehong Prefecture PSB and the Ruili PSB. In the meantime, they kept on observing, waiting for their chance. On 22 October at 0900, Yang Anquan and B suddenly appeared and asked that Tan go with B to inspect the goods. Yang Anquan stayed behind with Li and A. Things had suddenly taken a very dangerous turn: Tan would have to go to the drug dealing site; what would happen? Li would stay behind, but what if A, the drug dealers' one-time associate, was hot to deal with them, and pulled a double-cross? Even more important, they hadn't received the drugs yet, did not even know where they were. If the drug dealers escaped, they would be far short of success for lack of a final effort. If we don't take action now, what are we waiting for? Nong Jingyao made up his mind at once, and immediately divided the tracking squad into two groups, one going by car and motorcycles, following Tan's route and reacting as events unfolded. The other group stayed behind, responsible for arresting the remaining drug dealers. Detective Zhen Xuyan burst into the hotel room, and gave an eye signal to Li. Acting simultaneously, the two grabbed Yang Anquan, who had no time to react, and wrestled him to the floor. Detectives Li Jiansheng and Liao Bing rushed in, rapidly handcuffed Yang Anquan and A, and escorted them to another room for close surveillance. Meanwhile, B had led Tan to a freight yard. There was nothing in the yard, no trucks at all. The goods had disappeared! Leaving Tan there, B left hurriedly on a motorcycle. Nong Jingyao, who had been following them, saw that Tan was all right, and waved to indicate that he would continue to observe the situation. Certain that B would return to the hotel regardless of whether he found the goods, Tan took a taxi back to the hotel. After searching everywhere for his missing rented truck, B decided that our detectives were not underworld figures, but outsiders who had stolen the drugs. Furious, he returned to the hotel to find the "businessmen" and settle accounts. Entering the room, and finding both A and Yang Anquan had disappeared, he realized something was wrong and tried to escape. Tan and Li jumped into his way, and at first tried to place him under arrest. But B resisted so fiercely that they were unable to restrain him at once. The sharp-witted Li Kai joined in the struggle, and taking out his pistol beat B roughly about the head. The three detectives used their fists, elbows, and feet, and finally subdued the crazy B after more than 10 minutes' of fierce fighting. B completely lost his ability to resist, and collapsed to the floor. Both Yang Anquan and B had been apprehended, but where were the drugs? "Search!" The emergency order went out immediately on the radio waves. Police from the Ruili PSB and other Yunnan police agencies, who had been standing by for some time, were divided into more than 10 searching parties. Like lightning, they ran out to every parking lot and freight yard. Meanwhile, three other squads went separately to arrest other criminals--Yang Anquan's wife, Xiao Rong [2556 2837], was arrested at her home while playing majhong with a neighbor. Li and two other police officers broke down the door, brandishing an arrest warrant. The driver Zhang Xinping [1728 2450 1627], who had been responsible for transporting the drugs, had just returned from a truck parking lot. He hadn't even time to smoke a cigarette before two police officers suddenly appeared, shouting, "Don't move! Come with us." So he was caught. The female drug dealer Meng Shuai [1322 1596] was drinking with her husband in their family's restaurant, when Gu Wenyong [7357 2429 0516] and three other police officers suddenly appeared as if from the air, catching her as well. After a complete and thorough search of each parking lot and freight yard, they still had not found the car carrying the drugs. Nong Jingyao was deeply concerned about the situation. Suddenly, he realized what the problem was, and asked Yang Anquan, "You were there when the drugs were loaded. Tell me! What kind of car was it? What was the number of the car?" Yang Anquan answered, "It was an 8-ton truck, Yellow River make, with the number..." Nong Jingyao's thinking was that the hired driver was unaware of what had happened. The original agreement was to ship the cotton to Nanning, where payment would be made; was it possible that the driver had been too impatient to wait for B to bring people to check the goods, and he left?" Inspired, he at once gave the order: "Follow him to Kunming!" The detectives jumped into the already moving police car and sped off. The road was full of zigzags and slopes, and cave-ins were encountered frequently, but Tan Yiqing was a highly skilled driver and continued to increase his speed, 60 km, 80 km.... More than an hour later, they finally caught up with the Yellow River truck. Tan Yiqing made a beautiful sharp right turn, then slammed on his brakes, bringing the Yellow River truck to a halt. When the car had come to a complete stop, the detectives jumped out and took up positions which blocked the truck's retreat. They carefully searched through 120 individual parcels of cotton. Not until they got to the bottom did they find it: 58 parcels of concentrated heroin, with a gross weight of 20,560 g. So now, the number one drug enforcement case in Guangxi was a complete success, with a total of 24,460 g (24.26 kg) of heroin confiscated, and with the apprehension of eight drug dealers both from within China and from outside its borders. At 1500 on 12 November, as the three police cars carrying the drug dealers drove into the Nanning PSB, several hundred family members, coworkers, and ordinary people welcomed them with applauuse and cheers. Nong Jingyao ordered, "Line up! Salute!" Ten detectives dressed in camouflage at once lined up, and saluted their family members, the national flag, and the people. That image of 10 muscular bodies shining in the afternoon sunshine is deeply etched in people's minds.
