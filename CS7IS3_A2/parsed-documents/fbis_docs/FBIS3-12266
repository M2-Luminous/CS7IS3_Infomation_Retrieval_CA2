On the decisions and recommendations which are expected to result from tonight's meeting, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Yasir 'Arafat and the head of the Palestinian delegation in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the implementation of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, gave the following exclusive statement to this program: [Begin recording] [Sha'th] This is the first major meeting to be held since the terrible massacre perpetrated by the murderous Israeli settlers in the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron. The first responsibility of the PLO is to protect the Palestinian people. So we must discuss this subject in order to arrive at specific recommendations for providing protection for our people -- international protection and protection on the ground by the disarming of the settlers, the disarming of all the settlers, because without this protection cannot be provided for the Palestinian people. In addition to this, we must also study the U.S. call for the negotiations to be held in Washington. We want to know what this call will add to the negotiations, how the change of venue will help to solve the problems facing the peace process, what role the United States will play in the coming negotiations, and at what level the negotiations will be. What are the main subjects -- will they include the protection of the Palestinian people or not? [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Dr. Sha'th, you have announced in statements to the press that future negotiations will focus basically on providing international protection for the Palestinian people so that what happened in Hebron will not recur. In your opinion what form should this international protection take? [Sha'th] Many forms are known to the world. A few weeks ago a massacre occurred in Sarajevo in which the number of victims was similar to the number of Palestinian martyrs in the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron. The result was a change in the international view of the Bosnian issue and of the protection required for the Bosnian people from the Serbs who were threatening the lives of the Bosnian Muslims daily. A minimum level of protection was provided which was not sufficient at all, but it was a minimum threat to the killers so that they would move their guns far from Sarajevo and protection would be provided for the Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo. There are international forces in Bosnia and in many other places -- Sinai, the Syrian-Israeli borders, the Lebanese borders, and others. The agreement we signed in Washington comprises suitable and agreed international protection. Until this moment Israel has been dragging its feet in discussing this item which provides for observers and international troops who will give the minimum protection, in addition to the Palestinian police who must replace the army of occupation when the latter withdraws.
