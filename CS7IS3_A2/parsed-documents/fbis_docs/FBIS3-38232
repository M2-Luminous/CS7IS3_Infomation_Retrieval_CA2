Dlouhy, at the World Economic Forum where he met with EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere and his colleagues, added that the institution wanted to support the Czech Republic's "pro-export" policy through cooperating with the government's Export Guarantee and Insurance Agency, EGAP. Larosiere is much more interested in specific projects than his predecessor, Jacques Attalli, Dlouhy said. The EBRD could, for instance, be less adverse to risks and make the policy of Czech banks more flexible by investing in their shares. Dlouhy went on to say that the Czech Republic had managed to install the fundamental elements of a market economy while keeping its macroeconomic stability high and unemployment low, and achieving a change in its export orientation. The country will now be rated by its economic growth, as are other countries with a market economy, Dlouhy said. "Growth is becoming the basic thing for us."
