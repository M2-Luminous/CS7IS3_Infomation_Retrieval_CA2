The Army has, therefore, achieved its first objective begun on the first of day of 1994, working within the framework of its constitutional duty and in response to the request of the Chiapas government to protect the civilian population and restore security in the state. On the other hand, the changes made 48 hours ago at the presidential cabinet are permitting us to advance in the tasks aimed at promoting actions in favor of peace. The background and determination of the government secretary and the meeting between the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas and various sectors have resulted in broad support for the measures that may end the confrontation. The Catholic Church, as a whole, has expressed its support, as have the members of other churches. The presidential candidates of each of the political parties have pledged to work in favor of peace. The Special Commission of Senators and Deputies has expressed its decision to contribute to the elimination of violence as soon as possible. Different social movements, nongovernment organizations, the media, the country's most important trendsetters in public opinion, intellectuals, and citizens in general are in favor of the search for peace. The government of the Republic is now taking a firm step. Once the security of the region and that of the very members of the Mexican Army has been guaranteed, while attempting to send a clear message of reconciliation, peace, and respect for human rights; taking into consideration the fact that the Mexican Army has already reached the first objective in its constitutional mission to guarantee the security of the region; considering the feelings and opinion of the country; and given the very conviction of the president of the Republic, I, in a responsible way, have decided to suspend armed actions in the state of Chiapas. The Mexican Army will guarantee the tranquility of the residents of these cities and towns. The Army will only respond if attacked. If the armed groups do not end their aggressive actions, the Army will have to defend itself and defend the civilian population. Also, in this kind of situation, it is common that actions are carried out to achieve propaganda objectives. This cannot be ruled out, and we will remain alert. By doing this, the president of the Republic -- the supreme commander of the Armed Forces -- is doing everything possible to seek peace seriously. The most urgent task is to create more room for reconciliation. I fervently hope that this decision of the government of the Republic, which has the support of all of society, is the first step toward saving lives and finding new means of reconciliation. We have the chance to find a solution that can show the extraordinary strength of Mexican society. This is a moment of unity necessary in overcoming a difficult situation. We will continue to bring relief and food to those affected by the confrontation. We will redouble attention given to the social demands of Indian communities, particularly those in the highlands and jungle of Chiapas, with their own participation. We will act to ensure that there is greater justice. I also reiterate that those who have participated in the uprising because of pressure or desperation and who now accept peace and legality will be pardoned. This makes me confident that Mexico will come out stronger. Now let us all act in favor of peace and reconciliation. We therefore demonstrate, with the voice of a united Mexico, that the strength of peace is much greater than any violent group's capacity to do harm. Thank you very much.
