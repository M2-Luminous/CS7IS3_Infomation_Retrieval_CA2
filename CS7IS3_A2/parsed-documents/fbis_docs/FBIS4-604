Expressing confidence that "the greatest show on earth" will take place on time in all regions, IEC officials yesterday detailed its arrangements for the election. The commission has decided to increase the number of voting stations to substantially more than the 9,000 originally planned, opting for more mobile stations. The increase was considered necessary primarily because of the poor state of some roads. Ballot boxes will be taken from voting stations to about 1,000 counting stations countrywide. Each station will be responsible for counting more than 30,000 votes. Counting will begin at 6AM on April 29 and will continue through the night until it is completed. Officials expect the counting to take between 26 and 36 hours. Provisional results will be released hourly from each of the voting stations and will be transmitted to the IEC's Midrand base, where they will be released immediately. Between two and 10 days after the election, the commission will make a declaration about whether ti was free and fair, giving parties the opportunity to lodge complaints. Officials believe it will be impossible to have voting stations in three large areas of Natal, but stations will be placed close to these areas' borders. Transkei is also understood to be creating headaches for the IEC, but officials are confident these difficulties will be resolved. Despite the difficulties setting up an organisation employing more people than Anglo American, officials say planning is falling into place and elections could take place in three regions tomorrow. Meanwhile, the IEC has undertaken to reconsider the number of voting stations in Sandton, after it was pointed out that the provisional list showed only two voting stations had been planned.
