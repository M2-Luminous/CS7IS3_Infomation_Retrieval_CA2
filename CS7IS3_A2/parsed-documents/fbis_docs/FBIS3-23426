In an interview with AL-AHRAM, he said that this terrorist plan has clear features and is targeted against Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, and other Arab states. [passage omitted] Al-Bid said: We cannot allow Yemen to be a way station for exporting terrorism to Egypt, because this hurts us and runs counter to our loyalty to Egypt. It is illogical for us to offer terrorism instead of loyalty. All the plots and sedition being concocted against the Arab nation are also directed at the Islamic nation. In Yemen we are suffering from this terrorist plan opposing unity. We discovered in time that there are several terrorist acts and assassinations aimed at jeopardizing the march of unity. Therefore, it was necessary to adopt a stand against terrorism and those who support it, to protect the Arab nation's unity and solidarity, and to find a logical formula to confront this plan. The secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] said that the Gulf crisis was another factor that affected the unity of Yemen. He wondered about the reasons for the success of some fundamentalist calls and terrorist acts. He said that this success is the result of the existence of basic unresolved problems in some societies. These terrorist elements exploit such situations. They also exploit the youths who are suffering from a moral void and the absence of a pan-Arab concept to cling to. He clarified that despite this, the fundamentalist formula advocating terrorism under the slogan of the true Islamic religion -- which in fact has nothing to do with them -- did not gather momentum by itself. The Afghan experiment does not apply in the Arab world. [passage omitted] Al-Bid concluded his remarks to AL-AHRAM by saying: Some al- Jihad members are in Yemen. I regret that some people are dealing with these terrorists and encouraging them. Details will become known in due time. This cooperation with the terrorists does not serve our cause or honor it. The main terrorist camp is found in Sa'dah in the north. The terrorists also began to assemble in the south but we are able to pursue these terrorists pockets and expose them. However, we find it totally unacceptable that the terrorists should enjoy the support of some people in power and some Army units. When they are left without official support, it will be easy to besiege them and get rid of them.
