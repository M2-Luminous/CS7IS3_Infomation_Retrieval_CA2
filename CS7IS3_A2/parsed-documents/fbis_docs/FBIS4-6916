This was the first attempt to try to find a multilateral prescription to solve the unemployment problem. Nevertheless, it is true that "concrete policy solutions are not easy to come up with" (Treasury Secretary Bentsen). An agreement was made at the meeting that the employment problem will be an important conference topic at July's leading industrial nations meeting (the Naples summit). Japan, being criticized as "exporting unemployment," will therefore experience even greater pressure to open its market and to expand domestic demand. Summarizing the two days of discussions, Treasury Secretary Bentsen made a closing statement to the summit attendees. In it he brought out clearly the difficulties of creating substantive policy while there is a sense of crisis over the problems of employment and unemployment that are common to the nations represented. In his introduction Bentsen pointed out that, "Creating high-quality jobs and lowering unemployment is a common task of (the seven leading industrial nations)." He emphasized the importance of the seven leading industrial nations discussing solutions to the unemployment problem on the same table. In the background of this seems to be the frustration that, although global economic conditions show signs of improvement, the "unemployment rate shows no improvement at all" (Ministry of Labor). As for Europe, the unemployment rate exceeds 10 percent in France, England, and Italy; the long-term unemployment among the youth in particular is a severe problem. In the United States the unemployment rate is above 6 percent, with the disparity in wages widening between those at the top and those at the bottom. Although the unemployment rate in Japan is low compared to the other leading industrial nations, the prolonged economic slump has made it worse. Former Labor Minister Kondo, who advocated an employment summit, reflected that with the nations discussing a common topic in this fashion at a Group of Seven meeting, the finance ministers and the governors of their central banks "tend to focus on monetary and fiscal policies." Labor Minister Sakaguchi, who attended the employment summit, emphasized the significance: "It's important that there be a multilateral position regarding employment policies based on focused discussions." But even with a common sense of crisis, once concrete policymaking is underway, accommodating each leading industrial nation's viewpoint will complicate matters, which will then get out of control. While noting in his closing statement that "macroeconomic policy for changing job structures brings major results," Bentsen also refers to the importance of microeconomic policy, such as "the importance of retraining workers within enterprises," "technological innovation creates jobs," etc. His statement is all-inclusive and that is because it is "an amalgamation of the assertions made by each country" (Labor Department). In the United States, where the government traditionally adheres to market principles and does not intervene in employment problems, "the thinking is strong that the approach is to create jobs and eliminate unemployment through macroeconomic policies" (Chairman Nagano of Nikkeiren [Japan Federation of Employers' Associations]) such as interest rate inducements and public investment. President Clinton at the employment summit urged "Japan to expand domestic demand and Europe to lower interest rates." That Bentsen's statement incorporated the importance of macroeconomic policy and the opening of markets may be taken to show the strong disposition of the United States at work. On the other hand, in Europe, "Governments have a tendency to formulate policies that interfere excessively with business in order to maintain current employment levels" (Ministry of Labor). In Japan, too, because there is the issue of maintaining the lifetime employment system, "microeconomic policy is being given relatively serious consideration in employment policymaking" (Labor Minister Sakaguchi). The incorporation by Bentsen in his statement of the need for "the exchange of employment specialists" and "mutual research on the employment systems of each leading industrial nation" included the contentions of both the European Union and Japan. "First we will need to study each country's microeconomic policy and then learn together from the examples of successes and failures" (Labor Minister Sakaguchi). However, in the final analysis, they did not arrive at a substantive plan of action just by collecting the assertions of each nation at the summit. Of necessity, in order to continue discussion, it was specified in Bentsen's statement that, "The employment problem will be on the agenda at the Naples summit." Some people indicate that "there are pitfalls." The general view is that Detroit, the Mecca of the U.S. automobile industry, was chosen for the employment summit "to show the people in the United States that the U.S. administration is earnest in trying to solve the employment problem and, at the same time, to pressure Japan to open its markets" (MITI). As a result, a sense of crisis has surfaced in Kasumigaseki "Japan is made to pledge publicly to formulate effective economic policy to expand domestic demand, deregulation, and the opening of its markets by the time of the Naples summit." "We were able to avoid emotional Japan-bashing and the criticism that Japan is exporting unemployment," which was anticipated at the beginning of the employment summit" (MITI and the Labor Ministry). However, it was furthermore made clear that it will not be easy to find solutions to problems of employment and unemployment where business practices vary from country to country. It can be anticipated that "outside pressure" on Japan will strengthen ever more and that in preparation the government is tasked with the heavy homework assignment of effective macroeconomic policymaking.
