It had stopped these efforts for about a month after the disappearance of former Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur al-Kikhya. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Egyptian Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif's sudden visit to Tripoli and his meeting with Libyan Leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi were part of these efforts. According to informed sources in Cairo, Egypt conveyed to Libya France's willingness to start a dialogue with Libya on means of resolving the crisis. That is what French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe had conveyed to Cairo, during his recent visit, in response to the Egyptian proposals calling for a direct dialogue similar to that held with Britain at the beginning of the crisis. The sources also revealed that, in a reply message from Chairman al-Qadhdhafi to Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, Libya officially confirmed that it had nothing to do with al-Kikhya's disappearance and that it was perfectly willing to cooperate with Egypt to find out what happened to him.
