He expressed his hope: Proceeding from Shanghai's current actual conditions, the municipal party committee and government will continually explore new experiences in improving the party's workstyle and enhancing honest government under the new circumstances, and will play greater roles in boosting Shanghai's reform, development, and stability. While conducting investigations and research in Shanghai during 16-25 April, Comrade Wei Jianxing held conversations with Wu Bangguo, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju. He successively heard work reports given by Zhang Huixin, secretary of the municipal discipline inspection commission, and Bao Xinbao, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Trade Union Council. He also separately held discussion meetings with leaders of some district and county party committees and governments, secretaries of some discipline inspection commissions, and cadres of enterprise trade unions. Additionally, he personally visited the Pudong New District and the Caohejing Development Zone. Comrade Wei Jianxing pointed out: When carrying out anticorruption drive, we should pay attention to handling it from a macroeconomical viewpoint, stress education programs, aim at prevention, be concerned to resolve deep-seated issues, and properly conduct comprehensive rectification. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and government have been resolutely carrying out the anticorruption drive formulated by the party Central Committee and the State Council, and have been improving the party's workstyle and enhancing honest government by upgrading relevant mechanisms and legal and organizational systems. It is a good experience. He expressed his hope: Persistently proceeding from its current actual conditions, Shanghai will continually explore new ways and methods in improving the party's workstyle and enhancing honest government under the new circumstances, and will creatively carry out the anticorruption drive. Comrade Wei Jianxing pointed out: At present, trade unions at various levels should correctly regard and properly handle the relations among reform, development, and stability. They should pay special attention to and be concerned for, reveal, and help resolve the hardships of some staff members and workers. Trade unions should adapt to new circumstances; should widen their field of vision; should expand their tasks; and should actively explore new methods and new experiences that more effectively express and safeguard the specific interests of staff members and workers, while safeguarding the overall interests of all the Chinese people. They should support and participate in various reforms; should respect actual practice; should assess all tasks through experiments; should uphold and promote the party's fine traditions and trade union work experiences that have been accumulated in the past and that have been effective; and should realistically implement the party's policy of wholeheartedly relying on the working class.
