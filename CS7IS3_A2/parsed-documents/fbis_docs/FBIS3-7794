Second, there is the issue of financial means for the very urgent needs of the Army, in order to secure the Army's efficiency and effectiveness--there have been debates going on regarding that issue for some time now. The state budget presents an opportunity in that regard. I think that if additional revenues for the state budget emerge this year--there are people hoping that this will happen--then the Army's needs must definitely be taken into account. Third, I also think that there is no social awareness of the deteriorating security in the country and the resultant need to strengthen the Army's role so that the role can be played well in the future.
