In the past three months prior to the inauguration of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge the government and the private sector have worked to turn the border into a special economic area and set up industrial estates in several border provinces. Regarding security, there has been rapid reorganization as well as readjustments to border operations to suit the development trends in the northeast. The cabinet has approved the National Security Council proposal to set up the Border Policy Implementation Center under the directorship of the supreme commander. Instructions have also been given to the Army, the Army Regions, including the Second Army Region which oversees 19 northeastern provinces. The Second Army Region was instructed on 3 March to establish a management center for the border provinces under its jurisdiction. The center will operate within the framework of peaceful resolution of border disputes and the avoidance of violence, relying first on the local mechanism. It will accelerate the settlement of border disputes, while the relations with the neighboring countries are good and will protect interests of the local people. According to Lieutenant General Anuphap Songsunthon, commander of the Second Army Region, his command has issued instructions for the establishment of the Thai-Lao Border Command Centers and the Thai-Cambodian Border Command Centers. The governors of the border provinces will head the centers. The Thai-Cambodian Border Command Centers will be situated in four provinces -- Ubon Ratchathani, Sisaket, Surin, and Buriram. Their main objectives are to serve the Thai private sector in trade and investment in Cambodia and protect their interest. They will not support any Cambodian faction, tolerate the existence of foreign forces in Thai territory, or the violation of Thai sovereignty. They will drastically suppress activities of foreign armed bandits by setting up check points and operating rapid deployment units. It will cooperate with other units to suppress the smuggling of contraband, arms, and vehicles. The Thai-Lao Border Command Centers will be set up in Ubon Ratchathani, Loei, Nong Khai, Mukdahan, and Amnat Charoen provinces to support legitimate border activities and drastically suppress illegal trading. They will promote relations between local elements and cooperation to peacefully solve border problems. Anuphap stressed that after the friendship bridge opens the objectives of the policy will remain the same but will emphasize the strengthening of ties at the local level as well as promoting the use of the bridge for contacts between Thailand and Laos. The establishment of the centers at various levels by the security establishment amounts to the military's support of the government's policy and the policy's expansion to broaden contacts between Thailand and Laos and Cambodia to benefit trade and investment, while maintaining national security and avoiding disputes by the use of local mechanism. The establishment of the command center in each province amounts to adjustment of the province's conduct toward the neighboring country. The operational staff of the Second Army Region is drafting the details for the center operations for the regional commander to sign into formal centers quickly. Regarding the protection of important economic areas, Anuphap asserts that there is no security problem in the Second Army Region because the main forces of the army are already located there. There is no need for new deployment of weapons for the region. Investors can be confident in the Second Army Region. The above preparations by the security establishment to open the northeastern region to Indochina are an important step in facilitating investors. They amount to a new chapter in cooperation by the Thai military from its previous posture of aggressive solution of border problems. This adjustment has given investors greater confidence.
