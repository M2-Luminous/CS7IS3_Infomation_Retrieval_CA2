Reports from El Peten Department indicate that the controversial congressman was to be proclaimed presidential candidate next Saturday at a meeting of the 12 organizations affiliated with the Revolutionary Party in that department. Today there were more reactions to the attack. Here is National Congress President Marco Vinicio Villar Anleu, who commented on the subject with reporters. [Villar] The Board of Directors has no knowledge of death threats against any deputy or against Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla Vega in particular. We only know what has been reported about the attack on Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla Vega and the attack yesterday on Deputy Rene Barrios. [Reporter] Will the National Congress Board of Directors adopt any special strategy? It is obvious that any deputy can be the target of an attack. Will the Board of Directors take any special security measures or [words indistinct]? [Villar] Yes, the Congress will take preventive measures to protect the deputies and the building where congressional meetings are held. It is clear that this was an attack against the Congress as an institution, obviously to destabilize the country and hinder political activities. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Villar] No. Our analysis of the situation has remained within Congress. I have clearly said that we will not recommend a state of (?emergency). That decision must be made by the executive branch. It will depend on the information we receive from the ministers summoned by Congress and a meeting we will have with the president. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Villar] No. They were called upon to inform us of the mechanisms, it is not an (?interpellation). [Reporter] [Words indistinct] health of the two deputies [words indistinct]? [Villar] Thank God, we can say that Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla Vega, who is currently in a private hospital, is clinically out of danger, although his condition is still critical. He will be under observation for 72 hours. As for Deputy Rene Barrios Samayoa, thank God it was only an attempt to kidnap him. He is in perfect health, but he was emotionally and psychologically affected. [Reporter] It is said that Deputy Chinchilla Vega knew there would be an attack against him and that he met with the defense minister and other top government officials the day before the attack to inform them. [Villar] We have heard that report. Several deputies and even journalists have reported this, but the Board of Directors has no official knowledge of that. [Reporter] Deputy, Deputy Rene Barrios reportedly has not filed any complaint with the National Police. [Words indistinct] [Villar] We were informed yesterday and at last night's meeting with the deputies and the Board of Directors that he said he has information about the vehicles used in the kidnapping attempt. He said he spoke directly with the president and the presidential staff to apprise them of the facts. They are aware of the situation. [Reporter] Mr. Congress President, how can it be possible that (?Congress has not) said anything about a possible state of emergency when the government is waging a campaign in Guatemala's [word indistinct] in support of such a measure. [Words indistinct] [Villar] Quite simply, the executive branch is authorized to call a state of emergency. Congress cannot do it. All Congress can do is confirm it if it is officially sent to the legislature. I believe that the state of law and constitutional order must prevail in such situations and that we should demand that the executive branch, which is in charge of public and internal security, adopt the necessary urgent measures within the framework of the Constitution and existing laws. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [Villar] No. I have categorically stated that Congress will not request a state of emergency. So far Congress has not decided to do that. The executive branch has the authority to implement such a measure, and the decision will have to come from that branch. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] can Congress ask the president to impose [words indistinct]. [Villar] That is what I announced at the beginning of the news conference. We are going to invite the president and the two ministers to a meeting. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Villar] In the president's case -- I must be clear about this -- in accordance with existing laws, he cannot be summoned to Congress or to the plenum. We can, however, extend a cordial invitation to him to attend a meeting within the framework of the coordination of the branches of state, but always observing each branch's independence. [Reporter] Is it true that the secretary general of the Christian Democratic Party left the country because of this situation? [Villar] I have no official information on that. I spoke to him early this morning. He was in the country as of 0830. Since then I have been in a meeting with the Board of Directors, and I do not have any official information about his departure. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] to generate a coup d'etat. [words indistinct] [Villar] I had not heard that until you mentioned it, so I have no opinion.
