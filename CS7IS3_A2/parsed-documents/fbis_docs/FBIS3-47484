The group led by Naoto Kan, a House of Representatives member of the United Social Democratic Party (Shaminren), will submit the bill to the next ordinary session of the Diet beginning on January 31, they said. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa serves as adviser to the group. Under the panel's plan, the organization would hear complaints from the public about the administration, check such opinions and report the outcome of the study to the House of Representatives speaker or the House of Councillors president. The commission would also advise the lower house speaker or the upper house president on enacting or abolishing laws for the purpose of cutting administrative organizations. The planned organization would have the right to demand administrative bodies to submit documents and to open hearings. The Management and Coordination Agency plans to set up a similar organization in the Prime Minister's Office, but the group led by Kan doubts the administration can make the appropriate cuts on its own, they said.
