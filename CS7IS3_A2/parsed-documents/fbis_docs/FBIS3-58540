The liberals alone are against the other large political parties. The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] intends to use the situation politically for a common action with the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU]. The CDU, the CSU, and the SPD accused the liberals of adopting an "incomprehensible obstructive stance." CDU Interior Minister Manfred Kanther had made far-reaching concessions to the FDP leadership, which continues to strictly reject the bugging campaign by citing a resolution adopted at its party congress in Muenster in June 1993. He had suggested to confine "electronic surveillance of private homes" to serious, punishable offenses detailed in a catalogue. A judge would have the authority to order a bugging operation; in urgent cases, a public prosecutor would order such operation, which would then have to be authorized by a judge ex post facto. At the FDP's Epiphany meeting in Stuttgart, party chief Klaus Kinkel and Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger strictly rejected Kanther's initiative. Thereupon, Bavarian chief of government, CSU Vice Chairman Edmund Stoiber, sharply attacked the liberals on 8 January. He said that by his compromise proposal, Kanther had "taken all objections regarding the use of electronic means into account" as far as possible, without jeopardizing the effectiveness of this instrument against organized crime. Stoiber told WELT AM SONNTAG: "Therefore I do not have the slightest understanding for the FDP leadership sticking to its obstructive position and even rejecting this compromise. Our people must not be protected against an overly powerful state, as Kinkel and Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger are trying to make people believe, but against crime that is technically extremely well-equipped and represents a huge financial power." Commenting on the state of the Bonn coalition, Stoiber said that it was becoming increasingly difficult to convince German citizens "that urgently necessary and sound solutions do not come about out of regard for the liberal coalition partner, even though there are parliamentary majorities for them with the SPD." In a talk with WELT AM SONNTAG, SPD Parliamentary Manager Peter Struck called Kanther's compromise proposal "an adequate basis for talks in the Bundestag committees." However, the SPD would only accept an amendment to Basic Law Article 13 (inviolability of apartments), "if, at the same time, Article 14 (property, right of succession, and expropriation) is amended." The problem is under what conditions profits from criminal activities could be confiscated. "The SPD advocates a reversal of the burden of proof. This is a linkage for us," said Struck. The SPD politician added that, if Kanther mustered the courage, he should "submit a draft law without delay, including the necessary legal amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure." The SPD would, however, not agree to Kanther's proposal that, in urgent cases, a public prosecutor could authorize electronic-listening measures. Struck: "I think understanding between the CDU and SPD is possible if the CDU is ready to amend Basic Law Article 14 as well. The CDU and SPD will then, in any case, have a two-third majority." The CDU does not understand the liberals' position either. Deputy floor leader Johannes Gerster told WELT AM SONNTAG that it was "regrettable" that the FDP leadership "continues to reject" the bugging campaign, "despite increasing criticism from its party grassroots and contrary to the advice given by almost all experts." Gerster asked whether the FDP really intended to declare the leadership levels of organized crime, which can hardly be covered by the instruments of investigation used in the past, "areas exempt from investigation." Gerster called upon the FDP to study Kanther's proposals realistically, and not to "put them aside with a shrug," as party chief Kinkel did in Stuttgart. He, Gerster, had "no idea" how the FDP was going to make internal security "an offensive subject" in the upcoming election campaigns, "while continuing to reject the introduction of important instruments of investigation to combat dangerous crime."
