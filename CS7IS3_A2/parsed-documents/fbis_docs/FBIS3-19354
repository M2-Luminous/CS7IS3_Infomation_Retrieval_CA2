Good morning Carlos Basto. [Basto] [passage omitted] The Socialist Party's new National Committee has been holding its first meeting here at the Altis Hotel. You may recall that this National Committee was elected on 25 February, for the first time directly by the party's rank and file. This morning the committee has been voting on the party's other executive bodies. [passage omitted] The results will be announced shortly. There were no competing candidates, all the votes were on single consensus lists. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Carlos, perhaps we should point out that this new scheme of things is the result of changes to the Socialist Party's statutes. [passage omitted] [Basto] The congress at which Antonio Guterres was elected secretary general was also the party's last congress, insofar as it was decided that the party's supreme decisionmaking body would henceforth be called the National Convention. This year's version will be held in Oporto on 19-20 March. The convention is shorn of the dramatics that used to be the hallmark of the congresses, what with the bargaining for votes, the last-minute candidates, and the back-room negotiations. Under the new rules the leadership bodies will have been elected by the time the National Convention is held. [passage omitted] Almeida Santos is now going to announce the results. [PS Chairman Almeida Santos] [passage omitted] The National Political Committee has been elected with 173 votes for, 17 against, 10 abstentions, 18 blank papers, and one spoiled paper; [applause] the National Secretariat has been elected with 173 votes for, 16 against, 15 abstentions, 13 blank papers, and one spoiled paper; [applause] The party chairman has been elected with 194 votes for, seven against, three abstentions, 11 blank papers, and three spoiled papers. [applause] [Basto] To a standing ovation, Almeida Santos has just announced his own reelection as Socialist Party chairman. [Almeida Santos] Finally, the secretary general [party leader] has been elected with 210 votes in favor [applause], four against, one abstention, and three blank papers. My congratulations to elected and electors alike. [passage omitted]
