FR940325-2-00211 FR940325-2-00094 GPU and EII have agreed to pay Sellers a ``stipulated damage amount'' of up to $7 million in the event the Closing does not occur by August 15, 1994 due to the failure of a specified condition set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, or $5 million if EII otherwise fails or refuses to purchase the Cogen Corp. Stock, except for certain specified reasons. Additional authorization is being herein requested for EII to issue, sell and renew from time to time through December 31, 2004 its promissory notes (``EII Notes'') to one or more commercial banks representing borrowings in the aggregate principal amount of up to $25 million outstanding at any one time. The proceeds of such borrowings would be used to pay a portion of the Purchase Price, and the balance of the Purchase Price would be supplied through cash capital contributions from GPU or GPC. The EII Notes, which would be issued pursuant to loan agreements with the bank lenders who financed Sellers' QF projects, would mature no later than December 31, 2004 and bear interest at varying rates as provided in the loan agreements, but in any event not in excess of: (a) 250 basis points above the lending bank's prime or base rate as in effect from time to time, (b) 400 basis points above the specified London Interbank Offered Rate, as in effect from time to time, or (c) a negotiated fixed rate which, in any event, would not exceed 12%. The EII Notes would be prepayable to the extent provided therein. It is proposed that payment of principal and interest on the EII Notes, together with EII's other obligations under the loan agreements, be unconditionally guaranteed by GPU or secured by a pledge by GPC of the EII common stock to the bank lenders. Alternatively, GPU may enter into a support agreement with the lending banks with respect to repayment of the EII Notes. Project No. 1 is a 102 MW (net) natural gas fired qualifying cogeneration facility located in Florida. Project No. 1 is owned by a Florida limited partnership in which Cogen Corp. presently holds, indirectly through wholly-owned subsidiaries, 100% of the general and limited partnership interests. In order to comply with the ownership limitations for qualifying cogeneration facilities pursuant to the FERC's regulations under PURPA, simultaneous with its purchase of the Stock, EII will either: (a) Sell at the Closing not less than a 50% interest in Project No. 1 to an unaffiliated third-party which is not an electric utility affiliate, or (b) otherwise effectively limit at the Closing its acquisition in Project No. 1 to 50% thereof, pending such sale. (As noted above, in the latter event, EII would have 12 months from the signing of the Stock Purchase Agreement to sell such 50% interest; absent such sale, the remaining 50% Project No. 1 interest would be retained by Sellers and the related portion of the escrowed Purchase Price refunded to GPU.) Project No. 1 sells its entire net capacity and energy to a Florida utility under a long-term power purchase contract and provides steam under a long-term steam sales contract to an agricultural cooperative for food processing, packaging and cold storage.
