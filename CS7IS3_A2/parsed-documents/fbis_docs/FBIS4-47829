The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] decided to revise its counting procedures last night, and instead of entering batches of votes into the computer as they come in, they are now entering the total number of votes at counting stations. IEC spokesman Pieter Cronje says the vote counting is complete in all regions except the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] and KwaZulu/Natal, and that more than 50 percent of the votes in KwaZulu/Natal have been counted. He said the final allocations of seats in the National Assembly and the provincial legislatures and a ruling on whether the election was free and fair could be expected late tomorrow afternoon. The last results showed that with just over 53 percent of the votes counted the ANC had 62.5 percent compared with 22 percent for the NP [National Party], and 8.3 percent for the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. The Freedom Front has 3 percent, followed by the DP [Democratic Party] with 1.7 percent, and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] with 1.3.
