The dusty cowboy, the "Lone Ranger" [preceding two words in English] kicked the door, drew his pistols and fired "from the hip" [preceding three words in English], breaking four whiskey bottles over the bartender's head. It was a real "Western" scene, which was repeated in recent days over Bosnia-Herzegovina with the downing of the four "unknown" aircraft by the terrible war machine of the "Master of the Planet" who went to his "oval office" and, facing television cameras, spoke to his "subjects" around the world. Because now the saloon has become international and the cowboy's shots have been replaced with "F-16's" carrying air-to-air missiles. Today, however, they did not break some whiskey bottles, but four aircraft with four persons aboard, while hundreds of lives are lost daily on the ground. We are talking of human lives, and not of ethnicities or religions. Indeed, the logical explanation a simple man could give for this incident is its relation to the cowboy's spectacular entrance into the "international" saloon. Because the new world gendarme, who also calls himself "Master of the Planet," wants to remind people around the world that the power is his. Because now, since there is no opposing power as there was some years ago, all the world's inhabitants, and mainly those in Europe, must digest the fact that there is a "Master of the Planet." And of course, he found a little man he could hit to ensure that his victims cannot react with real bullets. The simple man in the street is asking: If the four aircraft, which were "like mice in front of a tiger," were Russian, would American generals and admirals, who used NATO as their "alibi," down them so easily? NATO, this collective organ that has turned from a defense mechanism against the communist threat to an executive tool of the United States. So, we have "Rambo" leaving the swamps of Vietnam and coming to Europe, and especially the Balkans. And of course, he wants his entrance on the "scene"--because let's not forget that everything today is a television spectacle--to be made in an impressive manner. The "producers" have thus chosen an easy target: the four little aircraft which, as the Americans themselves would say, were "sitting ducks" [preceding two words in English] for those awesome war machines, the F-16's. It is difficult for the simple man in the street to understand what is happening now in this tragic region of Europe. Things are so mixed up, there are so many ethnicities and religions fighting against each other, warring parties are so confused that no one can comprehend what is really going on, who is right and who is wrong. [passage omitted] No one knows who is the real target of the various "events" that appear on our television screens. We thus find ourselves in a state of utter confusion. We are not the only ones: more tragically, international "leaders" are confused as well. Because, to begin with, they are all "little men" disguised as "tigers" and they only think of their reelection and of what "image" they will "sell" to their people. But thousands of lives are lost in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It makes no difference if they are Muslims, Serbs, or Croats. They are all people losing their lives, their homes, their families. And no one seems to really care. We see those who once upon a time were demonstrating for the "Shining Path" or "Farabundo Marti" remaining silent. And what are we doing? We are not speaking up. Because we have lost our self-respect since selling our humanity in exchange for a consumer pseudo-society!
