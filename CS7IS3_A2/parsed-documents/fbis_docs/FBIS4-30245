Kim Tae-sun, director of the Moscow office of the Korea-Russia Science and Technology Cooperation Center---an annex of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), sent articles on plans for applying the Russian science and technology he has seen and felt on the scene since May 1992. We present this in two installments. One of the fields with the greatest prospects for cooperation with Russia is the software industry. Until now, Russia had no fixed laws on private property. With much investment made in facilities under these conditions, scientific and technological cooperation carries with it many risks of various kinds. One area which is important to us and which minimizes facility investment is the software industry. The shortage of computers is serious even in many of Russia's superior research organizations. Therefore, many research centers make use of PCs (personal computers), even if that is all they have, to conduct applied research. As a result, much software and many applications were developed using PCs. Another field with prospects for cooperation, even though less know to us, is dedicated IC (integrated circuit) design and manufacturing technology. Unilaterally, Russian IC design and manufacturing technology does not appear to be that superior. Manufacturing technology in particular is lacking: it can be said to be considerably behind Japan and the U.S. in mass-production technology. Therefore, compared to present ROK memory-IC manufacturing technology, Russian technology can be said to be markedly backward. Thinking about dedicated-IC design and manufacture, even in Russia's present situation, it is a suitable field for technological-cooperation with ROK industry. In Russia there are many organizations capable of designing and manufacturing dedicated IC. The productive capacity of most of these organizations, however, is considerably inferior. That is, although the semiconductor industry is not at a high level, it has many organizations capable of small-quantity-high-variety, dedicated-IC design and manufacturing. The present circumstances thus provide related ROK industries with conditions favorable for cooperation. As a cooperative sector favorable for dedicated-IC design and manufacturing, it could provide good partners for many ROK enterprises handling the manufacture of electronics-related instruments. In particular, companies making products (for example, medical instruments, communications instruments, and measuring instruments) other than memory chips and similar mass-produced items could select Russian organizations as good partners for the dedicated-IC design and manufacture of electronic-circuit portions of related products. Russia produces most of the medical instruments manufactured by advanced foreign nations. To put it another way, it can be said to possess technology capable of manufacturing all medical instruments. Even MRI equipment (nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer) is being produced and distributed. Visiting many medical institutions in Russia, however, one can sense the inferior medical instruments, the deterioration and lack of facilities of most of them. This reality is the result of Russia's overall economic difficulties. It is also a result of the funding shortages experienced by medical institutions because the medical system is in a transition period, moving from free medical treatment under socialism to medical treatment for which a fee is charged. Russia's medical-instruments industry is also linked with the program being conducted by the government of privatizing military industries. It is a well-known fact that Russia's aviation- and space-related technology is advanced. It can be called world class in all areas, from the design of aircraft and spacecraft to the design and manufacture of mechanical and electronic spare parts and new materials technology. However, because aviation-and space-related industries are run by a policy of large-scale investment at the national level, cooperation in this field generally can be achieved by state support or large enterprises. However, there are also fields among related spare-parts industries in which cooperation can be achieved by small and medium-sized business. Laser-related technology too is closely associated with Russia's advanced military industry. With the program of conversion to civilian industry, many laser-related technologies are being applied in laser-using industrial instruments, medical instruments, laboratory instruments, etc. A phenomenon common to all products made in Russia, technology for the production of fresh commercial products is lacking. Although products are made using superior technology, in various ways they can be said to be inferior compared to the products of advanced foreign nations. Therefore, if this is supplemented by ROK technology, it has the potential for commercial success on the world market. Through cooperation with Russia, the communications-instruments and spare-parts sectors have potential for making inroads into the world market, and also for making products for sale in Russia. In May 1993, 26 prominent, communications-industry companies entered Russia in the form of a joint venture. Russia is producing TDX (time division exchanges) and other telephone-switching instruments, but its performance is very backward compared to our ROK technology. Therefore, cooperation is possible on the sale or on-site production of ROK products. In the case of cellular-phone, satellite-communications, and optical-communications technology, however, Russia is advanced, making possible varied cooperation in ROK mobile-communications-related industrial sectors. Other technical fields with prospects for cooperation are the processing-related sectors using nonferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, zinc, and nickel, sectors dealing with the development and application of new materials, and the machine-instrument sector. More detailed, useful information on each sector can be obtained using the relevant reference libraries of the Korea-Russia Science and Technological Cooperation Center. [21 Apr 94 p 16] [Text] During the last three years, there has been an exchange between many ROK institutions (research centers, business, universities, etc.) and Russian institutions. They have used various methods of contact and exchange for absorbing Russian technology and applying it to the development of commercial products. Although some businesses have gained a measure of success as a result, most obtained no great results, failing in many cases. As a result of touring various Russian research institutions and business up to now, the author believes that it would be more useful for ROK small and medium-sized businesses to adopt Russian technology through a cooperative relationship. The reason for this is that, although Russia's technological level is high, it has insufficient linkage of this with mass-production technology, so small-quantity-high-variety production by small and medium-sized business would be profitable. Characteristic of Russian technology is a lack of systematization of mass-production technology and concepts of production costs. Therefore, if Russian technology is to be introduced and applied from product design to production, there is a high probability of running up against various difficulties and of failure. Judging Russian technology based on finished product alone is not a complete method either. Of course, it is true that if a product's performance is superior, the technology which made that product is superior. However, there are many cases in which a products technological level is superior, even though its performance is not. In this case, there are many instances in which superior-performance products were simply not made, rather than being impossible to make due to the characteristics of Russian society and the Russian economy. Technological cooperation with Russia must start with these particular circumstances in mind. Most Russian technology is not directly linked to production. It is technology with no concept of production-cost reduction. To a certain degree, ROK businesses have their own design and production technology. However, rather than cooperating in all technology from design to production, ROK businesses should form cooperative relationships with Russia after clearly selecting technology we need for specific fields in which it is lacking. Cooperative relationships can take various forms: getting technical training by inviting superior engineers in relevant fields; purchasing desired technology; development based on joint research (paying Russian research institutions a research fee, commissioning technical development); and developing technology by setting up joint-venture research centers in Russia. Inviting technicians could be an effective method, depending on the kind of technology we need. However, because there are limitations on the number of technicians who can be invited and on the length of their stay in Korea, this would not be efficient in many cases. Up to now there has been much technological cooperation between many ROK and relevant Russian institutions in the form of joint research. Given Russia's present situation, however, this is one of several considerably inefficient methods. Joint-ventures, in the present circumstances, are considered to enable decreased investment risk while allowing ROK businesses to adopt Russian science and technology. Not costing that much and an achievement of the research and development functions urgently desired by ROK business, the establishment of joint-venture research centers can be said to be ideal. In special Russian circumstances, the establishment of joint-venture research centers can be said to be very effective for the following reasons. First, performing research and development through joint investment by both sides, it is possible to carry out all processes through product development together with Russian technicians. Also, if a contract is concluded so that relevant Russian institutions provide public facilities and laboratory equipment, investment risk will be reduced by minimizing research center set-up costs. Besides this, use can be made of an excellent research workforce for wages lower than those of researchers at ROK research centers. This technological development through the establishment of joint-venture research centers in Russia is efficient from various viewpoints. However, ROK companies can be said to have a greater probability of succeeding in research and development if they take the following into consideration. First of all, having, to a certain degree, its own domestic research workforce, ROK business must lead research operations on site in Russia and must be able to domestically absorb the technology developed. ROK business must be able to handle on its own the commercialization process resulting from the mass production of this technology. Also, with the concept of carrying out research and development, it must begin a cooperative relationship by using approximately 10-20 percent of funding used in the domestic research centers of ROK companies for research centers in Russia. However, for genuine success in scientific and technological cooperation, it must start in the concept of mutual ROK-Russian interests.
