The Kim Yong-sam group Monday arrested a student of Chonpuk National University Ho Hyon-chun, former vice-chairman of the South side headquarters of the Pan-National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification, on the charge of the "violation of the National Security Law". He was put on the "want list" for his involvement in the pan-national rally last year. Branding this as another fascist offensive against the pro-reunification patriotic forces and an anti-reunification crime, the analyst says: It was out of the patriotic desire to bring earlier national reunification, the nation's wish, that the students in the North and the South last year discussed the matters of opening a grand reunification festival of students, holding talks at Panmunjom and confirming the reunification formula. Unable to sit at one place, they debated on matters regarding reunification in the form of telephone dialogue. It was a patriotic deed to contribute to the noble cause of national reunification, as befits the standard-bearers of the country's reunification. It can never be a target of suppression. But, taking issue with it, the Kim Yong-sam group blocked the students' reunification festival and arrested many patriotic people and, as if it were not enough, arrested one more student this time. This is a never-to-be- condoned act. The "civilian regime" of Kim Yong-sam group is no more than a veil, which is not different from the former military fascist regimes at all. There is nothing to expect from the present regime.
