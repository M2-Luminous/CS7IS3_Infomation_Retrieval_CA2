It was on its own initiative that the French Government decided to offer the United Nations 2,000 troops to go and protect the pockets of Tutsi refugees surrounded by Hutus. [passage omitted] However, yesterday's refusal by the OAU to support the intervention was a jolt for the diplomatic machinery. In the eyes of the former colonies, the motive of humanitarian aid stated by France is just an excuse. The former colonial power can only be driven by impure intentions. The point has been reached where the OAU is putting its own impotence down to a plot by white powers. The official communique states that if the OAU has been unable to set up a peacekeeping force that could have put an end to the massacre, it was because the developed countries have provided neither logistic nor financial assistance. A supposedly decisive indicator of this maneuver is the fact that, two months after the Security Council decided to send a force of 5,500 blue helmets from nine African states into Rwanda, only 550 troops have been effectively deployed. The carnage in Rwanda can be traced back to the fact that African reality is first and foremost tribal in nature. An ancient feeling of hate continues to oppose the Hutus, the majority and former vassals, and the Tutsis, the feudal minority. Between 1990 and 1993, French support for the majority race seemed to be in line with the democratic ideals of the West. However, it clashed with the local situation. The Tutsis in the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front], the rebel movement that now has the upper hand militarily, thus remain determined to sabotage any attempts at French intervention. They have the implicit support of Belgium, which has two reasons for taking their side. At the time of colonization, the governors sent by Brussels found it more effective to give their support to the maintaining of the traditional balance, i.e., Tutsis on top and the Hutus on the bottom. Since independence, Brussels has reproached Paris for supplanting it in its former colonies in the name of maintaining the French-speaking culture. When French paratroopers landed in Kolwezi, this audacity was accepted by the Africans because the gesture was irreproachable. It was intended to both rescue European nationals and to put a stop to a subversive operation controlled from outside by the Cubans. Today, however, there are no expatriates remaining to be evacuated and the country that stands accused of interfering is France. In Europe, the French are exemplary when they take a leading role, as they did successfully in Bosnia and in the GATT talks. However, in Africa, they may have to resign themselves to the fact that rather than accepting a lifeline thrown in from the outside, the Africans would rather all drown together.
