Participants adopted two reports: one on the organization of the next elections and the other on the moralization of public life. The general assembly made a series of recommendations concerning these elections in order to ensure their openness and democratic character. It urged political parties to thoroughly examine the possibility of creating a national and independent electoral commission. This commission will be charged with organizing, handling, and controlling the elections. The general assembly also proposed that the maximum number of voters for each polling station be 500 in order to facilitate the counting of votes on the spot with immediate exhibition of the results under the supervision of the local electoral commissions. As for the moralization of public life, the convention deplored the fact many commissions have been set up - one after the other - to almost no avail since the period preceding the national conference up to now. According to the parties of the convention, the moralization should be carried out at various levels, first of all in the public finance sector which needs reorganization, openness, and control. The second level is the ruling class, whose will to serve should prevail over the spirit of enjoyment. As for civil servants, a change in their daily behavior is imperative, and it is a duty for businessmen to clear their debt with the banks. The moralization at the level of the mass media means that an end should be put to the use of the state media houses for the cult of personality, as is the case at the national television now, the convention stressed. In his closing speech, Idelphonse Lemon, current chairman of the convention, was obviously satisfied with the general assembly's recommendations. This satisfaction made him say that the guards of the democracy temple in Benin have gathered within the CNFC, which is good for the Republic. Let us listen to him: [Begin Lemon recording] The Republic will always survive, but in an improved environment, where on the authorities' side, the will to serve will prevail over the spirit of enjoyment, where the fruit of growth will be fairly distributed, where the zone of poverty will be gradually cleared, and where the birds of darkness will be prevented from flying. Long live the Republic! Long live the opposition! [end recording]
