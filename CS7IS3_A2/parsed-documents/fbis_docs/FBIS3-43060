Until now, attempts to create and maintain such hybrids have been fraught with a number of problems. A fundamentally new technique for detecting human DNA based on a polymerase chain reaction [PCR] with arbitrary primers (referred to as the AP-PCR method) has been developed. The new method was tested on two previously created hybrid clones representing a cross of Chinese hamster (VL79-_g_-8) and the human cell line HeLa. The yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae 15V P4 was used as a negative control. Genome DNA that yielded well-differentiated PCR patterns when amplified with two different arbitrary primers (21 and 45) was isolated from the hybrid clones and from the pure cell lines. From the standpoint of the appearance of their PCR patterns, the two hybrid clones produced with the two different primers were in no way different from the starting hamster line. Dot hybridization of the amplified DNA of these clones with tagged human amplified DNA clearly demonstrated the presence of human DNA, however. The DNA of the yeasts amplified with primer 45 yielded the same negative result as the hamster DNA. In the human genome DNA (HeLa), researchers succeeded in amplifying those unique, strictly specific genome sequences that, when used as a tagged probe, revealed homologous human DNA in the DNA cell hybrids and thus confirmed their hybrid nature. Dot hybridization with the amplified hamster DNA used as a probe demonstrated that hamster-specific sequences are completely absent in the human DNA amplified with the same primer. Similar results were obtained for primers 21 and 45. The new AP-PCR, which is said to be without analogues, was deemed suitable not only for detecting human DNA in interspecific hybrids but also in identifying human chromosomes by in situ hybridization or cross dot hybridization with monochromosomal human hybrids. The new AP-PCR method was said to possess the following distinctive features: - the selection of primers is unlimited (no knowledge of nucleotide sequence is required when constructing primers, and paired combinations of primers may be used to make sequencing easier; - one and the same primer may be used to identify the DNA of both organisms whose genomes constitute a given cell hybrid; - the result of amplification is always positive (the amplifiability of DNA is directly controlled) - the presence of DNA is judged not by the fact of amplification but rather by the capability of the amplified DNA under analysis to hybridize with human DNA amplified with the very same primer.
