(NTT) will begin within a year a multimedia experiment with ordinary families using an optical fiber network system, the telecommunications giant said Wednesday [12 January]. Masashi Kojima, president of NTT, said at a press conference that Japan should boost such optical fiber network-based multimedia business as the United States has already launched an information superhighway project. Kojima said, "we can't be a loser in the global competition in the telecommunications field." U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration has begun setting up optical fiber network systems linking universities and institutional bodies. NTT will start an experiment with an interactive information network using a cable television system. With the system, audiovisual information can be picked up through 250 channels. The experiment will be carried out with ordinary families which will be equipped with necessary devices as well as optical fiber terminals. NTT has announced a project envisaging that every family will have an optical fiber network system by 2015.
