The chairman of Democratic Party, Eduard Selami, considered the veto "as an irresponsible attitude of Greek Government," which is part of "others non-friendly ones and not in favour of Albania." Mr. Selami expressed his hope "in the Greek moderate part" and considered the veto mechanism by Greece as "an abusive act." The leader of the democrats, who have the majority in the parliament, expressed his readiness for dialogue, but pointed out that "they (Greeks) should react seriously, if they are for dialogue and for the positive solution of these problems." The chairman of Social Democratic Party, Mr. Skender Gjinushi, considered as "unacceptable" the attitude of Greek Government, "above all, now that Albania is experiencing the transitional period." Mr. Gjinushi pointed out that the idea of non-respecting the rights of Greek minority in Albania "is groundless" and said that the Greek Government should reflect on this issue. The social democratic leader also requested the continuation of the dialogue with the Greek side. Mr. Sabri Godo, the leader of the republicans, said that the blocking of the funds by Greece "is a resentment of Balkanic style, which was not expected by Papandreou government, who is a statesman with broad culture." Mr. Godo pointed out "that Greece is not paying, but Europe is." While deputy chairman of Socialist Party, Mr. Servet Pellumbi, considered the blocking of 35 million ECU as an act of the European Union and not Greece and demanded that "all of us should reflect" upon this issue because "it looks like Europe has serious remarks on the respect of its European standards in Albania." Deputy chairman of the Human Rights Party, Mr. Kosta Makariadhi, said that "there are some requirements, which should be respected by the countries, that require aid from European Union," among which he mentioned the honouring of the human rights. According to him "there are flagrant violations of human rights in Albania."
