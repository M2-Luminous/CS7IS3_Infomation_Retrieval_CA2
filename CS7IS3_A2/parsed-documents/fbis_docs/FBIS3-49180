Tibor Dane is the chairman, Odon Bitay the deputy chairman, and Karoly Nagy is the secretary of the group that is a new platform of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in Romanian], the reports say. NEPSZABADSAG's Bucharest correspondent asked Odon Bitay what the actual goals of the organization are. [Bitay] The Social Democratic New Left-Wing Group was formed as an internal organization of the RMDSZ at a meeting of counties in Kolozsvar on 18 December 1993. Its establishment was justified by the fact that the general goals of the RMDSZ's program and the groups that have been formed as the RMDSZ's internal platforms ignore the vital issues of workers and wage-earners. We could call ourselves some kind of internal opposition of the RMDSZ as opposed to the sometimes extreme liberal ideas because we are offering an alternative regarding the ways to achieve the economic and social goals. It is our fundamental goal to represent the interest of workers, small entrepreneurs in towns and villages, the emerging agricultural paid laborers, young people, disadvantaged people, and primarily the unemployed and the pensioners, on a political level. [NEPSZABADSAG] What are the similarities and the differences between the goals of your group and the RMDSZ? [Bitay] We see the future in establishing a social market economy based on mixed ownership, and we are trying to ensure equal opportunities for wage-earners and manual and intellectual workers -- as they are the biggest social group -- both in their life chances and in the area of acquisition of property. We support the Union of Hungarian Workers in Romania, the RMDSZ co-organization that since May 1992 has been representing the economic interests of workers. We will support their political ideas so that we can assert the workers' interests in the RMDSZ's leading organizations -- mainly the Council of Federal Representatives -- and, through the RMDSZ's members present in the two houses of Parliament, in legislation. We clearly laid down our goals in our program that we published in June 1993 in the ROMANIAI MAGYAR SZO. However, as the county newspapers and the electronic media kept quiet about us, there was very little reaction to our appearance. The reactions that we did receive were not always positive. [NEPSZABADSAG] What do you think was the reason? [Bitay] The new left-wing in our group's name might be off-putting for many people. They interpret it as some kind of effort to restore the past. The lack of political culture is the basic reason for this, and the fact that people here are not familiar with the essence of the new left-wing political tendency although this view and ideological trend has gained followers and has been recognized in the West. [NEPSZABADSAG] What kind of relations does your group have with the RMDSZ? [Bitay] We adhere to the requirements of the statutes established at the RMDSZ's congress in Brasov. The RMDSZ's leadership was aware of the establishment of this group. We forwarded the statement from our inaugural meeting, our program document, and our statute to the RMDSZ's leadership. We claim our place in the RMDSZ's structure as a new platform. [NEPSZABADSAG] What is the territorial basis of your group? [Bitay] At the moment, we have local representatives in five counties, namely Harghita, Kovaszna [Covasna], Maros [Mures], Szilagy [Salaj], and Kolozs [Cluj] counties. However, we are only at the very beginning of our organization and we hope that we will also find followers in the other Transylvanian counties where Hungarians are living.
