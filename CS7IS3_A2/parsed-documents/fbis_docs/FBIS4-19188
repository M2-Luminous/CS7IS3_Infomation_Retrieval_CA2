"His" five-year Employment Act is to be attacked by both opposition, which has filed a motion of censure against the government's employment policy, and majority representatives. To be sure, the act remains in force; a new decree to implement the new measures is expected within a week. A few days after the withdrawal of the CIP [job training contract] Michel Giraud speaks out and reacts to the criticisms on his bill, while opposition from unions and employers remains strong. [Desportes] Today the opposition will attempt to "censure" your five-year Employment Act. How do you feel about this avalanche of criticisms both from the Left and the Right? [Giraud] Beyond the CIP, there is a combination of several factors. The various economic partners even have more reservations now than they used to have about anything that questions tradition and habits. Odd as it may seem, there is precious little acceptance when it comes to adjusting policies and resources to a world that changes every day. On the other hand, waiting for a return to growth obviously makes people even more impatient. Finally, the impending presidential election has intensified rivalries. So I'm facing a more or less permanent state of confusion which, it seems to me, too often lacks serenity and objectivity. I repeat that my goal is to channel all my energy into the fight against unemployment. And although I think that criticisms are often unjustified, I will not let them prevent me from pursuing the mission I have been entrusted with by Edouard Balladur. [Desportes] What if you could do things all over again? [Giraud] There are two mistakes I readily acknowledge. The message from the National Assembly's Social Affairs Commission was clear and strong enough that more heed should have been paid to it. Second, insufficient explanations were given, which complicated matters. I do say explanations, not consultation, because there was never such a thing as the bombshell mentioned by some people. We provided the economic players with all the information they needed. [Desportes] Will the CIP affair slow down the implementation of the five-year act? [Giraud] I will be even more cautious as a result of it, but the act will not, repeat not, be put on the back burner. It brings many solutions which we sorely need with regard to the organization of labor: preserving work contracts, giving businesses more flexibility, but also giving employees more freedom to choose their own lifestyle. [Desportes] On this issue, there will be three major criticisms when the act's "working time" section is implemented. The first has to do with the annualization of working time. Are you still willing, as a tradeoff, to grant a reduction of working hours? [Desportes] I would remind you that before the bill was voted we had agreed that an annualization of working time would be linked with reduced working hours. This was a formal request by the CFDT [French Democratic Confederation of Labor], which employers agreed to. The idea was to negotiate the cuts. This is what was voted in Article 38 of the Act, which provides for an easier shift to annualized working time by businesses, but also requires them to reduce the overall work time. Let me repeat this: It requires them to reduce work time. [Desportes] The CGT [General Confederation of Labor] and FO [Workers' Force] condemn the fact that you are making working time more flexible. [Giraud] One issue has to do with integrating a training component into the job. A young worker can expect to switch occupations three of four times in the course of a lifetime. How can an employee be expected to adjust to new activities without being given the time to prepare for them? Second issue: There is a demand for more time to be reserved for leisure and family life. Therefore we need to rethink the structure of work life. We also are terribly behind in terms of part-time work, especially with respect to the female population. In short, I consider that a shift to annualized work arrangements which leads to a reduction in working hours deserves some effort on the part of the economic players. I would add that everything will be negotiated between employers and unions. [Desportes] Critics also condemn the annualization of part-time work which you pushed through Parliament. Do you want to turn these people into intermittent workers? [Giraud] The act includes a series of safeguards. Here, too, consultations will have to be held within companies. This measure will not be an arbitrary one. In the catering sector, for example, this arrangement will make it possible to pay employees, who were paid only six or seven times per year, on a monthly basis. From the point of view of the company, annualized part-time work increases the flexibility it needs to adjust to the current context. [Desportes] Third criticism, unions believe that, due to all these measures, overtime will become a thing of the past, since working hours are now viewed over a year instead of a week. [Giraud] Wrong. But I do recognize that the relevant article (Art. 42) is not all that easy to understand. Overtime payments on top of a regualar salary remain possible, but compensation time arrangements will be improved. However, it will be made more difficult for companies to have employees work overtime. One needs to know what one wants -- what we want is to create jobs. [Desportes] Do you expect tangible results of the "working time" section? [Giraud] Of course. First of all, a reduction of working hours so that a number of unemployed can find a job. Second, an incentive to negotiate, including within small- and medium-sized businesses. I am perfectly aware that there are objections on various levels. We must find ways to overcome them, but, on the other hand, unfounded accusations must stop. [Desportes] Nevertheless, such objections are numerous, for example with respect to weekend labor. When will the new measures come into force? [Giraud] This is not a measure that is part of the act, but of one that dates back to 1982. On this subject, I am prepared to allow enough time for sector-by-sector negotiations. As for the act, I said that the regulations would be ready on 31 March, and they are; however, the government has decided to wait before introducing them so that consultation and explanation may continue. [Desportes] You said that you did not want to be the "minister of 4 million jobless people": Do you still stick to this statement? [Giraud] Indeed. But one must understand that the five-year act is based on an overall approach. I therefore do not intend to single out one particular measure. I did say that I hoped that 400,000 jobs would be created in the course of one year from the moment the act was completely implemented. This estimate must be viewed in relation with the level of economic activity. I would also like to say that tangible results can already be seen right now. Apprenticeship and mixed teaching and training formulas are booming; part-time work and gradual preretirement schemes have preserved a number of jobs. Compared with last year, the unemployment rate has slowed down considerably. I believe that the increase in unemployment is about to come to a standstill.
