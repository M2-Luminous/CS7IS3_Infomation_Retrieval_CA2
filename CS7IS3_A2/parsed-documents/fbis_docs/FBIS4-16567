FBIS4-16567 "drsov074_f_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-074 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 National Affairs Crimean Security Service on Attempts at Politicization Crimean Security Service on Attempts at Politicization LD1604003494 Kiev UNIAN in Ukrainian 2005 GMT 15 Apr 94 LD1604003494 Kiev UNIAN Ukrainian BFN [Text] Simferopol -- An appeal to the president and the people of Crimea was adopted at a meeting of the personnel of the Crimea Republic Security Service on 15 April. The document, in particular, expresses concern over the progress of events around this collective. "The latest developments prove that attempts are being made to shift the activity of the service from the legal sphere to political, in which we have no right to interfere," says the statement. "This is fraught with the disorganization of the operational and search activity under conditions of growing crime rates and increasing danger of the emergence of political terrorism." Accusations to the effect that the Crimean Security Service "went over to Ukraine" are senseless, because no one questions the provision of the law "On Security Service of Crimea" which stipulates that it is a regional body of the Security Service of Ukraine. Such reproaches evoke surprise, to say the least, because they are made also by "separate employees of the Crimean president's administration who are former executives of the former KGB. It is they who should be aware of the consequences of involving the special purpose law enforcement body in political confrontation better than anyone else."
