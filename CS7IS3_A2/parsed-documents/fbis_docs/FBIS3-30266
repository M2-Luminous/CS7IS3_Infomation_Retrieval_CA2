Security Council. In the letter, Jovanovic informed the Security Council president that Yugoslavia and Croatia signed in Geneva on January 19 a joint declaration aimed at normalizing ties in line with the principles set out in the U.N. and CSCE charters. Noting that the declaration does not imply mutual recognition of the two states, the Yugoslav foreign minister said that this was, nevertheless, the ultimate goal. The document also does not prejudge a solution for the status of the RSK, he explained. The right of peoples to self-determination is guaranteed in the Helsinki final act of 1975, and the Yugoslav Government does not question that fundamental right, said Jovanovic. The RSK, created in late 1991 by Serbs within their ethnic and historic boundaries, was proclaimed a U.N. Protected Territory in early 1992 in a document which set out that this status should last until a political settlement acceptable to both sides had been found. The fact that the RSK is a U.N.-Protected Territory has not stopped Croatia, however, from trying to introduce its rule there by force.
