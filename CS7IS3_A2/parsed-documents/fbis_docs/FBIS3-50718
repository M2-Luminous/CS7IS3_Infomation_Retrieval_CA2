The more than 179,000 grassroots solutions presented in 1993 confirm that mass participation was a decisive aspect for both military organizations. However, this did not hamper quality; on the contrary, it increased it. Technical and scientific discipline was an indispensable factor in maintaining the combat-readiness levels the times demand and to energetically fight crime. The skillful identification and integration of older and younger, highly trained specialists made it possible not only to repair and produce hundreds of pieces of equipment and parts, but also to remodel and produce new weapons. One of these is the Mambi, a 12.7-caliber semiautomatic rifle, ideal against personnel carriers and fire-support helicopters. This powerful rifle reached the national forum, where its creator, Lieutenant Colonel Armando Gutierrez, answered Fidel's questions. [Begin recording] [Castro] Does it pierce the shell of an armed personnel carrier? [Gutierrez] The bullet, at a distance of 500 meters, can penetrate a 20-mm sheet of steel. This was demonstrated in the test we conducted. We made several test shots with a U.S. Sherman tank, and it penetrated up to 35 mm. Therefore, it is possible that it will penetrate all light vehicles, which generally have an armor thickness no greater than 10 mm. [Castro] What armor do helicopters normally have? [Gutierrez] All helicopters, except the new generations under production right now, have light armor, which is therefore pierced by these bullets. All these bullets are piercing-incendiary bullets, even the tracers. Therefore, even while it is piercing, it also burns. [end recording] The results attained by the FAR and Minint in 1993, motivated by the science and technology movement, constitute a challenge for future forums. Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, a member of the Politburo and chief of the General Staff, spoke before the plenary of the Eighth Science and Technology Forum. [Begin recording] I believe that what we can tell the commander in chief today is that we have unleashed a mass movement aimed at guaranteeing the defense of the Revolution, which will provide extraordinary support to the Ninth Forum, not only in priority tasks, but also by solving small problems necessary to guarantee the defense of the Revolution. [end recording] The science and technology forum movement has entered a new phase in the FAR and Minint. All that is needed now is to perfect it as a method and workstyle, and to turn it into everyone's main duty -- the generals' and the soldiers.'
