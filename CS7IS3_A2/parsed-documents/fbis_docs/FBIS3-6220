Import growth outstripped that of exports, with slumping auto exports counterbalancing a pickup in semiconductor exports, while imports of computers surged, a ministry official said in explaining the monthly preliminary report. The overall merchandise trade surplus on a customs-cleared basis grew 3.3 percent from a year before, slower than some recent double-digit rises, to 10,912 million dollars. But the official said it was the largest February figure ever for the surplus, which has expanded every month for more than three years with the exception of last November. Imports grew 7.0 percent from a year before to 18,620 million dollars, while exports increased 5.6 percent to 29,533 million dollars. The surplus with the U.S. dipped 0.9 percent from a year before to 4,344 million dollars, the first decline in nine months, the official said. Imports grew 15.1 percent, outrunning a 6.8 percent rise in exports. The Japanese currency was up 13.5 percent from a year before to average 109.07 yen to the dollar in February, the official said. The higher yen should eventually curb Japan's surplus by making exports pricier in other currencies while making imports cheaper in yen terms. But in the short run it inflates the value of the surplus in the closely watched dollar terms. In yen terms, Japan's surplus continued to decline, falling 9.1 percent, with imports down 5.7 percent and exports off 7.0 percent from a year before. In volume terms, imports climbed 9.9 percent for their ninth straight gain, while exports dipped 3.6 percent, the official noted. On the export ledger, motor vehicles fell 16.7 percent to 4.6 billion dollars. That somewhat offset such increases as a 32.9 percent rise in semiconductors and electronic parts to 2.0 billion dollars, and a 79.0 percent jump in ship exports to 938 million dollars. Among the import gainers, computers and other office machines climbed 31.8 percent to 673 million dollars, semiconductors rose 43.9 percent to 488 million dollars, and clothing gained 41.2 percent to 1.0 billion dollars. But the value of crude oil imports sank 20.1 percent to 2.0 billion dollars, while that of petroleum products plunged 41.3 percent to 295 million dollars. The price of crude slumped 16.5 percent in February from a year before to an average 14.83 dollars a barrel, the official said. Contributing to the rise in U.S. imports was a 30.2 percent climb by computers and other office machines and a 26.9 percent increase in semiconductors and electronic parts. Among exports to the U.S., semiconductors were up 24.8 percent and auto parts rose 11.9 percent, while motor vehicle exports slipped 6.8 percent. Imports from the U.S. totaled 4,680 million dollars, while exports reached 9,024 million dollars. The trade surplus with the rest of Asia grew for the 22nd straight month, rising 5.8 percent to 4,389 million dollars, the official said. Exports to Asia rose 12.4 percent to 10,740 million dollars, with car engines up 40.7 percent and semiconductors rising 36.6 percent, the official said. Imports rose 17.5 percent to 6,351 million dollars. The surplus with the European Union also remained in decline, falling 15.8 percent to 2,269 million dollars. Exports fell 6.9 percent to 4,529 million dollars, with autos sagging 33.3 percent. European imports edged up 4.3 percent to 2,260 million dollars on increases such as autos, up 41.1 percent, and semiconductors, rising 21.9 percent.
