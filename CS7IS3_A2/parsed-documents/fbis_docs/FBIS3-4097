However, because some departments and units have treated in an improper manner enterprises' right to use export commodity trademarks, many disputes have occurred concerning trademark use, causing a certain amount of confusion in the domestic and international markets, damage to the reputations of the relevant trademarks, and a negative impact on the relevant enterprises' operations and development. To prevent the recurrence of this situation in the course of structural change and to make it easier for the relevant departments and units to handle the trademark problem properly, the following circular is issued: 1. Registered trademark proprietors can dispose of the use of their trademarks within the framework of the Trademark Law and the relevant regulations; no department or unit is allowed to interfere. 2. If an enterprise establishes another type of foreign trade enterprise and wishes to use the registered trademarks of others for foreign-related business operations, it must obtain approval from the registered trademark proprietors, and in accordance with the law, sign contracts approving the use of such trademarks. The unapproved use of the registered trademarks of others is prohibited. 3. Both signatories are responsible for the quality of the commodities bearing the approved trademarks. The approved enterprise is subject to the coordination, supervision, and management by the relevant department and by the approving enterprise with respect to sales market, customer, and price. The approved enterprise must have its name shown on the packing of the commodities bearing the registered trademarks of others. 4. In changing its structure or establishing other economic organizations, should an enterprise wish to transfer a domestically or foreign-registered trademark, it should abide by the principle of compensatory transfer (with the exception of those having an agreement). 5. Enterprise groups or other types of economic combination organizations the members of which are independent legal persons are not allowed to force these members to transfer their registered trademarks, nor is the higher administrative department allowed to force them to transfer their registered trademarks. 6. In principle, an enterprise using its registered trademark as investment capital cannot change its status as the main trademark proprietor. All levels of administrative departments are required to implement these provisions and to mediate in enterprises' trademark disputes according to the law in the course of foreign trade structural change. Serious violations of the Trademark Law and regulations, or infringements of the trademark proprietorship of others, must be stopped resolutely. If the higher administrative department violates the Trademark Law and regulations, or if it interferes in the normal use and management of registered trademarks, enterprises have the right to ask people's courts for legal protection. [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade 16 June 1992.
