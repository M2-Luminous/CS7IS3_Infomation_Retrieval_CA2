This 250-km-range missile had undergone a series of tests earlier, and the one carried out the other day was the last of the series. After the acquisition of the Prithvi missile, the Indian army's combat capability will increase many times, which will endanger the security of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and other small countries besides Pakistan. These countries are relatively weak compared to the tremendous military potential of India. According to Western media reports, India possesses a nuclear weapon, and it has amassed plutonium to the extent that it could make 25 to 30 bombs. India launched its missile program a decade ago, and since then it has experimented with various types of missiles, of which Prithvi and Agni [Fire] are top of the list. Agni is a long-range missile, whose range is 2,000 to 3000 kms. Although the Agni is in its early stages, after the successful test launch of Prithvi, Indian experts are now fully concentrating on Agni, and they will soon test-fire it successfully. It is a strange thing that the United States took serious note of Pakistan's acquisition of missiles from China and imposed sanctions against China. Pakistan has already been subjected to similar, even more stringent, sanctions. However, India's nuclear program, which deserves serious notice, was not given such a consideration. Now, it is understood that the United States has asked both Pakistan and India to roll back their missile programs. In this case also, Pakistan is being subjected to the same injustice in its nuclear program and missile production, which is justified by the Pressler Amendment. Those at the helm of affairs in the U.S. Administration also have now realized that the restrictions imposed on Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment are not justifiable. From this, it can be rightly expected that the United States will soon move to redress this injustice and end the discriminatory treatment on Pakistan.
