"The evidence collected by the Goldstone Commission is voluminous and credible" and suggests the AK-47 assault rifles "used in many criminal attacks on innocent people may be traced back, not to smugglers from Mozambique, but to the SAP [South African Police]." Minister of Law and Order Kriel "may have been kept in the dark" and Police Commissioner General van der Merwe "kept himself in the dark, diligently ignorant of the causes of the slaughter that has afflicted this country for years. However in both cases it is incomprensible that Mr de Klerk has failed to remove them from office, at least until the Goldstone investigations and the criminal investigations that must surely follow, are complete." The mystery is why Mr de Klerk clings "to the old guard under whose dubious supervision the rot set in." SUNDAY NATION Delaying Tactics -- The Goldstone Commission report "that there is a Third Force that has been perpetrating violence in the past four years" is welcome, "however we do not understand why the commission's report was not forwarded to the Attorney General for the immediate prosecution of those implicated," an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 20 March on page 6 notes. "The reluctance to detain the generals is likely to allow those implicated to interfere with investigations." "We cannot help but charge that De Klerk's strategy of ordering investigations instead of detentions is yet another delaying tactic in the hope the issue will be forgotten." "The ANC [African National Congress], through its influence in the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] should ensure that the entire command structure of the police be placed in neutral hands until a democratic government formally acquires the instruments of power. This includes removing Kriel from office." King Zwelithini's Proclamation -- "Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's Friday proclamation of kwaZulu/Natal as a sovereign kingdom and calls to his subjects to defend it at all costs, have confirmed our suspicions that he is nothing more than a puppet for Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi," the second editorial in the SUNDAY NATION on 20 March on page 6 notes. "To us, it seems the high-profile Buthelezi -- under pressure from leading international figures to join the national elections -- has opted to push the King forward to make pronouncements on his behalf and then claim to be supporting the position as a 'servant' of the monarch." "Maybe it is time that the King refrained from politics and left this to politicians." WEEKEND STAR "Breathtaking Litany of Shame" -- "The latest accusations against rogue policemen take the breath away," the "prima facie evidence" comes from "officers of the highest callibre, ranging from majors to a general, have been party to to the most damning exposure of third force activity so far," an editorial in the Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 19-20 March on page 14 notes. "Only one man has the power to act effectively: President de Klerk." "All the police officers named in the report must be suspended immediately, not sent on leave, and those men implicated who are not members of the SAP must not be allowed to skip the country." "De klerk must replace the Commissioner of Police General Johan van der Merwe, not only because the general bears ultimate responsibility, but because his lack of interest in bringing his own men to book is glaringly evident. Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel's performance must also come inder scrutiny." RAPPORT Urgent Action Needed on `Third Force' -- The Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans of 20 March points out in a page-20 editorial: "In the storm over possible involvement of senior policemen in a so-called Third Force which allegedly sowed violence, there is at present little more than allegations against certain people, and vehement denials." "The independent investigating team will have to present evidence which can be laid before a court, and on which a court must decide. The matter has been raised by the Goldstone Commission critical days before an election, and therefore it needs to be dealt with as speedily as possible. Those who are guilty must be punished by the court without delay, but the innocent must not have to live for months under the cloud of untested accusations. Not only they but the whole country is feeling a degree of uncertainty over the trustworthiness of the upholders of the law. Let us not have a repeat of the dismissal of military officers after the Goldstsone raid on the offices of Military Intelligence. As far as we can remember, not a single one of them has to date been convicted in a court of law, and some of them have in fact been reappointed to their posts. The question still remains over where the mistake lay: with the officers who were accused, or with the rash actions of the Goldstone Commission. With the election little more than a month away, this case must be treated with double the urgency."
