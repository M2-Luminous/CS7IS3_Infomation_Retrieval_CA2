Unfortunately the accident occurred when our head of state was tirelessly working towards getting Burundi out of the crisis and the sociopolitical stagnation in which it has been plunged since the tragic loss of late President Melchior Ndadaye. The Burundian Armed Forces convey to the entire nation, to the family of late President Ntaryamira, and to the families of the ministers who died in the tragedy, their deep sympathy and join them in this profound sorrow. They urge the people to maintain peace and dignity in these hard and trying times. They take this opportunity to reiterate to the follow-up committee, to the Parliament, and to the government, their firm determination to get our country out of the crisis. Signed, Defense Minister Gedeon Fyiroko.
