The United States, meanwhile, is consolidating its position as the world's largest arms supplier, while the Middle East remains far and away the biggest buyer. There is a connection between these two facts: The 1991 Gulf war had and continues to have immense impact on the market, and France--unlike the United States, which has carried off more than two-thirds of the arms trade in the region--has not yet reaped the benefits, appearances notwithstanding. Arms exports globally have fallen by close to two-thirds in the last 10 years, according to estimates (expressed in current dollars) from the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). Exports for 1984 totaled $72.8 billion, while the 1992 figure was $25.5 billion. The decline is thus perceptible. Exports to the Middle East have declined proportionately, but the latter remains the number one regional market for the arms trade, with three major clients: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates [UAE], and Israel. Iraq was at the top of the list for some time, but the post-Gulf war embargo war ended that, and nowadays Egypt, Qatar, and Kuwait, to cite only a few examples, are much bigger customers. L'ARMEMENT, a review published by the General Delegation for Armaments (DGA), focuses attention in its latest issue on the fact that the United States has won about 70 percent of the contracts signed in the Gulf since the war against Saddam Husayn. More than one-third of all American arms deliveries go to this region--more precisely, to Saudi Arabia and Israel, the biggest beneficiaries of what the Americans call FMS (foreign military sales): government-to-government transfers, and even gifts, of material. The practice has accelerated since the Gulf war, says L'ARMEMENT, since the volume of this new type of transaction has tripled over the last five years. France, by contrast, is cutting a rather pathetic figure. Of course, it is not doing as badly as the arms makers would have people believe. But the general trend is down, with annual sales over the next few years expected to average about 30 billion French francs [Fr]. According to provisional estimates, orders taken in 1993 totaled about Fr40 billion, down 12 to 13 percent from the Fr45.7 billion in 1992. Ten years ago, orders amounted to almost Fr62 billion. The defense minister had hoped new orders for 1993 would reach at least Fr50 billion, but the target was not met. True, 1992 saw an unusual surge with Taiwan's order (more than Fr30 billion all by itself) for 60 Mirage 2000-5. But a new trend seems to be emerging that could further aggravate France's already delicate position: Some clients--and not just minor ones, since they are Middle East countries--are reneging on contracts already signed between the two states. This is what is happening in Kuwait. That country's legislative body has reopened the issue of financing terms for the order of 155mm artillery pieces from France. The Kuwaiti Army had apparently underestimated the extra costs, beyond actual acquisition, involved in putting these batteries into service. In its Wednesday 6 April issue, the weekly strategic newsletter TTU--known for getting its information from highly reliable sources--claims to have learned that Kuwait did not really need the French arms but signed the contract to "commit a still-reluctant France" to play an active role in the area. It is also happening in the UAE. In 1993, France sold it 390 Leclerc battle tanks--not counting about fifty armored emergency repair vehicles--for the sum of Fr21 billion. On condition that French manufacturers involved in the deal reinvest Fr15 billion in the country as an offset. The two parties are having serious problems identifying domains of possible cooperation, and the UAE are now leaping on this pretext, threatening to renegotiate the entire contract if the investment commitment is not met. In Saudi Arabia, whose leaders are already being quietly urged to renegotiate the country's contracts with France for maintenance of warships and missiles, the vicissitudes of the Kuwaiti deal are being followed very closely. In fact, the Saudis too are considering a purchase of Leclerc tanks, and their current budgetary problems scarcely incline them toward generosity in their dealings with France.
