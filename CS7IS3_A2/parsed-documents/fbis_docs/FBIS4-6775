A NODONG SINMUN analyst, commenting on the war confabs Perry and the Kim Yong-sam group held with a view to doing harm to the DPRK, says: Raving that the North would "invade the South" if sanctions are taken by the United Nations, the U.S. defense secretary described their military step as one intended to prevent it and made quite a noise as if it were the DPRK, not the United States, that violated the DPRK-USA agreed conclusions. This is a jargon that could be uttered only by such warmaniacs as Perry who are accustomed to justifying their moves of aggression and war. It is the United States, not the DPRK, that failed to implement the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-USA contact in New York. It goes without saying that the United States needed to mass its Armed Forces in South Korea, an alien land, only to provoke a war. Perry decided to resume the "Team Spirit" war gamble with the puppets under unreasonable pretexts. This shows that they have no intention to seek a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue, and reveals his criminal intention to take the road of military adventure after massing U.S. Armed Forces on the Korean peninsula on the pretext of the North's "nuclear issue". Before setting foot in South Korea Perry sent Apache helicopters and Patriot missiles, and when he met with the puppets he pressured them to purchase heavy weapons of the United States, pressing home the need to build up the combat power of the U.S. forces and the puppet Army. It is the intention of the United States to rake up colossal profits by forcing them to open not only the rice market but even the arms market of South Korea. All this proves that the United States unilaterally discarded the Korean Armistice Agreement that prohibits the introduction of arms into South Korea for a war and the DPRK-USA joint statement on refraining from a nuclear threat to the DPRK and that the South Korean puppets nullified the North-South joint declaration on denuclearization that bans the introduction, deployment and production of nuclear weapons and are openly racing headlong along the road of war against the fellow countrymen. The U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are recklessly trying to stifle the DPRK with "strength", but it is a miscalculation. The United States must know clearly that military pressure or "sanctions" cannot work with the DPRK. If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets finally push the situation on the Korean peninsula to a dangerous phase of war, they would be unable to escape a thousand-fold blow. A MINJU CHOSON analyst warns that the aggressors and the traitors must act not rashly but prudently, clearly mindful of what tragic consequences their war frenzy would bring to them.
