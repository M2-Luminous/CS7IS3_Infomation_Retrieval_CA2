MITI's own survey found that prices for 23 of 25 items posted lower price indexes than under the management and coordination agency's official monthly consumer prices survey. The price index of video tapes, for example, was 171.3 in the February survey by the agency against 100 in the MITI survey conducted during the same month, MITI said. A MITI official said at a news conference that MITI's survey is more reflective of the actual retail price trend in Japan under the growing emergence of discounters. The official said MITI used price-evaluating methods including covering products sold in a bundle, such as videotapes and notebooks. The MITI survey, the first of its kind in Japan, was intended to assess how the Japanese Government's deregulation policy has impacted prices on store shelves, the official said, apparently dismissing arguments that the government has been reluctant to narrow a large price gap between products at home and abroad. The survey results can be taken to indicate that the purchasing power of Japanese consumers is stronger than generally believed, the official said. Other products that showed a large price gap with the official price survey included long-sleeved white shirts with an index of 147, tissue paper at 127.9 and television sets at 113.7, all against the base of 100 in the MITI survey. The MITI survey, conducted in Tokyo, also found that price gaps are wide among the various store categories. The average retail price index for the 25 items surveyed was 87.2 among discount stores, 113.1 among convenience stores, 96.7 among supermarket chains and 120.5 among department stores. Such prices gaps from one store category to another indicate not only the intensity of the ongoing price war in the retail sector but also a sharp expansion in product choices available to the consumer, the MITI official said. Among the polled items, men's underwear showed the sharpest price gap from one store to another, followed by tissue paper, videotapes and winter business suits, MITI said. On the other hand, items such as shampoo, paper diapers and health beverages showed the smallest price gaps among stores, MITI said, apparently because they are sold at their makers' recommended prices.
