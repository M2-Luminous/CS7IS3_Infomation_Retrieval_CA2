We certainly could not accuse NATO, reduced to merely carrying out UN orders, of wanting to take all the credit. Nevertheless, we still find it impossible to subscribe to the new instant-mix policy drawn up by Washington and registered on Friday [22 April] at NATO headquarters by the permanent Council of Ambassadors which drew up an ultimatum for the Bosnian Serbs. It is true that the impact of this strong-arm policy will please public opinion which was horrified by the Gorazde massacre, but the impartial observer must point out its inherent contradictions. The West, which wants to bring the Serbs back to the negotiating table, has decided, by unusually twisted thinking, that the fastest way to do this is by carrying out bombing raids that go beyond simply surgical strikes. The troops commanded by General Mladic have clearly demonstrated after the initial strikes that they will not hesitate to take retaliatory action and, consequently, attack blue helmet "hostages." The new strategy currently being implemented risks escalating a conflict in which the Americans refuse to participate on the ground. It has to be one thing or the other: Either Washington gives a whole new dimension to the Bosnian conflict and sends in the U.S. infantry or the White House administration sticks to a stance of cautious reserve to preserve UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] neutrality. There is no getting away from the fact that a new NATO ultimatum cannot be compared with that issued on 9 February aimed at lifting the siege of Sarajevo. That one was directed at the irregular Serbian troops and Bosnian Government forces.... Things have since changed. The whole concept of the neutrality of the blue helmets is collapsing. While it is acceptable in the name of human rights to impose an interventionist force on a country in the throes of civil war, is it really justified for NATO to take the side of one of the belligerents simply because it is the weaker? Moreover, insofar as it does take this decision -- without actually entering the war itself to assist "its" blue helmets -- will it not merely have accepted the responsibility for prolonging the war?
