"I deeply regret the reinstatement of this clause that has retaliation as a precondition," said Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Japan's auto industry has been under mounting pressure from the United States to boost purchases of U.S. Auto parts to help reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced Thursday that Clinton had signed an executive order reviving the super 301 clause which authorizes him to identify what Washington regards as unfair trade practices subject to retaliation. "Unilateral retaliation runs counter to the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)," said an official at a major Japanese automaker. "It's wrong to use the method of linking a macroeconomic issue like the (U.S. trade) deficit to a microeconomic issue (like auto trade)," he said. Some business people said it remains uncertain whether the U.S. will actually take sanctions against Japan. "I wonder if it is possible (for the U.S.) to do it because U.S. consumers will be the victims of import restrictions on autos," said an executive at one major automaker. But some others pointed to the need for Tokyo to take measures to rectify the bilateral trade imbalance, saying Japan has been slow in taking action on the issue. "The government should go ahead with macroeconomic measures to address the trade surplus by boosting domestic demand and recycling the surplus," NEC Corp. President Tadahiro Sekimoto said.
