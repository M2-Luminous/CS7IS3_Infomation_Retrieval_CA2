The two sides, however, agreed to meet again at 10 AM next Wednesday at Tongil-gak on the northern side of the demilitarized [zone] in the truce village of Panmunjom. The delegates to the fourth working-level inter-Korean contact could not even take up the problems related to the exchange of special envoys when North Korea demanded that they first discuss two new issues. North Korea demanded that South Korea stop trying to deploy Patriot anti-missile missile and clarify recent remarks by South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. The southern delegation, led by Song Yong-tae, vice minister of the National Unification Board, proposed at the meeting a 13-point agenda for discussions including the implementation of the delcaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the inter-Korean basic accords and a summit between President Kim and North Korean President Kim Il-song. Thursday's meeting ended a few hours after the South Korean Defense Ministry announced a conditional suspension of the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise "Team Spirit" in Seoul. South Korea and the United States have agreed to suspend the military exercise on condition that Pyongyang resume dialogue with Seoul for the exchange of special envoys to discuss issues including the North Korean nuclear question. "The southern side tabled a revised draft of the proposal for the exchange of special envoys to help resolve the nuclear issue and other measures to improve inter-Korean relations," Song said after the meeting. "But we could not make any progress in discussions for the exchange of envoys since North Korea raised four conditions," Song said. In addition to the two new demands, North Korea wanted South Korea to scrap the Team Spirit exercise and stop participating in an international campaign against North Korea. The two sides are expected to take up the question of exchanging special envoys at the next meeting on Wednesday, sources asid. In his opening statement, the South Korean chief delegate stressed that South and North Korea will have to exchange their special envoys before North Korea could hold a third round of high-level talks with the United States, which is tentatively slated for March 21 in Vienna. The special envoys have to be exchanged as soon as possible so that the two Koreas could solve the nuclear problem as well as other pending inter-Korean issues, Song said. Shortly before the meeting started at "Peace House" on the southern side of the demilitarized zone, Song met with the northern delegates and shook hands with them. He then noted that the inter-Korean contact was suspended in October last year "when the winter began to set in." "As we are meeting you here again today, we feel like we are waking up from a long hibernation," Song told the northern delegation led by his counterpart, Pak Yong-su. "I hope that the inter-Korean relations will also wake up from a long winter sleep and spring arrives in Panmunjom," Song added. The North Korean chief delegate deplored that "we wasted a whole season since we met each other last fall when grains were ripe for harvest." "Let us try to clear up problems for the exchange of special envoys within today," Pak said.
