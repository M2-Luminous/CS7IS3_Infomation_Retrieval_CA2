In an interview to Qol Yisra'el, Foreign Minister Peres said that the desire of Histadrut voters for a change should be respected. He adds however, that the results of the primaries must be honored if one seeks to maintain a democratic system. Peres warned of the danger of forsaking democracy to television in which a candidate's image counts more than level-headed considerations. As for the political process, Peres asserted that yesterday had marked the completion of an important stage in the process, with the next stage of elections in the territories and the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from population centers starting now. From now on, Peres noted, there would be two parallel tracks: One, in Washington, where the expansion of autonomy to the rest of the territories would be discussed. The second track would deal with the early empowerment of the Palestinian residents in the fields of education, health, social welfare, and taxation. On the eve of Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region, Foreign Minister Peres said there was no certainty that the visit would lead to progress in the negotiations with Syria seeing as up till now, Damascus had offered nothing new in its proposals which merely repeated previous, well-known Syrian positions.
