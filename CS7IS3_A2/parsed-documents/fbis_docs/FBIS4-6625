FBIS4-6625 "dreas078_a_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Food Imports Rise to Record High in 1993 Food Imports Rise to Record High in 1993 OW2004105994 Tokyo KYODO in English 1040 GMT 20 Apr 94 OW2004105994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Japan's food imports expanded 5.5 percent in 1993 to a record high 40,158.40 million dollars, going above the 40 billion dollar level for the first time, a governmental trade body said Wednesday [20 April]. The Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro) said the record high imports stemmed mainly from increases in fresh vegetables, beef, fish and rice. Imports of fresh vegetables, which suffered a poor crop as a result of a cool and rainy summer last year, posted a 15.4 percent climb, and those of beef rose 18.2 percent, supported by a reduction in custom duties and the yen's sharp rise, Jetro said. An 11.1 percent increase in fish, which has the largest share of total imports, also contributed much to the record high, it said. Imports of rice, which began as an emergency measure following a shortage of domestic rice in the wake of last year's unseasonable summer, totaled 107,900 tons worth 42.18 million dollars. Orange imports rose a tiny 2.8 percent, discouraged by lower prices of domestic "mikan" mandarin oranges, while imports of orange juice plunged 25.9 percent in a reactionary move against last year's surge after liberalization of the farm product.
