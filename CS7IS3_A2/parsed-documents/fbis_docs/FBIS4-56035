"I do not believe that the foreign banks could enter Poland all of a sudden and comprehensively." Chairman Krzak thinks that their entry into our market is unavoidable, while their presence here may be an opportunity as it would force others to compete with them. What do representatives of Polish banks think of that competition? Are they afraid of it? I am not afraid of healthy competition -- it can only change the market in a positive way -- Wojciech Haase, deputy chairman of Bank Gdanski SA told NOWA EUROPA. But unfortunately, we have seen some negative phenomena recently: Some of the foreign banks active in Poland began applying dumping prices, which may have a bad impact on the market. For instance, use is being made of calculating mandatory reserves according to the status on the last day of a month. But sooner or later, fundamental principles of competition will be defined. Just like foreign banks, Bank Gdanski is trying to act according to international standards, mainly in the area of treasury operations. A code of principles to be applied on the money and foreign currency market, should ensure a fair play type of competition. Pierwszy Komercyjny Bank in Lublin was established as an American bank. We are not particularly afraid of competition -- said Barbara Rudzinska, the bank's press spokesman. Three years ago, we were high above the level of our Polish competitors even when it comes to architectural design. Our clerks were also of high quality and we tried to implant similar notions throughout our domestic branches. All these innovations successfully met the test of practice -- our customers got to like us and other Lublin banks followed in our footsteps. We became a carrier of foreign competition ourselves. Of course, what is on the outside is not everything. A program of bringing the bank back to health -- which has been applied intensively -- contains many new elements which increase our competitiveness toward both domestic and foreign banks. Competition from foreign banks is an issue of the future broadly speaking. So banks have time to get ready for it. That will occur as the system's consolidation continues -- in which Kredyt Bank actively participates: Some examples are Bank Ziemski, Bank Regionalny in Rybnik, and there may be another similar move in the near future -- says Tomasz Uchman, Kredyt Bank's press spokesman. Facing up to the competition also entails a need to strengthen capital. Our bank can be an example to follow also in that regard. The issue of shares was carried out successfully, the bank's credibility will now be confirmed and publicly verified through the stock market. Thanks to the operation, our own financial means increased to over 1 trillion zlotys, which is high for Poland. It is also worth mentioning that Kredyt Bank has established reserves for lost credits in the amount required by the National Bank of Poland [NBP] as early as at the end of last year, that is, before the issue prospectus was published. True, it caused a drop in our results -- with net profit amounting to just 19 billion zlotys -- but the reserves at the level of 230 billion zlotys increase our credibility. This year, reaching the planned profit of 100 billion zlotys, seems realistic. In our activity, we try to make other indicators -- those of solvency, security, or the level of bad debts -- comply with NBP's requirements and regulations of the European Union [EU]. Once Poland becomes EU's member, only strong, secure, and efficient banks will be able to meet the challenge of competition. Professor Andrzej Olszewski, deputy chairman of Prosper Bank SA, is probably the only pessimist among bankers: Foreign banks have greater capital at their disposal -- which they can direct toward profitable activities -- and that is competition. Polish banks can finance ventures using share capital and their own assets, while foreign banks have the possibility to earn bigger money. As far as the competitiveness of services is concerned, foreign banks are not particularly interested in deposits by individuals, but in financing merchandise and investment turnover. They have sufficient capital for that, while Polish banks have to receive deposits from the population in order to accumulate such capital levels. The population in turn is looking for security that foreign banks and those banks that have NBP's guarantees, are more likely to provide, not -- as a general rule -- privately-owned banks.
