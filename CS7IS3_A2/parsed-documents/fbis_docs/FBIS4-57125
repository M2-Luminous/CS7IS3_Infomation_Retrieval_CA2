He said the coup d'etat against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was "as grave" as Saddam Husayn's invasion of Kuwait. In what was apparently a veiled criticism of U.S. inaction in the case of Haiti, Lula said he does not agree with "the policy of double weights and double measurements." These were Lula's first meaningful statements on foreign policy during his trip to the United States. Lula proposed the creation of "more agile mechanisms" to respond to attacks against the democratic order in Latin America. He criticized the proposal to create a permanent military force under the OAS to protect the region's democratic regimes, however. He said that under a PT administration, Brazil will not attempt to take a leadership role "on this specific question." Brazil will participate with other countries of the region in initiatives and actions that respect the principle of self-determination. During a luncheon with U.S. legislators, and afterwards during a public audience at the U.S. Congress, Lula diplomatically criticized the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba right in front of the measure's main supporter in Congress, New Jersey Democratic Representative Roberto Torricelli. Torricelli heads a House of Representatives foreign relations subcommittee, and was Lula's host on the occasion. "The embargo is against President Fidel Castro. It is not fair because the Cuban people suffer the consequences," Lula said. "I do not understand an initiative that has the purpose of protecting human rights in Cuba, but which leaves innocent Cuban children without food and medicines." Lula expressed hope that the U.S. Government would put aside its lasting animosity toward Cuba. He mentioned the agreement between Israel and the PLO as an example of an attitude that deserves to be followed. "Eight months ago, I visited Israel and met with the Israeli prime minister. At that time, a peace agreement with the Palestinians seemed impossible, but today the agreement is a reality." The third day of Lula's tour of the United States was also marked by moderation. On 10 May, he spoke before nearly 300 sympathizers who crowded a large amphitheater at Harvard University Law School. On the occasion, Lula and main economic adviser Aloizio Mercadante set aside the carefulness they had exhibited during their meetings with entrepreneurs. Sitting in front of them were some 50 Brazilians who study at Harvard. But most of those attending the meeting were young descendants of the tens of thousands of Brazilians who live in Boston's surroundings. But Lula regained the moderate tones that had characterized his meetings with bankers and New York business executives during his public and private meetings in Washington yesterday. Lula added a new line to the discussions on the foreign debt, an unavoidable topic at all meetings. He reiterated that if he is elected president he will not try to renegotiate the debt, "which has already been approved by the Senate. Some people find it difficult to accept the PT's disagreement with present debt agreements, which is very interesting, and the fact that we want to talk about it with creditors. These people do not react in the same way when the Dart family, whose members have $1.4 billion in Brazilian foreign debt titles, threaten to sue Brazil." Lula said during his meeting at the U.S. Congress that he will accept international financial and technological cooperation to design a sustainable development policy for the Amazon region "within a framework of absolute respect for our national sovereignty." Lula visited the THE WASHINGTON POST headquarters, where he was received by honorary president Katherine Graham. He also had an unscheduled meeting with Jim Hackney, Department of Commerce under secretary for Latin America [title as published], who promised to arrange a meeting with Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown when he visits Brazil at the end of the month. Lula's agenda today will begin with a breakfast with Richard Feinberg, National Security Council adviser for Latin America [title as published], and will end in New York with a reception at the residence of Ronaldo Sardemberg, Brazilian ambassador to the United Nations. Tomorrow, Lula will test his knowledge of economic issues at a forum with experts organized by Inter-American Dialogue. He will not have the help of Mercadante, who returned to Brasilia yesterday to participate in the vote on the process to strip Deputy Ricardo Fiuza of his privileges. Lula's visit to the United States will end tomorrow with a luncheon for nearly 700 people at the Hotel Marriott Marquis on Broadway.
