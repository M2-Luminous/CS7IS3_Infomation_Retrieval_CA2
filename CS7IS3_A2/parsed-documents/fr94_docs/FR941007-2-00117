FR941007-2-00117 FR941007-2-00072 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34765; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;36] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Equity-Linked Term Notes (``ELNs'') September 30, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on September 7, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which items have been prepared by the Amex. On September 20, 1994, the Amex filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 In Amendment No. 1, the Exchange proposes to require issuers of ELNs who reserve the ability to satisfy their obligations at maturity with either cash or shares of the linked security to publish notice, no less than 10 and no more than 20 business days prior to maturity of the ELNs, of how the issuer intends to satisfy its obligations. See Letter from Claire McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated September 20, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Amex proposes to amend: (1) Section 107A of the Amex Company Guide (``Guide'') to allow the Exchange greater latitude in evaluating the listing eligibility of those securities which cannot be readily categorized under the Exchange's existing listing criteria; and (2) Section 107B of the Guide to provide for greater flexibility in the listing criteria for Equity-Linked Term Notes (``ELNs''). The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In March 1990, the Commission approved the adoption of Section 107A of the Guide, which provides listing criteria for hybrid securities, i.e., securities that have features common to both debt and equity securities, yet do not fit within the traditional definitions of such securities. 2 In May 1993, the Commission approved the adoption of Section 107B of the Guide to specifically permit the listing of ELNs. 3 An ELN is an intermediate-term, hybrid instrument whose value at maturity is linked to the performance of a highly capitalized, actively traded common stock or sponsored ADR. 2 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27753 (March 1, 1990), 55 FR 8626 (March 8, 1990). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32343 (May 20, 1993), 58 FR 30833 (May 27, 1993). The Exchange's ELNs listing standards were subsequently amended to broaden the universe of securities eligible to underlie an issue of ELNs. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33328 (December 13, 1993), 58 FR 66041 (December 17, 1993) (order providing alternate trading volume and market capitalization requirements for the underlying security) and 34549 (August 18, 1994), 59 FR 43873 (August 25, 1994) (order allowing ELNs linked to sponsored American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') and other securities issued by non-U.S. companies subject to reporting requirements under the Act) (``Exchange Act Release No. 34549''). Section 107A of the Guide currently specifies minimum issuer qualifications, public distribution, aggregate market value guidelines, and other criteria to assist the Exchange in its case-by-case review and determination of the suitability of any hybrid security (including ELNs) for listing and trading. The Exchange now proposes to amend Section 107A of the Guide to provide additional flexibility in the listing of such securities. Specifically, it is proposed that the aggregate minimum market value criteria be changed from $20 million to $4 million, consistent with the current listing requirements for currency and index warrants under Section 106 of the Guide. The Exchange also proposes to eliminate, in favor of a case-by-case review, the minimum holder requirement for securities that are listed pursuant to Section 107A of the Guide but which are traded in thousand dollar denominations on the Exchange's bond trading floor.
