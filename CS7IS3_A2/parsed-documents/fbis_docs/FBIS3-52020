In a statement to the media last night, Conpaz member Roger Maldonado confirmed the bodies of Jorge Solis, 21, and Eduardo Gomez, 22, were found "in an advanced stage of decomposition" near a rural road in Las Margaritas. Citing eyewitness reports, Maldonado said the young men had been arrested by policemen, transferred to a local jail, and "moved that same day by Mexican Army soldiers" to another town. Their corpses, which had been "mutilated" by buzzards, showed "numerous knife wounds on different parts of the bodies," according to Maldonado. For the past two weeks, international organizations have charged the Mexican Army with alleged human rights violations and "extreme abuse" against prisoners. These accusations have been denied by the Defense Ministry. Meanwhile, amid expectations of a possible start to negotiations between the government and the guerrilla forces, the capital's news media on Wednesday "urged" political and social reconciliation in southern Mexico. Some 26 days after the rebellion broke out in Chiapas, the media is viewing as "positive" the rebels' offer to negotiate a series of demands, as well as President Carlos Salinas' promise to seek a solution to the crisis "through dialogue, reason, and harmony." "The most urgent matter is to work toward reconciliation," it was stated in an editorial in the progovernment morning newspaper EL MATUTINO. The independent newspaper LA JORNADA asked both parties to "take action" by way of "specific decisions that will lead to a dialogue for which the entire nation is waiting and hoping." In communiques that were released Tuesday, the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) proposed a "public dialogue" with the government based on an agenda that includes its political, social, and economic demands. "Peace Commissioner" Manuel Camacho Solis replied he would announce on Thursday a "detailed proposal" to carry out "a serious, honest, and responsible dialogue" with those who rebelled on 1 January. Moreover, Salinas made a quick trip on 25 January to Tuxla Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas, where peasants and Indians demanded food and clothing, medical attention, and support for the reconstruction of areas affected by military clashes. All of these facts, which have been interpreted by the media as "encouraging signs" of rapprochement, improve upon last week's situation in which the possible beginning of a political negotiation was far from certain. "The EZLN destroyed the filigree President Salinas had constructed around himself during his five years in office," and it has "compelled the regime to take stock of its situation," wrote EL FINANCIERO columnist Raymundo Riva Palacios. During his visit to Chiapas, Salinas promised representatives of 280 Indian organizations he would help them "promote peace, development, and justice," adding that the government "favored a project to improve the people's life."
