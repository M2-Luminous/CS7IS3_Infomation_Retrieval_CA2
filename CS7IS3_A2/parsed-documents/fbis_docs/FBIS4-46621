Chekmarev, military economics and finances department editor of TYL VOORUZHENNYKH SIL VOYENNO EKONOMICHESKIY ZHURNAL, date, place and occasion unknown, under rubric "Pertinent Interview": "A Package of Military Laws"] [Text] Our correspondent's questions are answered by Colonel General V. Vorobyev, chief of Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Main Military Budget and Finance Directorate. Colonel General Vasiliy Vasilyevich Vorobyev was born on 11 May 1946 in the settlement of Gidrotorf, Balakhninskiy Rayon, Gorkiy Oblast. He completed the Yaroslavl Military School imeni General of the Army A. V. Khrulev in 1966 and the Military Faculty at Moscow Finance Institute in 1974. He successively went through various positions in the troops: chief of finance service of a battalion, regiment, division, army and military district (Siberian Military District, Southern Group of Forces, Ural Military District, Far East Military District). He has been on the central staff since June 1990 (first deputy chief, then chief of the Main Directorate). Married, has two children. [Chekmarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, our country is experiencing a very difficult time. It is fully natural that the situation which formed in the Russian Armed Forces fully reflects the socioeconomic and political situation in society. Therefore, evidently from the very beginning of establishment of the Russian Army the military leadership has encountered very difficult problems that demand solution without delay. In your view, which of these problems are most acute? [Vorobyev] The first and probably most important one is the insufficient legislative base for Armed Forces vital activities. Because of this, so-called irregular situations often arise which make both the central staff and the troops feverish. Many of Russia's fundamental laws entering into the "military package" have not yet been adopted, and those which were adopted are not "working" to full capacity, since the mechanism for their realization has not been completely adjusted. In particular, this concerns the Russian Federation Laws "On Defense" and "On the Status of Servicemen." One other very acute problem is establishment of a Russian Army military-technical base meeting modern requirements. It is no secret to anyone that after partition of the USSR Armed Forces our state basically got the troops of interior districts, i.e., the second strategic echelon, and Russia's share of the newest arms was only 20 percent. Moreover, battle management, communications, intelligence, and missile and air attack warning systems and the system for providing troops with necessities of life and combat training were disrupted. Closely adjoining this problem is the need for removing troops from the territory of other states and settling-in hundreds of thousands of officers, warrant officers and enlisted men at new permanent station locations, difficulties in solving problems of servicemen's social protection, and the near-crisis situation with manning of military units and ships. And finally, economic disorders in the country, a new system of troop manning providing for contract service, conversion being carried out hastily and, unfortunately, not always in a well thought-out way, involvement of troops in regional conflicts, and also the very rigid framework of the military budget generate additional problems in Armed Forces organizational development. [Chekmarev] What has been done lately and what is planned to be done to protect servicemen against inflationary processes occurring in the country and to improve pay for military labor? [Vorobyev] The Russian Federation government periodically indexes pay by raising base pay and allowances. Thus, the position pay of all categories of servicemen was raised seven times just during 1992-1993. Under conditions of inflationary processes occurring in the country the main emphasis beginning in 1990 has been placed on strengthening social protection of junior and mid-level officers, warrant officers and extended-term servicemen whose level of base pay and allowances (pay for position and rank) periodically was increased more significantly than the level of base pay and allowances of general and flag officers. Payment of a monetary reward for a class rating was established for the first time beginning in 1990 as a financial incentive for officers at the troop level to perfect professional expertise. It presently is 10 percent of position pay. Payment of a monetary reward for a rating category was established in these same amounts for medical servicemen. The Ministry of Defense worked purposefully to expand the benefits of servicemen performing their duty under special conditions and whose service involves risk to health and life (pilots, navymen, landing personnel and so on). Specific work also was done to improve supplementary payments to servicemen performing duty in remote localities and in localities with difficult climatic conditions. For example, as of 1 January 1993 payment of higher position pay was established there in the amount of the regional factors applied to wages of workers and employees in corresponding localities, if an increase in servicemen's pay previously was not provided for there in amounts exceeding the amounts of these factors. A number of restrictions were removed on paying higher position pay to servicemen performing duty in these localities. As of 1 January 1993 significant supplementary payments and benefits were established for those servicemen who serve on territories of Transcaucasian and Baltic states and in the Republic of Tajikistan, and also who perform missions under conditions of a state of emergency and in armed conflicts (these are payments of one and one-half or two times base pay and allowances, a preferential offset for years served for pension and so on). That is when the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen" was placed in force, providing for a number of benefits, guarantees and advantages in social protection for servicemen, citizens discharged from military service and their families. In general, this law deserves to be the topic of a separate conversation. Let us focus attention on the important thing. Benefits and guarantees established for servicemen are in the nature of compensation. They have the purpose of compensating for restrictions on certain general civilian rights and freedoms dictated by features of military service, and unquestionably have the purpose of socially protecting servicemen and elevating the prestige of military service. Guarantees of pay for military labor are legislatively incorporated for the first time in this important document. Thus, Article 12 of the Law points out that pay for initial military positions of privates and seamen performing contract military service cannot be less than five minimum amounts of pay, and pay for rank cannot be less than half of military position pay. Consequently, the Law now guarantees payment of base pay and allowances to servicemen performing contract service in the initial position in an amount of at least 7.5 times the minimum amount of pay for labor. In addition, the amount of servicemen's station allowance was doubled, including for family members, on official reassignments. The Law also did not ignore servicemen being discharged on reaching the maximum age for active military service and also being discharged for sickness and in connection with table of organization measures. As of 1 January 1993 the one-time allowance on being discharged for those reasons was set in the amount of from 5 to 20 times base pay and allowances (depending on overall duration of military service) instead of that previously paid in the amount of five times base pay and allowances. Active work has been going on in recent years to unify the system of base pay and allowances for warrant officers, extended-term servicemen and officers in order to establish a uniform system for paying for the labor of servicemen performing contract service. For example, payment of a percentage increment for years served was introduced for extended-term servicemen and warrant officers in the very same amounts as for officers, and increments for special conditions of service, an increment for continuous service in remote localities, and others were established in identical amounts with officers. The Ministry of Defense will continue systematic work to strengthen social protection of servicemen and their families and to improve the system of base pay and allowances, especially with respect to servicemen serving under contract. [Chekmarev] Many critical letters about late payment of base pay and allowances and wages to Army and Navy personnel come to the editors, and probably also to the Main Directorate you head. And many are inclined to place the blame for this on military finance officers. I would like to learn your opinion on this problem. [Vorobyev] There is no denying that an enormous load and responsibility will fall on the Armed Forces Finance Service in the situation at hand. On the one hand, a periodic or, more correctly, systematic increase in base pay and allowances, wages and pensions demands considerable labor inputs for recomputation. But on the other hand, the constant shortage of Russian Federation Ministry of Defense financing and its unsystematic accomplishment in terms of volumes and time, beginning with the Ministry of Finance and ending with the military unit level, create a nervous atmosphere in Army collectives and give rise to unfavorable criticism of Finance Service work. And how many troubles are brought to us by the instability and contradictoriness of hastily adopted laws, which as a rule are not backed up economically! Whoever you like can argue about a poor rule of law, but just not finance workers. They must make decisions and assume responsibility for the blunders of others. I must declare with all responsibility that the heads of the Ministry of Defense and Main Military Budget and Finance Directorate are taking all necessary steps to stabilize the situation of financial support of the Army and Navy. But the state's economic situation is such that numerous efforts for now are not producing the desired result, and this circumstance cannot be blamed on the Finance Service, since on the whole it is coping with its tasks. Officials of our Directorate work a great deal in central economic and governmental entities, defending Armed Forces interests. We are giving most careful attention to ensuring a very strict regime of economy in expending the resources being allocated for defense, to strengthening fiscal control, and to coming up with proposals aimed at strengthening social protection of servicemen and Armed Forces veterans and their families. [Chekmarev] One other important problem is the construction and procurement of housing for servicemen, especially those arriving on the territory of Russia from abroad. What kind of funds are being spent for these purposes? [Vorobyev] In accordance with Russian Federation Presidential Edict No. 796 of 21 July 1992, the Ministry of Defense received the right to direct not only appropriations provided by the federal budget for financing centralized capital investments, but also extra-budgetary funds obtained from selling freed-up military property, for building and purchasing housing for servicemen. In 1993 over R600 billion from the republic budget and an additional R5 billion of extra-budgetary funds for constructing and purchasing apartments were sent to pay for construction of housing under the state defense order. In 1994 it is envisaged allocating funds for building 73,300 apartments--more than in the past year. [Chekmarev] Are Russian Federation Ministry of Defense enterprises and organizations subject to privatization? [Vorobyev] In accordance with the State Program for Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation for 1994, Ministry of Defense enterprises are not subject to privatization. Considering that Russian Ministry of Defense enterprises and organizations are a very important element in ensuring Armed Forces combat readiness and vital activities, in my view it is advisable to refrain from privatizing them even subsequently. It is necessary to perform purposeful work to strengthen the Army and Navy material-technical base, to outfit them with modern kinds of arms and military equipment, and to keep equipment service life at the proper level based on upgrading and developing the performance of military repairs. [Chekmarev] Many letters come to journal editors from Armed Forces veterans who are military retirees on matters concerning their pension support, and in particular on ensuring timely payment of pensions in new amounts when there is a mass recomputation of them. How is this matter being resolved presently and what steps are being taken by the Main Military Budget and Finance Directorate to accelerate getting pensions in the increased amounts directly to military retirees? [Vorobyev] A solution to this problem is very important at the present time under conditions of the rise in prices on goods and services and inflationary processes occurring in the country, inasmuch as a delay in paying a pension in the new amount devaluates it and lowers its buying power. By decision of the Main Military Budget and Finance Directorate, almost all military commissariats were supplied with personal computers to improve pension support and shorten the time for getting pensions in the new amounts to military retirees. This permits recomputing pensions in 2-3 weeks, and even faster for those military commissariats where a small number of retirees are registered. In addition, pension entities of military commissariats are attempting to adjust close business contacts with Savings Bank establishments in order to help the latter's employees complete documents for payment of pensions. And still there continue to be shortcomings in pension support work. The callousness and bureaucratism of some military commissariat workers have not yet been fully eradicated. Delays in assigning and recalculating pensions are allowed in places. There also are simply mistakes in determining the amounts of pensions and allowances, as a result of which the rights of some retirees are infringed. We see omissions and defects in the work of pension entities. Exactingness toward them has been raised. The majority of military commissariats and finance and economic directorates of military districts have been reinforced by experienced officers of finance and pension entities by decision of the minister of defense in order to improve the quality of work of servicing retirees. In short, everything depending on us is being done and will be done to strengthen the social protection of Armed Forces veterans. [Chekmarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, tell me, please, what social guarantees are envisaged for servicemen in case their health is harmed, and also for their families in case they are killed or die, for it is no secret that many Russians now serve in so-called "hot spots"? [Vorobyev] I agree with you that many Russian servicemen presently are performing military duty honorably in areas with an unstable sociopolitical situation, under conditions of a state of emergency, and in regions where armed conflicts are taking place. In order to socially protect servicemen in case their health is harmed or to protect their families in case the breadwinner is killed or dies, the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen" provides for state personal insurance. In accordance with this Law, insurance coverage norms which substantially strengthen the social protection of servicemen and their families were introduced beginning 1 March 1993 by decree of the Russian Federation government. I will give just one example. In case a servicemen performing contract military service dies in the line of duty, his family, consisting of his wife, two children and parents, altogether will receive 125 times the base pay and allowances authorized the serviceman on the day of his death. The procedure for completing documents and also for paying allowances and insurance is spelled out by the Russian Federation Minister of Defense Order of 6 May 1993. I would like to emphasize that it is the responsibility of the Military Insurance Company to make payments in accordance with the order I mentioned in order to shorten the time of paying the insurance sums so needed by families specifically at this moment. As of today, that insurance coverage answers the realities of the present moment. The Military Insurance Company is joining more and more actively in the work of social protection of servicemen. To assist families with many children, it has transferred from its funds R50 million each to the Far East Military District and Northern Fleet and R75 million each to the Transbaykal Military District and Airborne Troops. The Military Insurance Company purchased 35 apartments for servicemen with an overall area of 2,000 m[.sup]2[/], and other charitable acts are being carried out. Was such a thing really possible two or three years ago, when the Gosstrakh [Main Administration of State Insurance] "called the tune"?! Meanwhile, Army and Navy personnel still are making insufficient use of capabilities of the Military Insurance Company, although it can insure the lives of children and other members of the serviceman's family, a summer house, a car and much more. [Chekmarev] Changes in the country's economy, the trend toward a reduction of defense expenditures and of the economic foundations of Russian Federation military doctrine dictate the need to perfect the mechanism for providing troops with arms, military equipment and other material-technical resources, and consequently also with finances, which are the circulatory system of the military economy. Our journal's readers would be interested in learning how the activity of the Armed Forces Finance Service will be transformed under market conditions. [Vorobyev] You are right, the country's transition to market relations, the sharp reduction in defense expenditures, instability in allocating appropriations, and an expansion in Armed Forces relationships with enterprises and organizations with various forms of ownership require developing new approaches aimed at ensuring thrifty, rational use of resources being allocated for defense, especially for developing arms and military equipment programs and for capital construction. Successful performance of these tasks will be determined to a considerable extent by the status of economic activity at all levels of military management. The Economic Service was established to develop and implement a unified economic and financial policy in the Armed Forces. Its tasks include performing an economic analysis of measures envisaged by basic provisions of Russian Federation military doctrine, forecasting military-economic decisions being made, and determining the economically substantiated need for appropriations for financing troops and naval forces and for socioeconomic development of enterprises and organizations engaged in industrial production and construction. The Economic Service is to function along with existing finance entities. Economic structures presently permeate all military management entities, beginning with formations. [Chekmarev] In connection with the reduction in the Armed Forces, a considerable amount of arms, military equipment and property is being freed up. How does the Ministry of Defense plan to dispose of this wealth? [Vorobyev] The Ministry of Defense is given the right to sell freed-up military property in accordance with Russian Federation Presidential Edict No 1518 of 30 December 1992. In preparing the draft of this edict the Russian Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for Administration of State Property] demanded that there be a maximum limitation on the number of persons engaged in sales to preclude instances of abuse in selling military property. In this connection it is permitted to sell Ministry of Defense property in the domestic market only through the Specialized State Cost-Accounting Enterprise, and in the foreign market exclusively through the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Central Directorate of Material Resources and Foreign Economic Relations. But it stands to reason that not all property will be sold directly to the national economy. A portion of it may be used only after presale preparation. In addition, arms and military equipment cannot be used directly in the national economy. For their effective use it is necessary to arrange for their parting and thorough conversion, using industrial enterprises. It is for these very purposes that special state programs are being developed for recycling arms and military equipment. [Chekmarev] What are the main problems in selling and recycling arms, military equipment and property? [Vorobyev] Improving the sales mechanism, for example. At the present time a considerable portion of military property is being sold on the exchanges, but used property, as you realize, is not considered exchange goods. The auction form of trading in property should have been developed to a greater extent, but unfortunately the advantages of auctions are not being used to the full extent for now. The question is being examined of organizing small wholesale and retail trade stores, which in our opinion will allow simplifying the very process of selling property. Today that process requires completing a considerable number of documents, which gives buyers of products certain inconveniences. [Chekmarev] Vasiliy Vasilyevich, the final question: What is the role of fiscal control under conditions of market relations? [Vorobyev] Under conditions of a reduction in the Armed Forces and the country's transition to market relations, the main task of fiscal control was to monitor fulfillment of Russian Federation Presidential Edicts, Russian government decrees and instructions, and Russian Federation minister of defense orders and directives on financial and economic matters, to monitor observance of state and financial discipline in expending funds, and to monitor timely, correct financial support to Army and Navy combat readiness. A basic direction of control is the study of causes of deficiencies and disruptions in financial and economic activity, prevention of excesses and mismanagement in expending funds and supplies, development of proposals for improving financial and economic activity, and assistance to commanders and chiefs in organizing and managing finances. Under present conditions, when commerce and, let's put it this way, illegal entrepreneurial activity of some heads of military force elements is actively penetrating the Armed Forces economy, Finance Service inspectors are faced with new problems concerning a check of the legality of this activity and computation of the amounts of damage and losses which our Armed Forces suffer because of this. Such commercial and entrepreneurial activity has assumed especially wide scope in the Air Force, Navy (Pacific, Baltic and Northern fleets) and GLAVTU [Main Transportation Directorate]. Materials of audits and inspections of financial and economic activity of various military force elements indicate that a number of officials are taking advantage of connivance and the absence of control and are using aircraft for transporting commercial cargoes, personal cars and passengers. As a result, earned funds did not end up in the cash boxes of military units, but accumulated in the accounts of commercial organizations, which did material damage of many millions of rubles to the state. During 1992-1993 a number of Air Force servicemen illegally were founders or held leadership positions in commercial structures. This is clear nonfulfillment of the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen"... Many violations have been uncovered by audits and inspections in connection with the sale of automotive and aviation equipment to outside organizations and commercial structures. Control over legality of operations and proper establishment of prices is not being carried out and the sale was made at underestimated prices, which was one of the reasons for material damage being done to the state. Rather serious violations in commercial and business activity were uncovered, for example, in the Directorate of the Commander, Military Space Forces and in military units subordinate to him. I would like to note that control and audit entities and Finance Service inspectors maintain close contact with entities of the military procuracy in their practical work. Based on materials of audits and inspections, criminal proceedings have been and are being instituted against guilty persons. A number of orders of the minister of defense, commanders in chief of branches of the Armed Forces, commanders of military districts and fleets, and chiefs of main and central directorates of the Ministry of Defense have been issued based on results of audits and inspections. Guilty officials are being held strictly liable disciplinarily as well as financially. The organization and accomplishment of control is a very important function of the Finance Service. In connection with this, it is necessary to continue the search for ways of improving it and raising its quality. The main efforts should henceforth be aimed at preventing financial violations and giving practical help in troop activity locally. And of course, the demand on officials who have allowed violations in use of funds and supplies must be strict, in accordance with demands of the laws.
