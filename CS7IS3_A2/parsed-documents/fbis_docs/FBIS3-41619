This was announced at a meeting of the Norwegian/Russian environmental commission in Murmansk this week. The current round of bids will be closed within a short time. ``We were told that the work to modernize the plant would be started toward the end of 1994 or in the beginning of 1995,'' says State Secretary Borre Pettersen of the Environmental Protection Agency. During the past year there has been speculation about whether the Russian authorities themselves, and not least the combine that owns the smelting works at Kola, would not prefer to close down the works rather than carry out a modernization that would cost about 4.5 billion kroner. A large portion of the ore that is being smelted at Kola is carried by rail from the north Siberian city of Norilsk, where the combine has other smelting works. Now, however, it looks like nickel ore will continue to be smelted at Kola. The ice-free harbor probably plays a decisive factor. Norwegian Support Norwegian authorities made it clear during the meeting in Murmansk that the promise of environmental support of up to 300 million kroner for the project is still valid, and that the aid is not dependent on giving any orders to the Norwegian company Elkem in connection with the modernization. ``This is pure environmental support that eventually will be granted when we are given assurances that the emissions of sulphur and heavy metals are as low as we demand,'' Pettersen says. Nuclear Storage At the Murmansk meeting Pettersen was informed that Russian authorities are now working more concretely than before on building a long-term storage facility for waste with low or intermediate levels of radioactivity. The plant will be located either at Novaya Semlya or east of the Kola peninsula. The Russians have responded positively to the Norwegian request to participate in the planning as an advisor. No promises were given as to Norwegian economic support for the building itself. Because the dumping in the ocean of low-level radioactive liquid waste again has been on the agenda since the Japanese protested dumping in the Pacific, Pettersen raised the subject: ``Russian environmental authorities did not inform us as to where they were dumping, how much, or anything like that. They stressed, however, that Russia aims to stop the dumping, but so far this is impossible because there are no storage facilities on land.'' New Expedition Norway and Russia have agreed to carry through another research expedition to the Kara Sea next year in order to examine the Abrosimov Bay on the east side of Novaya Semlya. A common project will also be carried out in order to evaluate to what degree the nuclear plants in Mayak pose a risk for the northern areas from the river Ob. To be established under the commission is a subcommittee that will work with the ocean environment in the Barents region, write a report on the present conditions, make a list of priorities of things to be done, initiate new research, and coordinate current research. A training program in environmental technology for leaders and engineers in Russian industry will also be started. It was also agreed to continue working on plans to create a completely new system to coordinate environmental data in Russia. The long-term goal is to establish such a center in Moscow.
