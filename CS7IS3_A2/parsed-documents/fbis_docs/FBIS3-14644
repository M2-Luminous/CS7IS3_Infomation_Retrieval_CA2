Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali recently chaired a limited cabinet meeting to discuss the summit, the normal transfer of the UMA chairmanship from Tunisia to Algeria, and a follow-up of the implementation of the agreements and achievements made during the period of Tunisia's chairmanship throughout 1993. Although the date of the sixth Maghreb summit is only five days away, the fear of the summit being postponed for the fourth time still exists. Observers have confirmed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that it is feared that a number of the UMA leaders may not attend the summit. So far there has been no support, at least not from Morocco and Libya, for the holding of the summit. Diplomatic observers have expressed fears that a further postponement of the sixth Maghreb summit might open the way for interpretations and claims as a result of which the UMA's activities might be suspended. The summit has already been postponed three times. [passage omitted]
