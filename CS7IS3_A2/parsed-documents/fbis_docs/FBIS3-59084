Hagensen gave Jagland a unique testimonial and described the personal chemistry between them as "excellent." He said the present division of labor between the party leader and the prime minister is a major reason for the Labor Party's gains in the election and in the opinion polls. Hagensen confirmed that cooperation between the LO and the party is more flexible now than it was when Gro Harlem Brundtland was party leader. He said the strained relations that prevailed between himself and Brundtland at times was due to the fact that they both have a very direct style. It is no secret that Hagensen fought behind the scenes to get "his" man in as the head of the Labor Party after Prime Minister Brundtland made the surprise announcement at the national congress in November 1992 that she was resigning as party leader. As head of the nominating committee, Hagensen had a finger in the pie. He has now confirmed that he got the result he wanted. "The personal chemistry is excellent. I think Thorbjorn is doing a good job as party leader. He also has the Storting group under control. I was sure that when he got a leading role, he would acquire the kind of self-confidence that would allow him to flourish. He has done so, and at the same time, Gro is doing a good job as prime minister. There is a good division of labor between the party leader, the prime minister, and the government," Hagensen said. We asked what had caused the strained relations between Hagensen and the prime minister. "My style is direct and so is hers. We do not restrain ourselves when we disagree. Even though everyone expects us to lay all disagreements aside and put on a good act when we hold a joint news conference. But that is not the way we are, Gro and I." Hagensen stressed that it was mainly their personal styles that led to collisions. "My personal relations with Brundtland have never been negative, let me emphasize that. But when we disagree, we are unable to conceal it. She says what she thinks, and I say what I think."
