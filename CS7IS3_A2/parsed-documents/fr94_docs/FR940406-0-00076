FR940406-0-00076 FR940406-0-00005 (2) The Secretary of Defense is authorized by Pub. L. 103&hyph;160, Section 2903 to convey real property at an installation to be closed to the local redevelopment authority for economic development (an economic development conveyance). The conveyance of property may be for consideration at or below the estimated fair market value, or without consideration. The consideration, if any, can be paid in cash or in kind. Property to be transferred pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;160, section 2903, will be conveyed with no consideration, subject to recoupment as described in paragraph (f) of this section. (3) The economic development conveyance authority is an addition to existing public benefit authorities and, generally, should not be used when these public benefit authorities would apply. The Military Departments shall prepare a written explanation why a transfer was made using this economic development conveyance authority for what appears to be a purpose covered by an existing public benefit authority. (4) Before making an economic development conveyance of real property, an appraisal or other estimate of the property's fair market value shall be made, based on the proposed reuse of the property. The Military Department shall consult with the local redevelopment authority on appraisal assumptions, guidelines and on instructions given to the appraiser, but shall be fully responsible for completion of the appraisal. When a property is conveyed for economic development with no initial consideration, the Military Department shall prepare a written explanation why the estimated fair market value was not received and retain it in their real property files. (5) Property may be conveyed under Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;160 to an authorized local redevelopment authority for economic development following submission of a written request to the Secretary of the Military Department concerned disposing of the property. The requests should contain the following elements: (i) Description of the property to be conveyed. (ii) Statement of the local redevelopment authority's legal authority to acquire and dispose of property under the laws of the governing State. (iii) A redevelopment plan that includes economic development and job creation. (iv) A statement explaining why existing public benefit conveyance authorities are not appropriate. (6) Installations located in rural areas are of particular concern. An economic development conveyance may be made without consideration and without recoupment in a rural area when the base closure will have a substantial adverse impact on the economy of the local community and on the prospect of its economic recovery from the closure. To determine whether a rural community is eligible for transfer under this section, the Secretary concerned shall first determine whether the closure will have a substantial adverse impact on the prospect for economic recovery by determining whether there is a market for the property. The closure may be determined to have substantial adverse impact if after advertising for expressions of interest pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, no expressions of interest are received. No expressions of interest to purchase the property signifies that public or private developers will not be able to provide jobs and economic growth sufficient to provide timely recovery from closure without assistance. The second step requires the Secretary concerned to make a determination that the base closure will have a substantial adverse impact on the economy of the communities in the vicinity of the installation. In these cases, the base shall be offered to the local redevelopment authority for conveyance without consideration and without recoupment (subject to paragraph (f)(5) of this section). (7) The provisions of this section may not be appropriate for some of the 1988 and 1991 base closures and realignments, because these bases are so far along in the property disposal process that certain actions have been taken or agreed to that are inconsistent with the new procedures. In cases where the new property disposal process is not appropriate, the Secretary concerned shall request a waiver from the ASD(ES) before proceeding with the disposition of the property. (f) Profit sharing.
