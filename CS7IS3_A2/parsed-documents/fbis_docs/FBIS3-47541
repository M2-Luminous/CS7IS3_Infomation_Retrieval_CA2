In this way, he clarified his view that he will not accept the U.S. demand to set concrete figures as objective criteria to measure the degree of Japan's market liberalization. Japan and the United States are facing rough going in discussions over the three sectors: insurance services, autos and auto parts, and government procurement. As for the establishment of the objective criteria in particular, the opinions of the two countries are sharply divided. In the 12 January meeting, Prime Minister Hosokawa stated: "I said at the summit talks held last November in Seattle in the United States that I could not accept numerical targets. I would like to confirm this again at the upcoming summit talks." Moreover, saying that "multilateral actions are needed to prevent the United States from invoking Article 301 of the Omnibus Trade Act," Hosokawa clarified his plan to use the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will be formed in 1995 as a result of an agreement reached at the Uruguay Round (new multilateral trade negotiations of the GATT), to prevent sanctions between the two countries. As for the issue of financial resources for an income tax cut, which will be a pillar of his economic measures, Prime Minister Hosokawa stated: "The Social Democratic Party of Japan understands the need to carry out a fundamental reform of the tax system. However, it has a different understanding when it comes to the consumption tax." In this way, he stressed the difficulty of ironing out the differences of opinion within the ruling parties over the issue of increasing the consumption tax rate. Moreover, he commented on the Finance Ministry, which wants to limit a lead period of a tax cut to 15 months, and stressed: "I do not know if it [15 months] is enough to convince the people. We have to study how we can cut spending and accomplish fairness in the tax." He also said that "some kind of political decision will be needed" after the government's investigatory council for tax reform reaches its conclusions on a reform of the tax system for fiscal year 1994.
