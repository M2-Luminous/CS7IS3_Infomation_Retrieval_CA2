Qian Qichen said: The meeting between President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton in Seattle last November marked a new phase of Sino-U.S. relations. Since then, a favorable momentum for improving relations between the two countries has emerged, with the two sides increasing contacts and expanding cooperation. More than a month ago, we met in Paris and discussed every aspect of Sino-U.S. relations. Both sides expressed their wish to make progress through active efforts. We hope that Mr. Secretary of State's current visit will achieve concrete results [ju ti cheng guo 0367 7555 2052 2654]. Qian Qichen said: "We are deeply disappointed at some things which happened prior to Mr. Secretary of State's visit. A senior U.S. official came to China to prepare for the secretary of state's visit and took actions that interfered in China's internal affairs without regard for Chinese law. Thereafter, the U.S. media played up [da si xuan ran 1129 5127 8694 2676] the event, and U.S. government officials attacked China time and again in their remarks. All these acts clearly go against President Clinton's statement in Seattle in which he emphasized that the United States supports a strong, stable, and prosperous China; they also disrupt [gan rao 1626 2371] the secretary of state's current visit." Qian Qichen pointed out: "Sincerity on both sides and a good atmosphere are needed for dialogue. I hope to conduct a frank [tan shuai 0982 3764] dialogue with the secretary of state in an atmosphere of mutual respect so as to enhance mutual understanding, reduce troubles, and avoid confrontation, and so that our dialogue will help improve Sino-U.S. relations and make Mr. Secretary of State's current visit a success." Christopher elaborated to the Chinese side on issues of concern to the U.S. side. Qian Qichen said: China is a country that stresses the rule of law. We can only do what Chinese laws allow us to do. Qian Qichen also elaborated to the U.S. side on issues of concern to the Chinese side, such as U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and the sanctions it has imposed on China. On Sino-U.S. cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking, Qian Qichen noted: China and the United States have signed the "Sino-U.S. Memorandum on Cooperation in Fighting Against Drug Trafficking." In January of 1990, a U.S. court, without regard to China's judicial sovereignty and repeated representations, granted political asylum to Wang Zongxiao, a criminal in the Jinliyu drug smuggling case, who had gone to the United States to testify. This has erected an obstacle to bilateral cooperation in fighting drug trafficking. In discussing most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, Qian Qichen said: Mutual extension of MFN status by China and the United States is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial arrangement made by the two sides according to agreements on trade relations between the two countries; it is the basis of normal Sino-U.S. trade relations. Disruption of this basis will ruin the development prospects for Sino-U.S. economic relations and trade. This will bring harm to both China and the United States. The Chinese side is firmly opposed to any linkage between trade and issues that have nothing to do with trade. Christopher said: Both the United States and China are countries that shoulder global responsibilities. Both sides share common interests in maintaining peace and security. The two countries share each other's views or hold similar views on many global and regional issues. Mutually beneficial economic relations and trade between the two countries are expanding, and they are contributing to the prosperity of both countries. A strong, stable, and prosperous China conforms to the national interests of the United States. President Clinton hopes that the United States and China will build a more constructive relationship. The talks proceeded in a frank [tan shuai 0982 3764] and businesslike [ren zhen 6126 4176] atmosphere. Present at the talks were Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei; Xu Huizi, deputy chief of staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; U.S. Ambassador Stapleton Roy; Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis; and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner. After the talks, Qian Qichen hosted a luncheon in honor of Christopher and his delegation.
