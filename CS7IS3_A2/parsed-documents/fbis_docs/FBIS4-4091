He stressed that the case would go to court as scheduled no matter when the representatives of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan came. The three suspects will stand trial at a time the official has not yet disclosed, simply noting that the start of the trial would not be deferred for too long a period. Mr. Ma said that as the case involved Taiwan compatriots as well as Mainland persons, the trial would in no way be conducted to appease the anger shown by the Taiwan side. He added that whether the SEF representatives came was not a factor and the case would go ahead as scheduled. He revealed that the Zhejiang authorities had learned a lesson from the incident and they called departments of travel, transport and public security to a meeting on improvement of travel safety. A conference held in the province on tourist safety will make public its results following the arrival of the SEF personnel. In another development, Chairman of the "Mainland Affairs Council" of the "Executive Yuan" of Taiwan Mr. Huang Kum-huei and the Secretary General of SEF Mr. Chiao Jen-ho, in response to a letter by the Mainland Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) inviting SEF to send personnel to Hangzhou to look into the case, said that the Taiwan side accepted in principle the invitation. The council has asked SEF to reply to the proposal by ARATS and held consultations today for a final decision on the invitation. The "Minister of Economic Affairs" of Taiwan Mr. Chiang Pin-kung said yesterday that following the announcement regarding dealing with the case by the Mainland side, the true picture of the incident was tending to become clearer. He stressed that cross-strait economic exchange and trade should return to normal step by step.
