FR941128-2-00003 FR941128-2-00002 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [Docket No. 94&hyph;124&hyph;1] Availability of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has prepared an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact for the shipment of an unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing. A risk analysis, which forms the basis for the environmental assessment, has led us to conclude that shipment of the unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on our finding of no significant impact, we have determined that an environmental impact statement need not be prepared. ADDRESSES: Copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact may be obtained by writing to the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Please refer to the docket number of this notice when requesting copies. Copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact (as well as the risk analysis with confidential business information removed) are also available for public inspection at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A veterinary biological product regulated under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious before a veterinary biological product license may be issued. A field test is generally necessary to satisfy prelicensing requirements for veterinary biological products. In order to ship an unlicensed product for the purpose of conducting a proposed field test, a person must receive authorization from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). In determining whether to authorize shipment for field testing of the unlicensed veterinary biological product referenced in this notice, APHIS conducted a risk analysis to assess the product's potential effects on the safety of animals, public health, and the environment. Based on that risk analysis, APHIS has prepared an environmental assessment. APHIS has concluded that shipment of the unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Based on this finding of no significant impact, we have determined that there is no need to prepare an environmental impact statement. An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared for the shipment of the following unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing: ‚ê£ 1Requester(s) 1Product 1Field test location(s) Select Laboratories, Inc. A live, genetically engineered Newcastle disease-fowlpox vaccine, fowlpox vector Poultry houses in Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina.
