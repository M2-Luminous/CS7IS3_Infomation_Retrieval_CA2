Russia Has Filed a Petition To Join the Executive Committee of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees"] [Text] In recent years the refugee problem which has alarmed the world for decades has directly affected Russia, too. A stream of victims of interethnic conflicts in the post-Soviet space and victims of national discrimination in the former republics of the Soviet Union has rushed to Russia. This was perhaps the main reason the Russian Federation filed a petition to be admitted as a member of the Executive Committee of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. This UN structure was created as early as 1951 when a number of countries developed and signed the UN Convention on Refugee Status. Russia also signed this convention in May of last year, thus assuming the requisite obligations. If the UN approves the Russian petition--and at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation they assure us that this will most likely be the case--the observer status which Russia has at present will be converted into full-fledged membership. This will not impose any additional financial obligations on the state because the budget of the Executive Committee is formed on a voluntary basis. Two laws actually apply in Russia at present--"On Refugees" and "On Forced Resettlers." This is why it is important to determine who is who. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia believes that otherwise it will be very difficult to take measures aimed at solving their problems. It is necessary to solve three problems in order to settle the refugee crisis. First, we should make every effort to try and extinguish conflicts on the territory of the former USSR which constitute the ground zero of human waves sweeping toward Russia, and solve the problem of discrimination against the Russian-speaking population in the former Soviet republics, primarily in the Baltic countries by signing relevant agreements with them. Incidentally, they are now doing this at Smolenskaya Square quite intensively. The second problem is to set up a living for refugees and forced resettlers; this is handled by the Federal Migration Service (FMS) which was created in 1992. However, given the tremendous number of people seeking assistance from the FMS, it has not been in a position to fine-tune its operation in a civilized manner over this short period of time. This is why it is very important for Russia to become a member of the Executive Committee of the UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]. The Administrations of the High Commissioner which have been created in Moscow, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan are already helping to solve problems associated with migration. Obtaining membership in the UNHCR Executive Committee will help Russia to use the potential of this organization to the fullest extent. As early as the meetings of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in Rome and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council in Brussels late last year, the head of the foreign policy establishment of Russia Andrey Kozyrev proposed to make the institution of the High Commissioner for Refugees more effective and to reinforce it. These Russian initiatives were laid down in the Declaration on Aggressive Nationalism, whose text was also proposed by Moscow. Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the UNHCR has already produced favorable results: On 13 January of this year a communique resolving the issue of the return of resettlers from Georgia and Abkhazia was signed during Russian-Abkhazian negotiations with the cooperation of the Administration of the High Commissioner. The third task is to prepare and begin actions to resolve the problems of foreigners from faraway foreign countries who are staying in Russian territory illegally. So far, no procedure at all has been developed for them. As we were told at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to some estimates we have 0.5 million of them. There are many refugees from Afghanistan, Angola, and Somalia. The Kurds account for a significant proportion. There are also natives of Ethiopia, China, and Sri Lanka. All of them cannot be ignored: After all, according to the 1951 convention, a person is under its protection from the moment of filing a petition to be granted refugee status. Having become a member of the UNHCR Executive Committee, Russia will be able to influence the enhancement of its role in the world system in resolving emergency situations: famine, natural cataclysms, military conflicts, and so on. The structure of the UNHCR should continuously be the focus for solving the problems of refugees, and should coordinate work on their reception and provisioning which is also done by various organizations such as the International Red Cross, the International Children's Fund, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and a number of nongovernmental institutions.
