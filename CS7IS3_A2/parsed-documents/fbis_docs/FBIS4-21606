Previously, the EU delegation demanded that the imports of unenriched uranium from Russia should be kept back, which hindered the talks. But at the last week's meeting in Paris the French delegation stated that the deliveries of Russian unenriched uranium were not the problem. Instead, France suggested, Russia's quotas for the delivery of enriched uranium should be halved. A diplomat working with the Eurocommission said that if Russia accepted this proposal, this would create panic among the users of Russian uranium in Germany, Britain, Belgium and some other EU countries, which opted for priority development of nuclear engineering. The protectionist attitude of France put in question the signing of a multilateral agreement with the European Energy Charter, already signed by Russia, France and the EU.
