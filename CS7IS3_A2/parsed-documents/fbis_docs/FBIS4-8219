The ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) issued a statement warning that NATO forces had "directly militarily aided the Muslim offensive and clearly declared support to the forces which want war," while the United Nations, "by lending its name to the aggressive act," had lost credibility for its peace mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "By covering up and falsifying facts, concealing the Muslim offensive, delivering arms to the Muslim Army, deciding to engage Turkish troops, and now resorting to bombing, the United Nations has shown to be merely an instrument in the hands of the countries which want to achieve their interests and aspirations in the Balkan region by prolonging the war," the SPS statement set out. The U.N. took the decision to engage NATO aircraft at the request of the U.N. peace-keepers in the field, who have accused the Bosnian Serbs of allegedly launching attacks on the civilian population in Gorazde. However, the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, which should have been demilitarized last spring as one of the six U.N.-proclaimed "safe areas," has been used by the Muslim side to mass around 10,000 troops and launch the offensive operations against Bosnian Serb positions in the area. The U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), itself, has said in its reports that the fighting in the area of Gorazde has been provoked by the Muslims. Bosnian Serb military sources have said that the Muslim offensive was launched with a view to winning territories before the internationally brokered peace talks resume. The SPS said that a solution to the existing situation called for peace to be signed immediately so that conditions would be created for further talks. The ruling SPS underscored that talks were the "sole means of equitably and lastingly resolving the conflict in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina." Serbia's Democratic Party (DS) termed the air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde an "act of aggression." The DS statement recalled that the U.N. Security Council resolution proclaiming "safe areas" in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina called for the protection of the civilian population and the full demilitarization of the respective areas. The Gorazde "safe area" has, however, been turned into a real military base which is used by the Muslim army to prepare troops and launch offensive operations, the DS statement said. It set out that the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) took the necessary measures to neutralize the dangers of the misuse of "safe areas" and the bombing of Serb positions by NATO was, therefore, totally unfounded. The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) recalled that UNPROFOR reports from the field had said that the fighting around Gorazde had been provoked by the Muslim troops. The DSS set out that "NATO, that is, those who are irresponsibly pulling its strings, have shown with the attack on Serb positions that they have war and not peace on their mind." The Serbian Radical Party (SRS) qualified the NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions as "aggression against the entire Serb people." The SRS called for the Yugoslav parliament to hold an emergency session "clearly and loudly to take a stand on the aggression." It urged the federal government urgently to take a decision to terminate Yugoslavia's membership in the United Nations, close the Yugoslav U.N. mission in New York, expel all United Nations personnel from Yugoslavia, and ban transit across Yugoslavia to all U.N. missions. The SRS called on the state leadership of the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) within the shortest period to expel UNPROFOR troops and United Nations and European Union representatives from its territory. "We are convinced that the Serb army should counter with all available means every attack from the air," the SRS set out. The Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) said that it was "against every violence, even if carried out at the orders of the U.N. secretary-general." The SPO statement said that "peace is the only alternative" and "everybody in Bosnia-Herzegovina has had enough of death, devastation, and suffering." The SPO, nevertheless, feels that the "United Nations is not an enemy of the Serbs" and that the enemies are those who are "pushing (Serbs) into a war with the whole world." The New Democracy (ND) said that "the use of force leads to a further escalation of the war and draws the entire region further away from the much needed equitable and lasting peace." The ND maintains that "the siding of UNPROFOR with one side" and the use of NATO aircraft were reckless moves. The Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), the ruling party in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, expressed deep concern and indignation at the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serbs positions around Gorazde, and said that the moves were a violation of the basic United Nations commitments and principles. The DPS statement said the NATO air strikes threatened to be an introduction to the dangerous practice of the imposition of solutions by means of force and the favouring of individual interests without the acknowledgement and equal participation of all warring sides. We consider unacceptable and extremely dangerous the use of external force against any side in the civil war, especially at a moment when an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been initiated with a strong diplomatic action on the part of the international community and its most important representatives -- the United States, Russia, and the European Union, the DPS statement said.
