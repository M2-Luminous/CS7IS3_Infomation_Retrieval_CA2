Besides, intergovernment agreements on cooperation in mutual protection of investments and cultural exchange were signed between foreign ministries of the two countries. A document on preventing double taxation was coordinated by the two sides as well. During the talks the sides discussed a wide range of problems, paying particular attention to the situation in the Central Asian region and primarily, in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Turkmen officials have reiterated their position of non-interference into regional conflicts. They believe that the Afghan and the Tajik people can decide their fates themselves. The Turkmen side believes that Tajikistan needs national accord and consolidation. Any attempt to impose any variant from the outside might worsen the situation, said Boris Shikhmuradov, vice-premier of the Turkmen government in an interview with ITAR-TASS. "We do not join coalition forces for the maintenance of peace in Tajikistan. We proceed from the assumption that there is no external enemy there," Shikhmuradov said. "Present clashes on the Tajik-Afghan border is not the cause, but rather the consequence of internal instability in Tajikistan," the Turkmen vice-premier said, adding that the Tajik point of view was brought to the notice of the French side. France expressed satisfaction over the fact that despite a difficult situation in the vicinity of its borders Turkmenistan managed to preserve a certain balance of interests, a balance of forces. France looks upon stable Turkmenistan as a peace-keeping factor in the region. For its part, Turkmenistan regards the French president's visit as a sign that the country is prepared to make its contribution to regional peace-keeping activities. During the talks the sides discussed joint economic projects in spheres of priority importance for Tajikistan, including the development and transportation of oil and gas. Turkmenistan believes that having won the financial and technological support of French companies, it will soon turn into one of the leaders of the world energy exports. The completion of the central Asian tour made by the French president heralds doubtless success of the Uzbek and French diplomacy. It was announced in Ashgabat that France would soon open its permanent diplomatic mission there which was persistently requested by the Turkmen leader.
