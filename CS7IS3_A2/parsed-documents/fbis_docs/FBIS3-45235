The meeting was presided over by Vice Governor Liu Guanghe. Provincial party committee Secretary Yin Kesheng and other leading comrades from other sectors concerned, including Doba, Ma Yougong, and Zhang Jimin, attended the meeting. According to the plan formulated at the meeting, the provincial party committee and provincial government will dispatch 10 inspection groups to carry out an inspection of the performance of some autonomous prefectures, prefectures, cities, and some organs directly under the provincial authorities in the three stages of the anticorruption operation. During the meeting, Secretary Yin Kesheng presented his opinions on how to make this forthcoming inspection a success. He first demanded that all comrades accurately estimate the current situation in the anticorruption operation. He noted: Since the start of the anticorruption operation last August, all localities and departments have taken action to launch the operation in light of local circumstances. Initial success has been achieved in those localities and departments which have performed well. Generally speaking, the operation is following a good line. Cadres at and above the county and office level in party and government organs have made self-assessments against the five requirements of honesty and self-discipline, and have begun to correct their mistakes on their own. In light of the present state that our leading cadres are taking the initiative in practicing honesty and self-discipline, 10 stipulations and a series of rules have been adopted, banning cadres from accepting cash rewards and demanding that leading cadres minimize social appointments. Now it is found that most cadres in this province have been devoted to public duty and exerted themselves to meet the requirements. However, we also must be clearly aware that we have only achieved initial success in the ongoing anticorruption operation, which is still much short of the public's expectation. And the performance varies from locality to locality and from department to department. Some localities and departments have not been firm enough in their attitude and down-to-earth enough in their work, and what they have done still is quite superficial, while other localities and departments, being afraid of exposing real problems, have tried to play down some key issues, practice favoritism, and cover up some major important cases. Their wrong attitude and practices which have directly affected the progress of the anticorruption operation must be resolutely corrected. In the anticorruption operation in the future, all localities and departments must further strengthen leadership, try very hard to perform their duties, and make sustained efforts to carry out the anticorruption operation in depth. Yin Kesheng expressed his hope that all the major leading bodies at the provincial level would set store by the forthcoming inspection and appoint comrades of good quality with strong senses of responsibility to fill the inspection groups. All the inspection groups must pursue the principle of seeking truth from facts, going deep into the grass-roots level, being adept at soliciting opinions from among the public, and daring to deal with knotty problems and to expose real problems; never should they render the inspection a mere show. Yin Kesheng asserted: The most important points that one must bear in mind in the anticorruption operation are that one must do it in real earnest and in a persistent spirit. Party and government departments at all levels definitely must do the work in a down-to-earth and effective manner so as to win the public's trust.
