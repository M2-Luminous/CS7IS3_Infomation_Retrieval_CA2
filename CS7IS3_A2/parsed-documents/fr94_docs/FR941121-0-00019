FR941121-0-00019 FR941121-0-00001 B. Special formula for use where periodic statements are sent more often than the period for which dividends are compounded. Comment app.A.II.B.&hyph;1 has been adopted as proposed. Credit unions may use the special formula to calculate an APYE on a quarterly statement whether or not a monthly statement is triggered by Regulation E during the quarter. FRB commenters supported this rule as significantly reducing compliance burdens for institutions. For the same reasons, NCUA adopts the Regulation DD position. Comment app.A.II.B.&hyph;2 clarifies that the special formula requires institutions to use the actual number of days in the compounding period in calculating the APYE. The FRB believes using the actual number of days in a compounding period is necessary to produce an accurate APYE for a specific consumer's account. For reasons of conformity and parity, NCUA has also adopted the Regulation DD position. Appendix B_Model Clauses and Sample Forms Comments to Appendix B have been adopted as proposed. Several commenters requested changes in the Appendix B forms and sample clauses. However, as these changes were beyond the scope of this rulemaking, the Board could not consider them at this time. The Board will consider inviting comment upon the Appendix B forms and clauses at some future date.
