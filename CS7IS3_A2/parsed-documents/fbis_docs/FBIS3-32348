He said today that the government may adopt strong measures with radical effects to curb inflation. He also said Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso may resign his post if Congress continues delaying a decision on the economic plan. [Begin Simon recording] His argument is that if the bill is not approved all the government can do is return to what we all know, that is, strong measures like radical economic packages and the plans we already have lived through and whose results are known. He is capable of resigning if the bill is not approved. [end recording] Sen. Pedro Simon said that in his speech to the nation on 7 February, Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso will make a final appeal to the congressmen to turn up in the plenary hall and assume their responsibility. [Begin Simon recording] In his speech, the minister will explain the whole issue and he will call on congressmen to vote either in favor or against the bill. It would be fantastic if they vote against it because they would be rejecting a bill that, although it was prepared by Fernando Henrique Cardoso, was totally modified by Congress. Congress must give a reply. Do the congressmen agree that we must solve the public deficit? Do they agree that the government must stop borrowing money from the bank to pay interest it cannot pay? Don't you agree with this? The congressmen must approve the bill they modified. [end recording] Sen. Pedro Simon said the government needs the social emergency fund bill to be approved on 8 February in order to honor its commitments to its international creditors and then be ratified on 10 March.
