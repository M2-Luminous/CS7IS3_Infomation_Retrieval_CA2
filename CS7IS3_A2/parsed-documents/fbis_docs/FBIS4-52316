[Nguyen Trong Xuyen] Corruption and smuggling are painful evils imposed on our people. The party and state have introduced many resolutions, directives, and measures to stop these evil practices, but the results have been very limited. Our Army is a part of society. Therefore, the evils of corruption and smuggling have also appeared in the Army. Because of its tight control and different operational characteristics, however, corruption and smuggling are less severe, with very few serious cases in the Army. "The most common form of corruption and smuggling in the Army is when private traders lure greedy military personnel and units to be a front for their illegal businesses. Some units also use military vehicles to transport smuggled goods or use military facilities to store smuggled goods. Some units allow their troops to smuggle goods while carrying out their economic duties. Yet the number of these cases and the quantity of goods involved is not great." At present, the Ministry is investigating military units that have bought smuggled cars to sell for profit. "Regarding corruption, its main manifestation is the exploitation of management positions and authority over controlling materials and budgets to accept bribes. They also take advantage of payment loopholes to create a difference between the actual cost and the amount of money recorded on paper or on an invoice in order to appropriate state property, budget money, and unit funds. This type of corruption is normally practiced in infrastructure construction projects because of the great amount of money and materials, management difficulties, and loopholes in payment procedures." [Pham Minh Chau] "Dear Comrade Deputy Minister, can you brief us on the results of the fight against corruption and smuggling in the Army following the issuance of directives by the party Central Committee Secretariat and the prime minister?" [Nguyen Trong Xuyen] It is possible to say that our Ministry has strictly observed the party Political Bureau directive, the National Assembly resolution, and the government directives on fighting corruption and smuggling. The Military Inspection Section has worked with military leaders to conduct financial, logistical, material management, and transport management inspections in units suspected of corruption. It also coordinates with market management teams to clarify some cases. By checking 613 military vehicles in the 5th, 7th, and 9th Military Regions and in two armed corps, we discovered 20 vehicles transporting illegal goods. We also discovered more than 30 civilian vehicles using military registration plates to carry smuggled goods. In the fourth quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994, military inspection and control organs discovered and filed charges in many corruption cases. In the first quarter of 1994, we imposed penalties on 14 cadres and party members for corruption and 27 other military personnel for smuggling. The results achieved in the fight against corruption and smuggling have brought about positive changes, but compared to the requirement they are still far from our expectations. [Pham Minh Chau] "Based on those cases of corruption and smuggling you have uncovered, can you cite the main causes of these evils in the Army?" [Nguyen Trong Xuyen] There are many causes; they have been mentioned in several state and section meetings, conferences, and seminars. We have talked enough about the causes of corruption and smuggling. The causes of these evils in the Army are the same as elsewhere. In the Army, the most direct and important cause is the lack of responsibility and proper management by leaders and unit commanders over their subordinates. We must differentiate two separate sets of circumstances, though. The first is intentionally creating conditions and providing the necessary papers for personal benefit. The second, which is more common, is a lack of vigilance and knowledge of the law and state and army regulations by Army leaders. Their subordinates take advantage of this to practice corruption and smuggling. In any event, the leaders still have to be responsible for wrongdoings in their units. [Pham Minh Chau] "So in the future, what measures should be taken to prevent and fight corruption and smuggling sufficiently?" [Nguyen Trong Xuyen] Corruption poses a danger to our renovation undertaking. Fighting corruption and smuggling is an important undertaking of the entire party, people, and Army and all of society. The Central Military Party Committee and the Ministry are resolutely fighting these evils in the Army because this is one of the urgent requirements to build a revolutionary army. Regarding practical measures to prevent and fight corruption and smuggling, each unit needs to establish its most appropriate and effective way of fighting. Whatever measures are taken, though, they must concentrate on three fundamental measures: combining education and management with inspection, maintaining tight control, and strictly punishing violations according to state laws and military discipline. Fighting corruption and smuggling is a very complicated task because humans have hidden diseases. We believe that with unity between management and command and between the higher and lower levels, together with public participation, the fight will achieve actual results on the way toward eliminating these evils step by step to restore military discipline and order, thus earning the trust and love of the party, state, and people. [Pham Minh Chau] Thank you, Comrade Deputy Minister.
