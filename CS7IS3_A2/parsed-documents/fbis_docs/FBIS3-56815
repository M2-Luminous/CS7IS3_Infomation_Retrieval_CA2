Levon Ter-Petrosyan announced the dissolution of the operational services of the SDNS, the discontinuation of state border guard activities, and the curtailment of the operations carried out by the so-called security services. The president's edict also makes cadre changes to the SDNS leadership, namely appointing David Shakhnazaryan, until recently the Armenian head of state's former special representative at the Nagorno-Karabakh talks, to the post of acting chairman. Aram Abramyan, the Armenian president's press secretary, noted in an interview with me that the SDNS's functions should only include intelligence and counterintelligence tasks. Regarding the other functions of the former KGB, Mr. Abramyan reminded me that the structures of this organization were established during the era of the Soviet Union when they served other purposes -- primarily the persecution of dissidents. Because we are currently living in a period of democratic changes, these tasks no longer exist and Armenia's citizens enjoy all freedoms, and therefore the special services should only carry out the functions indicated above. Many observers in Yerevan have also focused attention on the fact that the new director of the country's special services, unlike his predecessor Eduard Simonyants, is a leader of the ruling Armenian Pan-National Movement. His appointment to this important post is in many ways connected with the increased influence of the party in the formation of the country's domestic and foreign policy.
