This was revealed in an interview with RIA today by Viktor Glukhikh, head of the State Committee for Defence Industries. The main budget receipts, according to him, are expected to come from spare parts for and service maintenance of sold combat equipment. At the same time, Russia intends to export tanks, aircraft and small arms. The main markets for Russian military equipment are Eastern Europe, China, India and Syria, said Glukhikh, assuming that up to 50 per cent of Russian arms exports will go to China and India. At the same time, he noted that Russia will supply MIG-29 warplanes to Hungary as repayment of the former USSR's external debt. As for Syria, the matter mainly concerns, according to him, spare part supplies. He also said that a contract is soon to be signed on the delivery of 18 MIG-29 planes to Malaysia. The negotiations have lasted almost two years. In Glukhikh's opinion, recent media reports that Russian warplanes may be sold to Pakistan are too optimistic. He thinks this deal will be very difficult to conclude because of the opposition of Western competitors. The same kind of opposition exists in the United Arab Emirates. Glukhikh noted that Russia also feels opposition in promoting military and technical cooperation with South Korea. But despite this, talks are under way on the joint development of anti-missile systems. Notable progress has been achieved also in conversion, in the establishment of joint ventures in optics, electronics and engineering.
