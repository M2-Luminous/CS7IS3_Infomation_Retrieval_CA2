Dependents of embassy officials and other non-essential members of staff will leave as "a sensible precaution," a spokesman said. "The embassy will remain open, but operating at a reduced level," he added. The embassy was also reported to be contacting all British and Commonwealth nationals registered with it. "If anyone wants to leave at the same time they can come with our convoy," First Secretary David Campbell told REUTERS in Belgrade. The Foreign Office said the withdrawal of personnel was "a sensible precaution because of increased tension". There are 11 British diplomats at the Belgrade embassy, which will remain open but probably with a reduced number of staff. The evacuees, expected to number less than 20, will leave by road convoy -- possibly tomorrow. Elsewhere in Belgrade there are about 60 other British residents, most of them journalists or married to local people. The Foreign Office issued advice some time ago for British nationals to leave the city.
