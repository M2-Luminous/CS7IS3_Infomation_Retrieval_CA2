Researchers who had not managed to seriously devote themselves to the static Nordic Region discovered a new interest after the end of the Cold War and saw it as a duty to study the challenges facing the Nordic countries and the Nordic Region as a whole. Denmark saw a chance to get the other Nordic countries into the European Union EU and went about it so zealously as to cause irritation on the part of its neighbors. In Norway, the experience of 1972 awoke in many leading politicians a fear of losing Nordic cooperation as well if Sweden and Finland joined the EU. When Sweden, with no advance warning, announced its intention to apply for membership, its action clearly upset the Finnish and Norwegian timetables, but it obviously also left the Finnish establishment with no choice. Naturally, as far as Sweden was concerned, this was mainly a matter of trying to protect its own primarily economic but also political interests in the rolling integration process, but it is very likely that there was also some thought of the possibility of heading up a Nordic group in a larger context. Finland was in more or less the same position as Norway (except for the petroleum). Psychologically, it seemed obviously impossible that the EU's border might run through the Aland Sea, especially since as far as Finland in general is concerned, the Nordic Region is almost synonymous with Sweden. The Nordic argument in favor of EU membership went furthest in Norway, where it began to be said that the path to the Nordic Region led through Europe. But in Sweden and Finland as well, the nationally deep-rooted and innocently positive attitude toward the Nordic Region was assiduously taken up as an argument in favor of EU membership. The new prime ministers, Carl Bildt and Esko Aho--both Nordic supporters and former members of the Nordic Council--shared an obvious frustration, dating from the 1980's, with the ineffectiveness of Nordic cooperation. That feeling was expressed in many contexts, and it also colored the Nordic reform efforts undertaken by the two prime ministers along with their colleagues in Denmark, Iceland, and Norway. At the same time, that same frustration and the picture of Nordic affairs that was being presented in the media undermined some of the credibility of the no side's arguments in favor of a Nordic Region as an alternative to the EU. The common feature in work to reorganize the Nordic Council has been an effort to remove everything that will be handled by the EEA [European Economic Area]/EU, emphasize Nordic culture and identity, and, lastly, take the step from formal cooperation to informal consultation. There is a lot that can be said about the probability of a common Nordic front in the EU, especially in light of the number of Nordic failures in "major" political areas, but the "official" viewpoint has come to be that the EU will benefit Nordic affairs and that Nordic cooperation can be successful only within the EU, provided that it takes the form of consultation. But here we come up against a problem. So far, Nordic affairs have been a matter of interplay between popular opinion and direct, natural contact on the one hand and, on the other, permanent dialogue between members of parliament and governments. But if the major (EU) issues are removed from cooperative dialogue and replaced by quick and frequent consultations, what will distinguish Nordic affairs from general international affairs? Is direct, practical, and somewhat elusive Nordic cooperation to be replaced by intrinsically and obviously intensive top-level contacts? And how will the link with popular organizations and civic organizations--or broader expressions of Nordic political opinion--be handled? Regardless of which solutions the Nordic countries choose in this fall's referendums on the EU, there is reason to begin a debate, sometime before the overall picture emerges, regarding the entire many-faceted Nordic issue, high-level support for the policy, the channels of communications from the bottom up, and the various institutional alternatives that may exist. The Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish EU negotiations gave no impression of any broader Nordic teamwork beyond consultation and the exchange of information. And the EU is skilled at playing one country off against another. This supports the opinion that Nordic affairs have had their day and that the issue now is Europe. But if that is so, there will have to be support for that decision--or else.
