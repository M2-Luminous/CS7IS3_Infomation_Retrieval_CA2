Officials in charge of the free trade zone, or bonded zone, here said that the zone has been expanding rapidly since it was established three years ago. It is also one of the largest among China's 14 bonded zones. So far, the free trade zone has approved a total of 2,338 enterprises involving some 1.76 billion U.S. dollars in investment volume. Investors include those from 54 countries and regions as well as from inland provinces in northwest China. Some 1,000 companies in the zone have started operation. Total import and export volume in the first quarter of the year topped 400 million U.S. dollars. Within six months after the approval of the establishment of the zone, about 180 km from Beijing, infrastructural facilities were completed. Later, a series of laws and regulations for the zone were issued to safeguard the interests of overseas investors. Following that, ventures from both abroad and within China began to pour into the zone, and within one year, all 1.2 sq [square] km of land had been parceled out to investors. Then another 3.6 sq km of land was added to the previous zone. A series of preferential policies including tax reduction and exemption were adopted in the zone. More than a dozen famous international companies, such as Honeywell Inc. and the American President Shipping Company of the United States, the New World Group Company of Hong Kong and the Singapore Shipping Corporation, have set up operations there. The Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone, neighboring the free trade zone, has also harbored more than 1,000 industrial enterprises, making it the largest development zone in China in terms of the amount of investment.
