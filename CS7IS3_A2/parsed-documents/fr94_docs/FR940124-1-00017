FR940124-1-00017 FR940124-1-00005 II. Sanctions Under the Clean Air Act This sanction action is being proposed under EPA's discretionary authority contained in section 110(m) of the Act. The predicate findings and types of sanctions are described in section 179 of the Act. The two sanctions available to EPA for application under section 110(m), as provided in section 179(b), are: (1) A prohibition on the funding of certain highway projects; and (2) an increase in the emission offset requirement for new and modified major stationary sources. The highway funding sanction prohibits approval by the Secretary of Transportation of any projects or the awarding by the Secretary of any grants, under Title 23 of the U.S. Code, other than projects or grants for safety and certain other categories of projects listed in section 179(b)(1). The offset sanction requires that, when States apply the emission offset requirement of section 173 to new or modified sources, the ratio of emission reductions to increased emissions must be at least 2 to 1. Section 179(a) of the Act sets forth the findings 1 which provide EPA with discretion under section 110(m) to impose one or both of the sanctions specified under section 179(b). The four findings are: (1) A state has failed, for a nonattainment area, to submit a SIP or an element of a SIP, or that the SIP or SIP element submitted fails to meet the completeness criteria of section 110(k); (2) EPA disapproves a SIP submission for a nonattainment area based on the submission's failure to meet one or more plan elements required by the Act; (3) a State has not made any other submission required by the Act or has made a submission that does not meet the completeness criteria or has made a required submission that is disapproved by EPA for not meeting the Act's requirements; or (4) a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented. 1 Section 179(a) refers to Agency findings, disapprovals, and determinations. These will all be referred to by the one term ``findings.'' Under section 179(a), unless the State corrects the deficiency, one of the two sanctions listed in section 179(b) must be imposed 18 months after a finding is made, and the second must be imposed 6 months after the first sanction is imposed if the deficiency remains uncorrected. 2 In addition, both sanctions shall apply after 18 months if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part of the State. 2 On October 1, 1993, EPA proposed a rule governing the order in which the sanctions shall apply under section 179 of the Act. 58 FR 51270. The rule proposes that the offset sanctions apply first and the highway sanctions apply second. According to the proposed rule, EPA may change this sequence of sanctions through individual notice and comment rulemaking. This proposed sequencing applies only to mandatory sanctions that apply under section 179(a) and does not govern sanctions imposed under section 110(m). Although section 179(a) establishes mandatory deadlines for the application of sanctions at certain points after a finding of deficiency, section 110(m) provides EPA with the discretion to impose section 179(b) sanctions at any time (or at any time after) a section 179(a) finding. Likewise, although mandatory sanctions under section 179 are limited to the area with the deficiency, section 110(m) authorizes EPA to apply discretionary sanctions to any portion of the state that EPA deems reasonable and appropriate to ensure that the requirements of the Act are met. See 57 FR 44534, 44536&hyph;44537. However, the Act requires EPA to establish by rule criteria to ensure that such sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable implementation plan are principally responsible for the deficiency. On September 28, 1992, EPA proposed criteria under section 110(m) that it would use when proposing statewide sanctions to determine if one or more political subdivisions is principally responsible for a SIP deficiency. 57 FR 44534. These proposed criteria are discussed later in this notice. With regard to California, EPA is using its discretionary authority under section 110(m) to propose early sanctions 3 based on California's failure to adopt legislation to improve its I/M program. EPA is taking this action for two reasons: (1) Congress required timely submittal of enhanced I/M programs as a measure central to allowing the State's metropolitan areas to meet CAA deadlines, and any legislative delay threatens the States's ability to meet those deadlines, and (2) enhanced I/M is the single most effective air pollution control measure available. Delayed legislative approval of an acceptable I/M program places a disproportionate burden for cleaning the air on the State's major industrial sources_additional burdens which are especially problematic given California's current economic difficulties. 3 EPA issued its letter on December 30, 1993, finding that the state's proposed SIP revision was a failure to submit a SIP revision as required by the Act and, in addition, was an incomplete SIP submittal. Mandatory sanctions were triggered under Section 179(a) by issuance of the letter notifying the state of the finding of deficiency.
