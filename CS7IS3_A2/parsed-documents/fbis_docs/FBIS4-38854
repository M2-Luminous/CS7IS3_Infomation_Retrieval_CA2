This development opens a way to resolving the conflict between Chubays and Luzhkov within a legal framework. However, the length of the examination (not less than a month, according to prosecution officials), as voucher privatization is drawing to a close (1 July), reduces the practical value of its results for the victims. According to an official source in the General Prosecutor's Office, Chubays' letter will shortly be given for study to Deputy General Prosecutor Sabir Kekhlerov, who oversees in particular the preparation of arbitration suits in court. The source also said that in all likelihood, consideration of the "Luzhkov case" will continue for more than a month (one month under the law) because "a huge number of documents" and even verbal instructions from the mayor will have to be analyzed. As a result, on each unlawful decision by the Moscow authorities with respect to privatization, suits are to be prepared on annulling all illegal deals. By going to court, therefore, Chubays made good on his recent threat to take measures to countermand a number of Luzhkov's recent resolutions limiting the conduct of voucher privatization in Moscow. Regardless of decisions by the General Prosecutor's Office, Chubays' move can even now yield some political dividends. First, the chairman of the State Property Management Committee has received an opportunity to distance himself officially from the "catastrophic" (according to Chubays) consequences of privatization in Moscow which, he believes, will lead to "a major social explosion on 30 June." Second, Chubays has relieved himself of the energy-consuming occupation of the chronic theoretical dispute with efficient economic manager Luzhkov about the harm and usefulness of voucher privatization for the people and Russia. Third, by taking such a step, the head of the State Property Management Committee has reminded that voucher privatization has a legal basis (in contrast to the "special" Moscow privatization program) while his (Chubays') department is responsible only for the quality of its execution. All this also responds to Chubays' objectives to demonstrate to President Boris Yeltsin and Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin that he is in full control of the privatization process. This is especially pertinent since the completion of the final round of privatization stimulates the activity of the vice premier's opponents who call for his resignation. Judging by Luzhkov's recent statements, he is ready for retaliatory action with respect to Chubays, the author of the privatization "fraud" (according to Luzhkov). In particular the mayor has expressed his readiness "with great pleasure" to arrive at the prosecutor's office together with Chubays where he intends to explain that "property must be sold, not wasted away, as is now happening with Chubays-style privatization." Presumably at today's press conference Yuriy Luzhkov will acquaint journalists in some detail with his countermeasures.
