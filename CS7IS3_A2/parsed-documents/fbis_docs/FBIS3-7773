Therefore, in principle the Russian plan involves greater authority and thus also a quicker solution. We shall see who is pleased with this initiative and who is not. For the time being the replies from the West have been a bit reserved and ambiguous. However, we support such an initiative in any case. Regarding the U.S. plan, if we demand self-determination for ourselves and know that the Serbian side would not agree to any sort of political dependence or subordination to other sides, we have no democratic right, and we must allow the negotiations between the Muslims and the Croats, especially in the political sphere, as long as they are not to our detriment. These talks have to do with an internal matter, a question of their domestic relations, so to speak; naturally, this is all based on the fundamental assumption that this will not be a military alliance, as it was at the beginning of the war, but a political integration that suits them. [Unidentified correspondent] Given the circumstances, how should one understand the position of the Serbs and define the Serbian interest? [Koljevic] Well, I believe that this was already defined a few days ago -- in THE WASHINGTON POST yesterday or the day before -- namely, that the Serbs will be absolutely free to choose their form of constitution, that they will be able to set themselves up independently in the Srpska republic or unify with Serbia, which is actually the wish of the people and in our natural historic interest. This is already being mentioned publicly as a viable option in the United States if this thing between the Muslims and the Croats proves to be viable.
