That's because this intervention shows determination to promote the UN process, which is enforced with the joint call issued by the United States and Russia to the two sides to show "political will and realism for agreement on the CBM's." U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher rejected the evaluation that there is an impasse in the talks on the CBM's, stressing that things are not idle but that "much work is being done." We do not know the content of the American proposals but we trust they do not affect the basis of the talks and do not lift the security norms that prevent the CBM's from being interpreted as a direct or indirect recognition of the pseudostate. The United States is the only superpower able, with its interstate relations, not to bend the principles of international law and not to come into conflict with the UN Security Council resolutions. We want to believe that the increased American interest stems from the possibilities thrown up by some assurances given to President Bill Clinton by [Turkish Prime Minister Tansu] Ciller. These assurances are now on trial to test their practical implementation. This newspaper has repeatedly stressed the importance of U.S. intervention as the most powerful way out of the stalemate. The White House will and determination to promote a just solution is known. The road to an agreement cannot be mined with demands that would overturn the basic principles and directives of the United Nations, certainly not those contained in the Security Council resolutions. President Glavkos Kliridhis emphasized that the assurance that the discussion of the CBM's take place on condition, among other things, that UN Security Council Resolution 541, which condemns the declaration of the pseudostate, demands its dissolution, and calls on all UN members not to recognize it, is effected. The United States has repeatedly declared that the status quo in Cyprus is "internationally unacceptable." Consequently, both the suggestion of the U.S. ambassador and the joint U.S.-Russian call for political will and realism cannot imply that our side surpass the security limits described in the Security Council's directives for one federated, bizonal state with a single international identity and the exclusion of any possibility of separation and final division. President Kliridhis has the legal knowledge and political wisdom to deal with any instruction in line with the above, should any such instruction be expressed by intervention. Our side's political will is proven. The opposite is true of the other side, which remains confined to words or appears contradictory with specific acts of provocative rejection of the international element's instructions. President Kliridhis' statement that no Cyprus solution can depend on Turkey's will, but on the will of the Security Council, particularly of its permanent members, should be seen as an expression of goodwill in response to the joint U.S.-Russian call. That's because our side considers that international law and order cannot depend on the will of the aggressor, which in our case seeks to maintain the faits accomplis of the invasion and occupation.
