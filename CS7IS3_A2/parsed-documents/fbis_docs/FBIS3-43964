There has been no official explanation of why the troops surrounded Tshisekedi's Kinshasa home but the move appeared to be linked to a strike on Wednesday called by him to protest the dissolution last week by President Mobutu Sese Seko of the country's rival legislatures. Shops and most offices stayed closed and the capital's streets were virtually empty of traffic all day.
