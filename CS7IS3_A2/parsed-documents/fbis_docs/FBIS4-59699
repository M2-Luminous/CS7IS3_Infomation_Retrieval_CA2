FBIS4-59699 "drnes095_l_94004" FBIS-NES-94-095 Daily Report 17 May 1994 ISRAEL Two Dead, 1 Wounded in Hebron `Terrorist' Attack Two Dead, 1 Wounded in Hebron `Terrorist' Attack Ministers Briefed on Hebron Attack TA1705110394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 1000 GMT 17 May 94 TA1705110394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Report by Jack Katzenell] [Text] Ministers learned about this morning's terrorist attack at Bet Hagay during the weekly cabinet session, which was held today instead of on Sunday. They expressed outrage at the attack. The information was still fragmentary, but the chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, gave a detailed report on yesterday's incident in Hebron. Some ministers criticized the Army for permitting the settlers to walk into downtown Hebron. Environment Minister Yosi Sarid said these tours are never innocent; they are always provocative. We have to fight terrorism and provocation, he said, if we are to press forward with the peace process. Immigrant Absorption Minister Ya'ir Tzaban said that if this artificial cult of old tombs is allowed to continue, there will be plenty of new tombs. Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer renewed his demand for the concentration of all the scattered groups of settlers in Hebron in one place, and Prime Minister Rabin said the action of the settlers yesterday was not justified. The chief of staff rejected the ministers' criticisms of the Army. He said in allowing the settlers tour, the Army was only carrying out instructions of the government. On the basis of these instructions, settlers are permitted to walk from Qiryat Arba' into Hebron. This had always been permitted in the past, and the government had never adopted a decision to the contrary. The prime minister did not report to the cabinet on his meeting with Warren Christopher last night. It was informal, he said, and the real talks will take place this evening. The head of the Israeli team negotiating with Syria, Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, told Qol Yisra'el this morning he has the impression that the Syrians realize that time is running out and do wish to make progress, but are not certain how to go about it. In an hour's time, Secretary Christopher will be meeting Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. This evening, he will have another meeting with Prime Minister Rabin.
