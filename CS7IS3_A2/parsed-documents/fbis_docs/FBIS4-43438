"Antifederalists" Make EU Domestic Issue Writing in the 23 May Lisbon daily PUBLICO, Alvaro Vasconcelos, president of the Institute for Strategic and International Studies, credited "antifederalists" -- opponents of a more federated EU -- with bringing the EU issue to the center of the political debate in Portugal. This has ensured that the question will not be the sole purview of governments, Vasconcelos continued, and will contribute to the democratization of the European process and the increased ability of the Portuguese people to influence both governmental and EU decisions. To this end, however, the difficult questions linked to the goal of achieving a politically united Europe must be discussed and the debate must no longer be defined by the anti-Europeanists, Vasconcelos warned. Europeanists have avoided a debate on a federal EU because they believe that "Europe does not produce votes." It is difficult to understand this conviction, Vasconcelos wrote, given that polls show popular support for "deepening" the EU. The debate on the EU, he continued, is of "poor" quality because it has not focused on essential issues such as the EU's "democratic deficit" (shortcomings in providing democratic institutions) and the substantial powers to be granted to the European Parliament, the lack of transparency in making decisions, the participation of citizens, and the consequences of enlargement. In addition, Vasconcelos maintained, the economic debate should not be restricted to how to spend EU funds. It should include a discussion on the necessary measures to overcome the economic crisis and on the utility of the EU Commission's white book on unemployment. The security problems now confronting Europe, especially the resurgence of nationalism, should also be an important part of the debate. The question of lost sovereignty is endlessly debated at a time when "the danger is not `more Europe' but indeed `less Europe,'" Vasconcelos wrote. "Antifederalists" may well contribute to the reinforcement of an EU discussion on federalism by making Europe the center of Portugal's political debate, Vasconcelos concluded. Sovereignty Issue Discussed To shed light on the European issue it is necessary to clarify the confusion surrounding the debate on national sovereignty, wrote Teresa de Sousa in the 23 May PUBLICO. While Portugal lost sovereignty when it joined the European Community, it also gained more power on the international scene and is now better able to defend its economic, diplomatic, and security interests, de Sousa maintained. The need to compete with Japan and the United States justified the transformation to a single European currency, De Sousa wrote. Given the globalization of the economy and the liberalization of the financial markets, countries as small as Portugal or as large as France will be unable to control the stability of their currencies. Thus monetary union between the various EU states, which demands a narrowing of the levels of economic development and a high degree of financial stability, would help the economic and social cohesion policy aimed at helping economically weaker countries such as Portugal. Portugal does not lose autonomy with the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), de Sousa continued, because each country is free to pursue its own foreign policy correponding to its specific national interests. On the other hand, Lisbon's negotiating capabilities with third countries will increase significantly because of its EU membership. With the abolition of the EU's internal borders, one of the arguments of EU foes has been that Portugal must receive East European immigrants while rejecting African or Brazilian immigrants, therefore limiting its autonomy in granting entry permits. In de Sousa's opinion, however, the restrictions applied to the entry of immigrants and refugees from former Portuguese colonies are fully Lisbon's area of competence.
