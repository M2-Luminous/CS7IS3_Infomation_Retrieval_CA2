The Rwanda Patriotic Front forces coming from the north have managed to link up with the 600 rebels in central Kigali, but they have not yet taken control of the city. The rebels said a moment ago that they control four strategic points in Kigali. Christophe Boisbouvier has just filed this report: [Begin Boisbouvier recording] With the rebels coming from the north linking up with those who were holed up in central Kigali, the regular army now finds itself surrounded in the presidency district. Unless there is significant resistance from the civilian population which has set up roadblocks in the streets, the fall of Kigali seems imminent. It might, however, be more difficult for the rebels to take the northern strongholds of Byumba and Ruhengeri, since the government forces there are well armed with artillery. The rebels will, however, have to be wary of their success. In statements today, they gave assurances that they would not confiscate the state for the Tutsi minority. The Rwandan people will judge them on their actions. [end recording]
