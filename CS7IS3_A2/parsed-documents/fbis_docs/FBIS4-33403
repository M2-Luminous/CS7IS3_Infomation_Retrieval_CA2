FBIS4-33403 "drlat108_r_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-108 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 Peru _O_ Unemployment, Poverty in 1995 Election _O_ Unemployment, Poverty in 1995 Election 94P20820A 94P20820A CSO [Editorial Report] The monthly PERU ECONOMICO [PE], devoting its April issue to employment, said that employment policy will be the central issue in the 1995 presidential campaign, "no matter who the candidates are." The general public calls unemployment the greatest problem facing the nation today and is looking for a leader with solutions, according to PE. Apoyo-owned PE speculated that unemployment ranks higher than poverty because the solution to poverty is associated in the public mind with social welfare programs. Peruvians today "prefer a job with which to resolve the economic problems rather than a handout." In addition to the primary focus on unemployment, the composition of the presidential ticket will be "much more important" than in the past. (In 1990 outsider candidate Alberto Fujimori won the presidency on the strength of his antipolitics stance and his commitment to restore civil order by defeating the Shining Path [SL] and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.) PERU ECONOMICO predicted that the candidates will run short campaigns "in order to avoid overexposure." Stymied Jobs Creation The labor reforms of recent years, which were intended to improve competitiveness by reducing wage regulations and doing away with collective bargaining have not led to any noticeable increase in jobs. The reforms also caused a drastic downsizing in the public sector: from 633,349 government employees in 1990 to 338,428 in 1993. Nor is the export sector expected to generate any significant increase in jobs or wages in the future, according to the April PERU ECONOMICO. The situation is further exacerbated by the very large numbers of young people entering the job market each year. The labor unions have lost much of their clout and many of their members as the reforms have encouraged individual contracting, short-term employment, and modifications in wage regulations with a system for compulsory saving. The establishment of various mechanisms to reduce the cost of opening up new jobs, such as private pension funds and wage reform, has not gone smoothly and the program to finance housing (FOVI) has been suspended. Nor is there a timetable for starting up private health organizations. Two Markets According to the same issue of PERU ECONOMICO, creating more flexible employer/employee relations and other "modernization" attempts are only a partial solution to unemployment and lack of competitiveness because the market has become divided into two disparate segments: a formal market where the workers are protected by labor laws and an informal market with no protection. There are great differences in qualifications, productivity, and wages in the two markets. In the informal market there is not much chance of full-time employment or upward mobility, nor is there any investment in human resources. An expert consulted by PERU ECON0MICO is quoted as saying that the government's strategy to modernize the labor market will only affect the workers in "the most modern sector." They would benefit from compulsory savings programs which will in turn give them access to investment and credit. In the traditional market, improvements could only occur through increased foreign and domestic capital. The current reform does not ensure that the unemployed or those in low-paying jobs will benefit from economic growth. For that to happen there would have to be a skills-training policy and incentives to invest in human resources. Employment Numbers PERU ECONOMTCO estimates that in metropolitan Lima the underemployed (earning $135 per month) constitute 53 percent, and those adequately employed ($341 per month) constitute 38 percent of the economically active population. The Lima sectors with the greatest unemployment were mining (16 percent) and construction (13 percent). Sectors providing the most adequate employment were "nonpersonal services" (15 percent) and commerce (14 percent). Age did not appear to be a factor. Poverty Rising The monthly PERUPAZ in its April issue decries the Fujimori government's failure to address the serious problem of poverty and says that in spite of the economic successes the government claims, its economic policy impedes any improvement in the quality of life for most Peruvians. There is a disconnect, the monthly contends, between Fujimori's economic policy and the country's social needs. In 1992 the GNP dropped by 5 percent from the preceding year to its lowest level in 15 years. Studies by the Institute for Statistics and Data [INEI] show "critical poverty" to have reached 53 percent of the population by 1991, while "extreme poverty" rose to 21 percent. Urban Poverty PERUPAZ says that "contrary to earlier decades," poverty now exists also in the urban areas, and in particular in Lima, where a full one-third of those in critical poverty live. Thirty-three percent of the economically active population of Peru live in Lima. In 1989-1990 salaries and wages shrank by 13 and 16.8 percent respectively. The downhill trend continued for the period 1990-1992: The number of underemployed went from 86.4 to 88.1 percent of the population and the number of unemployed from 8.3 to 10 percent. Nationally, underemployment decreased slightly--from 79 to 76 percent in 1991-1992, while unemployment went from 5.9 to 9.9 percent. Rural Poverty The majority of the poor live in the rural and mountain areas of the country where income is extremely low and there is rarely any access to basic health services, education, adequate nutrition, and sanitation. The INEI study of 1991 showed that in the rural areas of the Sierra only 43 percent of the homes had drinking water (inside or outside), and only 14 percent had sewage. Thirty-one percent of the homes had electricity. Diseases Diseases previously considered under control have reemerged: malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, facial ulcers. Mortality rates for children under the age of five did decline from 97 per thousand in 1978 to 76 per thousand in 1991 according to INEI, but Peru continues to have one of the highest infant mortality rates in South America. Governability Questioned PERUPAZ concludes that the government has failed to address the problems of the poor, "who have become the majority." The periodical calls for a vigorous social policy and an economic policy congruent with the social necessities, saying that a key factor will be stimulating agricultural production. PERUPAZ warns that if the social issue is not addressed, it is "not optimistic about the outlook for governable conditions in Peru." Steady Trend Opinion polls over the past several months done by Apoyo, Imasen, etc., have consistently shown former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar leading President Alberto Fujimori in a two-way race, with the former enjoying greater support in the country's interior. The polls also consistently show that Fujimori would have a clear lead over the other frequently mentioned potential candidates, Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont, former President Fernando Belaunde Terry, and former Arequipa Mayor Luis Caceres (to date, only Belmont has declared his candidacy). Vice Presidential Factor In its April issue PERU ECONOMICO says the vice presidential candidates will be a significant factor: National Police Inspector General Antonio Ketin Vidal "could bring a lot of votes." (Vidal is credited with the October 1992 capture of SL founder and leader Abimael Guzman.) PE does not rule out a surprise candidate, much like Fujimori in 1990, and notes that there are other potential candidates, waiting for a "propitious opportunity," prominent among them former Prime Minister Juan Carlos Hurtado Miller. Fujimori Versus de Cuellar PERU ECONOMICO concurs with the widely held view that Perez de Cuellar's strength is his international stature and his weakness is his decades-long absence from Peru. PE quotes an unnamed "leading" politician with "many victories" as saying "this product [de Cuellar] is not particularly marketable in the sierra." Fujimori's strength, successfully controlling subversion and inflation, puts him in a "paradoxical situation" in that the public sees him as a successful president, but not as a good candidate. The country today has a sense of order; two years ago "no one would have predicted that Shining Path would today be in the process of disappearing," PE asserts. Fujimori projects an authoritarian image and is perceived as lacking any vision "beyond establishing order," according to PE, which adds that the "general requirement" for more peaceful times will be a leader who carries on a dialogue and is a consensus builder. According to a poll published in the Apoyo-owned weekly 24 April SEMANA ECONOMICA, 64 percent of the interviewees believe the next president should be a consensus builder and only 29 percent want an authoritarian president. The number of respondents in the poll, conducted in Lima and "eight other cities" was not given. April Apoyo Polls The April Apoyo polls published in PERU ECONOMICO showed that a majority thought Fujimori's "self-coup" of April 1992 had led to an improvement in the areas of terrorism, inflation, corruption, and narcotics trafficking. A majority believed that the nation's main problems are unemployment, poverty, nutrition, education, and cost of living. The poll was conducted in Lima and eight provincial capitals across socioeconomic groups. The number of respondents was not given. Intelligence Service Poll According to the weekly Sl [2-8 May] citing unnamed "sources," President Fujimori ordered the National Intelligence Service [SIN] to conduct a poll to check whether the private-sector opinion pollsters' figures on the president's reelectability were correct. The findings of the SIN: Fujimori enjoyed a 72-percent popularity rate ("6-8 percent more" than in the other polls); in a two-way race, Fujimori would get 55 percent over de Cuellar's 35 percent; in a two-way race against Belmont, Fujimori would get 52 percent to Belmont's 38. If the two vice presidential candidates were Congressional President Jaime Yoshiyama and Congressional Vice President Victor Joy Way (both of Asian descent) only 3 percent would vote for the three-person ticket while 90 percent would not, reputedly saying "that's a lot of Chinamen." Asked if there should be a woman on the ticket, 77 percent said yes, 10 percent no. The majority wanted to see the female candidate in the slot of second vice president. SI reports that Fujimori is now looking at former Prime Minister Hurtado Miller and National Police Inspector General Ketin Vidal as vice presidential mates, but is also considering Congresswomen Martha Chavez and Luz Salgado, both of New Majority-Change `90. According to the sources, 25 SIN officers were sent out to "all parts of Lima" to interview 1,200 people, ranging in age from 22 to 50.
