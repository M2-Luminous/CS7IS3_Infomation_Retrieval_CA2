FBIS4-16217 "drsov072_r_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-072 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Azerbaijan Aliyev Addresses Nation on Progress of War Aliyev Addresses Nation on Progress of War NC1304123294 Baku Azerbaycan Radio Televiziyasi Television Network in Azeri 1517 GMT 12 Apr 94 NC1304123294 Baku Azerbaycan Radio Televiziyasi Television Network Azeri BFN [Address to nation by Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev; place not given--live, broadcast in progress] [Text] Vladimir Kazimirov [Russian envoy to the Karabakh talks] visited Baku and held talks with us and presented a new draft agreement to us. After discussing this draft, we gave our own proposals and views and indicated that in principle we are inclined to sign such an agreement, provided that our proposals and conditions are accepted. After that Kazimirov was to visit Yerevan and hold talks there. We are still waiting for the result of these talks. Despite all this, Armenia's armed forces have resumed attacks on our positions and on Azerbaijani territory in recent days. A large Armenian force heavily attacked Geranboyskiy [Shaumyanovskiy] Rayon early on the morning of 10 April, and attempted to take Gulistan and Talish. Bloody battles took place. Azerbaijani Army units gave them a deserving reply. In this clash both the Armenian side and our armed forces suffered casualties. Though the Armenian Armed Forces managed to occupy a few heights there, they failed to achieve their objective. Battles have been continuing in that sector since yesterday. Armenia's armed forces launched powerful attacks in two directions early yesterday morning -- one in Agdere [Mardakertskiy] Rayon and the other in Agdamskiy Rayon. They tried to occupy Matagis and Hakobgamari in Agdere. They also launched three powerful successive attacks in Agdamskiy Rayon yesterday. As is known, the city of Agdam is under Armenian occupation, but our armed forces control a part of the rayon, and our citizens are living in the towns there. These cities were also subjected to shelling and the military headquarters there came under fire. Despite all this, our armed forces gave a deserving reply to the Armenian Armed Forces on this front too. The fighting is continuing, and will probably continue all day. In fact, having reinforced its forces, the Armenians resumed their attacks in these directions and in Geranboyskiy Rayon. This marks a new stage in Armenia's aggression. It appears that having taken advantage of the recent cease-fire, the Armenian Armed Forces have regrouped and have brought in forces from every corner of Armenia -- and I can state this with utmost certainty -- to this region and are launching attacks. This shows they have not ceased their aggressive actions, but continue striving to seize additional Azerbaijani territory in pursuit of their occupationist aims. I am pleased to inform the Azerbaijani citizens that Azerbaijani Army units are waging bloody battles on all these fronts, strongly resisting the enemy, dealing powerful blows to the Armenian Armed Forces, and reliably defending their own positions. For example, the powerful three-pronged attacks in Agdamskiy Rayon yesterday were checked. Our fighters were martyred there; 21 were martyred, and 46 were wounded. Twelve of the martyrs were from the battalion formed in Sumgait. The battalion commander Elmar Edilov, a resident of Agdam who has been fighting there for the last two years, died heroically, and the deputy commander was gravely wounded. Undaunted by this our Army units, were continuing to counter the Armenian attacks, and defend their positions. About 23 or 24 were killed or wounded in Agdere region, and there are also casualties in Geranboyskiy Rayon. As I address all Azerbaijani citizens today, I bow my head to honor the heroism of our sons and fellow citizens who heroically died in recent days while defending their homeland, and giving a deserving reply to the enemy. I express my condolences to the families of all the Azerbaijani sons martyred for the homeland. The martyrs' heroism will forever live in our hearts. May God bless their souls. During the bloody battles over the past three days, Azerbaijan's heroic fighters and armed groups have inflicted major blows to the Armenian armed formations that have launched a new offensive against the Azerbaijani territory. Now, I do not want to cite detailed figures, and there is no need to do so. However, the Azerbaijani citizens should know that in those regions -- and I already gave our side's losses -- the Armenian Armed Forces' losses are much greater than ours, both in terms of men and material. For example, during the fighting in Agdamskiy Rayon yesterday, four Armenian tanks and a number of infantry fighting vehicles were destroyed, and they lost many military vehicles in other regions as well. Their casualties were particularly high, including officers. We know this for a fact. I want to emphasize that while dying for the homeland, our soldiers, officers, and fighters are also inflicting powerful blows to the enemy. Before I came to the television studio today, I contacted the fronts, and our soldiers and commanders informed me that they are firmly defending our positions, and are repulsing the enemy, and assured me that they will not surrender any territory to them. However, the fighting continues, and I expect the Armenian Armed Forces to make a major redeployment of forces from all over Armenia to our fronts, after which they will resume their attacks. We are experiencing a serious situation. However, these grave days have become normal under the present conditions. Azerbaijani territory has been the victim of Armenian aggression for the last six years, and we have no other alternative. As I said at the beginning of my statement, our real aim is to put an end to the war through peaceful means. Regrettably the Armenian Armed Forces, the Armenian aggressors, and the aggressive circles in Armenia are not willing to follow this path. When they are participating in peace talks they ostensibly claim to favor peace; but, when it comes to action, they again reveal their true faces, as in these past three days. By television and radio, I now convey my sincere greetings to our fighters, soldiers, officers, and the all citizens at the front who are defending our lands. I congratulate them for standing firm in the defense of our land and express my gratitude to them. I want to say that I am sure that they will continue to reliably defend our lands and will give the Armenian Armed Forces the response they deserve, hit them hard, and prevent them from (?regrouping). At the same time, an analysis of the present developments once again shows that we must further strengthen our defense against Armenian aggression. More attention must be paid to forming Army units. As you know, during 9 to 11 April I visited all along the front, saw various units, and met with our soldiers, officers, and commanders. All of them are defending our territory with high morale. However, I also feel that there are shortcomings in our Army, which must be further strengthened and even better organized. Therefore, the entire population, all the citizens of Azerbaijan, and each person should work to further strengthen the Army. The events of the last three days once again show that we have no other alternative. Therefore, today I am calling on all the Azerbaijani people: I want you all realize that our republic is in danger. Each person should do his part in strengthening the Army and of our defenses. From this point of view, the recent slackened Army call up seriously disturbs me, and I believe it will disturb every patriotic Azerbaijani. Of late there has been an increase in desertions. Desertion is treason against the people and homeland. Evading the mobilization is treason against the people and homeland. Therefore, I once again call on the deserters and draft dodgers to return to the true path. I want to tell them what they are doing will not benefit them. I want to tell the families and friends of the young deserters and draft dodgers: You too bear responsibility for the desertion of your sons and relatives. Azerbaijan is the homeland of all of us. Everybody, each citizen, must guard the homeland. When the soldiers and officers are standing guard at the fronts, bleeding and dying, those citizens who cannot go to the fronts must contribute at their own work places and should send their eligible sons, grandsons, and brothers to the fronts. They must send them to serve in the Army; there is no other alternative, there can be no other way. Therefore, I once again call on the Azerbaijani citizens and people: Come, let us all join forces and rise in defense of the motherland. Let no one think that if the Armenian Armed Forces again achieve victory and advance in some region it will benefit anyone. It will bring no benefits to anyone. It will only be a new blow to the Azerbaijani people; it will be another blow to the Azerbaijan Republic and its independence. Let no one think that he is absolved of this responsibility, or that he will attain his personal goals with such a defeat. No. God will (?punish) them. I trust in our people's common sense and I appeal to them in the hope that each Azerbaijani, each citizen, will arise and follow our just path and refrain from taking the path of treason against the people, the path of worsening Azerbaijan's present grave situation. I hope that the majority of our citizens, the Azerbaijani people, stand and will continue to stand fast in defense of the homeland. I want to assure our people that our army, our soldiers, officers, and fighters at the front are reliably defending our lands and that the current Armenian attacks will be repulsed. In this regard I want to address recent rumors. As you know, rumors as such are not worthy of my attention. However, sometimes a rumor spread by one person creates confusion in society and harms our work. In connection with recent developments, there are rumors that the Armenian Armed Forces are going to capture this or that place and that people should flee from such places, from Terter, for instance; or that incidents will take place in Ganja. These rumors only serve the enemy, and those responsible for them are the enemies of the Azerbaijani people and traitors. Let them know that their efforts are in vain. Our people are now aware. Regrettably, there are even some officials circulating such rumors. They disgust me, and I hope that our people feel the same. I want to assure the people that no one should worry, for our land is being reliably defended, and the Armenian attacks are being repulsed. Let no one worry, let no one leave his post. In connection with recent developments, I also call on the Azerbaijani citizens of Armenian origin living in Daghlyk [Nagorno]-Karabakh. They are citizens of the Azerbaijani Republic; they cannot be citizens of another republic or state, because they are living on Azerbaijani territory. I believe that most of them are now experiencing great hardships. The Armenian soldiers taken prisoner during recent fighting, and even during their previous blitz, have revealed during interrogation that they are being brought to the front by force -- they push them under duress, they force them to fight. We even found out that when they try to retreat, they are punished and shot in the back; they are forced to fight at gun point. What these prisoners say shows that the soldiers from Daghlyk-Karabakh, and most of the Armenian ones too, are brought here by force. For example, an Armenian soldier taken prisoner in Geranboyskiy Rayon yesterday said that most of their troops had been released from prison. These convicts were released and told if they obeyed orders they would be pardoned. Even the people coming from Yerevan, Leninakan [Gyumri], and Edzhmiatsin, and other regions of Armenia indicate that they were forced to come here. This is learned from POW statements. However, I am specifically addressing the Armenians living in Daghlyk-Karabakh who are citizens of Azerbaijan. You should realize that you too have been in a bad situation for the last six years. You too are tormented, and have suffered many losses. Your houses and cities have been destroyed and your living conditions have deteriorated beyond belief. What is it that you want? You too are being killed in this fighting and are sustaining losses. Yet, what have you achieved by this? For the last six years, the aggressive and nationalist circles have dragged you, Azerbaijani citizens, you residents of Daghlyk-Karabakh, into a futureless war. You and the Azerbaijanis who used to live in Daghlyk-Karabakh, as well as the Azerbaijanis who are still living around you in Azerbaijan, lived in friendship and happiness for scores of years. You Armenians who have settled in Daghlyk-Karabakh have been there for the past 150 years. Leaving aside a few conflicts during that period, you have always lived with the Azerbaijanis under friendly and happy conditions. Why was such an existence not good enough for you? Why this? Why this bloodshed? Why do you prefer these losses and destruction? Why? Wake up. Realize that there is no end to this war. The aggressive circles will not be able to achieve their objectives, or attain their goals. The Azerbaijani Republic will never give up its own territory. It is not yet too late to cut the losses in half. There is still a chance. It is not too late; renounce this path; pull out of this fight; pull out of this war; and I assure you we will continue to protect you as Azerbaijani citizens, as our own citizens. Your rights will be protected. We will create all the necessary conditions for you to live in safety. I also call on the citizens of the Armenian Republic, the Armenian people, their leaders, on Armenian President Levon Ter- Petrosyan, the Armenian political parties and their leaders. I want to inform them that this aggressive policy can lead to no end. You should renounce it. There is no need for us to prove that this war was started by Armenia's aggressive and nationalistic circles and will bring no benefits to the people of Armenia. The Armenian people have also been suffering for the last six years. What do we need this for? I tried to telephone Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan yesterday and today, but it was not possible; therefore, I am addressing him on television: I call on him to act responsibly, I am calling on all the Armenian leaders to act responsibly for the sake of their own people. In recent fighting, several hundred Armenian troops died or were wounded. Armenia's aggressive circles, the circles continuing this war, are responsible for the deaths of their own citizens. They are shedding this blood, and there is no end to it. I want to state sincerely that we want to put an end to this war. We want to make use of all the opportunities to conduct talks. However, on one condition: The Armenian aggressors, the Armed Forces must leave the Azerbaijani lands, the Azerbaijan Republic's territorial integrity must be guaranteed, and the inviolability of the Azerbaijan Republic must be ensured. Therefore, having analyzed the results of the past three days, I reiterate that we are for peace, not because such aggression and attacks frighten us, but because we do not want bloodshed. It is known to the world that the Azerbaijani Republic is suffering from Armenian aggression, that more than 20 percent of our territory is occupied by Armenian Armed Forces. Therefore, we are not the occupiers, we are merely waging a just war and are defending our own territory, citizens and homeland. In calling upon the world community, international organizations, the UN, its Security Council and the leaders of the United States, England, France, Russia, China -- who are permanent members of the Security Council -- I call on them to take effective measures to stop the Armenian aggression. We have accepted the Russian mediation initiative and tried to benefit from this initiative, but regrettably, despite months of talks, no results have been achieved. I hope that a great country like Russia -- which has close friendly relations with both Azerbaijan and Armenia, a state with great worldwide influence, a member of the UN Security Council -- will play its role in this region. I also call on the CSCE and members of the Minsk Group to be more active. I call upon Azerbaijan's neighboring states, namely Turkey, Iran, and Georgia: I believe that being neighbors with both Azerbaijan and Armenia, they should not remain on the sidelines of this conflict and should make more effective use of their own possibilities to put an end to this war. I also want to point out that the timing of the Armenian Armed Forces' attacks against Azerbaijani territory and our military positions for the past three days is not a mere coincidence. Some time ago--perhaps a month ago--the CSCE Minsk Group's new chairman, Ian Eliason, came to Azerbaijan and Armenia with a large delegation and held talks on the need to further strengthen the Minsk Group. Minsk Group's debates on Daghlyk-Karabakh resumed in Prague on 11 April--that is, yesterday. And at this very time, when the representatives of Azerbaijan and Armenia are taking part in that session, the Armenian Armed Forces have launched this strong attack. As you know, the press reported that the CIS leaders will meet in Moscow from 14 to 15 April. Important issues will be discussed there. The Armenian attacks on Azerbaijan on the eve of this meeting have certain aims. It may be that with these attacks they want to pressure the Azerbaijani Republic and its leadership. This in vain; no one can pressure us. We have defended and will continue to defend Azerbaijan's independence. We have fought for our independence at all costs. We have also become a member of the CIS. We were greatly saddened when the Armenian attack began, even though we are a member of the CIS and were getting ready to go to Moscow. Taking all these things into consideration, I also appeal to the CIS and its leaders, declaring once again that there should be no more war between CIS member countries, for such a thing is abnormal and it must cease. I particularly address Russia, which has a special and influential place in the CIS, and Russia's leaders: An end must be put these events. Russia has the means to peacefully resolve these problems. I hope that they will make use of these means, as they should. I hope that my calls will not go unnoticed, and will be duly received by the international community. With trust and confidence in the international community, international organizations and international norms, I am conveying my views to them through television and radio. To once again refer to the domestic life of our own republic I once again call on all Azerbaijani citizens, political groups and forces: I want to state that everyone should serve one objective during these grave days for our republic: to ensure the security of the Azerbaijani Republic, help it to survive the present grave war situation, and guarantee its territorial integrity. We must all unite on this path, and walk together along this path. If anyone tries to take advantage of this grave situation for their own loathsome purposes they should realize that they are bound to fail. There are such forces in Azerbaijan; and such intentions are also fostered by forces outside Azerbaijan, which are now active. They all should realize that they will not be able to attain their loathsome objectives. I trust in the Azerbaijani people's (?maturity), (?alertness), and bravery; and I am sure that we will successfully overcome these trials and will defend our land and give a fitting response to all the aggressive forces. I again call on our soldiers, officers, and fighters at the front: You are defending your homeland and native soil. You are serving sacred goals. Your service will always be appreciated by the people, society, and state. Because a part of my statement was addressed to neighboring countries, I will now repeat the gist of my statement in Russian. This is because I want the leaders of these states to hear this from me in person today.
