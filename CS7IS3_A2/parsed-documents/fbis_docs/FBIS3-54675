The message states: Armenian Republic's rayon centers and settlements in Noyemberyanskiy, Idzhevanskiy, Tavushskiy have been subjected to unprecedented shelling by Grad launchers and long-range artillery from Azerbaijan's Tauzskiy and Kazakhskiy Rayons as of 1030 on 29 December. Certain sectors along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, particularly Sisianskiy Rayon, were also subjected to artillery shelling during the day. Considerable material damage has been inflicted on these rayons. Material destruction has been caused, and there are dead and injured among the peaceful population. Against the background of the large-scale offensive that was launched against Nagorno-Karabakh on 21 December, Azerbaijan's military operations cannot be interpreted as anything other than a renunciation of the process of peaceful resolution of the Karabakh problem and another attempt to drag Armenia into the war. The Armenian Foreign Ministry is making a firm protest to the Azerbaijani side, stressing that such a policy is dangerous for the stability of the entire region and does not conform with the position of the international community. By rejecting the efforts of the CSCE's Minsk Group, the peacemaking mediation of the Russian Federation, and the UN Security Council resolutions, Azerbaijan has virtually isolated itself from the international community. By firmly rejecting such a political stance by the Azerbaijani side, the Armenian Foreign Ministry is authorized to declare that Armenia reserves the right to respond in a like manner if these operations are repeated. At the same time, we appeal to the sagacity of the Azerbaijani side and call on it be realistic and resolve its problems with Nagorno-Karabakh exclusively through peaceful means and in conformity with the internationally accepted norms.
