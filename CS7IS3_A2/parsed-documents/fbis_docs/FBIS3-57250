During the talks Sensenbrenner reaffirmed the continued support of the U.S. Congress and Administration to the Latvian sovereignty. The guest underlined that the U.S. Congress had no differences concerning the fast withdrawal of the Russian troops from Latvia. He reminded that aid to Russia was closely linked to security issues. If Russia threatens any neighbouring country, the congress would immediately cancel the aid programme, he said. Gorbunovs thanked the United States for support and added that Latvia was concerned about the recent remarks by the Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. He voiced the necessity of international control over the removal of the Russian troops from Latvia, especially concerning the future of the radar base in Skrunda, as Russia rejected the term of three years proposed by the Latvian Government. The Latvian parliament could consider other suggestions only if concrete international guarantees were provided for. The U.S. ambassador to Latvia assured that the United States would not regard the Russian presence at the Skrunda base for a definite period of time as a proof that Latvia was within the Russian sphere of interests. He said that a U.S. delegation would arrive in Latvia at the weekend to discuss further bilateral military cooperation. Sensenbrenner also said that he was willing to meet a delegation of Latvian legislators that could visit the United States at the end of February to study the lawmaking practices at the U.S. Congress.
