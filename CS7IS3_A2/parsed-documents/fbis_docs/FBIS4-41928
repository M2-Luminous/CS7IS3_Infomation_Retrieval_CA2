According to him, Comrat representatives were surprised "to hear the proposal to discuss a draft on special juridical status modified by the Moldovan Parliamentary Commission and not the one previously drafted by the Moldovan and Gagauz Parliamentary commissions." Valeriu Senic, Socialist Unity faction leader, chatted on the Socialist Unity faction representatives to support the modifications proposed by the Moldovan Parliamentary commission. "The Gagauz Parliamentary Commission sent a protest to the Moldovan Parliamentary Commission which unilaterally modified the draft law; the draft does not favor the Gagauz side and limits the potency of the `Gagauz Eri -- Gagauzia'."
