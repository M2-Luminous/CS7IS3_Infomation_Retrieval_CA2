His comments follow strong hints last week from the Governor, Eddie George, that the last cut in the base rate to 5.25 per cent had been mistaken if inflation was to continue falling. In the United States yesterday the Federal Reserve moved to rein in inflation by raising both its interest rates by a full half-point, more than the markets were expecting. In an attempt to calm jittery global financial markets, it hinted that the increases would be the last for the time being, but the rise almost certainly ends any lingering hopes that Britain's base rate could come down further, lowering the costs of borrowing to industry and reducing mortgages for home-owners. The Fed's move underpinned the Chancellor's point that economic growth must not be allowed to get out of hand as it did in the late l980's. Speaking to industrialists at the Confederation of British Industry's annual dinner, Mr Clarke admitted that the Government's popularity was suffering because the economic recovery was less than spectacular and said most people still believed Britain was stuck in recession. But he ruled out any suggestion that he was at odds with the more cautious Mr George over the level of interest rates, and was at pains to emphasise his determination to keep inflation down even if that ran counter to "short-term political or populist" objectives. "Too many people still hanker after the go-for-growth in living standards they enjoyed in the years of boom. Well this Chancellor does not want a boom because boom gets followed by bust," he said. Sustainable economic growth meant keeping interest rates high enough to ensure inflation remained firmly within his 1-4 per cent target band and would fall to the lower half of that range by the end of the present Parliament -- probably in l966 or early l997. But in the Bank of England's latest Inflation Report released last week, the Governor argued that at current interest rates the "core" rate of inflation would remain stuck at 3-3.5 per cent over the next two years. The Chancellor, however said he had "let the Bank loose to write its own inflation report" in order to improve the credibility of policy, and there was no "clash of cultures or objectives" between the Treasury and Threadneedle Street. "Eddie George and I share the same aim of low inflation and sound money. I decide, but we discuss and seek to agree," he said. Striking out at the right wing of the Tory party, who insist Britain's place lies outside the European Union [EU], Mr Clarke argued that the EU was "good for British industry and British entrepreneurship" and if that meant taking on "those who cling to a more dirigiste vision of Europe, then so be it." He insisted that the argument was moving in Britain's direction. "To be pro-European does not mean that we should accept the soggy social democrat consensus of the European Union in recent years." Meanwhile, City analysts will be watching data released today on unemployment, average earnings, public borrowing and inflation for any signs in a slowdown in activity after April's wave of tax increases or, conversely, a hint of a pick-up in inflationary pressures if growth is too robust. The Prime Minister yesterday appeared to be softening up MP's at Question Time in the Commons for some bad economic news. He said prospects were extremely good, but "every single indicator in the months ahead may not be as good as we would wish." In the United States, bond and share prices rose strongly after the news of the increase in interest rates. However some members of Congress fear the Fed has indulged in overkill and may push the economy back towards recession in an election year. The increase in the Fed funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other -- to 4.25 per cent was the fourth in as many months, though the three previous rises were each of a quarter point. The half-point rise in the discount rate -- the rate at which banks borrow money from the Fed -- to 3.5 per cent was the first in five years.
