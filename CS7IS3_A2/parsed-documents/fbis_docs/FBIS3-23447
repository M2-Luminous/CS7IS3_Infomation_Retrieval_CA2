The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office confirmed the operation, which is linked with the alleged letter by the Red Army Faction [RAF] published by the daily yesterday. [see item AU1603152294 previous Terrorism Report] The spokesman of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, Public Prosecutor Hans Juergen Firster, stated that the search and the confiscation of the 18-page letter was ordered because the original of the letter may be used as evidence. With the help of technical examinations, "evidence may be obtained and evaluated" that might allow conclusions regarding the writer or the writers. The operation is justified despite the journalists' right to refuse to give evidence because the drafting of the letter and its dispatch to the newspaper "suggest membership in the terrorist association RAF." Thus, just like other pieces of evidence, it is subject to confiscation, the spokesman stressed. The editors of JUNGE WELT protested "most strongly against the measure of the federal authorities."
