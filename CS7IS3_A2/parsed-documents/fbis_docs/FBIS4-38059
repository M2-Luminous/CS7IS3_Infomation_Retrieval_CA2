He noted that one of the goals his government has so far failed to achieve is keeping inflation under 10-percent. According to him, the fact that the government has served half its term does not change anything with regard to the peace moves. Mr. Rabin is determined to complete his term, even with a minority government. The prime minister was reacting to a public opinion poll conducted by the statistics department of Haifa University on the occasion of the government completing a two-year term. Those polled gave the Rabin government a performance grade of 5.3 on a scale of 10. Some 29 percent of those polled view Rabin as their preferred candidate for prime minister, 14 percent favor Netanyahu, 8 percent chose Shim'on Peres, and Hayim Ramon and Ari'el Sharon each won the support of 4 percent. The poll surveyed 650 people.
