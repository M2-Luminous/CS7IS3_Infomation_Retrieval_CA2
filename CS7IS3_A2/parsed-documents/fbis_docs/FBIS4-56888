After a heated debate, the declaration was approved. It summarizes in 10 points the five days of work carried out during the seminar on the Development of the Media and Democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean, which began on 2 May and which was organized by UNESCO, the United Nations, and the Chilean Government. The Santiago Declaration was approved by consensus, except for article eight to which the Chilean and Venezuelan journalists associations objected. They favor unconditional exercise of journalism. The confrontation was between the Chilean Journalists Association and the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA), which groups continental written media owners. In its main points, the Santiago Declaration remarks that freedom of expression "is the cornerstone" of democracy and that it is essential for peace and development. The 400 delegates to the seminar ask governments to guarantee freedom of expression and their professional work, and they condemn the violence to which some journalists are subjected, as well as all prohibitions and controls.
