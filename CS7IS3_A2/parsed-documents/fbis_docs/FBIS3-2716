C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, March 10 (CNA) -- Chang Hsiao-yen, minister of the cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC), said Thursday [10 March] that the commission will place emphasis on coordinating the economic strength of all Chinese and strengthening service to overseas Chinese communities. Chang made the remark during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. The combined assets of Chinese traders could rival those of the United States, Japan, and Germany, he stressed. Chang quoted the economist magazine which reported that Chinese businessmen outside Mainland China hold US$1.5-2.0 trillion in liquid assets. Taiwan's economic development could provide a sound basis for business links between domestic and overseas Chinese traders, he elaborated. Moreover, he noted, the commission must do its part to boost cooperation with overseas Chinese in order to deter Beijing's "united front" tactics, which has drawn more than US$6 billion worth of investment to Mainland China. And to meet the growing demand for Chinese-language instruction among overseas Chinese, the OCAC will set up "Taipei schools" in areas with large overseas Chinese communities. The minister said he has visited 112 Overseas Chinese communities in the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Holland, Spain, South Africa, the Philippines, Thailand, Hong Kong, Macao, and Japan since he assumed his office a year ago, and is planning to go to Canada, Australia, and Latin America in the near future.
