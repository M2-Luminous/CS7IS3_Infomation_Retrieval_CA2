Already a lot of international aid has been pledged to South Africa. America alone has promised $600 million. Zimbabwe, South Africa's neighbor and a country with its own experience of racial division, is one of the countries most likely to lose out in the battle for international aid. President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is in London on a state visit, and Julian Marshall asked him if Zimbabwe was now competing with South Africa for international aid. [Begin recording] [Mugabe] Some competition is inevitable, and after all why shouldn't there be competition? If South Africa will have that investment, well and good, but there are also forms of investment which, because of the advantage that we have over South Africa, will come our way. Anyway, we can say that today as things stand, we are more peaceful and stable than South Africa, that we have had areas of greater development and progress than South Africa because of the problems they have had, and that this gives us here in some way and some areas that needed advantage. [Marshall] How important is the white population in Zimbabwe -- I am thinking particularly of white farmers -- to the continued prosperity of the country? [Mugabe] Very important. We still need commercial farming, and don't forget that commercial farming has to do with just more than production of food. We need cash crops; we need greater productivity in the commercial sector so we can compete. So, apart from the fact that we need more land from the commercial sector, and how acquiring this land is going to affect some of the farmers, apart from that problem, there is no other problem. Really, the commercial farmer, I mean, the white commercial farmer, is a happier person in Zimbabwe. [Marshall] So, you do intend to continue with the process of the equitable redistribution of land? [Mugabe] It is equity we are aiming at -- land which must come into the possession of the peasant community -- so that the peasant community has a resource and asset for the improvement of their economic position. [Marshall] So, finally, given the experience of the white population in Zimbabwe in 14 years of independence, what is your message to the white people in South Africa? [Mugabe] Our message is that they should look at how and why community in Zimbabwe -- white and black community -- have reconciled to each other, and I am glad that President Mandela has pronounced the policy of national reconciliation and national unity as guidelines for the people of South Africa, and I hope they do respond to his call in a social and economic way, reacting to it positively, trying to work together with the majority of the people in South Africa, and trying also to enhance the lot of the poor in their country. That way, there will be greater harmony and greater stability, and the whites in South Africa needn't fear of any repercussions, any policies of retributions in the future -- if this happened.
