FR941110-2-00058 FR941110-2-00024 Department of the Navy Notice of Public Hearing for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposal and Redevelopment of Naval Base Charleston, North Charleston, South Carolina Pursuant to Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508), implementing procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the Department of the Navy has prepared and filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the disposal and subsequent redevelopment of the Naval Base Charleston, North Charleston, South Carolina. In response to the recommendations of the 1993 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission and to legislative requirements in the 1990 Base Closure and Realignment Act (BCRA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;510), Naval Base Charleston is to be closed. Activities included in the closure are the Naval Station, the Naval Shipyard, the Fleet Industrial Support Center, the Fleet and Mine Warfare Training Center, the Submarine Training Facility, and the Naval Reserve Center. Naval Base Charleston is located in the City of North Charleston approximately five miles north of the City of Charleston. The Base encompasses approximately 1,575 acres of land along the Cooper River and includes about 2.3 million square feet of industrial space, l.8 million square feet of warehouse space, 2.2 million square feet of administrative space, 86 residences, 19 barracks, 152 marina slips, 23 piers, 5 dry-dock facilities, and a wide range of recreational facilities. The proposed action addressed in the DEIS is the disposal and subsequent redevelopment of lands/facilities determined surplus to the needs of the federal government. A Charleston Naval Complex Reuse Plan was prepared by the Building Economic Solutions Together (BEST) Committee, which included representation of over 40 local groups and organizations from throughout the region. This plan, which identifies a preferred development plan, was approved by both the BEST Committee and the recently created Charleston Naval Base Redevelopment Authority. The DEIS has been prepared to address the environmental consequences of the implementation of this comprehensive reuse plan. In the preparation of the Redevelopment Plan, consideration was given to the possible reuse of the Base by other federal, state, and local agencies, homeless support organizations, business interests (i.e., privatization of the Shipyard), and recreational users. Various reuse scenarios were developed by BEST, and a preferred reuse plan was identified and approved following public review and evaluation. The Preferred Alternative evaluated in the DEIS is the Preferred Development Plan as approved by BEST and the Redevelopment Authority. The Preferred Redevelopment Plan identifies areas of the Naval Base for use as a Cargo Terminal, Intermodal Rail Yard, Marine Industrial Park, recreational areas, cultural park warehouse space and open space/stormwater management. The Shipyard is to be privatized for continued use as a shipyard. The preferred plan also provides facilities for local/regional homeless service agencies including residential, training, and administrative uses. The plan also provides for use of lands/facilities for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS), and interim use of facilities by the Navy. In response to environmental concerns and the current unavailability of information from ongoing Installation Restoration efforts, a Contingent Redevelopment Plan is being considered as part of the Preferred Alternative. The Contingent Redevelopment Plan includes all the same components as the Preferred Development Plan and will result in similar beneficial economic impacts, but will avoid restoration sites if necessary. The DEIS also addresses potential impacts to community services, traffic, air quality, water quality, vegetation and wildlife, cultural resources, noise and land use. The DEIS has been distributed to various federal, state, and local government agencies and elected officials, special interest groups, libraries and the media. A limited number of single copies are available at the address listed at the end of this notice. The Department of the Navy will hold two public hearings to inform the public of the DEIS findings and to solicit comments. One hearing will be held from 7:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. on Monday, November 28, 1994, at the Chicora Neighborhood Center, North Charleston. The second hearing will be held from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM on Tuesday, November 29, 1994, at the North Charleston City Hall. Public hearing times will be as scheduled or until the conclusion of public comments. The hearings will be conducted by the Navy. Federal, state, and local agencies and interested parties are invited and urged to attend or be represented at the hearings. Oral statements will be heard and transcribed by a stenographer, however, to assure the accuracy of the record, all statements should be submitted in writing. All statements, both oral and written, will become part of the public record. Equal weight will be given to both oral and written comments. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit remarks to five minutes.
