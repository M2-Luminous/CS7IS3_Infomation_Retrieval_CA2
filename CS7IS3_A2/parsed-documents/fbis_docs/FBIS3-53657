However, beyond the car stickers saying: "The people are united on the Golan," what do the residents of the plateau think about their future? The poll we held among the settlers was conducted by Haifa University's Statistics Department under the scientific supervision of Dr. Avner Halevi, an internationally renowned expert. Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling sums up the poll's results: Question: Do you think we can reach with the Syrians an agreement which contains less than a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights? Fifty-one percent of Golan residents do not believe we can. Question: Do you think that within five years there will be a peace accord which includes a withdrawal? Fifty-five percent believe that within five years there will be such an agreement which includes some withdrawal. Twenty-four percent do not believe there will be such an agreement. Question: Would you be prepared to live on the Golan Heights under Syrian sovereignty? Seven-and-a-half percent are ready to live on the Golan Heights under Syrian sovereignty, 85.5 percent are not prepared to do so, although even among them there are those who believe that there will be a withdrawal in the long run. Question: Did you discuss the option of leaving the Golan within your family circle? Fifty-two percent did discuss the option with their family and that includes religious inhabitants, kibbutz members, and people living in the town of Qatzrin. Among these people, 11 percent have already made a move in that direction, such as looking for other jobs and alternative housing, and the possibility of receiving financial compensation. Question: Would you be prepared to leave the Golan Heights now in return for adequate compensation? Some 12 percent are prepared to leave now in return for appropriate compensation. An interesting point is that all those who responded positively on that came from kibbutzim or live in Qatzrin. Not a single resident of the moshavim are ready to leave in return for compensation. Question: What compensation do you think appropriate? Among those ready to evacuate, some 35 percent mentioned between $100,000 and $300,000. Some 60 percent are not prepared to quote the amount they would accept. The next question is general: Do you support the peace process with the PLO on an autonomy for Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip? Golan residents are equally divided between supporters and opponents of the agreement with the PLO: 46.3 percent both for and against. Compared to previous polls, it appears that for the majority there is no obvious link between their views on the Golan Heights and their positions on the Palestinian autonomy. They support the autonomy in other areas, but oppose leaving the Golan Heights. The last question: How did you vote in the last elections and would you vote the same way today? Fifty percent of Labor voters would vote the same way again, 27 percent would not vote Labor, and the others are undecided. Among those who voted for right-wing parties -- Likud, Tzomet, the National Religious Party -- 60 to 70 percent would vote for them again. Among Meretz voters, 30 percent said openly that they would not vote for it again, 40 percent would recast their vote for it, and 30 percent are undecided. The telephone poll was conducted among 250 households on the Golan Heights based on a representative sample.
