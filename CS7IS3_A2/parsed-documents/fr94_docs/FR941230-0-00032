FR941230-0-00032 FR941230-0-00006 CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION 16 CFR Part 1210 Safety Standard for Cigarette Lighters; Correction AGENCY: Consumer Product Safety Commission. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This document corrects a citation in a final regulation establishing a safety standard for certain cigarette lighters that requires the lighters to meet specified criteria so the lighters will resist operation by young children. 16 CFR part 1210. The regulations were published at 58 FR 37554 (July 12, 1993). Section 1210.12 of the regulation requires manufacturers (including importers) of lighters subject to the rule to issue a certificate that the lighters comply with the applicable standard. Section 1210.12(b) contains requirements for the contents of the certificate of compliance. Section 1210.12(b)(3) states that the certificate shall contain ``*␣*␣*, if different from the address in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the address of the place of manufacture.'' However, paragraph (c)(2) does not contain a requirement for an address, and the reference actually should be to paragraph (b)(2). EFFECTIVE DATE: December 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Bogumill, Division of Regulatory Management, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207&hyph;0001; telephone (301)504&hyph;0400, ext. 1368. Accordingly, the Consumer Product Safety Commission amends 16 CFR 1210.12(b)(3) to read as follows: §1210.12 Certificate of compliance. * * * * * (b) Certificate of compliance .␣*␣*␣* (3) The date(s) of manufacture and, if different from the address in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the address of the place of manufacture. Dated: December 23, 1994. Sadye E. Dunn, Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;32104 Filed 12&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6355&hyph;01&hyph;P
