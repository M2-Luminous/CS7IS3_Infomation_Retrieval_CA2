Kumagai was referring to reported calls by the Advisory Committee for Energy, his advisory organ, for reviewing Japan's policy in favor of plutonium use as a way to meet energy demand in the future. The committee is now formulating a report on Japan's new energy policy by accounting for recent rapid changes in the energy field. Speaking before a regular press conference, Kumagai said the committee is moving toward a consensus against active use of plutonium. ``Discussion so far by the committee seems to be convincing,'' Kumagai said. Japan has come under global criticism for its plutonium policy as leading to nuclear proliferation. Doubt has also been cast at home over the feasibility of commercial use of plutonium.
