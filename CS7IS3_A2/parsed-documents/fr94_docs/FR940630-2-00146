FR940630-2-00146 FR940630-2-00114 Office of Defense Trade Controls [Public Notice 2027] Munitions Exports Involving the Armaments Corporation of South Africa, Ltd., a/k/a ARMSCOR, and Related Entities and Individuals AGENCY: Department of State. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that it shall be the policy of the Department of State to deny all export license applications and other requests for approval involving, directly or indirectly: the Armaments Corporation of South Africa, Ltd, a/k/a ARMSCOR, an agency of the South African Government; the Denel Group (Pty) Ltd., a/k/a DENEL, a wholly-owned company of the South African Government; Kentron (Pty) Ltd. (KENTRON); Fuchs Electronics (Pty) Ltd. (FUCHS); William Randy METELERKAMP. Vern DAVIS; Brian SCOTT, a/k/a ``Graham Craighness''; Bert QUINN; Johan LOMBARD; Jaco BUDRICKS; Gerrit PRETORIUS, a/k/a ``Bull''; and, any divisions, subsidiaries, associated companies, affiliated persons, or successor entities. This action also precludes the use in connection with such entities of any exemptions from license or other approval included in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120&hyph;130). EFFECTIVE DATE: June 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary F. Sweeney, Compliance Enforcement Branch, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State (703: 875&hyph;6650). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 31, 1991, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania returned an indictment charging the above cited persons, except DENEL, with conspiracy to violate and violating the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The Department of State, therefore, has reasonable cause to believe that, during the period from 1978 through 1989, ARMSCOR and the other cited entities have engaged in an ongoing conspiracy to export, and exported, defense articles and defense services to the Republic of South Africa and to Iraq without the requisite license(s) or approval(s) of the Department of State. During the period from 1978 through 1989, what is now DENEL was an integral part of ARMSCOR. DENEL reportedly came into being in 1992, in the separation and restructuring of ARMSCOR. It is a wholly owned company of the South African Government, operating as a commercial organization. Inasmuch as it is a successor to ARMSCOR, DENEL is also liable for AECA and/or ITAR related violations. This action has been taken pursuant to sections 38 and 42 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) (22 U.S.C. 2778 & 2791) and sections 126.7(a) (1) and 126.7(a)(2) of the ITAR (22 CFR 126.7(a) (1) & (2)). It will remain in force until rescinded. Exceptions may be made to this policy on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Office of Defense Trade Controls. However, such an exception would be granted only after a full review of all circumstances, paying particular attention to the following factors: whether an exception is warranted by overriding foreign policy or national security interests; whether an exception would further law enforcement concerns; and whether other compelling circumstances exist which are consistent with the foreign policy or national security interests of the United States, and which do not conflict with law enforcement concerns. A person (as defined at 22 CFR 120.14) named in an indictment for an AECA-related violation may submit a written request for reconsideration of the denial policy to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Such request for reconsideration should be supported by evidence of remedial measures taken to prevent future violations of the AECA and/or the ITAR and other pertinent documented information showing that the person would not be a risk for future violations of the AECA and/or the ITAR. The Office of Defense Trade Controls will evaluate the submission in consultation with the Departments of Treasury, Justice, and other necessary agencies. After a decision on the request for reconsideration has been rendered by the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, the requester will be notified. Dated: June 16, 1994. Thomas E. McNamara, Principal Deputy, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs Department of State. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15920 Filed 6&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4710&hyph;25&hyph;M
