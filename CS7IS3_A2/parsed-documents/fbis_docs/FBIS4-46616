In the city of Semipalatinsk, where a smoky-brown mushroom created by a nuclear explosion rose above the horizon, young teachers led children into the schoolyard, and said as they pointed their finger in the direction of the test range: "That, children, is where the nuclear shield of our motherland is being forged!" With time, of course, all that was left of the former "visual aid" was radiophobia, while the formerly vast nuclear shield was torn into such a quantity of chunks and pieces that it is now absolutely impossible to determine what part of it really remains. The Semipalatinsk test range is the property of Kazakhstan, while several of the design offices are the property of Ukraine, not to mention the radar stations and nuclear strike early warning resources, which remain on the territory of small but proud and independent Baltic states. And if we add to this the numerous treaties on disarmament, cessation and nonproliferation, the cases of misappropriation of nuclear materials, and the absence of money for scientific developments and to support any sort of subsistence minimum for our nuclear scientists, the question that arises is quite simple, but extremely unpleasant: Is Russia left with anything of the nuclear shield, of what it was that made it a great power? It is unpleasant all the more so because skeptical voices are already being heard both from across the ocean and from the "vast expanses" of the near abroad. "If sufficient concern is not displayed toward the arsenal of a superpower of such dimensions during political and economic reforms, the result may be historically unprecedented leakage of nuclear technology, and a catastrophe as yet unwitnessed in the world," declared U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter a month ago. [Yakovlev] You can't really say that the situation at enterprises of our nuclear complex is very bright. And of course, the fact that radioactive materials are being stolen is a bad symptom. But we mustn't forget that the number of such cases is relatively small, and that the uranium that has disappeared was enriched to 2-4, and rarely 30 percent. It has no relationship to nuclear weapon components. And besides its use in nuclear fuel assemblies, this kind of uranium isn't much good for anything but fishing: It might be good bait for frogfish in terms of its relative weight. When in 1992, and in subsequent years as well, reports appeared that Kazakhstan had sold some sort of warheads to Iran, that the Chechen Republic had possession of two nuclear devices, and that a nuclear weapon cropped up in Azerbaijan, all we could do was laugh. There is, after all, an extremely strict system of controlling the presence and state of nuclear ammunition. All parts of such ammunition, even those not associated with fissionable materials--automatic units such as sensors for example--bear a plant number. There is a data bank that can be used to easily determine where a device is located, when it was made, and what work has been done with it. It can even tell us how many milligrams of precious metals a particular part contains. If any sort of work is done, written confirmation of what was inspected, what parts were replaced, and so on is transmitted immediately to the ministry's central administration. Moreover there are also a number of organizational measures: Whenever a storage site is opened, entry of less than three workers is categorically prohibited, and when charges are shipped, not only is security intensified but also an escort system is established and so-called specialized back-up systems are put into place. I can therefore state quite certainly that it is impossible to lose not only a nuclear charge but even its vehicle or any other nonnuclear part of it. [Belyaninov] Vitaliy Nikolayevich, Western specialists are especially alarmed at the situation involving our tactical weapons: nuclear artillery devices, ammunition for aviation, and short-range missiles. In contrast to strategic missiles, use of which requires creation of an entire infrastructure, tactical weapons may be used by practically any state of the world without any special trouble. Moreover, as they assert in the United States, the exact quantity of our tactical devices is still unknown to them. Officials in Washington state a figure of 19,000, while independent experts such as, for example, Bruce Blaire from the Brookings Institution cites a figure of 43,000. [Yakovlev] It's true that we never cited a figure. Having signed an agreement with the United States to eliminate tactical nuclear ammunition for rocket forces and for ground forces artillery prior to the year 2000, we regularly hold joint consultative meetings. But no figures are thrown around in these meetings. We report that as of the given day 17 percent of such-and-such forces and resources were eliminated. And that's all. Although I can say--these data haven't been made public anywhere yet--that of the total quantity of weapons withdrawn from Ukraine, we have already eliminated 1,500 units, or over half. And if we consider the potential danger of proliferation of nuclear weapons.... Back during the time of perestroyka--and as we know, perestroyka meant instability--we gave some thought to this problem, and we began withdrawing weapons from Warsaw Pact states and from USSR republics. We began with the Baltic and Transcaucasian countries, such that by the end of 1991 we still had nuclear ammunition only in Ukraine, Belorussia and Russia. After the four-way treaty on elimination was signed in December 1991, in which Kazakhstan participated in addition to the republics named above, we began withdrawing weapons from the territories of these states as well. In this case complexities arose, and are arising now, only in regard to Ukraine. The Republic's Supreme Rada began doubting that we were really destroying the withdrawn weapons, rather than placing them into combat duty in Russia, and they stopped releasing our trains across the border. But we were able to find a solution. Beginning at approximately July 1992 we began eliminating these weapons under the observation of Ukrainian specialists. The agreement is still in force, and it also foresees the presence of specialists from Belorussia and Kazakhstan. But to be honest, this isn't cheap. Money has to be paid for the presence of specialists in Russia, for housing and the like, not counting health services. Apparently understanding this, neither Belorussia nor Kazakhstan sent their own observers. As for Russia itself, all we are doing as far as tactical weapons are concerned is dismantling them. Our enterprises have not produced a single device since the time the agreement was signed with the republics. [Belyaninov] How much time does it take to dismantle a single unit of ammunition? [Yakovlev] Not much. The Americans, for example, have two main device dismantling "points." The main one of these--Panteks [transliteration]--eliminates around 2,000 a year. Our rate is not any lower. But as with any other country, we are dismantling more than just tactical weapons. Our ammunition has a shelf life, and a guarantee period. Upon expiration of this period it is not only unsuitable but also unsafe to store it: The charge becomes more sensitive to mechanical effects, and the radiation background may rise. This is why strategic weapons are also sent to the dismantling enterprises. [Belyaninov] Last year was marked by an entire series of conflicts between the Ukrainian and Russian defense ministries. Part of the strategic nuclear forces were transferred to Ukrainian jurisdiction, Russian specialists developing ammunition were deprived of access to weapons, and it became impossible to carry out routine repairs and maintenance. As a result several accidents occurred at bases in Ukraine. [Yakovlev] It may sound somewhat cynical, but two factors saved the day: a visit to Kiev by the American President and Ukraine's economic difficulties. The Americans raised the issue of granting economic assistance to Ukraine that would be directly dependent on the timetable for withdrawal of missiles, while the crisis in atomic energy and the shortage of fuel for nuclear power plants, which was being produced only in Russia, compelled Ukraine to sign a trilateral treaty with fewer stipulations than before. This made our situation much easier. In accordance with the agreement Russia supplied fuel assemblies for reactors to the Republic, while our department was given permission to withdraw all remaining weapons and do all of the needed work at the bases. Such that we can now take responsibility for the safety of the weapons. But I'm not about to make any long-range forecasts: The situation changes so frequently that it is simply impossible to talk about any kind of stability. [Belyaninov] Vitaliy Nikolayevich, the opinions of experts regarding American assistance differ. Some assert that we don't need this assistance at all, that while the Americans talk about hundreds of millions of dollars, they are barely appropriating hundreds of thousands, and that ultimately this is assisting not Russia but the American economy. [Yakovlev] This is true to a certain extent. Little of the $400 million appropriated by the U.S. Congress this year has in fact been spent, but the American side shouldn't be the only one that is blamed. After all, each item in the agreements must pass through a very long and complex system of consideration and approval both there--in Congress--and here--in the Duma. On the other hand any assistance of this sort consists not of cash transfers in the millions to the Central Bank, but of materials and equipment valued at this amount. The United States does place orders with American companies. But agreements to provide such assistance are in effect, and some of them have already been realized. As an example we have received so-called "Kevlar linings" to be used in transportation of the devices. They are unique in their properties: They offer good protection against environmental effects, and several layers of Kevlar can easily stop a bullet from an automatic weapon. We did not have such a material before. We also received special equipment for emergency teams, and an agreement to produce special railcars to transport nuclear ammunition is being implemented. These cars are being developed in the United States, and they offer several levels of protection. The Americans supply parts for these cars, but they will be assembled in Russia. There are several agreements between the Ministry of Atomic Energy and the U.S. Department of Energy regarding construction of a new storage facility for plutonium extracted from warheads, regarding delivery of supercontainers to transport highly radioactive materials, and so on. It is evident at least from this list that the total volume of American assistance already exceeds tens of millions of dollars. [Belyaninov] Vitaliy Nikolayevich, many in the United States associate the volume of assistance being granted with access of American specialists to Russian technology for dismantling and destroying weapons. And during one of the sessions of the U.S. Congress Defense Subcommittee its chairman, John Murtha, declared that unless all Russian enterprises of the nuclear complex are opened to the Americans, including military ones, there will be "no money at all." [Yakovlev] An agreement to deliver processed uranium extracted from warheads to the United States was signed by the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy and the U.S. Department of Energy. And naturally the American side wants to make sure that the materials we are transferring are in fact coming from weapons. The actual issue is at what stage American specialists could be allowed in. We insist on the beginning of the processing cycle--that is, when the warhead has already been dismantled and the material has been extracted and delivered to the corresponding enterprise. In the meantime the Americans want to supervise the process from the very beginning, from the moment the warheads are dismantled. This is a more sensitive topic, this means access to weapon design, and access to our military secrets. When it comes to my own point of view, the problem is easily solved: Weapon-grade uranium differs dramatically in its characteristics from that used in the fuel assemblies of nuclear power plants and nuclear submarine reactors. They're simply impossible to confuse: The characteristics of a material with this degree of enrichment are known to any specialist both in our country and in the USA. [Belyaninov] There is one other problem that troubles many today: What is happening with the Russian nuclear program? The test ranges are closed, tests are not being conducted, and scientists are living on starvation rations. [Yakovlev] Testing is in fact a difficult issue. A tombstone placed over the Semipalatinsk test range long ago, and it will never again be used to test nuclear weapons. Nor is there any sense in talking about Novaya Zemlya, as long as we aren't conducting tests there, and are supporting a policy of their prohibition. But when we--I'm referring to the military department--discussed the need for tests, what we had in mind primarily was not improving nuclear weapons but improving their safety. Only by conducting experiments, by conducting tests, can we be certain of the safety of a device that is in storage. But it would be useless to argue this now. World public opinion is so negatively oriented, and specialists of all countries possessing nuclear weapons are experiencing such problems. This is one of those issues that will not be resolved as long as no country violates the moratorium and conducts tests first. As for the nuclear program, it existed before, and it exists today, although many scientific directions have either been curtailed or significantly reduced. We have weapon systems, the design systems have been developed, several systems of nuclear devices exist, and they have been tested and proven to be reliable. Such that we aren't under the threat of falling behind in this area as yet. There are of course difficulties with specialists. Some of them will switch to jobs in the International Center for Science and Technology currently being established in Moscow. It is being built with American assistance. Testers from the Semipalatinsk test range will most probably work in one of our scientific institutes. And as for creating new forms and systems of weapons, that's something not worth thinking about today, it's too expensive a pleasure. Such that we are concerned more today with problems of disarmament.
