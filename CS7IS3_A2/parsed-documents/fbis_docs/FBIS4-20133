A government spokesman said today in response to a query that Bonn has "no plans" to send Taiwan any submarines via a cooperation agreement with U.S. firms. Contrary to usual practice, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl stated publicly following a secret meeting of the Federal Security Council on 28 January 1993 that delivery is out of the question as far as Bonn is concerned. This position has not changed. According to reports published in the HANDELSBLATT and NEUE ZEIT, the submarine deal with Taiwan is supposed to be worth around 10 billion German marks [DM]. In addition, the supply of the submarines is intended to open the way for the sale of the German Intercity Express high-speed train, a deal worth a total of around DM30 billion.
