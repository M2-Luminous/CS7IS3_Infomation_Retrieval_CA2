Could you please tell us the main points about the results of that visit? [Nguyen Manh Cam] Even though Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to Cambodia this time was very short, it brought about very fine results. First of all, both sides reiterated the principles governing bilateral relations in the new situation. Those principles are based on mutual respect for each country's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; noninterference in each other's internal affairs; and cooperation for mutual benefit. Those principles provide the basis for the two countries to promote friendship and good neighborliness. In other words, it is necessary to further consolidate the time-honored ties between the two peoples. Based on those principles, our prime minister and the Cambodian first and second prime ministers as well as the two government delegations agreed on the need to take practical measures to further develop bilateral relations. This move will benefit not only each country's development, but also regional development as a whole. These measures consist, first of all, of efforts to step up economic, trade, cultural, scientific-technological, educational, and training cooperation. Generally speaking, this cooperation involves all areas of activities. Nonetheless, top priority is given to economic and trade cooperation. Therefore, on this occasion, the two sides signed a trade agreement under which the two countries will accelerate goods exchanges a step further. Regarding economic cooperation, the two sides agreed to step up cooperation under different forms, including joint ventures and participation of Vietnamese companies in bidding for contracts to build projects funded by aid to Cambodia from foreign countries or international organizations. Refund and other forms of cooperation will be available, too. Regarding trade, along with efforts to step up goods exchanges, the Cambodian side made an earnest request for goods transit permission. We gave this request very favorable consideration based on the principle of mutual benefit. Regarding other areas of cooperation, the two sides agreed on cultural and scientific-technological exchanges. In particular, the Cambodian delegation wanted us to continue to help Cambodia with cadre training and human resources development. We also concurred with the Cambodian side on this issue. We try our best to promote bilateral relations based on the principle of mutual benefit. Nonetheless, as far as bilateral ties are concerned, a number of problems still need to be resolved. It must be said that, generally speaking, broad sections of public opinion show due concern for those problems. The first problem involves the border issue. According to the Cambodian side, there are many factions in Cambodia. Therefore, it is necessary to reconsider the border issue and take measures to resolve existing problems. The second problem involves Vietnamese residents in Cambodia. In the past, due to the Khmer Rouge massacre of Vietnamese, a number of Vietnamese residents fled to the border area. In the meantime, Vietnamese nationals who stay in Cambodia often fall victim to the Khmer Rouge's attacks and cruel massacres. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the safety of Vietnamese residents in Cambodia. At the same time, it is necessary to resolve the issue relating to the number of Vietnamese residents who are stranded in the border area. [Correspondent] Comrade foreign minister, during Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit, the Vietnamese prime minister and the two Cambodian co-prime ministers discussed the problems that you have already mentioned. Did they agree on any problem-solving methods? [Nguyen Manh Cam] This is part of the very important contents of the exchanges of views this time between Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and the two Cambodian co-prime ministers, as well as between the two government delegations. First of all, regarding the border issue, we made it known to Cambodia that it is our intention to resolve this issue at an early date in order to turn the Vietnamese-Cambodian border into an area of long-lasting peace and friendship for the two nations. Needless to say, if this goal is realized, there will be conditions for the two countries to enjoy stability, which, in turn, will benefit the region as a whole. Based on this principle, the two sides agreed on the formation of a joint committee of specialists to exchange views on ways to resolve this problem according to the contents of different documents reached so far. Secondly, there is another aspect of the border issue which is worth noting here, namely order and stability in the border area at present. At times, different incidents have taken place along the border which adversely affected mutual understanding. Also, we must mention the situation concerning smuggling activities. During his visit to Cambodia, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet made a very clear analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the situation and stressed the need to ensure order and stability in the border area. As a result, the Cambodian leadership unanimously concurred with the need to set up a joint committee comprising representatives of agencies and localities concerned to help maintain order and ensure stability along the border. This move will help prevent the movement of illegal migrants and other violations which are likely to happen because of a lack of a well-defined border demarcation line. However, this move is designed especially to deal with smuggling activities, which are detrimental to both sides. Cambodian First Prime Minister Ranariddh as well as Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian Government delegation were very much in agreement that border stability and order must be quickly restored, and especially that the two sides must work together to counter smuggling. With respect to Vietnamese residents, our prime minister clearly stated that Vietnamese residents have been living in Cambodia for several generations. They have shared weal and woe with the Cambodian people through all stages of history. They have shared victories and difficulties with the Cambodian people and they have offered their contribution to national construction. Therefore, they deserve correct treatment so that they can conduct their own business in peace. Their business is not only for their own benefit, but also for building and reconstructing Cambodia. This time, First Prime Minister Ranariddh stated clearly that the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia will continue the policy of Prince Sihanouk when he was the head of state before 1970. He also said that the Royal Government will ensure safety as well as life so that the Vietnamese residents can enjoy the same conditions as other ethnic groups in Cambodia. Regarding those who are stranded in the border area, we said clearly that this is not an issue of our concern only, but it also attracts attention from the region, the world, and international organizations. This issue, if left unsolved, will not be beneficial. The Cambodian side said that several investigations have been conducted lately leading to the return of some people. We suggested that this issue continue to be settled early and to return these people to Cambodia because they have been living there for many years with their families, assets, and property. Therefore, if they can return they will find it easier to get on with their lives and to contribute to Cambodian reconstruction. Prime Minister Hun Sen said that he would try his best. [Correspondent] Dear minister, Vietnam and Cambodia signed four agreements during the visit. Can you inform us which issues of these four agreements will be implemented quickly in the intermediate period? [Nguyen Manh Cam] It is correct that four agreements were signed during the visit. They include an agreement on trade cooperation; an agreement on transit goods; an agreement on cultural, education, scientific, and technical cooperation; and an agreement on creating a joint committee for field cooperation to help the two governments carrying out their agreements. I believe that in the current conditions, stemming from the expectations of both sides, we must quickly form committees to settle the border issue and the issue of Vietnamese residents in Cambodia. Other issues will continue to be accelerated. Lately, we have accelerated steps in economic and trade relations. Moreover, we must quickly form a joint committee in order to review bilateral relations before finding measures to accelerate these relations for the better. I believe that Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit opened a totally new stage in relations between the two countries. It also correctly executed the principles agreed to by the two sides about current relations. Therefore, I believe that relations between the two countries will be further accelerated, thus contributing to regional peace and stability. [Correspondent] Thank you, minister.
