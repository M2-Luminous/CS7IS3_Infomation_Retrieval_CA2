FR941013-0-00016 FR941013-0-00005 The FAA received several comments that state that PMA 3rd stage outer air seal, Part Number (P/N) M2533, manufactured by McClain International, should be an acceptable alternative installation to the corresponding PW part, P/N 811962. The FAA concurs. Third stage turbine outer air seal, P/N M2533, has been granted FAA PMA approval, and therefore meets all applicable Federal Aviation Regulations and is directly interchangeable with PW P/N 811962. The AD has been revised to specify P/N M2533 as an acceptable installation. One commenter states the PW JT8D&hyph;17R and &hyph;17AR engines should be exempted from the requirement to install the thicker third stage turbine outer air seal because these engines are already configured with a turbine shield for containment protection. The FAA does not concur. The PW JT8D&hyph;17AR engines require additional containment protection due to higher rated low pressure rotor speeds on these engine models. Therefore, both the thicker third stage turbine outer air seal and the turbine shield are required for these engine models. The FAA received two comments that state that additional costs could be incurred due to lack of availability of the parts required by this AD. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has coordinated this AD closely with PW to ensure the availability of the required parts. In addition, PMA parts are specified in this AD as an acceptable alternative for PW parts. One commenter concurs with the rule as proposed. The FAA has extended the compliance end date to December 31, 1999, in order to maintain consistency with AD 94&hyph;20&hyph;08, Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;83. In addition, the compliance requirement for modification of the LPT vane cluster assemblies has been revised to exempt engines that incorporate PW SB No. 5859, Revision 3, dated January 22, 1991, or earlier revisions. In addition, the FAA has determined that inspections of the third and fourth stage LPT blade sets in accordance with the procedures and intervals described in PW ASB No. 5913, Revision 5, dated August 10, 1992; or PW ASB No. 5913, Revision 4, dated February 20, 1992, constitute acceptable alternative methods of compliance for the inspections required by paragraph (a)(1) of this AD. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
