SUMMARY: This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations by adding a new provision that would allow for test programs and procedures in general and, specifically, for purposes of implementing those Customs Modernization provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act that provide for the National Customs Automation Program. The proposed regulation would allow the Commissioner of Customs to conduct limited test programs/ procedures, which have as their goal the more efficient and effective processing of passengers, carriers, and merchandise, and impose upon participants requirements different from those specified in the Customs Regulations, but only to the extent that such different requirements do not affect the collection of the revenue, public health, safety, or law enforcement.
