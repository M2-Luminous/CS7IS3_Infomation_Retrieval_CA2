The provincial media has reported that Lieutenant-General Liu Anyuan has been replaced by Major General Fang Zuqi. Military sources said yesterday General Liu's retirement was due to age and not to factional struggles. General Fang is among a corps of young officers who have been promoted to the top echelons since the reshuffle began following an enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in mid-December. His last post was director of the Political Department of the Beijing Military Region, a position he occupied for less than a year. Responsibilities of the Nanjing region include the Taiwan Strait and monitoring Taiwan's military strength. In addition to General Fang, two other senior staff of the Beijing region, Lieutenant-Generals Li Laizhu and Zhang Zhijian, have gained promotions in the last few weeks. Sources close to the PLA said at the enlarged CMC conclave, the top brass also discussed military organisation, strategy and geopolitics. "The CMC will further streamline the command structure by concentrating decision-making powers at the headquarters level," an informed source said. The source said the CMC was studying a recent suggestion by its think-tanks that an organ similar to a Western-style national security council be set up. Aside from members of the top brass, such a council, which might be attached to the Communist Party's Central Committee, would incorporate civilian defence, intelligence and foreign affairs experts. In terms of geopolitical strategy, the CMC endorsed the shift of emphasis from the north and northeast to the south and the east of the country. Western military analysts said following improvement of relations with Russia and other members of the former Soviet Union, the focus of Chinese defence and power projections had moved to the southeastern fringe. They said the majority of the large-scale war games held by the PLA last year had taken place along the south and eastern coasts. The analysts said as a result of this new strategy, expansion of naval capacity continued to be a top priority with the national armaments modernisation programme. However, Chinese sources said both the CMC and the central Government had decided to tone down media coverage of the expansion of the Chinese Navy. The main reason was Beijing's desire to remove the suspicion and anxiety of its Asian neighbours.
