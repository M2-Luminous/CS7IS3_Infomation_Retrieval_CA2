Since 0600 on Friday he had been taking calls from radio stations and at the request of one of them, he exchanged greetings with Samper, responding with a "very good, my dear Ernesto," to a somewhat cool "well, how did it go?" Then he met with journalists from EL TIEMPO in his apartment where, accompanied by Luis Alberto Moreno, his campaign coordinator, and Jaime Ruiz, his issues adviser, he was getting ready to begin his first campaign trip through Antioquia. [passage omitted] EL TIEMPO: People recognize the effort you have made to be independent of your father. But there are some issues, like international policy, on which when you speak it seems as if Misael and not Andres were speaking.... Pastrana: One thing needs to be understood: few times in political history has a former president seen that his son might reach the presidency. I imagine that would not be easy to deal with. At least not for a man with the character and temperament of Misael Pastrana, a person who likes to express his opinions, who fights openly for his party and for his ideas. On international policy, we have a very important group of people who are truly knowledgeable about these issues. If there is one thing on which I agree with my father, it is that international policy should not be handled in isolation by one party. EL TIEMPO: But in this area some of your father's proposals belong more to a nationalism of a bygone era. Pastrana: Are we perhaps talking about the marines? Fine, we can do that. If there really are troop movements, the president has to make the issues clear. The government has said that it failed to provide information. It is still possible to convene the Advisory Commission on Relations to help clear up unknown factors. Since I am on this issue, here is another difference between myself and Samper. During my government I will bring in foreign advisers to help coordinate the campaign against narcoterrorism. He said he would not do that; he does not know that we need strong methods to fight this scourge. In this field, I have developed my own policy, my own contacts. I chaired an organization of 16 Latin American parties. I have ties of friendship with President Caldera and his family, and also with President Frei of Chile. I am a friend and I went to school with President Figueres of Costa Rica. We have excellent relations with President Cristiani. I also have excellent contacts in Europe. That will allow us to consolidate the integration process, going beyond international treaties. We have already promoted our own course of action, which is very much my own. [passage omitted] EL TIEMPO: Now that Escobar and the myth of the Medellin Cartel are dead, what would you do about the Cali Cartel? Pastrana: I have been quite clear about the need to curb the drug traffic and not to legalize the production, sale, and consumption of drugs. We are going to revise our antidrug strategies to make them more effective. I have not been informed about the negotiations with the Cali Cartel. I support them as long as they are in compliance with the law and the policy of bringing criminals to justice. I do not accept and will not accept the policy of house arrest. That is ridiculous; it would be shameful. What is needed is severe punishment, not a reward. EL TIEMPO: The possibility that drug traffickers may end up with ridiculously small penalties is of great concern to the United States. They demand that the punishment be proportional to the crime. Do you think that fear is reasonable? Pastrana: Why do they not apply that approach in their country? Carlos Lehder was sentenced to life in prison plus 100 years. Now, according to what we have heard, he was transferred to a German jail and given special privileges after negotiations. When I was in Washington in 1990 I proposed that we pursue a policy similar to plea bargaining; the press jumped all over me and asked me why I was suggesting such an idea. "Why are you so upset? That is your system, we are going to copy it," I answered. And we have copied it, to such an extent that the first legislation was issued by decree. What was wrong with that? That we might negotiate in search of peace? But when the drug lords sought through extradition went [to the United States] and got the "perks" of plea bargaining by turning in other people, that was not criticized. I agree that we need to seek a fair sentence from the legal point of view. I insist that penalties must be served in prison. The policy of bringing criminals to justice must be consistent. EL TIEMPO: You have announced that you will not accept campaign contributions from the Santo Domingo Group. Does this mean your government would pursue an energetic policy of controlling concentrations of wealth? Pastrana: As they should be, my campaign books are open to anyone who wants to see them in the Treasury Inspector's Office. A policy needs to be developed to protect citizens from abuses by private and public enterprises that take advantage of their dominant position. Another very important issue is regulating lobbying and political campaign financing. The regulation of the monopoly system concerns me, especially as it relates to the Television Law. I believe we have been lax because the government has run the television system. If we want to protect the citizens' right to be well informed, we can not continue to be so lax. Furthermore, regional autonomy will not become a reality without excellent territorial legislation. We need to strengthen and pay attention to the commission created by the 1991 Charter. The truth is that the bill now pending in Congress is very weak.
