To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of client services to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority business. The MBDC will provide service in the Buffalo, New York Metropolitan Area. The award number of the MBDC will be 02&hyph;10&hyph;95003&hyph;01. DATES: The closing date for applications is October 31, 1994. Applications must be post-marked on or before October 31, 1994.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Fuller at (212) 264&hyph;3262. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months) from March 1, 1995 to February 28, 1996, is estimated at $198,971. The total Federal amount of $169,125 and is composed of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,125. The application must include a minimum cost share 15% $29,846 in non-federal (cost sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $198,971. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations thereof. The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions. Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (25 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determinations of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award. The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour based on the gross receipts of the client's business. Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance, the availability of funds and Agency priorities. Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs'', is not applicable to this program. Federal funds for this project include audit funds for non-CPA recipients. In the event that a CPA firm wins the competition, the funds allocated for audits are not applicable.
