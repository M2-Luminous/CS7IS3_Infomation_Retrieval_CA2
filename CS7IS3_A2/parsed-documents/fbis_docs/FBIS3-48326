Touching on the question of whether Prime Minister Hosokawa will take the responsibility if the package of political reform bills are killed in the Diet during its current session, Chairman Murayama said: [Begin Murayama recording] It is not desirable to leave Japan with a political vacuum at a time when Japan is mired in a severe recession. The prime minister should first work to compile a budget for fiscal 1994. He should make a decision on the responsibility after the enactment of the budget. I believe the Hosokawa cabinet should fulfill its responsibility to the people. [end recording] In this way, Chairman Murayama said Prime Minister Hosokawa should not dissolve the House of Representatives and announce the resignation of his cabinet en masse, and the prime minister should make a decision on his responsibility after the budget is enacted in the Diet. [passage omitted on the SDPJ's discussing ways to handle its members who voted against the bills in the lower house].
