The FRG's military-political circles are alarmed by provisions in Russia's military doctrine making possible intervention in the "Near Abroad." "Moscow proposes to move probable conflict on Russia's borders onto the territory of the opponent as quickly as possible," WELT AM SONTAG writes. The initial euphoria of the participants in the Brussels conference quickly turned to dismay when they listened to Pavel Grachev, the German general acknowledged. When the guest from Moscow reassured his NATO colleagues that the Russian Army does not intend to save national minorities in the "Near Abroad," everyone sighed with relief. But, when he added: "Unless the relevant countries want this," NATO went on its guard. This phrase reminded many irresistibly of the "call for help" to Moscow from Czechoslovakia and other countries when it was necessary to crush popular uprisings in the "Soviet spheres of influence." FRG Defense Minister V. Ruehe, who has long advocated the expansion of NATO to include the states of Central and East Europe, rejected Grachev's proposals to establish a "strategic" partnership between Moscow and NATO. Meanwhile, the Bundeswehr leadership has announced that the new partners' Armed Forces -- Poland's, for example -- have already begun to adapt their structures to NATO's. At the request of the Hungarian Government Bundeswehr General Winfried Dunkel recently went to Budapest with the same purpose. The Baltic states have also approached Germany with a request for aid in reequiping and redirecting their forces. In particular, they are asking for tanks from the former arsenals of the GDR Army. General Helge Hansen, commander of the allied joint forces in Central Europe, has announced that the first staff exercises with the participation of Poland, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, and Estonia will take place on FRG territory in October of this year. It is not only the newcomers who will have to adapt to the new conditions of partnership. Germany will be required to elaborate new juridical prerequisites for the presence on its territory of troop subunits of the Eastern countries who come to the FRG with their arms and combat equipment. If, for example, a Polish regiment returns home from the exercises, then, under the currently existing provision of the law on arms export controls, it will have to leave its equipment behind in Germany.
