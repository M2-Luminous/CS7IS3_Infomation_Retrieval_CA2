FR940202-0-00055 FR940202-0-00006 Example 2. Accrual of OID on debt instrument with qualified stated interest _(i) Facts. On September 1, 1994, A purchases at original issue, for $90,000, B corporation's debt instrument that matures on September 1, 2004, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument provides for semiannual payments of interest of $3,000, payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 1995. (ii) Determination of yield. The debt instrument is a 10-year debt instrument with an issue price of $90,000 and a stated redemption price at maturity of $100,000. The semiannual payments of $3,000 are qualified stated interest payments. Under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the yield is 7.44 percent, compounded semiannually. (iii) Accrual of OID if semiannual accrual periods are used. Assume that A decides to compute OID on the debt instrument using semiannual accrual periods. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the OID allocable to the first semiannual accrual period equals the product of the issue price ($90,000) and the yield properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period (7.44 percent/2), less qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period ($3,000). Therefore, the amount of OID for the first semiannual accrual period is $345.78 ($3,345.78&hyph;$3,000). (iv) Adjustment for accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest if monthly accrual periods are used. Assume, alternatively, that A decides to compute OID on the debt instrument using monthly accrual periods. The yield, compounded monthly, is 7.32 percent. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the OID allocable to the first monthly accrual period is the product of the issue price ($90,000) and the yield properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period (7.32 percent/12), less qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. Under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, the qualified stated interest allocable to the first monthly accrual period is the pro rata amount of qualified stated interest allocable to the interval between payment dates ($3,000×1/6, or $500). Therefore, the amount of OID for the first monthly accrual period is $49.18 ($549.18&hyph;$500). Under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument for purposes of determining the amount of OID for the second monthly accrual period is $90,549.18 ($90,000 + $49.18 + $500). Although the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument for this purpose includes the amount of qualified stated interest allocable to the first monthly accrual period, A includes the qualified stated interest in income based on A's regular method of accounting (e.g., an accrual method or the cash receipts and disbursements method). Example 3. Accrual of OID for debt instrument with initial short accrual period _(i) Facts. On May 1, 1994, G purchases at original issue, for $80,000, H corporation's debt instrument maturing on July 1, 2004. The debt instrument provides for a single payment at maturity of $250,000. G computes its OID using 6-month accrual periods ending on January 1 and July 1 of each year and an initial short 2-month accrual period from May 1, 1994, through June 30, 1994. (ii) Determination of yield. The yield on the debt instrument is 11.53 percent, compounded semiannually. (iii) Determination of OID allocable to initial short accrual period. Under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, G may use any reasonable method to compute OID for the initial short accrual period. One reasonable method is to calculate the amount of OID pursuant to the following formula: OID short =IP×(i/k)×f In which: OID short =The amount of OID allocable to the initial short accrual period IP=The issue price of the debt instrument i=The yield to maturity expressed as a decimal k=The number of accrual periods in a year f=A fraction whose numerator is the number of days in the initial short accrual period, and whose denominator is the number of days in a full accrual period (iv) Amount of OID for the initial short accrual period. Under this method, the amount of OID for the initial short accrual period is $1,537 ($80,000×(11.53 percent/2) × (60/180)). (v) Alternative method. Another reasonable method is to calculate the amount of OID for the initial short accrual period using the yield based on bi-monthly compounding, computed pursuant to the formula set forth in Example 1 of paragraph (j) of this section. Under this method, the amount of OID for the initial short accrual period is $1,508.38 ($80,000×(11.31 percent/6)). Example 4. Impermissible accrual of OID using a method other than constant yield method _(i) Facts. On July 1, 1994, B purchases at original issue, for $100,000, C corporation's debt instrument that matures on July 1, 1999, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000. The debt instrument provides for a single payment at maturity of $148,024.43. The yield of the debt instrument is 8 percent, compounded semiannually. (ii) Determination of yield. Assume that C uses 6 monthly accrual periods to compute its OID for 1994. The yield must reflect monthly compounding (as determined using the formula described in Example 1 of paragraph (j) of this section). As a result, the monthly yield of the debt instrument is 7.87 percent, divided by 12. C may not compute its monthly yield for the last 6 months in 1994 by dividing 8 percent by 12. Example 5. Debt instrument subject to put option _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1995, G purchases at original issue, for $70,000, H corporation's debt instrument maturing on January 1, 2010, with a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument provides for semiannual payments of interest of $4,000, payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 1995. The debt instrument gives G an unconditional right to put the bond back to H, exercisable on January 1, 2005, in return for $85,000 (exclusive of the $4,000 of stated interest payable on that date). (ii) Determination of yield and maturity. Yield determined without regard to the put option is 12.47 percent, compounded semiannually. Yield determined by assuming that the put option is exercised (i.e., by using January 1, 2005, as the maturity date and $85,000 as the stated principal amount payable on that date) is 12.56 percent, compounded semiannually. Thus, under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, it is assumed that G will exercise the put option, because exercise of the option would increase the yield of the debt instrument. Thus, for purposes of calculating OID, the debt instrument is assumed to be a 10-year debt instrument with an issue price of $70,000, a stated redemption price at maturity of $85,000, and a yield of 12.56 percent, compounded semiannually. (iii) Consequences if put option is, in fact, not exercised. If the put option is, in fact, not exercised, then, under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, the debt instrument is treated, solely for purposes of determining yield and maturity, as if it were reissued on January 1, 2005, for an amount equal to its adjusted issue price on that date, $85,000. The new debt instrument matures on January 1, 2010, with a stated principal amount of $100,000 payable on that date and provides for semiannual payments of interest of $4,000. The yield of the new debt instrument is 12.08 percent, compounded semiannually. Example 6. Debt instrument subject to partial call option _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1995, H purchases at original issue, for $95,000, J corporation's debt instrument that matures on January 1, 2000, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable on that date. The debt instrument provides for semiannual payments of interest of $4,000, payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 1995. On January 1, 1998, J has an unconditional right to call 50 percent of the principal amount of the debt instrument for $55,000 (exclusive of the $4,000 of stated interest payable on that date). If the call is exercised, the semiannual payments of interest made after the call date will be reduced to $2,000.
