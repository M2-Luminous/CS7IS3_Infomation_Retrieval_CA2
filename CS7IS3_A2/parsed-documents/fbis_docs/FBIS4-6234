A spokesman for the Department of Defense said that the main purpose of his visit to South Korea is to hold meetings with military leaders, to receive briefings from commanders in South Korea on situations, and to take necessary military steps, while talking about the North's military moves. This shows that Perry's visit to South Korea is a dangerous visit for war [wihomhan chonjaeng haenggak] to further strengthen military pressure against us, to extremely aggravate tensions on the Korean peninsula, and to embark upon the road of war under the pretext of the nuclear issue. As disclosed recently, last year, the U.S. imperialists formulated a plan for a war of northward invasion, the so-called New Operational Plan No. 5027, along with the South Korean puppets. Based on this, they have concentrated their massive arms of aggression on the Korean peninsula, as well as the areas surrounding it. According to the report issued by the U.S. Department of Defense in mid-February this year, the U.S. imperialists have maintained approximately 100,000 aggressive troops in the Far East in preparation for the emergency situation on the Korean peninsula. Also they have reinforced the military equipment for U.S. Forces occupying South Korea, including the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea, and accelerated military preparedness for the wartime situation [chonsi cheje]. After occupying the post of secretary of defense, Perry has made many remarks that reek of gunpowder [hwayangnae pungginun], while taking the lead in talking about the nuclear development by the North. He has babbled loudly that he will make the North stop developing nuclear weapons at the price of another war on the Korean peninsula, and instead of discussing mere plans for military steps during this visit to South Korea, that he will concretely discuss how, when, and why military steps should be taken. This shows that the U.S. secretary of defense's visit to South Korea is a visit for his front-line command [ilson chihwihaenggak] aimed at reorganizing their wartime system in order to put their already established plan for a Northward invasion war into practice, as well as a visit to plot their operation to organize a combined armed forces [yonhap muryok] against us. Perry, the boss of a war plot, will visit South Korea at a time when the U.S. imperialists are concentrating their massive arms of aggression on South Korea and the areas surrounding it in order to bring the disaster of nuclear war to our nation. Therefore, this is not a thing that can be overlooked. Also, his visit to South Korea is a visit to plunder and exploit the South Korean people by heightening tensions on the Korean peninsula, by subjugating South Korea even more militarily, and by sending stocked military supplies to South Korea. It is well known that the U.S. leaders [udumoridul] are aggravating tensions and stirring up disputes in every place to find an outlet for the munitions industrial complexes which have faced difficulties finding markets since the Cold War ended. As a person formerly in charge of military equipment affairs from the mid-sixties until recently, U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry has had close relations with large munitions businesses. He was also in charge of military equipment for coping with South Korea [taenamjoson kunsa changbi] in the past. It is clear that Perry will visit South Korea to generate profits for munitions businesses, to militarize the South Korean economy, and to force the puppets to increase their proportion in the fund for maintaining the U.S. Forces in South Korea by deliberately aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula and by turning South Korea into a U.S. arms exhibition center. Perry's visit to South Korea will accelerate the driving of the Korean peninsula's situation to the dangerous brink of war and will infringe upon the South Korean people's interests. In view of this grave consequence, his visit to South Korea is totally regarded as a trip for aggression and war [cholchohi chimnyakkwa chonjaeng haenggak], and inevitably faces our people's opposition and rejection [pandae paegyok]. What matters is that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, as a U.S. war servant [migugui chonjaeng mosumggun], is welcoming the U.S. military head's visit to South Korea and is running indiscreetly to set a fire of war against fellow countrymen with the United States. After rupturing working-level contacts for the exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and the South, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique put the entire puppet Army on alert and is accelerating preparations for a northward invasion while talking about strong countermeasures, punishing retaliation, and the like. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has recently dispatched a special inspection team to the military and even made a stir of reconfirming the state of ammunition held in reserve for combat and of inspecting the management of ammunition in store. It is needless to say again that this was conducted according to the U.S. imperialists' adventurous, new war maneuver. When the U.S. bellicose military head and South Korea's civilian warmongers sit face to face, they have nothing to do but scheme up a war, and it leaves no room for doubt that this will threaten peace and reunification of Korea more gravely. We will attentively watch the warmonger's ominous [simsangchi anun] visit to South Korea. If the aggressors and nation-sellers set fire first [sonbulchirul handamyon], they will be made to pay dearly for their behavior.
