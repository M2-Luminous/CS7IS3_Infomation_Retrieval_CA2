If the nation does not now work out such an infrastructure, then by the next century--even though the old ``bottleneck'' restrictions may be resolved--a new ``bottleneck'' will appear: the added difficulty of [jointly] raising industrial competitiveness and the State's comprehensive national power. China's present level in information technology is 30-40 years behind that of the U.S. To raise industrial competitiveness and the State's overall national power, China must firmly take up the task of building an information infrastructure suited to domestic conditions, incorporating innovative technologies and management practices, documented by relevant laws and standards, and based on research and surveys into the economic and social benefits of this global tide. So far, China's information infrastructure building has been government-driven, unlike the market-driven form seen in the U.S. This situation needs to be changed: non-government investment must be encouraged, industrial activity and the entrepreneurial spirit must be part of the overall campaign; industry leaders must no longer rely on the government alone before taking action. In the area of resource allocation, the government has invested over 20 billion yuan, which went for construction of a dozen-odd major information systems, and is investing an additional 50 billion yuan for construction of information systems at as many as 10,000 firms.
