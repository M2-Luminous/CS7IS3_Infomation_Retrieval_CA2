The first group arrived in 1993 for commando training by Turkish officers. It has been ascertained that 754 young men have gone through this training since the beginning of 1994. At present 500 young men are being trained at Urla. After completing their training, they returned to Sandzak and were told "to bomb various government buildings and assassinate political figures." The parents of the young men are told that "they are going to attend higher educational institutes in Turkey." But the parents do not know what their sons are doing in Turkey or which school they are attending. The only liaison for them in Turkey is the Sandzak Intelligence Center in Ankara. It is said that this center is being run by the General Secretariat of the [Turkish] National Security Council [NSC]. Murat Bayrak's Planes The young men picked up from the various regions of Sandzak are assembled at the Macedonian capital Skopje [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Here, they are given "pocket money" of 300 to 500 DM [Deutsche Mark] on behalf of the President of Sandzak Suleyman Uglanin [name and title as published], and then they are flown to Izmir on planes from Sandzak Airlines, which belongs to Murat Bayrak's son Mustafa Bayrak. It is also said that Murat Bayrak is contributing financially to this project. It is stressed that Bayrak, who is from Sandzak, has contacts with Suleyman Uglanin. AYDINLIK made inquiries with Murat Bayrak in Bonn and Mustafa Bayrak in Istanbul on this matter. There were no replies from either Bayrak when our paper went to press. A Deputy's Confessions This came into the open with the publication of confessions by Harun Hacic [name as published], a deputy at the former Sandzak Autonomous Parliament, in the October 1993 issue of ILUSTROVANA POLITIKA magazine, which is published in Serbian in Belgrade and sold in European cities. Hacic was caught red-handed during the operation carried out by the Yugoslav police at the beginning of 1993 to detain the young people trained as commandos in Turkey and organizers of the project. A considerable amount of arms and military hardware that were buried in his garden were seized. Following an exhaustive interrogation of Hacic, the Sandzak police detained 80 people. The interrogation of the detainees has been continuing over the past year. ZAMAN and MILLI GAZETE [both published in Turkey] have been campaigning for the last two weeks for the detained. U.S.-Saudi-Ozal Operation The first official contact on training the Muslim youths in Turkey was made during Sandzak President Suleyman Uglanin's visit to then President Turgut Ozal in Ankara at the end of 1992. Uglanin is the head of the Sandzak branch of Democratic Action Party (SDA) of Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia- Herzegovina. SDA is supported by Saudi Arabia and the United States. The project of training the Sandzak Muslims in Turkey is part of a plan to create "a Muslim state in parts of Serbia and Montenegro." This also complies with the views of Izetbegovic's party, which is active in Sandzak. It was the United States that put forward the plan to establish a Muslim state in Europe. Saudi Arabia is openly supporting it. Besides, Turkey's secret diplomacy on Balkans is being financed by Saudi Arabia. Deputy Hacic, whose confessions have already been published, is Sandzak President Suleyman Uglanin's right-hand man. In his statement he said that "it was Uglanin who first told me about the groups to be dispatched to Turkey." He said Uglanin explained the aim behind the action as thus: "At first, to secure a special status for Sandzak, and then to form an independent Muslim Sandzak step-by-step." Sandzak is a multiethnic and multidenominational autonomous region between Macedonia and Kosovo. The spreading of war to heavily Muslim populated Sandzak or Kosovo would create a regional crisis engulfing Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Macedonia. The United States is banking more and more on using Turkey in its plans with Muslims in the Balkans. The statement of Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, said that "we have the largest army in the region, and have gained experience in guerrilla warfare," meaning that the Balkan and Caucasian wars are not regular but guerrilla warfares. Kahramanyol Is the Leading Man Mustafa Kahramanyol heads the activity providing Sandzak youth with commando training in Turkey. Kahramanyol, who is from Sandzak, is an expert on the Balkans Desk of the NSC General Secretariat and is also an adviser in the prime minister's office. After a long pause, Kahramanyol replied to AYDINLIK's questions by saying: "I am a government official, I cannot comment on this issue." Hacic's confession published in ILUSTROVANA POLITIKA includes names of the organization's members: Sokol Ahmetovic [name as published], the responsible official in the city of Yeni Pazar [Novi Pazar], who organizes the contact with the young men. Cemal Kolasinatz [name as published] is one of the former Yugoslav army officers. Kolasinatz arranges the travel of the groups to and from Turkey.
