Referring to the Camp David accords, Peres said when the Likud Prime Minister Menahem Begin offered autonomy to all the Palestinian residents of Judaea and Samaria, the Likud should have known that autonomy is 80 percent, if not 90 percent, independence. Autonomy is not a reduction in their authority but basically sovereignty minus responsibility for two things: security and foreign relations. Peres later said we will let the Palestinians run their lives with honor and independence, again with the two exceptions. The foreign minister was responding to a motion for the agenda by Likud Knesset Member Moshe Qatzav, who accused Peres of rushing the negotiations with the PLO at the expense of Israeli interests.
