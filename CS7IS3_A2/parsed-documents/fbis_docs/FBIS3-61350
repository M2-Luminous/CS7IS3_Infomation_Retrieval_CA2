Buteyko by an unidentified URYADOVYY KURYER correspondent; place and date not given: "Ukraine's Nuclear Ambitions. Do They Really Exist?"] [Text] [Correspondent] The world is widely commenting on the well-known decision of the Ukrainian parliament concerning the ratification of START I. Unfortunately, there also are assertions that Ukraine, allegedly, has ended up in international isolation and put itself in opposition to other countries that follow the path of nuclear disarmament. What is the situation as you see it? [Buteyko] Yes, indeed, there are ill-wishers in various countries, in particular in our neighbor to the northeast. Actually, everything is by far not as unambiguous as some people would like. At a meeting of the CSCE ministers of foreign affairs Russia attempted to have a decision adopted that could have indeed isolated Ukraine. However, they did not succeed at doing that. Another attempt was made in Brussels, at a meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, with the same result. This is why at present some Russian politicians, possibly being guided by election-time motives, make statements leveling accusations at Ukraine and point toward the international community that supposedly also condemns the decision of our parliament. However, there is, of course, no documentary proof of such condemnation. On the contrary, the facts testify that, although some states experience absolutely understandable uneasiness, others view our position with understanding. The world waited for a first step toward a genuine nuclear disarmament, toward a genuine liberation of humanity from the nuclear monster. Everyone wanted this to happen as soon as possible, as the saying goes, the day before yesterday. One does not have to be a prominent professional to understand that disarmament is no simple matter. It necessitates considerable expenditures, additional material resources, technologies, and production capacity, i.e. precisely the factors that are in very short supply in Ukraine to begin with. This is why the decision of the parliament was justified although, as far as I am concerned, somewhat different, more acceptable wordings could have been found. However, the key provisions of the decree of the Supreme Council are fully in the national interest of Ukraine. I will note that the nature and content of this particular decision were also predetermined by the position of some countries of the world. What do I mean? The issues of guaranteeing our security, the issues of providing technical assistance, of compensation for nuclear material placed in the warheads have been repeatedly raised by Ukraine before the states of the world. Of course, had we been accommodated, executive power and the president himself would have had more arguments in order for the members of the parliament to accept different wordings. [Correspondent] We would like to specify what the main content of the accusations that some are now leveling against Ukraine is. [Buteyko] One of the main accusations is that we supposedly violated obligations to destroy nuclear weapons before certain deadlines in keeping with START I that we have assumed under international law. However, in this instance our ill-wishers count on people who are simply not knowledgeable about the area of international law. Certain principles have long emerged in relations between states according to which, as a rule, obligations and rights are linked. If a state assumes certain obligations to other parties, at the same time it also acquires rights that safeguard its interests. The nature of the obligations and the procedure for assuming them are regulated by the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of International Treaties. It clearly states that a state may assume obligations by way of concluding agreements that take effect and, accordingly, become legally binding documents after they are signed. However, an agreement may envision another track--ratification, i.e. an act of parliament. If we look at START I and the Lisbon Protocol, to which our opponents refer, these documents provided specifically for ratification. Therefore, obligations for Ukraine arise only after the Supreme Council votes in favor of them and the treaties take effect. For now, we may state that they have not taken effect and Ukraine does not have--I will stress this--any obligations under international law in this area. [Correspondent] They refer to the well-known declaration of the Supreme Council about Ukraine intending to acquire nonnuclear status in the future and the Declaration on State Sovereignty.... [Buteyko] Yes, it is so, but the documents mentioned were unilateral acts of the state, and they may be classified as those merely proclaiming the objective; by no means can they be viewed as obligations of Ukraine under international law. Besides, they contain no mention of definite deadlines, or anything else. [Correspondent] As is known, at a certain point, or more precisely on 7 May 1991, Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk sent a letter to U.S. President Bush in which he expressed the idea about the obligation of Ukraine to destroy strategic offensive nuclear weapons within seven years. [Buteyko] Indeed, there was such a letter. However, I would like to stress once again that this was a unilateral political act on the part of Ukraine. Obligations of a political rather than legal nature are at issue. For some reason, those who quote this letter turn only to its first part, forgetting that it also has a continuation. Specifically, the letter clearly says that upon the ratification of START I Ukraine will honor its obligation to destroy strategic nuclear weapons before the deadlines envisioned by the treaty and, I stress, within the context of the Declaration on the Nonnuclear Status of Ukraine. In particular, the treaty envisions that it will have effect for approximately one-third of the entire nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union. Therefore, the Lisbon Protocol provides that the four nuclear states--Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus--should conclude an agreement among themselves under which they will divide this number of nuclear delivery vehicles and warheads that are subject to destruction. However, Russia has refused to do this, refused to even proceed to negotiate this. Supplements to the letter concerning the destruction of nuclear weapons within the context of the Declaration on the Nonnuclear Status of Ukraine should be interpreted under international law in keeping with the norms that exist in the already mentioned Vienna Convention. This means that we should look at what even the political obligation assumed by the president of Ukraine is about. The sense of it is that nuclear weapons are located on the territory of Ukraine that were not manufactured by us but were inherited by Ukraine. Ukraine will destroy them by way of participating in START I whereas the remainder of the nuclear weapons that are not covered by the treaty will become the subject of negotiations with other interested states. In addition, we should note that the Declaration on the Nonnuclear Status of Ukraine envisions that we will destroy these nuclear weapons in line with our financial, technical, organizational, and legal potential, as well as proceeding from the need to ensure ecological security. The problem should be viewed in this very context: Are we capable of destroying all nuclear weapons in two, three, or seven years in our specific situation? Therefore until START I takes effect, Ukraine has no obligations under international law. All accusations, including those found in the declaration of the Russian Government, are completely groundless. [Correspondent] There is a lot of talk about whether Ukraine owns nuclear weapons. However, they reproach us, as does Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs A. Kozyrev, for Ukraine suddenly wanting to become the owner of nuclear weapons. [Buteyko] Empires have fallen apart many times in the history of civilization. Humanity has developed norms that regulate issues associated with the emergence of new states on the rubble of empires. This is what it is about. Two Vienna conventions exist concerning the legal succession of states with regard to treaties, and legal succession with regard to state property, state debts, and archives. Specifically, they provide that in the event of the emergence of a new state (or several states) everything located in their territories becomes the property of the new state or states. In keeping with these international norms, the Ukrainian Supreme Council passed the well-known decree as early as 12 September 1991 in which it was laid down that all assets, including financial resources, of all enterprises, offices, and organizations reporting to the Union became the property of Ukraine. The same applies to strategic nuclear weapons. At the time, nobody objected to this. Over time, the thesis about Ukraine as the owner of nuclear weapons was also confirmed in other agreements signed and concluded within the framework of the CIS. Even the agreement on creating the CIS said the states will exercise joint control. Subsequently, an agreement between Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine, dated 21 December 1991, also said that the states assume such and such obligations with regard to nuclear weapons. How could Ukraine have assumed obligations with regard to an object that was not its property? It is nonsensical. Therefore, even then it was recognized that Ukraine is the owner of these weapons. Besides, there was another string of agreements, in particular, two about the status of strategic offensive forces within the framework of the CIS in which Ukraine also acts as the owner of the components of nuclear weapons deployed in its territory. [Correspondent] Does it follow from this that Ukraine is a nuclear state, or not? [Buteyko] This is a quite complicated question. Usually, they talk about nuclear or nonnuclear states, that is, as if there were no third. However, it is paradoxical that in the case of Ukraine this dilemma does not exhaust the entirety of factors. In the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty itself, there is an indirect definition of a nuclear state and a state that does not posses nuclear weapons. Nobody envisioned in this treaty that states might appear which would inherit nuclear weapons, as happened in our case. Ukraine has not produced or tested a nuclear device, it has no technology for producing nuclear weapons, it does not even control the weapons because the nuclear button is located in Moscow. Therefore, it so happens that Ukraine is an owner of nuclear weapons but is not a nuclear state in the full sense of this term. This is a unique situation that is not envisioned by existing international agreements. In view of this, Ukraine should manage the weapons as material valuables. We are accused because of the Supreme Council failing to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. However, if this were to happen now, in this situation, when Russia did not go for an agreement on compensation for tactical nuclear weapons that had been removed previously, it would turn out that Ukraine is forsaking its right to compensation for fissionable materials that are placed in the warheads. It would have to give the weapons to Russia unconditionally. Can we really agree to this? We have already had the case of tactical nuclear weapons; we have already had an agreement on the division of the property of the former Union abroad. We got zilch by virtue of that. However, the goal of achieving the nonnuclear status of Ukraine exists, nobody has canceled it; I am convinced that a relevant decision of the Supreme Council will be approved. [Correspondent] The idea is widespread that nuclear weapons in Ukraine threaten us with a new Chernobyl, and that we are not capable of ensuring proper oversight of nuclear warheads. Therefore, the sooner we give them to Russia the better it is for us. [Buteyko] The safety of nuclear charges should be ensured by the producer--Russia. We had an agreement on warranty inspection and servicing of nuclear missile complexes by the manufacturer last year, which was also confirmed during negotiations between the presidents of Ukraine and Russia. These agreements should be complied with. I am convinced that both parties will be wise enough to honor their obligations. If this were suddenly not to happen, we should know that danger would loom not just for Ukraine. In this case, such a situation could be the subject of consideration by the UN Security Council. Negotiations are now underway both with the United States and Russia concerning security guarantees, financial and technical assistance, and compensation. I believe that we will manage to come to agreements that will be acceptable to Ukraine and other states. Ukraine is a peace-loving state; it does not threaten anybody, and this is understood in the world. In particular, our neighbors the Poles stated during a meeting of the Consultative Committee of the Presidents of Ukraine and Poland that they perceive with understanding the position of Ukraine and the decision of the parliament as the first step along the path toward achieving the nonnuclear status. In turn, we understand the uneasiness of some states because of this problem. A recent conversation between L. Kravchuk and U.S. President Clinton touched on exactly the readiness to find mutually acceptable solutions. I think that the development of events will follow this very path.
