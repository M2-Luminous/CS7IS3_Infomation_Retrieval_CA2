He also said that this vote of confidence gives an occasion to consider the major goals the sitting cabinet has set for itself for 1994. The prime minister told journalists that the passage of the budget will set in action a system of measures aimed at taking this country out of its financial isolation through settling the problems pertaining to the finalization of the agreement in principle on Bulgaria's foreign debt and through attracting foreign investments. Prof. Berov stressed that the cabinet-sponsored programme of December 1992 continues to be effective. This was the programme with which the government came out in December 1992 when it was formed on the mandate of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms and the support of the Bulgarian Socialist Party and the New Union for Democracy (set up by defectors and expellees of the anti-Communist Union of the Democratic Forces, SDS). Prof. Berov said the cabinet will concentrate its efforts on optimizing the management and privatization of state-owned property. Forty percent of the capital of the functioning state-owned companies will be denationalized after parliament adopts the mass privatization programme, the prime minister said. He went on to say that the cabinet is developing a system of measures designed to promote the private initiative in the production sector, as well as a variety of other measures aimed at the social policy in the period of structural adjustments. One of the major goals of the Cabinet will be to bring the inflation rate further down from 64 percent in 1993 to 35-45 percent in 1994, Prime Minister Berov said. Prof. Berov dismissed as groundless "the statements made by some of our (the Cabinet's) adversaries alleging that the land reform is likely to stop across the country, that some of the major restitution acts will be repealed, that certain members and supporters of the SDS will be persecuted, etc." The prime minister described these allegations as publicity stunt and said the threats for reinstating of the former nomenklatura to top government offices, restoration of the Soviet-style cooperative farms, plots against the private business, a new orientation of this country's foreign policy and an attack against the judiciary, all these come in vain. The prime minister in mid-January called upon the MP's to pass the 1994 national budget bill within mid-February. The budget was passed yesterday [28 February], according to him much later than the deadline he had set, on the votes of the pro-cabinet parliamentary majority.
