Its per capita GNP amounted to 3,675 yuan in 1993, higher than the country's average. Thus, the province's overall economic strength has reached a new level. At the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], this reporter interviewed NPC Deputy Chen Huanyou, secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and governor of the province. Chen Huanyou said: Jiangsu Province has made new planning for reform and development. We have set forth a reform objective according to local conditions that the basic framework of a socialist market economic structure should be built in about five years. Then, we must effectively perform our work particularly in several aspects in order to achieve this objective and push Jiangsu's economy to a new level. Chen Huanyou said: First of all, we must continue to deepen reform. The state has announced more reform measures this year than in the past. Reforms are more difficult to carry out, and they need to be conducted in more depth and breadth and with more intensity. All the announced reform measures involve the key aspects of establishing a socialist market economic structure. We have decided according to Jiangsu's conditions that we should carry out various reforms while concentrating on establishing a modern enterprise system and reforming the macroeconomic management system. We should perform our work carefully and practically, do a good job in publicizing and explaining reform measures, organizing and coordinating their implementation, and strive to achieve actual results. In dealing with the reform of the foreign trade and foreign exchange systems, Chen Huanyou said: We should seize this opportune time to open to the outside world in an ever broader scope and more fields and at an ever higher level in order to integrate our economy with the international economy at a faster pace and with better results. We should expand our import and export trade and increase our ability to earn foreign exchange through exports. We should make vigorous efforts to attract investment by foreign businessmen and make more use of foreign funds. Our planned use of foreign funds this year is to increase 30 percent as compared with last year. Meanwhile, we should vigorously develop our economic and technological cooperation with other countries. We should also build various development areas according to high standards. Chen Huanyou said: This year we will not follow the beaten track of blindly going after the output value and expanding the investment scale and will put the stress of economic work on the quality, efficiency, and level of high economic growth [gao jing ji zeng zhang 7559 4842 3444 1073 7022]. We should foster the idea that "development is the last word." Enterprises whose exports are marketable and with good economic returns should develop their production as fast as possible, and those which cannot do so should not be forced to do so. Everything should be done according to reality. We should attach importance to scientific and technological progress and the improvement of workers' quality, make vigorous efforts to readjust the economic structure, raise the quality and overall level of economic growth, and improve overall economic results. On the construction of infrastructural facilities and basic industries, Chen Huanyou said: Jiangsu has made tremendous progress in building key infrastructural facilities and basic industries over the past several years. But there are still some weak links in these regards. This year we should concentrate our efforts on building key projects, optimize the investment structure, and use our limited financial and material resources for such key projects. We should strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the national economy; vigorously readjust the structure of agricultural production; stabilize the production of grain, cotton, and oil- bearing crops; develop export-oriented and foreign-exchange-earning agriculture, as well as village and town enterprises and diversified economic undertakings, and make every possible effort to increase farmers' actual incomes and to promote an all-round development of the rural economy.
