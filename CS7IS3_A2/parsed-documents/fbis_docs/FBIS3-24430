Leonov: "You Give Us Collectivization!.."] [Text] Perhaps only this way, in true bolshevist style, can you evaluate the process of mass circulation of new kolkhozes in the republic which has been continued since the times of the "glorious" Stalinist five-year plans. If you think about it, our agriculture has been a vast field of experimentation. All kinds of experiments were conducted over the years! First they consolidated them, then they broke them up, then they transformed them into sovkhozes and interkolkhoz associations. There was a time when they even cherished the idea of creating agrocities. But all these undertakings were conceived at the top and implemented in a directive procedure. But the process which has spread over the Azerbaijan countryside during our democratic era is not connected with government decisions, not obligatory for the lower strata to carry out, and not imposed by the will of high authorities at all. The initiative began in local areas, and the ones who started it were persons who thirst for power and want to prosper at the expense of their fellow countrymen: you see, some persons were needed right away to become kolkhoz chairmen, surrounding themselves with devoted people who dream of cozy homes in management, a little farther from the fields and farms. Enticing the masses, "activists" have shared their "brilliant" plans, painted glowing pictures of economic prosperity, and led them on with the ideas of unlimited independence that are in vogue now. This is how the process of breaking up the existing kolkhozes and creating new farms in the rayons was begun and rapidly accelerated. While there were 608 kolkhozes in the republic in 1985, there were 983 when the question of decreasing and eliminating them arose in 1990, and there were 1,175 of them the year after, there are more than 1,200 of them today! This means that there are twice as many chairmen and the number of management personnel who are not working in productive labor in the fields and pastures and on the farms has increased accordingly, naturally. Some rayons have been especially successful in their yearning for organizational activity. Bilyasuvarskiy Rayon now has 22 kolkhozes instead of 13, Ismaillinskiy Rayon has 17 instead of eight, Geranboyskiy Rayon has 61 instead of 30, Agdzhabedinskiy Rayon has 40 instead of 24, and Babezhskiy Rayon now has 32 instead of five kolkhozes. So many major changes have taken place in a number of rayons in just 1 year. Residents of four settlements in Sabirabadskiy Rayon--Mugangendzhyali, Dzhengyan, Salmanly, and Tezekend--were members of the rather prosperous "Oktyabr" Kolkhoz. After promising their fellow countrymen rivers of milk and honey and swearing to serve them faithfully, the new candidates for chairmen urged the people to vote to divide the kolkhoz that had been formed a very long time ago. As a result, each one of the villages acquired its own kolkhoz--"Shakhiyar," "Shen Khayat," imeni S. Gazanov... Though the efforts of those who aspired to be the leading landowners were not crowned with success everywhere. As an example, in Belokanskiy Rayon, there are fewer kolkhozes than before. I have been told that once they had assumed power, many of the new kolkhoz managers rushed to provide themselves with an official vehicle and driver for their personal use first of all and began construction of a solid building for the kolkhoz board with the indispensable main office and hall. A well-equipped, spacious, personal farmstead was often quickly built at the same time. As a rule, the persons who zealously assisted the power-lover to occupy the administrative and economic throne in a deserted, downgraded little hamlet were rewarded, depending on the extent of their services. But perhaps by taking care of themselves and those close to them, the new chairmen were also concerned about kolkhoz production?! In most cases, their activity has turned out to be deplorable. Let us take Geranboyskiy Rayon, where the kolkhozes were broken up so zealously. The average gross production on 100 hectares of agricultural land in 1992 declined by one-half as much compared with 1985. In Bardinskiy and Salyanskiy rayons, output also declined by nearly one-half as much during the same period. Overall profitability of agricultural production in the republic slid from 36 percent in 1980 to 14 percent in 1992. The yield of literally all agricultural products has dropped sharply, and livestock breeding is in a disastrous state. Even cultivation of vegetables has ceased to be profitable on the kolkhozes. The figures on the increasing number of unprofitable kolkhozes are depressing: there were only four of them in 1985, but now there are over 200! Of course, the causes of the agricultural crisis in Azerbaijan are deep-seated; it stems from the extremely bad state of the economy in general, the break in traditional ties among the regions, and the political instability. However, among the other reasons, the factor of overall fragmentation of the kolkhozes has been very harmful. This organizational intrigue has drawn workers away from production and left the fields and farms without supervision. The division of kolkhoz property has been scandalous in nature at times: each of the new formations has strived to seize the arable land that is a little better and equipment in a little better condition. I read a letter from the countryside describing the painful division of property when a large and prosperous kolkhoz was broken up. One obtained a well-equipped repair base, and others received tractors and cultivators which needed thorough technical maintenance. They distributed few spare parts, and it became obvious that none of the sides would benefit from this. It turned out that one of the divided kolkhozes had most of the cultivators, but two others did not know what to do with unneeded agronomists and livestock experts. Bitter, long-lasting disputes have broken out concerning who will be responsible for the credits taken in preceding years, and to what extent. It is clear that the separated collectives, in addition to losing a substantial amount of material resources and often deprived of specialists, have not only been unable to achieve high labor productivity, but productivity that is barely acceptable. Some of these farms that were created artificially very quickly became completely bankrupt and incapable of providing for even their own local residents. The competence and morality of the kolkhoz chairmen who have taken the reins of power lately are another matter. In 1992 and the first half of 1993, because of party bias, persons who were absolutely incompetent and far removed from agricultural production were advanced to positions as kolkhoz managers. Out of 18 new chairmen in Geranboyskiy Rayon, 13 have no agricultural education. Drivers, medical attendants, teachers, librarians, and photographers continue to hold positions as chairmen here and there to this day. Kolkhoz regulations and the principles of democracy have been rudely flouted. Practice such as this has been fertile ground for misconduct and provided scope for the princelings to plunder kolkhoz and public property. In Kyurdamirskiy Rayon, a clever kolkhoz chairman made his 90-year-old sister-in-law the "manager" of a cooperative and sold her kolkhoz motor vehicles, a tractor, and a water pump at bargain prices; the building for a machine shop, a transformer, and a bath house were transferred to her without charge. The kolkhoz "let the cooperative have" 150 sheep at little cost. Dozens of hectares of land suitable for cultivation were dispensed left and right. And the creator of this self-rule got away with it. Many of the kolkhoz members who sincerely believed in the advantage of breaking up the kolkhozes or who were deceived as careerists and mercenary-minded individuals would not mind reuniting the separated farms today. In Imishlinskiy and Geranboyskiy rayons, six kolkhozes were consolidated and gained as a result. But on the whole, it is not simple to put the prevailing trend of possession in reverse. The managers of farms in local areas do not intend to part with the positions which provide them with an incredible salary, the opportunity to command, and all kinds of privileges. And it is hard to engage in organizational restructuring once again, especially in our troubled time. The number of kolkhozes in the republic has increased partly because a number of unprofitable sovkhozes in mountainous areas were turned into kolkhozes. The state left its burden to the rural residents and firmly proceeded to change the form of ownership. But the unprofitable sovkhozes were not turned into profitable kolkhozes for the most part, and this has given persons an additional reason to maintain that kolkhozes in general, no matter whether they are large or small, have become obsolete and they have clearly shown that they are unsound. Such categorical conclusions are not likely to be urgent these days, when we are entering the market little by little with huge and obvious losses, where privatization is only shown by a dotted line, and the triumph of private property is still a long way off. In the current segment of history with its distinctive contradictions and the cataclysms and extraordinary burdens for the people, it is important to retain and make use of all forms of ownership with the most possible benefit for society and to efficiently utilize the best that is incorporated in the kolkhozes. Casting aspersions on them without making distinctions and rejecting a differentiated approach would be an irreparable error. In accordance with our old custom, the kolkhozes are still being commanded from without, their free access to the market is being impeded, and excessive taxes are being imposed on them. I was told an interesting fact at the Kolkhoz Affairs Main Administration of the Ministry of Agriculture. Livestock raising, and milk production in particular, is unprofitable for kolkhozes in the republic as a whole. Kolkhozes have been compelled to give milk to the state dairy plants at a sharply understated and "very ludicrous" price. But in Imishlinskiy Rayon, one of the kolkhozes was authorized to sell milk freely as an exception. As a result, in less than a month, selling milk in the market at 70 manats [unit of currency] per liter in January, the kolkhoz earned more than in the entire year of 1993! And the cash was most welcome to the kolkhoz. It is hard to tell what will happen to the separated kolkhozes now. I think in each specific case we have to be extremely careful and cautious not to resort to severe administrative pressure, to appeal to people's intellect and aspirations first of all, and to encourage and support their sense of economic expediency in every possible way.
