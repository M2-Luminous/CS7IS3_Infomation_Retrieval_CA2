FR940906-2-00070 FR940906-2-00060 General Management Plan, Final Environmental Impact Statement, Wind Cave National Park, SD AGENCY: National Park Service, Department of the Interior. ACTION: Availability of Final Environmental Impact Statement/General Management Plan for Wind Cave National Park. SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Park Service (NPS) announces the availability of a Final Environmental Impact Statement/General Management Plan (FEIS/GMP) for Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota. DATES: A 30-day no-action period will follow the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability of the FEIS/GMP. ADDRESSES: Public reading copies of the FEIS/GMP will be available for review at the following locations: Office of the Superintendent, Wind Cave National Park, Telephone: (605) 745&hyph;4600. Division of Planning Design and Maintenance, Rocky Mountain Regional Office, National Park Service, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, CO 80225, Telephone: (303) 969&hyph;2620. Office of Public Affairs, National Park Service, Department of the Interior, 18th and C Streets NW., Washington, DC 20240, Telephone: (202) 208&hyph;6843. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FEIS/GMP analyzes three alternatives to ensure the long-term preservation of the significant resources and provide for public use and enjoyment of the park's many features. The no-action alternative (Alternative A) would continue current management and operations in existing facilities. The proposed plan (Alternative B) would increase visitor services, improve administrative and maintenance facilities, address health and safety issues, and improve employee housing, while mitigating effects of surface facilities and activities on the cave and providing for additional visitor use. There would be no significant change in the current level, type and location of development. Alternative C is similar to the proposed plan, but would also remove the campground, eliminate the concession, remove the sewage lagoons and install a discharging tertiary wastewater treatment plant and remove the bison fence. The FEIS/GMP in particular evaluates the environmental consequences of the proposed action and the other alternatives on cave geology, soils, and vegetation; wildlife; water resources; air quality; cultural resources; visitor use; socioeconomic effects; and management and operations. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Superintendent, Wind Cave National Park, at the above address and telephone number. Dated: August 23, 1994. Robert M. Baker, Regional Director, Rocky Mountain Region, National Park Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21872 Filed 9&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;70&hyph;P&hyph;M
