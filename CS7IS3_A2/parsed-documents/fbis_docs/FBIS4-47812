They are considered as candidates of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allies. Candidates whose applications were rejected are: Faustin Birindwa, (Jembi Kalubiyi Manchanga), (Kanga Fubiye), (Gudu Mbangana), and Arthur Zaidi Ngoma. No applications fully complied with the laid down conditions because the negotiations that should have been held inside and outside the various groups did not take place. However, the committee said it accepted the seven candidacies because they are in line with Article 78 of the transitional Constitution and in line with its preconditions and can therefore be submitted to the head of state for the appointment of a prime minister.
