Andrey Kozyrev announced that he will go to Brussels to sign the document. He did not indicate the date on which the document will be signed, but said "in the near future." Asked what exactly is needed for Russia to sign the PFP, Kozyrev did not reply for a while, showing his displeasure at the question, but then said: "That is the last question to be asked in connection with the PFP." Kozyrev pointed out that there will be differences in the implementation of the PFP in line with the characteristics of each country. Russia's situation will be approached within this framework, he said. The Russian foreign minister also spoke of "a comprehensive organization excluding the mutual right to veto." Kozyrev pointed out that he met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher for two and one-half hours and then met again at dinner yesterday, adding: "Very fruitful talks were held at dinner. We made progress because Tansu Ciller was with us." Secretary of State Christopher stressed that the United States is pleased that Russia is going to sign the PFP, and said that even if they have differences of opinion, there exists a basis for reaching a solution. Replying to a question on the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Christopher recalled that he met with Azerbaijani President Aliyev. The secretary of state pointed out that the solution should be found within the framework of the CSCE, and opportunities must be created for the continuation of the cease-fire. He added that Kozyrev agreed with him regarding this issue. Meanwhile, Christopher and Kozyrev announced that they agreed to propose that the United Nations impose sanctions on North Korea. Christopher stated that they will submit a draft resolution to the United Nations "in the coming days" to impose sanctions on that country and to convene an international conference on the issue of North Korea's nuclear power. He explained that U.S. President Clinton and Russian President Yeltsin discussed the North Korea issue on the telephone. Kozyrev pointed out that the issue of sanctions and the issue of an international conference are directed at "a single aim," adding: "We cannot tolerate a violation of the nuclear nonproliferation agreement."
