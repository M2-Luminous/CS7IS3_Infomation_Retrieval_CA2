FBIS4-25157 "drchi109_k_94010" FBIS-CHI-94-109 Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social Economic Dilemmas Facing China Discussed Economic Dilemmas Facing China Discussed HK0606115494 Hong Kong CHING PAO in Chinese No 203, 5 Jun 94 pp 34-37 HK0606115494 Hong Kong CHING PAO Chinese BFN [Article by Feng Chien 7458 0051: "Deng Xiaoping Talks Again About Arrangements After His Death"] [Text] Confronted with the actual conditions that capital construction has continued to expand, inflation remaining high, and living standards of staffers and workers having somewhat worsened since the beginning of this year, it is said that the CPC top echelon continues to focus in the near future on scaling down capital construction, exercising strict control over the scope of credit, lowering the inflation rate, and firmly grasping agricultural production as well as "non-staple food supply engineering" in urban areas. According to State Council Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, the key to the success or failure of reform and development this year lies in whether or not a good job is done of reducing the inflation rate and the scope of capital construction, whether or not mass sentiment, especially of workers and staffers at state-owned enterprises suffering deficits, will be stabilized. With a good job done in those two aspects, reform and development in the second half of the year will enjoy comparatively smooth progress. To fulfill the aforementioned targets, the CPC top echelon is sparing no effort to conduct macroeconomic regulation and control by resorting to administrative means, while slowing the pace of reform for the time being. Economists' estimates show that despite the fact that the CPC top echelon continues to adopt a "soft landing" policy, which has been in practice since the second half of 1993, in handling economic issues this year to prevent an excessive drop in the growth rate, should economic growth and inflation rates remain too high, the CPC top echelon is likely to adopt control measures of greater magnitude than last year, even though Zhu Rongji himself is unwilling to resort to such measures. Deng Xiaoping's New Instruction on Economic Construction A resourceful figure disclosed that one opinion on the mainland believes that responsibility for the economy being "overheated" should be assigned to Deng Xiaoping's talks made during his southern inspection tour; Deng had approved of a 6 percent growth rate, which he later contradicted in the wake of his talks made during this tour. Furthermore, Deng Xiaoping insistently stressed decentralization, "filling ponds with water to breed fish" [fang shui yang yu 2397 3055 7402 7625]; as a result, central control was reduced, the regional imbalance in economic development aggravated, and the momentum of blind expansion in various localities went out of control. Such opinion had been collected and reported to Deng Xiaoping, who did not say anything about it right away. However, not long ago, while talking about other issues, Deng Xiaoping said: "Taking economic construction as the key," reform and opening up, and "development is the last word" [fa zhan shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810], these three points are the essentials of what I have advocated; practice demonstrates that there is nothing wrong with those three points, which have won popular support. To my mind, no major problems will surface should the third generation of CPC leaders persist in these three points. As to the question of whether or not the central authorities should have greater power or less, I have not shaped a clear picture in my mind yet. However, this issue should be judged by three criteria, namely, whether or not it is helpful to social productive force development, improving comprehensive national strength, and improving people's living standards. No rules should be generally stipulated. For many years, we have not found a satisfactory solution to this issue. In his days, Chairman Mao wanted to resolve the issue; however, the result was overly rigid centralization which affected development. In the wake of the Third Session of the 11th Central Committee, we have changed past practice; consequently, the economy improved. Today, the issue has once again become conspicuous, where lies the knot of the issue? That is a point leading members of the third generation must resolve. In my opinion, historical lessons and experiences should not be neglected; on the other hand, problems should be investigated and resolved from the angle of reform and development. I have long set out that the central leadership must have authority; that is one of our political advantages. The problem today is that it does not enjoy sufficient authority; at the same time, the enthusiasm of localities has not been given full play. Primarily it is necessary to have a clear picture of the differences between the two aspects. I do not have much energy left now, and other old comrades are not working in the forefront. I am afraid all we can do is offer some suggestions, and we must rely on younger comrades to resolve the issue. Younger comrades should make new accomplishments; it is quite beyond us old people to take their place. Regarding Deng Xiaoping's aforementioned words, figures of political and economic circles made the following analyses: 1) Deng is sober-minded, has his own criteria in understanding the situation, and does not fully approve of current practices; and 2) Deng Xiaoping is, perhaps, still examining "leading members of the third generation." However, it is quite beyond him now; he pins his hopes on leading members of the third generation maturing and growing up as quickly as possible. Some source has it that Deng Xiaoping has recently told his family members: Do not see my personal role being so great; it is far from being so in reality. When Chairman Mao passed away, was it not true that the sky did not fall! Now everyday the outside world is saying that I am dead or on my death bed. When things like that are repeated too often, people will get used to it. The key lies in the fact that we have taken the right path and the economy has developed. No matter how big my role is said to be, it is merely mediocre?! The sky won't fall, even if it should fall, there is always someone to support it. The Present Situation Is Characterized by "Political Tightening Up, Economic Toughening Up" To generalize the mainland situation today in a popular saying, perhaps it is appropriate to quote the phrase "political tightening up, economic toughening up." The CPC top echelon have all along persisted in "political tightening up" over the past few years. To maintain the CPC status of absolute leadership, the top echelon first talked about "reform" of the political structure, but now they have confined themselves to talking about "completion and perfection" only, and retrogressed to canceling the political reform plan characterized by "separation of the party and government" formulated at the CPC 13th Party Congress, while basically resorting to the traditional political structure corresponding to the traditional planned economy to deal with economic restructuring. It is only since the second half of 1993 that the top echelon began to pay attention to and augment the policy of "economic toughening up," with its fundamental characteristic of augmenting central macroeconomic control and regulation as well as a central dominant role in finance, with more power relegated to localities redistributed in the name of "reform" to undergo recentralization. Prior to this, the CPC implemented a "soft economic" policy in reform, basically characterized by relegating power to localities and enterprises to develop the market economy. The simultaneous implementation of "soft" and "tough" policies in economic reform has shown that the CPC has greater room for choice and comparatively greater freedom in reform in the economic arena. Reviewing the entire progress of reform over the past dozen of years or so, the basic CPC strategy was to center on the traditional political structure to push economic marketization and liberalization. Namely, "to promote being `soft' [in the economy] with `tightening up' [in politics]." More often than not, while augmenting political control, the CPC would lift excessive restrictions over the economy on a wide scale; and it was comparatively rare for the CPC to adopt a policy of "simultaneous tightening up" in politics and economics. Even in the wake of the "4 June" crackdown in 1989, they implemented the policy of "promoting `being soft' with `tightening up'" for approximately three years; however, the pace of economic reform in 1992 was greater than any time in the past. Traditional Political Structure Can Hardly Conform to Economic Reform As of today, the CPC top echelon believe that a basic experience in the success of China's reform is to promote it and development in the way of "politically tightening up, with relaxation in the economy." However, whether or not such practice of giving up political restructuring while augmenting political control will continue to be effective has increasingly become a question. First, the existing political structure in China and its operational form can hardly resolve and remove the political perplexity and contractions that have arisen in recent years. For example, regarding incidents of workers from state-owned enterprises petitioning for failure to receive their wages, there are few political means for the authorities to resolve worker resentment. At last, they could only resort to relying on financial allotments to "extend concern" in dealing with such problems. Second, the existing political structure in China can hardly overcome the phenomenon of corruption. The phenomenon of corruption, basically characterized by bartering power for money, has spread and expanded. Consequently, the effectiveness of the market economy allocating goods and equipment has been seriously jeopardized; in addition, the impartiality and authority of the party in office, and its governing in social and economic administration are seriously injured. According to a mainland statistics, the annual loss in state-owned assets was approximately 100 million yuan, and a major channel for the loss was precisely through bartering power for money, a universal malpractice existing in various economic activities. "The first responsible persons" of party and government departments at various levels have considerable power in their hands to intervene in economic life; a mere note or order they wrote would give the green light to the sale of assets worth thousands and even a hundred million yuan for which the officials themselves would obtain huge sum of "commissions" in return. The "double-track system" has cultivated a number of bureaucrats who live on "bartering power for money," who hold an entirely opposing and resistant attitude regarding such political requirements as separation of party and government, of government and enterprise, of government administration and assets management, and democratic supervision, sharing power, and balance in power, which fall in line with the law governing the market economy; they are even opposed to the central authorities retrieving the power in their hands. These people and this social strata have shaped into a strong political force impeding reform in China. The CPC top echelon's worries about failure to effectively overcome such tendencies as "disobedience to government orders," "localism," and "each going his own way" are attributed to the resistance of the aforementioned political force. An important task in China's economic reform is to require governments at various levels to implement separation of government and enterprises with regards to state-owned enterprises, and for government departments to accelerate conversion of functions. However, this task is very difficult to fulfill, and one of the causes lies in the unwillingness of those officials who have fattened their purses by utilizing "bartering power for money" under the "double-track system" to give up power. The phenomenon of corruption finds its root in the "double-track system." Nevertheless, the merger of the "double-track system" with the market economic structure can hardly be fulfilled by relying on economic restructuring alone. The CPC top echelon's aim in pushing reform this year is "to push forward reform as a whole [zheng ti tui jin 2419 7555 2236 6651,] make major breakthroughs [zhong dian tu po 6850 7820 4499 4275,] shape a whole range in coordination [pei tao xie tiao 6792 1152 0588 6148.]" Such an aim for reform can hardly be implemented in practice for lack of a design and arrangements in political restructuring. Presently, the CPC top echelon has increasingly resorted to administrative means to implement the reform plan and to resolve pressing issues existing in economic life. There is no signs of conversion of the "double-track" situation, but a strengthening momentum of the trend to resort to administrative means. The government's role in economic life seems to be far stronger than the market's role; however, its effective role is markedly reduced. From one angle, such a phenomenon shows that China's political restructuring is behind schedule, which has brought increasingly marked negative effects on economic reform. The Authorities Confront a Dilemma in Inflation We should say that political restructuring being behind schedule is a great hindrance to unfolding comprehensive economic restructuring in China; another great obstacle to pushing economic reform will be the CPC top echelon's dilemma in confronting inflation. What accounts for the inflation in China today is largely the following causes: 1) Price hikes inevitably resulting from the transition from a planned to a market economy. This includes conversion from incomplete to complete cost accounting, from welfare to operational service undertakings, from "implicit" to explicit government financial subsidies. 2) Price hikes resulting from China lifting control over prices for grains, energy resources, raw materials, transportations and tertiary industries which accounted for about 60 percent of the rise in the general price level in China. 3) Price hikes resulting from investment expansion and excessive money. The increase of banknotes in circulation in China exceeded 30 percent in 1993 and over 1992, and the lasting effects of this continue to be felt this year. 4) The tax reform plan presented this year, especially value-added tax, has helped push up prices. Of the aforementioned four major causes, 1), 2), and 4) will continue to have a comparatively strong impact on price rises. Perhaps there is little positive meaning to controling price rises of goods in those categories; on the contrary, it would result in still greater confusion in economic life. Thus, the CPC top echelon has focused work regarding control over prices on checking the scope of capital construction and controling the excessive money supply, while resorting to a series of administrative means such as listing scores of commodities under supervision and examination, suspending trade in coal and steel futures, and strictly controlling circulation funds and loans while adopting such measures as putting a ceiling on and freezing prices and conducting price checks on a wide scale. Despite such steps being effective to certain degree, the negative effects resulting from them were comparatively great. First, the losses of state-owned enterprises which rely on voluminous low interest-rate loans for their survival continued to grow, with chained debts rising to 700 billion yuan. Second, unemployment pressure has continued to grow, especially a large number of workers of large state-owned enterprise are worrying about their livelihood because production has been suspended or semi- suspended, with very strong resentments fermenting. And third, the trends of governments in various places drifting away from the central authorities has further aggravated. The central austerity policy and taxation and banking reform measures presented have not brought localities any substantial benefits and power; consequently, localities paid less attention to repeated central orders and injunctions, while utilizing various fund-collecting channels to enlarge reproduction in pursuit of growth rate. Experts Have Controversial Opinions on Curbing Inflation Under such circumstances, great disputes have surfaced among economists who provide the CPC top echelon with strategic advice. A number of economists, with Li Yining as representative, believe that only by maintaining a 9-10 percent economic growth rate will it be possible to fully mobilize existing resources, while avoiding wasting them. For this reason, a certain degree of inflation is inevitable; furthermore, the process of monetizing economic activities as demanded by the building of a market economic structure will inevitably be accompanied by a high inflation rate to a certain degree, but will yield a system in which effective allocation of economic resources will be realized. Thus, it is advisable to keep the fight against inflation at a moderate level, the implementation of the economic austerity policy should be appropriate, and focus must be placed on converting the managerial mechanism of state-owned enterprises and removing chained debts, while allowing enterprises with high economic returns to have more sufficient circulation funds and loans to promote development, so that the pressure of unemployment might be reduced to a minimum. However, another set of economists, represented by Wu Jinglian, believe that any form of inflation will only worsen the economic situation and result in recession of the entire economy as well as political instability. To maintain abnormal state-owned enterprises with low economic returns by increasing money issuance would not resolve chained debts, but only make more funds flow into capital construction, with greater volume of products in storage while stimulating the aggravation of inflation. Thus, the pressing matter of the day is to maintain the magnitude of economic austerity, strictly control money supply and loans, promote the conversion of managerial mechanism, bankruptcy, and transfer of abnormal state-owned enterprises with low economic returns to curb capital construction. It was said that the authorities attached importance to and appreciated the latter of the aforementioned two opinions. However, in late April, inflation was not curbed in China, and the authorities had to adopt the opinion of Li Yining's school of economists to appropriately relax the magnitude of economic austerity and change the targets of circulation fund loans to take into consideration the demand of those enterprises with better economic returns. However, economists indicated that the authorities must raise loan rates again if they wanted to keep the general scope of money supply under control while showing consideration for the pressing needs of circulating funds for various state-owned enterprises. However, deficits of numerous state-owned enterprises will be increasingly aggravated, and the rise in enterprise production costs will bring along further price hikes. Such a dilemma has been a great headache to Zhu Rongji. The CPC Is Likely To Convoke Its Fourth Plenary Session in the Near Future During the "politically sensitive" period of April, May, and June, any decisions made by the CPC top echelon will come under the restriction of consideration for "stability." It is estimated that at least after early June, the CPC top echelon's policy will gradually be clarified, and the issues surfacing in the course of economic reform and development will be placed on top of the agenda. Probably, that will be one of the contents on the agenda of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee said to be convoked around June.
