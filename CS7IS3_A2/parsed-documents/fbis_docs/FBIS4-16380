Speaking to journalists after his talks with visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in Moscow on Thursday, Kozyrev said that the agreement will reflect two aspects -- Russia's interest in cooperation with North Korea in lumbering and guarantees of personal safety and human rights for any person staying in the Russian Federation by the highest international standards. "At the same time we understand the interest and concern of the Republic of Korea because this involves its compatriots," he continued. "In this connection we discussed the Russian approach towards the enforcement of the rights of our compatriots, including in the countries that have emerged on the territory of the former Soviet Union," he said. "We speak not about interference in anyone's internal affairs or manifestations of an imperial approach. We speak about our natural interest in enforcing human rights," Kozyrev said.
