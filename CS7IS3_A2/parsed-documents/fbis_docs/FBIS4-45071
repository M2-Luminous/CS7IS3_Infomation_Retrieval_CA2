The outstanding example of this is the technological-economic sphere, which is indirectly affecting our social and spiritual life. Our language and the culture of interpersonal relations are changing, with implications for the political and national sphere as well. Hayim Ramon overran the old and hated fort of the Histadrut and gave a green light to speeding up replacement of the leadership of the old and intermediate generations. We can look forward to further assaults bringing down the strongholds of the old Zionism, to dissolution of the Histadrut, the Palmach, which had seemed wiped out to all of us, the Jewish Agency and the rest of Zionism's archaeological relics. In his impulsive reaction to the state comptroller, Rabin reminded everyone that he still belongs to the old Palmach boys. The terms "monkey's uncle" and "drivel" are indeed native Israeli, but old-fashioned. The right camp is stuck in a desperate struggle to block the "peace train," which naturally, and as expected, has been built in and stops at the Gaza and Jericho stations. One may hope for "Gaza and Jericho first--and last," at least during the current government's term. The right camp, in its conservatism, must not preserve the party institutions' outdated structure. National feedback circles must be created, the public must be stirred with ideas. Perhaps the Meymad movement and the Takhelet circle will generate momentum leading, in time, to "new life" in the center and the right, but every other initiative and mass ferment is to be blessed in this transition period. Religious Zionism finds itself at a crossroads. The NRP's [National Religious Party] exclusion from the government is causing a crisis in many spheres of activity in which the national religious public [as published] had been a leading factor. One may hope that the natural processes that will make "Gaza and Jericho first--and last" will enable a new settlement scheme to take the socioideological place of religious Zionism. The time has come to mark whether the national religious public is advancing religious Zionism or, on the contrary, burying it in a corner of the national right. In the past, the role of "counterweight" permitted religious Zionism to stand in the center of the map. It may be that what is needed today is integration into the major parties in order to spearhead the new Zionism. This issue must be put on the agenda in the upcoming party elections. The national religious public's success depends on the extent of the public's disgust with the big parties, but on the scale of a midsize to small party, a situation will be perpetuated in which the national religious public exists by grace of the government. One of the areas in which the NRP is an initiator and leader is that of immigration and Jewish-Israeli activity within the former Soviet Union. The Labor Party's myopia on this issue is typified by the conduct and attitude of Deputy Education Minister Mikha Goldman, and reached a peak regarding youth immigration, about which I wrote in a previous article (published 12 May 1994). In that article, I called for "new life" in the Jewish Agency and for youth immigration with Rabin in peace." The reply of Eli 'Amir, who is in charge of youth immigration, to the article "National Project," which was published in HATZOFE on 26 May 1994, argues for a "national monopoly" of the Jewish Agency and youth immigration. This monopoly is a sure prescription for atrophy, mediocrity, and a low level of services. There is no need in the modern period and the current situation of "expiatory fowl" to engage in a "cock fight"; what we need is to foster a healthy competition between two plans. In the case of immigration and immigration 16, the very one who feared a professional defeat took advantage of his proximity to authority and obtained a political, nonprofessional decision. Israeli society's great fear is that the "expiatory fowl" of the various immigration bureaus will undergo a negative psychological process of "identifying with the aggressor," the authority culture of those who receive them. Such psychological dynamics will perpetuate the culture of "expiatory fowl," and the only thing that will change is the sacrifice of the week. Eli 'Amir's rhetoric demonstrates that he has become more of a Mapainik than the Mapainiks. That is not big news for students of youth immigration. On the contrary, the culture of immigration absorption in Israel, which is causing an outbreak of delayed aggression by those absorbed, and by no means in creative and positive channels, has to be changed. We need a culture of authority and absorption that is more refined, one in which Israeli society imbues immigrants with esprit de corps and opens itself to study and change. Direct, open and mutual absorption, not haughty and unilateral provision of shelter. The challenge for Yehi'el Leqet, acting chairman of the Jewish Agency, is to take measures before it is too late and to make reforms that will prevent him from being branded with the image of "the Haberfeld of the Jewish Agency." He now has on his desk the problem of youth immigration, which is one of the tests of his ability to absorb the spirit of the times. Rabin, who is fighting for his position against 'Arafat, and was dragged down to 'Arafat's level of expression in Johannesburg, is incapable meanwhile of rising above himself, neither with youth immigration nor with the Palmach, not even at the expense of 'Arafat and the PLO. As the leader of a modern state with a new spirit, a vast center of power residing in his office, he finds it difficult to break free of both the near past, the Rabin-Peres camp, and the remote past, the days of the Palmach and the victory of the Six-Day War. Perhaps we are dealing with a crisis intrinsic in the office, as Nahum Barne'a and Shim'on Schiffer have analyzed in YEDI'OT AHARONOT, but the fear still exists that the problem is a deeper psychopolitical one. It is difficult to see how, without advisers and strong-willed younger men, he can adapt to a changing reality and guide a new Zionism, a Zionism that embraces management of a modern competitive economy and breathes fresh ideas into national values. It is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that new Zionism depends on "new life" and a young, fresh leadership.
