The Hong Kong Government has no right to publish the contents of the Sino-British talks. If the British side wants to publish the contents of the talks, these should be issued through diplomatic channels. The British side should not violate the principle of confidentiality agreed upon by the two governments. Qin Wenjun attended a Spring Festival get-together sponsored by the "Hong Kong United Association for the Advancement of Women in All Walks of Life" yesterday evening. When asked by reporters about the British Hong Kong Government's declared intention to publish the contents of the 17 rounds of the Sino-British talks, he said: The British Hong Kong Government should understand three points about this issue: First, the Sino-British talks on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements are a matter between the Chinese and British Governments, and the Hong Kong Government has no right whatsoever to publish the contents of Sino-British talks. Second, at the start of the talks, the Chinese and British Governments agreed on a common principle -- the principle of confidentiality, and the Hong Kong Government should take this into consideration prudently. Third, if the Hong Kong Government wants to publish the contents of the Sino-British talks, these should be issued through diplomatic channels. If the British side unilaterally publishes the contents of the talks, it will violate the principle agreed upon by the two Governments. He urged the British side to take a prudent attitude.
