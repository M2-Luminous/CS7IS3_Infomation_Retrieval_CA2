A plurality say that Kim's top accomplishments were the implementation of the real-name financial system and his reform campaign, while criticizing his failure to stabilize prices and hammer out appropriate agricultural measures in the wake of the Uruguay Round accord. A large number believe Kim's determination to achieve reform has weakened from his early days in office. Compared with 80.8 percent last June, just 50.1 percent applauded Kim's management of state affairs over the past year with 12.5 percent saying he did very well, according to a telephone poll by the TONG-A ILBO. His greatest achievement was hailed as the real-name system (70.5 percent), followed by the anti-corruption and discipline campaign (54.9 percent), military reform (54 percent) and improvement of public services (43 percent). Price stability was widely cited as Kim's top failure (87.6 percent), trailed by agriculture policy (59.5 percent), revitalization of the economy (51.6 percent), environmental protection (38.4 percent) and anti-crime measures (37.5 percent), according to the TONG-A poll. Some 69 percent say they hope to see the Kim administration do better in improving the economy, with 49.1 percent calling for price stability. In the same vein, 40.4 percent think the economy has worsened, four times the 10.1 percent of last June. Assessing Kim's determination to carry out reform, 44.7 percent said it has weakened while 49 percent said the president remained equally steadfast. Kim claimed a better approval rating of 62.3 percent in the poll by the CHUNGANG daily news, but that was still below the 83.6 percent recorded last June. While a plurality voiced satisfaction with Kim's first year, 44 percent answered negatively in assessing the accomplishments of his reform policy, compared with a 42.6-percent positive response. Kim's government failed again at attaining price stability (59.2 percent) in CHUNGANG's telephone poll, while a majority said the attitude of politicans and public servants had improved. But most were disappointed in the economy and inter-Korean relations. Some 38 percent felt the president did well during his first year in office, while 16 percent said the opposite in a poll of 1,200 men and women across the nation conducted by the KYONGHYANG daily news. However, 46 percent answered that Kim did just so-so. His greatest feat was implementation of the real-name system (51.3 percent) followed by revision of the public servants' ethics law (21.6 percent). Spiraling prices again ranked as Kim's worst failure, followed by the decision to open the rice market (23.8 percent) and the economy's lack of improvement (12.1 percent). Meanwhile, 39.7 percent said Kim's reform policy did little to improve their everyday lives while 17.4 percent thought the opposite. A total of 46.8 percent said the economy was no better than last year while 25.8 percent said it has grown worse.
