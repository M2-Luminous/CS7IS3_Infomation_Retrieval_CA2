FR940628-1-00063 FR940628-1-00013 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 48 CFR Parts 1831 and 1852 Revision to NASA FAR Supplement Coverage on Precontract Costs AGENCY: Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This rule proposes to amend the regulations pertaining to precontract costs to specify the content of letters to contractors which authorize the incurrence of precontract costs, make clear the circumstances when precontract costs would be appropriate, and clarify that precontract costs are not allowable unless the clause ``Precontract Costs'' is included in the contract. In addition, the proposed rule revises the prescription for the clause to allow its use in other than cost-reimbursement contracts. Also, the rule proposes to change the title of that clause from ``Date of Incurrence of Costs'' to ``Precontract Costs'' to more accurately reflect its purpose. DATES: Comments must be received on or before August 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to Mr. Joseph Le Cren, Contract Pricing and Finance Division (Code HC), Office of Procurement, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Joseph Le Cren, (202) 358&hyph;0444. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Although NASA has used authorization letters for precontract costs for many years, there has been little standardization in the contents of the letters. In addition, the current NASA FAR Supplement coverage at 1831.205&hyph;32 does not make it clear when the use of precontract costs would be appropriate, or that the clause at 1852.231&hyph;70 is required to be in the contract in order for precontract costs to be allowable. In addition, the clause prescription incorrectly states that the clause only should go in cost-reimbursement contracts. The clause would also be applicable to fixed-price incentive or redeterminable contracts and to terminated firm-fixed price contracts, as the cost principles at (FAR) 48 CFR Subpart 31.2 would be applicable. The proposed rule specifies the information to be included in precontract cost authorization letters to contractors, identifies when the use of precontract costs would be appropriate, as well as requires the clause at 1852.231&hyph;70 be used for precontract costs to be allowable. The proposed rule also retitles the clause at 1852.231&hyph;70 from the ``Date of Incurrence of Costs'' to ``Precontract Costs'' to more accurately reflect the purpose of the clause. Impact NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). This rule does not impose any reporting or record keeping requirements subject to the Paperwork reduction Act. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 1831 and 1852 Government procurement.
