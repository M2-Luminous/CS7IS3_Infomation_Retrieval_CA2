During a brief meeting of the agency management he spoke about the need for journalistic integrity. [Begin Pawlak recording] I hope that PAP will deal with facts and information related to facts and not with spreading feelers put out by other media. This, I think, is a general issue that concerns mass media in general, to concentrate on facts -- and on important facts -- and not make a huge story out of minor matters. It often happens that once a story is verified it is hard to tell where it originated, but by that time it is all over the place. So, I think that such an agency as PAP should serve as an example of reliability and publish information that is important to the public, the state, and the economy. [end recording] Asked what feelers he had in mind, Prime Minister Pawlak recalled the issue of the Concordat. [Begin Pawlak recording] There was a situation when a well known local radio set in motion an avalanche of suppositions, speculations, and considerations around alleged expert reports. Later, when there was a joint statement by the government and episcopate press offices, it seemed like the reports could hardly get through. I understand that sensations should find their way to the consumers, but journalistic integrity requires equal treatment of information concerning facts and correction of information if it is untrue. But it would be best not to deal with untrue information at all. [end recording]
