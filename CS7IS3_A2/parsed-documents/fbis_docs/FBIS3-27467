Liu Jianjun, Wang Wenzhi, Li Wansen, Li Suanlao, Gao Baguang, and Yang Heping, who were guilty of stealing, are all peasants. From August 1989 to April 1990, these persons committed crimes alone or in a group on 54 occasions. They broke into the warehouses of 47 residences, taking seven motorcycles, seven bicycles, and a large quantity of articles for daily use, including sheep, flour, rice, and clothes, totaling over 52,900 yuan. Of these cases, 45 cases were committed by Liu Jianjun independently or jointly, and stolen money and property came to a total of 51,100 yuan. Cao Yukuan, who committed intentional murder, was a temporary worker at the Hohhot City Construction Engineering Corporation. On the night of 19 July 1993, Cao Yukuan, in collusion with another criminal, Guo Yongdong, attempted to seek revenge by killing the manager of the corporation, named Shi. Carrying military bayonets, these two criminals went to Manager Shi's house. Seeing that Manager Shi was not at home, they broke into the warehouse to stab the daughter to death, with over 10 stabs to her chest, stomach, and legs. They also stabbed and wounded Shi's wife named Guo and a neighbor by the name of Shi, who rushed to the scene to save Shi's daughter after hearing her cries for help. Upon pronouncement of the court decision in the first ruling of the Hohhot City Intermediate People's Court, the accused refused to accept the referee's ruling and lodged an appeal. In the second ruling by the regional higher people's court, the appeal was rejected, and the first court's decision was upheld. An additional 22 criminals were respectively sentenced on 26 January to death with a two-year reprieve or to life imprisonment.
