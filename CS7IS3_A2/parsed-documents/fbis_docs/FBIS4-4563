This was finalized during the recent Japan-ROK summit talks. ROK companies will be allowed to participate in the multimedia experiments at the Kansai culture and science town, the preparations for which are being conducted under the initiative of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT], and experiments on a link-up with the ROK will be undertaken. While the private sector has taken the lead in the information superhighway program in the United States, Japan and the ROK chose to conduct their program under government guidance. South Korea is working on a next-generation communications network with the installation of optical fibers and other equipment, dividing the period from 1994 to 2015 into three phases. It plans to build a main state communications network, linking mostly public institutions, and a public communications network linking South Korean homes. The ROK expressed interest in a briefing from Japan on the information network experiments at the regular Japan-ROK telecommunications consultations last October. President Kim Yong-sam formally asked for Japan's cooperation during his Tokyo visit at the summit talks on 26 March. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa basically agreed to the request; he stressed the importance of an international communications network linking Tokyo, Seoul, and other cities. South Korea expressed its desire to participate in the "new generation communications network pilot model project" combining communications and broadcasting going on at the Kansai science town. The MOPT accepted the request. The project calls for installation of an optical fiber network in private homes in the science town to conduct experiments on "video on demand"--providing video programs whenever the consumers want them--and television shopping services, which will start in July. This communications network will now be linked with South Korean companies and private homes to experiment with international communications. If the experiments are successful, the two countries may cooperate in developing new applications for multimedia, such as remote medical treatment, or working at home. Right now, a total of around 100 companies are participating in this project, including the British communications company Cable and Wireless, Canadian communications equipment maker Northern Telecom, and another foreign company. Asian companies are yet to take part in the program. As a result of the bilateral cooperation agreement, Korean Telecommunications (KT) and electric machinery makers of the major business conglomerates are expected to participate in the Kansai science town experiments.
