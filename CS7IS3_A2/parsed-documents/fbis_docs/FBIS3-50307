The meeting was also attended by Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys, President's Office Head Lubos Dobrovsky told journalists. Havel and Kolodziejczyk agreed that the approach of the Czech Republic and Poland towards the U.S. Partnership for Peace plan was very close and in many points fully identical, he said.

Baudys described Kolodziejczyk's visit as the beginning of a broad cooperation between the two countries' armies and defense ministries and as the starting point of realizing the necessity of a dynamic approach towards the Partnership for Peace project.
