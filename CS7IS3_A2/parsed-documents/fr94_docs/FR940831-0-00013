FR940831-0-00013 FR940831-0-00006 Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ADDRESSES. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;07.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing Amendment 39&hyph;8972, (59 FR 36930, July 20, 1994), and by adding a new airworthiness directive, Amendment 39&hyph;9011, to read as follows: 94&hyph;17&hyph;16 ␣General Electric Aircraft Engines: Amendment 39&hyph;9011. Docket 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;07. Supersedes AD 94&hyph;15&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8972. Applicability: General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) Models CT7&hyph;5A2, &hyph;5A3, &hyph;7A, &hyph;7A1, &hyph;9B, &hyph;9B1, &hyph;9B2, &hyph;9C, &hyph;9D turboprop engines, with propeller gearboxes listed by serial number in GEAE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) Service Bulletin (SB) No. A72&hyph;350, Revision 3, dated June 8, 1994. These engines are installed on but not limited to Construcciones Aeronauticas, SA (CASA) and Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) CN&hyph;235 series and SAAB Aircraft S340 series aircraft. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the propeller shaft, which can result in separation of the propeller from the propeller shaft and possible damage to the aircraft, accomplish the following: (a) Perform a one-time ultrasonic inspection of the propeller shaft flange outer diameter (OD) fillet radius and inner diameter (ID) bore for subsurface metallurgical defects, and replace defective propeller shafts with serviceable parts, at the next shop visit after the effective date of this AD, or prior to October 31, 1994, whichever occurs first. Perform the ultrasonic inspection, and replace defective propeller shafts with serviceable parts, in accordance with GEAE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) SB No. A72&hyph;350, Revision 3, dated June 8, 1994, on propeller shafts listed by propeller gearbox serial number (S/N) in Table 2 of that SB. (b) At the next shop visit after the effective date of this AD, or prior to October 31, 1994, whichever occurs first, perform a one-time borescope inspection to identify all markings on the propeller shaft, in accordance with GEAE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) SB No. A72&hyph;350, Revision 3, dated June 8, 1994, on propeller shafts listed by propeller gearbox S/N in Table 3 of that SB; and proceed as follows: (1) For those propeller shafts that are determined to be suspect, perform a one-time ultrasonic inspection, and replace defective propeller shafts with serviceable parts, at the next shop visit after the borescope inspection required by paragraph (b) of this AD, or October 31, 1994, whichever occurs first, in accordance with the Accomplishment Instructions of GEAE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) SB No. A72&hyph;350, Revision 3, dated June 8, 1994. (2) For those propeller shafts that are determined not to be suspect, no further action is required. (c) For the purpose of this AD, a shop visit is defined as the induction of the propeller gearbox into the overhaul shop for maintenance. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Engine Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Engine Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Engine Certification Office. (e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the aircraft to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (f) The inspections, and replacement shall be done in accordance with the following service documents: ␣ 1Document No. 1Pages 1Revision 1Date GEAE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) SB No. A72&hyph;350 1&hyph;40 3 June 8, 1994.
