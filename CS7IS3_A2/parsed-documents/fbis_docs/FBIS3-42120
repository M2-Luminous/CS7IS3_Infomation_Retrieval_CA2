I was surely not the only one to think so on learning that the Russian and U.S. presidents had announced the detargeting of strategic missiles in the Moscow declaration. "For the first time since the beginning of the nuclear era our countries have stopped targeting missiles at each other," Major General Anatoliy Svetikov, deputy chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces Staff Directorate, believes. [passage omitted] Yet the past is still with us. The following questions have arisen from there, from the alarming past: Is the retargeting of missiles and their return to their former condition possible and how long would this take? Let us allow the specialist, Maj. Gen. Svetikov, to speak: "The process of introducing and scrapping missions operates on many levels and planes. It varies for different categories and types of missile. The scrapping of missions will depend on the principle chosen by the two countries' presidents. As regards resumption, I can say that as long as a missile is on alert status there is always a possibility of returning everything to its former place. How long will this take? Long enough, although the times vary for different categories and types of missile. I do not intend to talk about time periods but have singled out the most important thing: the implementation of the presidents' decision sharply reduces the threshold of a nuclear strike." How nice it would be to put a period after such an optimistic conclusion and to exclaim joyfully "The End!" Alas, there is still a long way to go before the end; dreams about a complete ban on nuclear weapons still remain dreams. The nuclear danger comes not from across the ocean but from Russia's doorstep -- Ukraine. Its president pledged to transport nuclear warheads to us for dismantling. But some of them are already in a critical condition. Yet again we have to talk of the unreasonableness of certain vociferous politicians. Specialists, foreseeing the complexities with missiles, made an agreement about centralized maintenance of them. But some Ukrainian deputies saw Moscow's evil hand in this too. The agreements, which did not need parliament's ratification, were blocked by it. We, they said, will overcome. But how can routine inspection and maintenance work and the maintenance of missile complexes be undertaken when there are not enough resources or specialists? The result of the deputies' veto is the alarming technical condition of missiles in Ukraine. Following inspection, warheads were removed from some missile launchers which had simply become dangerous. Hamlet's question has now crystallized over these missile silos. How will people answer it?
