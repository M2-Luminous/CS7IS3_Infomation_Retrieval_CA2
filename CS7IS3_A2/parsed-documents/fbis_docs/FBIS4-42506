CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] politicians have agreed to petition Interior Minister Kanther to check whether the conduct of the Republikaner conforms to the Constitution. Nevertheless, calls for a ban on the Republikaner are controversial. Rudolf Krause, chairman of the Republikaner in Saxony-Anhalt, refuses to accept his party's exclusion. An objection can only be considered after the elections. Should the objection be granted, the election result would have to be declared void. At a meeting on Wednesday [1 June], the Landtag Election Committee of Saxony-Anhalt decided by four votes to three to exclude the Republikaner from the elections. The reason it gave was irregular procedures when formulating the election list. Several Republikaner members had complained about the fact that the choice of Halle as location for the party's candidate nomination congress in March had been kept secret, as a result of which they could not attend this congress. Even so, Paul-Uwe Soeker, election manager for Saxony-Anhalt, recommended that the Republikaner be permitted to run in the elections, saying that similar procedures for drawing up election lists had been approved in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. Rudolf Krause, land chairman of the Republikaner, described his party's exclusion as a "dagger thrust against democracy" and announced judicial measures. Soeker said on Thursday evening that he would ask the Landtag Election Committee to reconsider its decision. Meanwhile, there were increasing calls from the Bonn factions to deal with the Republikaner more harshly. Horst Eylmann (CDU), head of the Bundestag Legal Committee, said he has serious doubts whether the Repubikaner are a democratic party. Eylmann referred to the latest resignations and accusations among the party leadership, as well as the findings of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV]. If it transpires that the Republikaner have tolerated acts of violence or even actively supported them, that will be the right time to file an application to ban the party, said Eylmann. Ulrich Maier, the man responsible for domestic policy among SPD chancellor candidate Rudolf Scharping's election staff, said that placing the Republikaner in the category of a right-wing extremist party is long overdue. Party chairman Schoenhuber's image is "similar that to the National Socialist Democratic Workers' Party," said Maurer. Nevertheless, he opposed a ban on the party because the necessary process might take many years. Johannes Gerster, acting chairman of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group, also said that a ban would make little sense. A lot of time would pass before the Constitutional Court decided to impose a ban, and until then the Republikaner might develop an image as martyrs. SPD politician Peter Glotz said that a ban might be legally possible, but would not serve anyone's interests. Both Gerster and Glotz said that the Repubikaner should be combated by political means. According to the BfV, there is a "series of legally valid criteria" suggesting that the Republikaner are developing into a extremist right-wing party. Ernst Uhrlau, chief of the Hamburg BFV, said in SAARLAENDISCHER RUNDFUNK that the Republikaner had expressed "subdued pleasure" with acts of violence, particularly in 1991 and 1992. "A hatred of foreigners and anti-Semitism are expressed quite openly and extolled in smaller circles," he said. "The Republikaner and other right-wing extremist groups consider themselves a national political camp." Republikaner chief Franz Schoenhuber denied that he had called for a "hunt to seek out and destroy fractious party members." This accusation had been expressed by Udo Boesch, head of the Republikaner federal organization, who quit this week. Boesch spoke of threats against his person and against Martina Rosenberger, federal secretary of the party, who also quit this week. Both Boesch and Rosenberger attribute their resignations to the Republikaner's increasingly extremist way of thinking and to Schoenhuber's dictatorial style of leadership.
