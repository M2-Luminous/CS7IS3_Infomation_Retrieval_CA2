Your presence is urgently required at the Cuscatanzingo Municipal Electoral Board. We have reports that riots have just broken out. Go ahead, Cuscatanzingo. [Iraheta] We have had some problems here following the conclusion of the final vote count for this municipality. The Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] won 46 of the 49 ballot boxes. [Beltran] Do you have a total vote count? [Iraheta] No, we do not have a total vote count. The problem occurred as we left the voting station. We were attacked by the hordes of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN]. [Beltran] What happened? [Iraheta] A girl received a serious blow to the head. [Beltran] Do you need an ambulance to move her? [Iraheta] She has already been taken to the hospital. Her name is Maria Victoria Santos Garcia. [Beltran] Maria Victoria Santos Garcia. How old is she? [Iraheta] I do not know. Three other party members were attacked after that. Somebody shot at them with some kind of short weapon. Fortunately they were not hit, but it was still a precarious moment for them. We would like to call on the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] and the FMLN to remember that democracy prevails now. Acts of violence and repression are things of the past. We wish to call on these people to truly join the democratic process by accepting ARENA's nationwide victory. Thank you. [Beltran] Thank you for your report.
