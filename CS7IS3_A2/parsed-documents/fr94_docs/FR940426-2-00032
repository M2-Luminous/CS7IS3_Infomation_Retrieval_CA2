FR940426-2-00032 FR940426-2-00019 [Docket Nos. CP90&hyph;454&hyph;004 and MT94&hyph;3&hyph;000] Midwest Gas Storage Inc.; Revised Initial Tariff Filing April 14, 1994. Take notice that on April 8, 1994, Midwest Gas Storage Inc. (Midwest), 13100 Southwest Highway, Palos Park, Illinois 60464, filed in Docket Nos. CP90&hyph;454&hyph;004 and MT94&hyph;3&hyph;000 a First Revised Volume No. 1 of its FERC Gas Tariff, with a proposed effective date of May 15, 1994. In its revised tariff, Midwest proposes to convert its tariff from a volumetric basis to a thermal basis and incorporates the Commission's Order No. 497 tariff requirements to reflect a new marketing affiliate, Midwest Gas Services, Inc. Midwest states that the new marketing affiliate will provide interested persons with gas that is stored in Midwest's facilities. Midwest states that in addition to the 6-month waiver to implement its electronic bulletin board previously requested in Docket No. CP90&hyph;454&hyph;002, Midwest requests approval to implement on an interim basis, a Telephone Bulletin Board, which Midwest indicates is similar to that of Tarpon Transmission Company and Louisiana-Nevada Transit Company. In addition, Midwest requests waiver of the flexible receipt and delivery point requirement because it is anticipated that nearly 100 percent of Midwest's storage activity will take place through only one point: the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company/Midwest interconnection. Any person desiring to be heard or protest the subject filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure: 18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214. All such motions and protests should be filed on or before April 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the parties. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and available for public inspection. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10044 Filed 4&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
