Following the decision by the Council of State--which is unconvinced by the president's explanations on the issue--a copy of which was sent to the Chamber of Representatives Commission to Investigate Charges and to the Attorney General's Office, the Presidential Palace issued the following declaration: 1. The Council of State, by saying the government's explanations government are unconvincing, has adopted an interpretation contrary to the traditional interpretation that has prevailed in the nation for the past 45 years. 2. Therefore, points 1,2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Council of State statement on the absence of permission from the Senate or a decision from the very council are the consequence of this new interpretation. Neither Senate permission nor a Council of State decision was requested, because it is considered we are dealing with international treaties that do not so require. 3. The government does not believe the president of the Republic has violated the letter or spirit of the Constitution. 4. The government has delivered to the media a copy of the letter the president of the Republic has sent to the Council of State in which the government cites what it considers a correct interpretation of the Constitution on the issue. 5. What the Constitution seeks to establish is a procedure for granting permits for the transit of foreign troops that have intentions of war against third nations. It does not seek whatsoever to regulate joint training operations, high-tech operations, equipment maintenance, or technical assistance that are part of international treaties in force. 6. The acceptance of the legal interpretation of the Council of State would end military-technical cooperation between Colombia and other nations, particularly cooperation on which Colombia has insisted so much in its struggle against drug-trafficking cartels. 7. Despite the Council of State's statement, this does not have a bearing on the validity of international treaties signed by Colombia, nor does it constitute a ruling or a sentence regarding the government's conduct on the issue. The Narino Presidential Palace declaration concludes by stating President Cesar Gaviria is planning a news conference during which he will once again broach the touchy issue.
