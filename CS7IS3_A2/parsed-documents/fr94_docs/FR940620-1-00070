The specific software or documentation in which the Government must own or control copyright must be identified in a special contract requirement. (b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in the computer software or computer software documentation delivered as a special work under the clause at 252.227&hyph;7020, the contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that software or documentation.

(c) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7020 does not permit a contractor to incorporate into a special work any work copyrighted by others unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer's permission to do so and obtains for the Government a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works, to perform or display any portion of that work, and to permit others to do so for government purposes. Grant permission only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party work is included in the deliverable work.
