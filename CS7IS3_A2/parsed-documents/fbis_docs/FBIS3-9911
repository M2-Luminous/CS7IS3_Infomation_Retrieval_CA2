This is supported by the actions we have carried out with the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari...." ARIC called the EZLN's armed revolt an event that would threaten security, increase anguish, and impede the attainment of justice. It also called on peasants in the region to reject violence. The advertisement, which was also signed by two regional peasant groups, was, in essence, a declaration of war on the EZLN. Strangely, however, the published advertisement did not include the names of all of the directors of the relevant organizations -- obviously, they were not in the union offices at the time -- although all of these organizations have a long tradition of consulting one another before making important decisions. Actually, the advertisement was planned and written in a government office, and its objective was to "isolate" the Indian rebellion and present it to the public as an initiative that lacked regional consensus. Although, the federal government ultimately had enough insight not to continue publishing similar ads, the damage had already been done. The long-standing problem between the two political forces that work in the same territory -- those sympathetic to the EZLN and part of ARIC's directors and advisers -- was made public. Very quickly, however, the EZLN was able to prove to the nation that its decision to go to war had ample support in the communities where it operated and that it was a political-military force formed by Indians from various tribes. As if this were not enough, the vast majority of the organizations in the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC) of Chiapas [Consejo Estatal de Organizaciones Indigenas y Campesinas (CEOIC) de Chiapas] decided to support the Zapatist struggle. In turn, positions like the one initially adopted by the ARIC directorate are now viewed as being virtually isolated. In the same geographic and social arenas in which the ARIC directorate and the EZLN currently operate, other forces with less conspicuous political profiles exist -- for example, the UGOCP [General Union of Workers and Peasants of Mexico], the CNC [National Peasant Confederation], the CIOAC [Independent Federation of Agricultural Workers and Peasants], and so on. Actually, whether with or without intending to do so, the EZLN current penetrated the rank-and-file of these organizations and won them over to its cause. The history of the Federation of Unions, as that of any peasant organization subjected to the harassment of its natural enemies and the state government, is far from idyllic. After growing and becoming the most important autonomous organization in terms of numbers in Chiapas State, it has suffered from a painful split by those who have built credit unions and decided to postpone the struggle for land. It suffered from an inefficient and corrupt board of directors, which was finally dismissed. It had to face the departure of a series of leaders and ejido [a form of land tenure] unions, who without completely giving up their organization have decided to operate outside the organization. After suffering from the separation of the ejido unions, it faced the worst experiences in coffee marketing amid a somewhat severe criticism of bureaucratism. It finally saw how in its ranks the young and old became increasingly tired of getting scant practical results via peaceful means and decided to resort to the use of weapons. In sum, it saw how its initial project crumbled while totally different political positions were being adopted inside the organization. Even though it cannot be said all the communities and all the individuals of the region are behind the EZLN (has there ever been a social movement in which this has occurred?), it is evident the call for an armed struggle succeeded, which does not mean all the ARIC rank and file supported the EZLN. The number of troops mobilized by the Zapatists during the occupation of municipal capitals and the nearby towns on 1 January is evidence of that. After the unfortunate initial deployment of troops, the ARIC Board of Directors called for a political solution to the conflict, a respect for the people and belongings of those who do not believe in the armed solution, a return home, freedom of movement, and peace with justice. Meanwhile, the EZLN thought certain ARIC leaders and advisers had betrayed them and had become instruments of the government. A significant number of organizations of the CEOIC believes ARIC seeks an isolation of the Zapatists. Some 500 people, under ARIC's influence, participated in a pilgrimage on 20 February for "peace, reconciliation, and respect for human rights." Organization leaders did not attend. According to news reports, calls of vivas for the EZLN were heard during the event. The demands made during the pilgrimage were published in at least two national newspapers a day later. Even though the event was given a religious tone locally, at a national level it appeared as part of a broader campaign aimed at showing there are other means of struggle in the conflict area. In fact, the initiative seems to be the result of a broader proposal: to make ARIC appear as a third force in the conflict and to include it in the negotiations. The accusations the EZLN has made against certain ARIC leaders, which it called traitors, seem unjustified. To accuse someone of treason in a situation of war is very serious. Certainly, among ARIC leaders there are probably former EZLN members who did not want to join the armed struggle. That does not make them informers, however. The purge of political forces is a natural process in every institution, and it can hardly be resolved by settling scores. Certain ARIC advisers have explicitly declared, even if they do not share the armed struggle, they are far from accusing those who have taken that path. The EZLN's accusation can work against it. A provocation by any person affected by the current rebellion against an ARIC member will be presented to public scrutiny as a Zapatist aggression. The ARIC leadership must state, however, its initiative to present itself as a third party in disagreement; first, because there are more people in its situation; second, because ARIC has the doors of negotiation open to its demands equally or more than the rest of the state's peasant organizations, individually or through the CEOIC; third, because the other negotiation, that of war or peace, is held between the EZLN and the peace commissioner, and ARIC is not a party in this phase of the process. Just as a strike is negotiated between those who declare it and the boss--and not between those who oppose it--peace is discussed with those who have declared war. There is no third force in disagreement here, rather, a mediator who has been named and accepted by the parties. If given the EZLN postulate of "everything for all..." the ARIC leadership sets first its presence in the territory of conflict; it will see its prestige before public opinion deteriorate more than it already has. The Union of Ejidos of the Jungle and the EZLN have named their corresponding "commissioners for peace" and have begun to negotiate the path to reconciliation from below. Other segments within ARIC seem to have undertaken a similar path. The fact is significant and encouraging, but it is not enough. In a context in which a national agenda much broader than that of four municipalities is being negotiated, the ARIC leadership is faced with the dilemma of endorsing this process or appearing at best, despite its statements, as victim of a narrow vision of its past and interests and, at worst, as an instrument of the counterinsurgency.
