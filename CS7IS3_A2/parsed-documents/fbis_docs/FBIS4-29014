In an interview with the three major televisions in Seoul, the premier said that at the moment there is no sign of provocation or any unusual military movement in North Korea. The prime minister said the fire power of the South Korean and U.S. Forces are enormous and the two countries maintain a close cooperative system. "Today's civil defense drill was to check our security preparedness but the drill was not due to any growing danger of war," he said. The premier observed that North Korea seems trying to apply some shock therapies like the withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency. "But, the strategy does not go the way they wish," he added.
