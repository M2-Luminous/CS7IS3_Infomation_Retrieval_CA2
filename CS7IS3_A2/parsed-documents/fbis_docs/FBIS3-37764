Invited by the City Council of the "Vyasna `94" Association [Spring], the former legislative speaker visited Homel and had three meetings here -- with activists of democratic parties and movements, with "Homselmash" plant workers, and with broad circles of the public. The meetings evoked so much interest that the audience spilled from the room over to the hallways. By the way, Mr. Shushkevich did not come all by himself. He was accompanied by the deputy from Homel Aleskandr Sasnow, head of the legislative standing commission, and Aleksandr Dabravolski, leader of the United Democratic Party of Belarus. It stands to reason that the current political and economic situation of Belarus was the focus of their attention. It is worsening, and people should not be deceived about this. Meanwhile, the old Constitution, after its Article 6 about the leading role of the Communist Party has been removed, specifies no one to control operations of the government. It has been three years since the Kebich government went from one extreme to another -- to no effect, though. It even does not allow "its own" newspapers to criticize it. This is easy to explain -- it is not capable of governing, it can only execute someone else's instructions. To corroborate his point, Stanislav Shushkevich brought up three facts. Although Belarus declared its sovereignty, it now faces the question of abandoning it. Although a market transition program was adopted some time ago, it is practically dead now. Was the government brought to account for those failures? Of course, not. By giving good positions to many deputies, titles, and convenient land plots for houses, the Kebich government formed a virtually unsinkable pro-government lobby in the Supreme Soviet from the old nomenklatura. This lobby drags its feet on adopting a new constitution and many other things. In this situation, S. Shushkevich thinks that the democratic parties and movements should rally around the idea of building Belarusian sovereignty, democracy, market economy, and force the Supreme Soviet to keep to its declaration on calling early elections this spring. This will enable a whole range of urgent problems, including that of the government, to be resolved as soon as possible. In the opinion of Stanislav Shushkevich, people can determine on their own who to vote for and whom to entrust with their lives over the next five years. It was the demand for immediate legislative elections that moved Mr. Shushkevich closer to the "Vyasna `94" bloc, even though the former speaker has no intention so far of joining any particular party. Also, his answers show that he does not intend to establish his own party, either. So, this man will probably play a coordinating role in the democratic camp, which no one has played well so far. This is why Stanislav Shushkevich once said that he mastered another profession over the past three years -- that of a politician. He proved that in Homel -- and not only through a deep and comprehensive understanding of the situation and witty answers that now and then made the audience burst into applause. The most important thing is that he does not look defeated. During one meeting, he artistically brought to nothing attempts by several dozens of political hacks to obstruct the dialog. I believe that many from the audience felt and realized that it is too early for Shushkevich to leave big politics. And as many, it turned out, are ready to give their votes to that politician with high integrity. Ridiculous accusations of misconduct just would not stick to him. P.S. As we have just learned, Stanislav Shushkevich was invited to visit Baranovichi, Borisov, Orsha, and other cities of the Republic.
