FR941013-1-00009 FR941013-1-00003 This condition, if not detected and corrected, could result in the inability to open the passenger/crew door and possible passenger injury if emergency evacuation was needed. Jetstream Aircraft Limited has issued Service Bulletin 52&hyph;A&hyph;JA 930901, Revision 1, dated February 11, 1994, which specifies procedures for inspecting and replacing the passenger/crew internal door handle mounting platform structure on JAL HP137 Mk1, Jetstream series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. The CAA classifying a service bulletin as mandatory in the United Kingdom is equivalent to the FAA issuing an airworthiness directive in the United States. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other JAL HP137 Mk1, Jetstream series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the passenger/crew cabin door handle mounting platform structure for cracks, and, if found cracked, replacing with a structure of improved design as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with the service information described above. The FAA estimates that 165 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1 workhour per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,800. This figure does not take into account any possible passenger/crew door internal handle mounting platform structure replacements nor repetitive inspections. The FAA has no way of determining how many of these structures may have cracks or the number of repetitive inspections each owner/operator may incur. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding a new AD to read as follows: Jetstream Aircraft Limited: Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;16&hyph;AD. Applicability: HP137 Mk1, Jetstream Series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category. Compliance: Required upon the accumulation of 1,800 hours TIS or within the next 100 hours time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, unless already accomplished, and thereafter as indicated. To prevent the inability to open the passenger/crew door because of cracked internal handle mounting platform structure, which could result in passenger injury if emergency evacuation was needed, accomplish the following:
