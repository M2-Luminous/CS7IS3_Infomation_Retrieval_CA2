FBIS3-14665 "drnes061ff_94001" FBIS-NES-94-061 Document Type:Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 South Asian Regional Affairs Indian, Pakistani Reaction to Kashmir Vote Noted BK2503122994 BK2503122994 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Both India and Pakistan claimed victory after the deliberations at the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Commission on the Pakistani resolution on human rights violations in Kashmir. Pakistan withdrew the resolution hours before it was due for a vote on 9 March after high-level contacts between Pakistan, China and Iran and an appeal by the delegates of developing countries for its withdrawal. While Indian officials were euphoric in claiming "stunning diplomatic victory" for the "unconditional withdrawal" of the resolution, which they say has now "lapsed," Pakistani officials were adamant that the resolution has only been "deferred" after what it described as "singular diplomatic victory" after India came under international pressure to allow a fact-finding delegation from Muslim countries to visit Kashmir. While the Indian press was near unanimous in hailing the outcome as vindication of the Indian position that the Kashmir issue could only be solved bilaterally, and in predicting increasing domestic political pressure on Bhutto for her "Geneva rebuff", reaction from Pakistani media was mixed, with some papers even going to the extent of describing it as a "loss of face" for Pakistan. Within hours of the Geneva vote, Delhi All India Radio in English at 0245 GMT on 10 March described it in its news bulletin as "vindication of India's principled stand" and broadcast a statement by External Affairs Minister Dinesh Singh. Singh thanked China and Iran for "prevailing upon Pakistan to withdraw the resolution." He also expressed the hope that "Pakistan will now be ready for bilateral talks under the Simla Agreement and desist from misleading the international community through false allegations of violations of human rights in India." A radio commentary that morning urged Pakistan to "accept defeat." The commentary said: "Will Pakistan learn a lesson from the humiliation it suffered in Geneva? The outcome of the conference shows that while rhetoric as resorted to by the Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, may sound fine, it does not yield results. India believes in peaceful coexistence with its neighbors and has consistently reiterated its commitment to bilateral dialogue. Hopefully, Pakistan -- having traversed the path of defeat -- will now realize that there is no substitute for peace, truth and honesty." In its prime-time 1530 GMT news bulletin on 10 March, Delhi Radio broadcast Foreign Secretary Srinivasan's statement. The statement affirmed that "Pakistan's withdrawal of the resolution is unconditional and there is no question of linking it with sending of a fact-finding mission to Kashmir." At the same time, Srinivasan ruled out Iranian mediation on Kashmir. In its 1230 GMT and 1530 GMT bulletins on 10 March, Delhi Radio reported the reaction of Indian political parties. The ruling Congress-I Party described the development as "a diplomatic success for India as Pakistan found itself totally isolated in the international community." The statement added: "The clear message to Pakistan from Geneva is that it must go back to the Simla pact." The Communist Party of India hoped "good sense will prevail on the Pakistan Government now that it has withdrawn its resolution at the UN Commission on Human Rights at Geneva. Pakistan should make an honest effort to solve it within the framework of the Simla Agreement." The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, while hailing the outcome, urged the government "to take firm action to curb the militancy in Kashmir." BJP leader Atal Behari Vajpayee wanted "consolidation of the gains of Geneva vote by taking concrete steps to restore normalcy in the Kashmir valley." The Communist Party of India-Marxist, while expressing satisfaction, called on the government "to find a political solution of the Kashmir issue." The Indian press was unanimous in praising what it described as Pakistan's "failure" and the "rebuff" it received. It also contended that the Geneva failure may create domestic political pressure for Benazir Bhutto. The anti-establishment INDIAN EXPRESS said in the editorial "Returns From a Hard Line" on 11 March: "Islamabad is trying hard to cover up its debacle at the UN Human Rights Commission session by claiming that its purpose of internationalizing the Kashmir issue has been amply served. Why does it imagine that the chancelleries around the world are not already fully aware of the Kashmir dispute after three full-scale wars and four years of low intensity proxy conflict? In point of fact, the ridiculous strategy of internationalizing Kashmir has more to do with internal pressures of successive Pakistani regimes than with gaining external support. This is why Benazir Bhutto may well face the most daunting domestic challenge of her career following the Pakistani misadventure in Geneva." An article by HINDUSTAN TIMES columnist M.K. Dhar said: "The rebuff Pakistan suffered at Geneva, where its concerted efforts to internationalize the Kashmir issue failed miserably, deals a severe diplomatic and political blow to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto whose anti-India rhetoric is expected to become more strident in the coming weeks. Having queered the pitch for a showdown with India and having forced to retreat under the impact of adverse international opinion, she has made herself vulnerable to a renewed attack by her political adversaries. She will find her position further weakened, precariously poised as she is as the head of an inherently unstable government." The first Pakistani report came in an Islamabad Radio Pakistan Network Urdu news bulletin at 0200 GMT on 10 March. While announcing the "deferment" of a vote after India agreed to allow Muslim fact-finders to visit Kashmir, the report said: "A three-point package has been worked out out after high-level contacts among Pakistan, Iran and China. Sixteen countries supported the formula." The same news bulletin included Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali's statement saying: "Pakistan has achieved its objective to awaken world opinion about the plight of the Kashmiri people. Despite the deferment of the resolution, the Kashmir issue will be raised at other world forums." The 1100 GMT bulletin that day included Information Minister Khalid Ahmad Khan Kharal's statement echoing the foreign minister's remarks. Kharal said: "Pakistan has not withdrawn the resolution, but it has only been deferred at the intervention of its Chinese and Iranian friends." In its prime-time 1400 GMT bulletin, Pakistan Television in English broadcast a recorded statement by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali defending Pakistan's decision to withdraw the resolution. The statement said: "The package deal is that a resolution has been tabled. It has not been withdrawn. It remains in its original form without any amendment whatsoever, but it has been deferred. So, the Kashmir resolution is now on the world agenda." In its 1500 GMT Urdu bulletin on 10 March, Islamabad Radio referred to Foreign Secretary Sharharyar Khan's statement that India should include the Islamic Conference Organization secretary general in the Muslim delegation allowed to visit Kashmir under the package deal. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's reaction was reported by Islamabad Radio at 0100 GMT on 13 March. Bhutto told foreign correspondents in Islamabad that "Pakistan will now consider presenting a resolution on the issue at the United Nations." On the Geneva vote, Bhutto said: "India had promised us through Iran that it would allow the ambassadors of Islamic countries to visit occupied Kashmir. Fourteen countries expressed concern over the people of Jammu and Kashmir and violation of human rights when the voting on the resolution was deferred." In its 1400 GMT English bulletin on 16 March, Pakistan Television referred to Bhutto's interview with Voice of Germany Radio defending the Pakistani decision to withdraw the resolution. She said: "Voting on the resolution was not important as it is not a game of numbers, rather it is a matter of conscience." State-run media gave scant coverage to reaction by opposition parties not satisfied with the government's explanation. At 0200 GMT on 11 March Islamabad Radio broadcast an under-minute report saying that Nawabzada Nasrulla Khan, chairman of the National Assembly Kashmir Committee, was "not happy with the deferment of the voting on the resolution on Kashmir at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva." The radio said main opposition leaders Mohammad Nawaz Sharif and Maulana Mohammad Ajmal Khan have also "criticized the deferment of the voting on the Pakistan resolution on Kashmir." The press, however, widely published opposition criticism. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Group leader Chaudhary Shujat Hussain described Geneva as a "fiasco" and said "it is a black day in the struggle of Kashmiri people, who are rendering unprecedented sacrifices for their rights and have been stabbed by an unpopular government." Gauhar Ayub Khan, deputy opposition leader in the National Assembly, was more critical, saying "the prime minister should immediately step down as she had brought an embarrassment to Pakistan, which had no parallel in the history of the country." He added the negative vote outcome was due to the "criminal negligence on the part of the government." Mian Shahbaz Sharif, opposition leader in Punjab, condemned the government decision and accused Bhutto of "patronizing" India. He said: "She is not prepared to lose any single opportunity to please India by playing with the national interests of Pakistan, which are in no way dear to her." He appealed to the people to stand up against the "pro-India" government. Editorial reaction was mixed. The pro-government THE PAKISTAN TIMES said in the 11 March editorial "A Successful Move" that "Pakistan has achieved the basic objectives underlying the move" to table the resolution in Geneva. Insisting that Pakistan has succeeded in highlighting the Kashmir situation for the world, it claimed: "Thus, while on the one hand Pakistan has succeeded in putting India on the defensive on the human rights issue in held Kashmir, on the other, it retains the diplomatic initiative in the matter." The Urdu-language Rawalpindi daily JANG published an editorial on 11 March supporting the government move in wake of "pressures from China, Iran and 15 other friendly countries" by saying: "the foreign minister's assertion that by tabling the resolution Pakistan has realized many of its objectives is correct to a great extent." The English-language daily THE NATION, however, took a different view. In the 11 March editorial "Loss of Face in Geneva" it said: "Whether it was an outright foreign policy debacle, as the Opposition would insist, or a tactical retreat dictated by the compulsion of circumstances as is likely to be offered as an alibi by the Foreign Office, Islamabad, to say the least, has been guilty of gross miscalculation in Geneva. And, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be made accountable for misleading the government and the people about the success of our campaign to win the international support." The paper added: "whether we like it or not, New Delhi has scored a major propaganda victory." The Rawalpindi Urdu-language daily NAWAI-I-WAQT said in a 17 March editorial said "This indicates the weakness of the government's foreign policy. The withdrawal of the Pakistani resolution at a time when the United States, United Kingdom and most other countries of the world are acknowledging that Kashmir is a disputed territory, and when they are realizing that serious violation of human rights are being committed in occupied Kashmir, is quite amazing." The Islamabad Urdu-language daily KHABRAIN said in its 11 March editorial: "The decision will also affect the Kashmiri struggle negatively and Kashmiris will be gripped by a feeling of frustration."
