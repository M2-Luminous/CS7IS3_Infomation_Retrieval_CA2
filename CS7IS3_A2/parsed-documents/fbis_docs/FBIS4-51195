Some clauses have been revised in light of the present situation. Now the "Management Methods for Import and Export Commodities Through Border Trade" are issued to you for implementation. Should there be problems in the course of implementation, please report them to the state bureau. Attached are the Management Methods for Import and Export Commodities Through Border Trade. The State Commercial Inspection Bureau of the PRC 22 April 1993 Management Methods for Import and Export Commodities Through Border Trade: Article 1: To develop border trade, strengthen the inspection, assessment, and supervision of import and export commodities, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of all the trading parties, these management methods have been formulated in accordance with the "PRC Inspection Methods for Import and Export Commodities" (hereinafter shortened to the "Inspection Methods") and the "Regulations on Implementing the PRC Inspection Methods for Import and Export Commodities" (hereinafter shortened to the "Implementation Regulations"). Article 2: These management methods are suitable for inspection and management of import and export commodities through small-scale border trade, civilian border trade, joint fair trade on borders, and local trade in border areas. Article 3: Commercial inspection departments' inspection of import and export commodities through border trade covers the following categories of commodities: 1. Import and export commodities which fall under the "list of categories of import and export commodities subject to commercial inspection departments' inspection" as well as import and export commodities which, as law and administrative regulations require, must be submitted to commercial inspection departments for inspection; 2. Carrying out health inspection of export food and quarantine of export animal products; 3. Commodities for which border trade contracts require inspection by commercial inspection departments; 4. Commodities for which foreign trade dealers apply for assessment and inspection. Article 4: Commercial inspection departments may carry out random checks on import and export commodities which are not listed in Clauses 1 to 3 of Article 3. Article 5: When handling applications for inspection of import and export commodities through border trade, commercial inspection departments may treat each case on its merits in light of local border trade characteristics by adopting flexible inspection methods, providing certificates to pass, or completing clearance procedures. Applications for inspection must be accompanied by the relevant contracts or agreements as proof. Article 6: Import and export commodities through local trade in border areas, small-scale border trade, or civilian border trade must be inspected according to the contract provisions if any; if contract provisions are not available or are not clear, inspection should proceed in accordance with the standards of the relevant exporting country. If commodities involve safety and health, inspection should proceed according to the regulations of the relevant importing country. Import commodities below the necessary safety and health standards should be prohibited from entry even if the buyer agrees to accept the commodities. Article 7: Commodities imported with safety quality permits should be handled according to the "Detailed Rules on Importing Commodities Under the Safety Quality License System." Article 8: After a port commercial inspection department receives notice of import commodities' arrival, it should proceed with the inspection of the commodities if inspection at the port is possible. If inspection at the port is not available, the port commercial inspection department should promptly provide a transfer procedural document and notify the port of arrival for inspection of the commodities. Article 9: If a foreign trade dealer applies for the assessment or authorizes the inspection of commodities, the commodities should be assessed or inspected in accordance with the standards set by the foreign trade dealer. Article 10: Commercial inspection departments should, in accordance with the relevant regulations, exercise management over commodities exported with quality licenses and health registration certificates. Border trade operational units should purchase commodities manufactured by factories which have obtained quality licenses or health registration certificates issued by commercial inspection departments, and should submit these licenses or certificates to the commercial inspection departments in the commodities' places of origin. Article 11: Commercial inspection departments may send personnel to inspect, check, assess, and supervise import and export commodities stored in regions under their jurisdiction or to trading sites under their jurisdiction. Article 12: Before export commodities which require commercial inspection certificates are directly transported out of the borders through combined railway transportation, the commercial inspection departments in places where the commodities are dispatched should verify that the commodities are up to standard before issuing such commercial inspection certificates. For export commodities transported through combined transportation facilities other than railways, commercial inspection exchange certificates or release certificates should be issued by the commercial inspection departments in the places of dispatch; and the relevant port commercial inspection departments should examine the exchange certificates and complete the clearance procedures for the export commodities to be transported out of the borders. Commodities which are proved to be below standard cannot be exported. Article 13: After inspection, the relevant commercial inspection departments should stamp the words "border trade" on the certificates issued for export commodities through border trade. The "border trade" stamp will be standardized by the State Commercial Inspection Bureau. Article 14: Violations of these methods are liable to penalties in accordance with the "Inspection Methods" and the "Implementation Regulations." Units or individuals manufacturing or selling counterfeit commodities will be severely dealt with in accordance with Articles 52 and 53 of the "Implementation Regulations." Article 15: Commercial inspection departments will collect charges in accordance with the relevant regulations for the work they have done in inspecting and assessing import and export commodities. Article 16: In light of border trade characteristics and local conditions, commercial inspection departments in border areas may designate the scope of import and export commodities for inspection and formulate methods for exercising inspection and management. Article 17: The State Commercial Inspection Bureau is responsible for explaining these methods. These methods will come into effect on 1 June 1993. The former "Inspection and Management Methods for Import and Export Commodities Through Border Trade (for trial implementation)" promulgated on 1 June 1992 are simultaneously revoked.
