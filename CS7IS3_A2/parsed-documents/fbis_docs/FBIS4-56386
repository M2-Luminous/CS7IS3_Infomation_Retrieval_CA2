FBIS4-56386 "drlat086__s94006" FBIS-LAT-94-086-S Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 MEXICO Reports, Document on Pre-Rebellion Chiapas Reports, Document on Pre-Rebellion Chiapas Bishop Ruiz Testimony 94CA0097F Mexico City PROCESO in Spanish No 904, 28 Feb 94 pp 6, 9-11 94CA0097F Mexico City PROCESO Spanish CSO [Article by Ignacio Ramirez] [Text] The left-wing political groups that came to Chiapas from Torreon took advantage of the religious infrastructure created by the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas and carried on their work in the Highlands and the Lacandon Forest using language that was not only Marxist but atheist as well. They gave rise to the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization (OCEZ). Close to 200 catechizers went into 200 communities to spread the new ideas and set up economic and political organizations. They had already changed their way of thinking. Later came the repression and institutionalized violence. It was in this context that the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) issued its declaration of war. This was, in summary, the account that Bishop Samuel Ruiz gave of the way that the social movement which gave rise to the EZLN was born. He was speaking at the meeting that the members of the Plural Commission of the Standing Committee of the Congress of the Union held in San Cristobal de las Casas on 13 January with bishops from the southern Pacific coast region. The commission had been formed to analyze the events in Chiapas. The members of the commission reported that they held this and other meetings a few days after the outbreak of fighting on 1 January. They did not reveal their substance, however. PROCESO now has a copy of the shorthand version of the talks between lawmakers and bishops. Attending the meeting, among other legislators, were Benjamin Gonzalez Roaro, Jorge Tovar Montanez, Blanca Ruth Esponda, Juan Ramiro Robledo, Jorge Moscoso, Alvaro Salazar, Adolfo Kunz Bolanos, Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi, Jesus Martin del Campo, and Alejandro Encinas. Representing the Ecclesiastic Commission were, in addition to Samuel Ruiz, Felipe Aguirre Franco and Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel, the bishops of Tuxtla Gutierrez and Tapachula respectively; Adolfo Suarez Rivera, the archbishop of Monterrey and president of the Mexican Episcopate; the archbishop of Oaxaca, Hector Gonzalez; the bishop of Coatzacoalcos, Carlos Talavera, and the Dominican bishop, Raul Vera. During the meeting Samuel Ruiz warned of the danger that once peace has been achieved, "if the military takes a military approach, they will observe the subsequent pacification stage in a military way, and there could be a witch hunt. I am not emphasizing anything; I just want to point out this risk." "If we are unable, right now, to see things in a positive light," he added, "if we are going to look at our brothers with prejudice, then obviously we are going to be the first ones to hamper a reconciliation...This requires an attitude of fairness, an attitude of honesty, an attitude of understanding, and an attitude of humaneness, with a change on our part in order to break with the structures that are hurting them." Chiapas is not just the Zapatist National Liberation Army, was the comment at the meeting, during which criticism of all sorts was voiced of the Mexican political system, neoliberal policies, and the FTA, inasmuch as the conflict is not only with the group that has taken up arms "but also has other areas of concern in the different spheres of government and society." Bishop Felipe Arizmendi: "The answer to why all this happened is mainly poverty, exploitation, and injustice...The fact is that the entire economic system in which we live, not just in Mexico but all over the world, the entire neoliberal system of the market economy has to be reassessed, and it has to be a serious reassessment at the level of the world economy, not just nationally and not just in Chiapas. What is happening to us? These mechanisms are forgetting about the poorest people. All this is for the big businessmen, the big power groups. And what about all these people? In general, it is the type of economy that we have in the world, which is not an economy of solidarity, an economy of sharing, of justice. It is an economy of seeing who can make more any way he can. We must not forget this, because if we only take an Alka-Seltzer for the problem and fail to treat it more seriously, sooner or later it is going to explode everywhere." "What do you know about the direction of this armed movement? Is it primarily local, specifically in terms of the top echelon?" PARM [Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution] Deputy Adolfo Kunz Bolanos asked Samuel Ruiz. The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas diocese gave a wide-ranging account of how the social movement that led to the actions of the EZLN was born. The following is a summary of the verbatim transcription of his remarks: That is a difficult question, because I do not know the answer. I am going to say what I know. I will go far back. When I arrived here, I knew that Castro Ruz had gotten training in the Chiapas jungles and that he had even been in Yucatan. This was mentioned there with great admiration. During Echeverria's term there were two guerrilla forces in the jungle: a right-wing guerrilla force, maintained by the left, and a left-wing guerrilla force, maintained by the right. I mention this merely to point out that the situation in the jungle, because it is a jungle, was tense. A favorable moment arose, however, and the situation was gotten under control. There was a pretty strong movement in Torreon, and several agitators were jailed. Bishop Fernando Romo, a friend of mine, was in very close touch with us on occasion. I went there, to Torreon, and marveled at the discipline and organization of the grass-roots forces, which caused quite a serious problem for him that he could find no way to resolve. I saw that organization over there and, seeing the political backwardness of the community, I said here: When will something like that come to Chiapas and raise people's consciousness? Some of the people who were listening just stared at me because I was talking with someone in that movement. "Some day," he told me, but very cynically. Four months later we saw them here. And very soon they started using our infrastructure. They were supposed to give one poor nun some clothing in a package, and it turned out to be outright subversive propaganda. They lied outrageously to us...That situation was exposed. They wanted to take over the entire religious structure, the structure of the catechizing religion. Several members of the communities, particularly catechizers, were "hauled off," and some went voluntarily, with different tendencies. So, at a given moment in some places in the Chol Zone, for example, that movement co-opted several communities and turned the hermitages into barns for growing coffee or storing corn. At the same time, their language was not just Marxist but atheist as well. I was very pained to hear one catechizer say: "I wipe my ass with the Bible." Forgive me for repeating this. But I was terrified at how these people had made a complete turnabout. I also remember hearing the Indians say things like: "We have to begin building a movement, not a political movement but our movement." It was at this point, as far as I can recall, that the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization was born, very near to where we are speaking. So this became more or less well-known and grew in different areas. The southern Pacific coast region looked on when the time came for the political opening to register parties. And the entire southeast area, including Veracruz and this whole section of Oaxaca and Chiapas, saw the extraordinary emergence of a whole array of political positions, despite the cultural and linguistic barriers, because they were a response to longing of the Indians, of the peasants for specific support at that moment, with the growing awareness that their lands had been snatched from them. Their consciousness was raised, and we ourselves are not far removed from a consciousness-raising effort there. Two-hundred catechizers went into 200 communities when this situation arose. The catechizers are the ones who reap the harvest of a community's thinking. Their way of thinking had already changed. Imagine what sort of consciousness-raising the communities were undergoing. Economic and political organizations, ejido associations, internal organizations, and cultural groups too emerged. This is the background to what would be called evangelizing action. It is clear that political decisions and choices were made in the wake of it. I would have been the unhappiest bishop in the world if after 30 years of work there had been no consciousness-raising about the political involvement of the laity. Several other factors had an influence. Another result was the subsequent repression, because there is institutionalized violence: 15,000 Indians starved to death in Chiapas last year; this is institutional violence. Then came repression in the indigenous areas, and a second wave of violence, and finally a desperate counterviolence, which we call violence without remembering that a previous violence caused it. The most recent movement and the repression arose in this context. It was so discreet that four days before it began an Indian brother, a father, came to me and said: "Bishop Ruiz, what is going on? My son always obeys me, but he has taken off on me. He is off to liberation, to freedom." It was so discreet that not even families themselves knew who was in the movement or not. We obviously noticed certain signs. To tell them that what they were thinking was crazy was not possible in historical terms, because desperation is stronger than idleness. We only knew very hypothetically what towns or municipalities they were in. We thought that they were confined to a quite limited area, but in the last few months of the year we got a broader, more alarming picture. As late as 4 November, when this sacred national emblem was presented to me, I submitted to the authorities the latest report by our Human Rights Center, listing all of the awful violations that had been committed up to then. I put it there along with a medal of the Virgin of Guadalupe. We always made this effort, but they operated so discreetly, I repeat, that although we noticed certain signs, we were never able to see that the movement had external leadership, though I think there is some internal leadership as well. But we cannot therefore say: This is the leadership that is responsible for the reasoning that the Indians are doing about their own hunger-stricken conditions. [end of Ruiz remarks] Deputy Jorge Tovar of the PPS then asked whether there had been mass bombardments of the population. Samuel Ruiz replied that he had heard of them from parishioners in several towns: "We do not know how many people died there. We were told of four missing persons in just one community, but I do not know whether they have reappeared. Deputy Blanca Ruth Esponda has told us that we all have to work together to prevent violence. But there is a kind of violence that has nothing to do with the violence of weaponry. It is the other kind of violence, which we have already made a custom, which we have thoroughly accepted, for which we too are to blame: institutionalized violence." Bishop Suarez Rivera spoke up to say that based on Monsignor Ruiz's explanation, the Zapatist movement is made up of people from Chiapas, "but there must also be people from outside Mexico." "Monsignor Ruiz himself was telling us that in the past there were suspicions that Fidel Castro Ruiz himself (laughter)...Ruiz and some other people were here...." Ruiz remarked that people still think that the Indians are mentally retarded: "During the Indian Congress we had to select among 50 candidates who wanted to be translators, all of whom spoke four or five languages besides Spanish. I am giving this background so you know what we are talking about." He reported that 23 percent of the Guatemalans in the refugee camps have relatives or close friends in Chiapas, according to official figures, and that after their first return to their country, 43 percent had become Mexican. "In short, what we have seen so far is that there is a single presence and leadership (the EZLN), represented by Subcommander Marcos. There may be some foreigners, we do not deny this, but we would be getting off the track if we thought that since the word for `hunger' in Tzotzil and Tzeltal is `huinal' and Marxism calls it class struggle, they mean the same thing." In response to a question from PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] Deputy Alvaro Salazar, Samuel Ruiz explained how he came to be the mediator in the armed conflict in Chiapas: "I hastened to give my response because I had already offered to do it. Rigoberta Menchu called me up and said: `Did you hear what happened?' I became alarmed: `What happened?' `Haven't you read LA JORNADA?' `No, it hasn't come yet. It's four in the afternoon. What happened?, tell me,' I asked her anxiously. She said: `Well, there's a communique, a fax, proposing me, you, and Julio Scherer as intermediaries.' So, I then tried to get in touch with Julio. He was not in. I left him a message...I would have liked for us to agree on a joint statement about the situation. Because no one received a direct communique, it seems. They did not ask me in writing to mediate. Therefore, I replied not to what they should have sent but to what appeared in the press, because I reacted to the communique. "When they were here at city hall, it would have been extremely simple, but by the time I offered to mediate, the Zapatists had already left the city. It would have been easy; I was just a few steps away, and communication with the people was extraordinarily good. I gave my sermon on the last day of the year, summarizing the pope's words and talking very vigorously about democracy and peace, without realizing that peace was going to give way to shooting at midnight...." At the meeting with the deputies and senators Bishop Samuel Ruiz also stated that he had definite suspicions ("I think that these suspicions are strongly confirmed") that there was no fighting in several communities "because the people there are Zapatists in their hearts, although they do not belong. Let us consider how bad the conditions are and to what extent the Indians have progressed. How could this have not exploded years ago, don't you think?" He then gave another lengthy explanation of the religious conflict between Catholics and Evangelicals in Chiapas. He said that the problem did not arise just a year or two ago; it has been awaiting a solution for 20 years: "It should be made clear that both Catholics and Evangelicals have been displaced by the caciques, who wear religious masks but obviously have political and financial interests. I have my theory. I could be wrong, but we can see that Chiapas is the political springboard for Mexico's Indian movement." According to Ruiz, the cause of the conflict is the fact that the sects clearly identify those who do not belong to them and have very odd recruitment methods and that some of their members talk about the people whom they fail to recruit with remarks like "they're children of the great harlot," "666, the mark of the beast," and "we're going to burn their little idols on All Saints Day." The reactions have been brutal. "It finally got to the point that we refused to let them into the religious services on the feast of San Juan Chamula. And then they called in pseudo-bishops. They said to us in so many words: We are from the PRI. We have come here to help you. And we are not going to ask you for anything, no requirements like the ones Bishop Samuel Ruiz sets." He said that "other interested parties arrived later. Initially there were 40 people, and later 200, working as spies who followed the Chamulas during their Catholic services and putting their names on a black list. There was a little bit of everything: jailings, torture, killings, taxes, looting, robberies." "Although the number seems exaggerated, there are 25,000 Chamulas living outside their communities, Catholics and Evangelicals, who preferred to stick to their convictions rather than hold onto their belongings. Our Chamula brothers have borne witness to their martyrdom." Samuel Ruiz recalled that the pastoral action of San Cristobal diocese has also been blamed for the lack of unity among indigenous communities. He related the following anecdote, involving the Chamula mayor and an Indian: "Domingo, you have to be patient. You know that things are being taken care of." "We have been patient for 20 years, sir. Right now our patience has not run out on us yet. What we are running out of is room to live." Bishop Gonzalez Martinez said that since the middle of last century the authorities have been encouraging the arrival of [Protestant] religious sects in order to weaken the Catholic Church. "This event has changed Mexico, and we hope that people realize now that in the specific case of Chiapas all sectors must pay attention but also that we have to somehow change the political situation in the state and find common ground among all of the sectors in the state, above all to improve the living conditions of the population," said PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] Deputy Jorge Moscoso. He said that he was convinced that the members of the EZLN "are making a very difficult contribution that is being heavily criticized for its methods but not its causes. No one in this country has denounced the underlying causes of this situation. So then, when all is said and done, this obliges us lawmakers and bishops to get together and create a new framework in the country." PRD Deputy Jesus Martin del Campo explained that the presence of the lawmakers in San Cristobal de las Casas could do much to reinforce the effort and develop a solution that would prevent more Mexicans from dying in this conflict. Bishop Adolfo Suarez: "I would like to emphasize, as Bishop Arizmendi was saying here, that only certain sectors in the state are being protected because they are the ones whose voices can exert the most influence. The most vulnerable sectors, such as the ones that we have found in Chiapas, very specifically the Indian people, have even been excluded from legislation that would more justly acknowledge the value of their cultures, their values, and their contribution to the country." Bishop Carlos Talavera: "Economic democracy, social democracy, and cultural democracy have already been mentioned. It seems to me that if we really want a shift towards democracy, it must happen in all aspects of life. I, for example, ask myself: Why are there caciques? Why? And why can't we do anything about them?" Bishop Raul Vera: "In order to really begin building a more participatory society, which would be the start of a true democracy, in order to really bring about change in Chiapas and throughout the country, we have to make a personal conversion, a change of mind-set, whereby we value the whole individual as an individual, and these individuals themselves can be major players, in their own sphere and with their own resources, to help exalt our country."
