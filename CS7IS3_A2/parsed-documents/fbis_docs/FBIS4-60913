Kruk by correspondent Igor Serebryakov; place and date not given; from the "Aty-Baty" program] [Text] [Serebryakov] As a person who deals directly with the subject, could you tell us whether corruption in the armed forces is increasing or decreasing? [Kruk] It is difficult to talk about the decrease of crime in the military or in society. It continues to grow -- perhaps not at the rate that it did in previous years, but it is increasing. And because the armed forces are part of society, as they used to say, the troubles and hardships taking place in society are transmitted to the armed forces. It is true that the general situation is a negative one, and it continues to worsen in society at large, and this also has a negative effect on the armed forces. Crime is on the increase, and the military procurator's office currently is handling several ongoing investigations against several high-ranking officials on charges of corruption, bribery, unauthorized commercial ties, self-enrichment, and so forth. These cases are about to be publicized. It will be possible to reveal them in the near future, but it is still detrimental to talk about them because of tactical considerations. There are such cases, and we will concentrate on them. We investigated several times more cases like this type last year than during all preceding years. Military procuracy organs are more independent today from any kind of pressure from ministerial departments than ever before. We obey only the prosecutor general and the law, and I do not know of any case in the past few years win which pressure produced any discernible result. [Serebryakov] So what is going on, then? I have recently had an opportunity to tour the hot spots: Stepanakert, Georgia, Abkhazia, and so on. I am a military man myself, and I can clearly distinguish regulation-issue Soviet Army weaponry from that which is not. In all of these wars, hundreds and thousands of people are being killed by weapons which were supplied to both gangs and irregular forces of these republics through informal channels from the depots of the [former] Soviet army. I think that if someone were not selling these weapons illegally, these terrible conflicts on the perimeter of our country would not exist. Young power structures in the process of being formed do not have enough money to buy such weapons, so how did they get there, how did this happen, and who is responsible? [Kruk] The myths and legends claiming that all the gangs and bands, all the warring sides are armed exclusively with military equipment and weapons from the Russian armed forces are unsubstantiated. The thing is, after the USSR collapsed, enormous quantities of equipment and arms remained on the territories of the former republics. Let us remember the weapons depots in Agdam. [Serebryakov] But they belonged to the Soviet army. [Kruk] They later came under the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan, which privatized them. All of this [equipment] is being used for fighting now and will continue to be used for this purpose for a long time to come. Let us cite the situation in Georgia. After the well-known events of 1991 which had to do with Georgia becoming a sovereign state, gangs of every kind had one goal only: to steal anything that was not nailed down. This meant weapons first and foremost, but also equipment, drugs, and other valuables. Let us remember that over 600 armed attacks against Russian units deployed in Georgia took place during 1992-93. The only goal [of these attacks] was capturing arms and equipment. [Serebryakov] The stock at the Agdam depots could not have lasted for more than three months of fighting. So they used it all up in the first three months of the war. But where do they take it from after that? There is only one possibility: One either pumps it in from Iran or from Afghanistan. But I think that it is coming from the north. [Kruk] The Agdam depots are not the only ones of their kind. Moreover, we must not forget that arms arrive at the hot spots not only from Russia but also from neighboring countries, such as Armenia, the Dniestr region, Ukraine, and several others. Let us remember the case, which was scandalous at the time, of the dachas in Krasnogorsk and Domodedovo. The top echelon of the Defense Ministry was accused of accomplishing the illegal privatization of dachas. There was a lot of talk and noise concerning this, and demands for blood from every side. Time passed, the dust settled, all the material is in the courts, suits have been brought, but the cases still have not been settled. But this is not our fault. [Serebryakov] But why? What is the matter? Did the courts fail to adopt a decision, or maybe there are not enough facts? [Kruk] There might be enough facts, but the legal basis is not always appropriate for the situations we encounter today. After all, the situation changes, and what might have been illegal two or three years ago has acquired a legal status today. Everyone still experiences a housing shortage. We are building housing with the help of Germany, Finland, and the Baltic republics. It is a different matter that the housing does not always go to those for whom it is intended. Yes, there are instances of abuses. [Text] [Serebryakov] Are these serious? [Kruk] As long as there are shortages, there will be abuses. There is no avoiding it. This is one of life's axioms. If there is something that has to be divided between people, and if there are more people than there are pieces of cake, someone always will get preferential treatment. [Serebryakov] Is the procurator's office today pursuing cases involving housing matters? [Kruk] There are quite a few. [Serebryakov] Will some conclusions be drawn? [Kruk] Undoubtedly. Extensive reports are being prepared for the defense minister and the government. These questions are raised continuously. Not a quarter goes by.... [Kruk pauses] We present this issue to different levels several times a year. Yes, we take measures to solve certain problems, but new ones crop up. [Serebryakov] If there is some barrier preventing all these corrupt structures from developing, then it must be the military procurator's office first and foremost. How do you publicize your work to the people? [Kruk] An investigator or a team of investigators carry out work regarding a certain person in some region and in a concrete garrison or department. Only those who are connected to this case know about it. Several months usually go by before a case is completed. The unit that this person was serving in is usually informed, the command is notified, and the appropriate information -- to the effect that an investigation of the case established this and that and that the circumstances which made it possible were such and such -- is distributed up to and including the defense minister. A set of measures is proposed to prevent such incidents in the future. It is a different matter that all of this is not always widely publicized. The regional or national public does not know that a certain case has been investigated and that those found guilty were justly punished. I think that this is partially our fault, too, in that we do not address the mass media a lot. It might be because the alliance between the mass media and the investigative organs has not been very productive. Both sides are to blame for this, and correspondents printing such material do not always interpret it correctly. Sometimes there is just talk, slander, and incorrect interpretations, which distort the whole meaning. There is a lot of repercussions and noise.... [Serebryakov, interrupting] Well, they are looking for a sensation, but actually, they just obstruct the case. [Kruk] Or they are trying to dramatize things just for the effect of it. In real life, it is much more prosaic, but they wish for something big and heroic. In practice, everything is much simpler.
