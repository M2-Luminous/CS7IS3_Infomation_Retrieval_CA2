This statement was made yesterday by SDL Chairman Peter Weiss. He described the claim made by Deputy Prime Minister S. Kozlik that P. Weiss and L. Pittner voted intentionally for the draft state budget as a deliberate political lie. "I know that the prime minister waited impatiently for the outcome of the SDL Executive Committee meeting and that he expected me to resign," said Weiss in this context. According to him, differences are beginning to crop up within the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] between those who want to continue democratically to fulfill the HZDS' preelection program and those who, despite their deputy's mandate, also have posts in the state administration and are interested in privatization. Weiss considers the visit to Slovakia by representatives from the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] to be part of the preelection campaign organized by the party, which is trying to ward off the threat of electoral defeat. Weiss announced that L. Fogas (SDL), the leader of the group of National Council of the Slovak Republic deputies in the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, has been elected one of its deputy chairmen.
