He was speaking straight after addressing the Russian people from the Ostankino Television studios. Clinton said Russia could do its part "in two ways - first of all, the Russian military are still one of the best trained and best armed militaries in the world. So, for Russia and the United States to participate means all these other military armies, particularly from the smaller countries, get a chance to do planning, and training, and actual exercises at a much higher level, than they would otherwise. "In other words, it's a big thing. It increases the capacity of their armed forces and their sense of security. "Also, if Russia joins the "Partnership for Peace", one of the conditions for joining is saying, "We promise to be good neighbors. We respect the terrritorial boundaries of all the other countries in the "Partnership for Peace". So it takes away one of the big fears that you hear in some countries or in the Baltics or wherever. [no end quotation mark as received] Responding to a question about what impressions of Russia he will take home, the President said, "I think it's a wonderful country and I have had a wonderful trip. And I think you're going to have a great future. I know this is a tough time, but you'll work through it. You'll figure it out."
