It now transpires that the government firmly insisted on its position in the negotiations, but it did not really support the position on which it insisted. An increasing number of ministers have been expressing themselves in favor of uprooting settlements -- perhaps just Netzarim, but maybe the entire Qatif Bloc. Or at least Qiryat Arba'. Or the heart of Hebron. The name of any minister and deputy minister who respects himself is being noted down these days on one of two fashionable lists: wants to uproot some settlements and neighborhoods, or insists (still) on his opposition to the uprooting of settlements. With a society as transparent as ours, in which every view is immediately aired on one of many radio or television talk shows, there can be no doubt that the PLO has been accurately taking note of those ministers and politicians who likewise think that the Oslo agreement was a mistake and that now is the time to wrest better terms from Israel. It is now clear to all that the entire PLO and half the cabinet want to uproot settlements. Can anybody in Tunisia not seize this one-time opportunity to squeeze concessions out of the hesitant Israeli Government? Anyway, with our active assistance, the PLO scored a big advantage in the negotiations. We are prepared to pursue the talks under any condition or without any condition. The PLO, on the other hand, must be seduced and rewarded every step of the way. While the PLO names its price for returning to the negotiations, we have no price. We will even go for free. And, if the price quoted by the PLO is that we agree to do something that quite a few in our midst are eager to do in any event, why should we fight it and our instincts and not give it what it wants? Of course, we know how dangerous it is to reopen a signed agreement and to agree to amend a key clause. After all, we were the ones who complained that the PLO tends to renege on promises and to define a final agreement as an Israeli draft proposal. In this case, however, the instinct is so strong and the Israeli-PLO affinity is so absolute that we (or at least some of us) believe that we really must heed the adversary's demands, because those demands are merely the fulfillment of a dream that we share. I must confess that I do not quite understand the motives of people for whom the uprooting of a Jewish settlement is not a source of pain and anguish but rather of satisfaction. I find the bizarre ideal of making a town in Eretz Yisra'el off-limits to Jewish residents rather pathological. But I realize that it is perceived as a kind of collective punishment of a large group, as a sort of sanction against Gush Emunim and masses of settlers who have for months been depicted as enemies of the people and as an obstacle to the peace process. They are an obstacle because the presence of Jews in the Palestinian self-rule is perceived as a kind of provocation and can in no way be compared with the presence of hundreds of thousands of Arabs in the Jewish state. I think one must admit that if the idea is collective punishment, it will be very effective if it is expressed in the uprooting of a settlement or a neighborhood. The pain will be acute and genuine, because these people in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza are really attached to their land and truly believe in the right of Jews to settle anywhere in any country in the world, and all the more so in Eretz Yisra'el. They will feel the hurt in their hearts and their faith, and being banished from their homes will be an unbearable pain for them. All this, however, does not make collective punishment fair or just. It is an elementary rule that a person is responsible for his own actions and cannot be held criminally responsible for the actions of his fellow man within a group or a nation. It is utterly inconceivable to banish people not because of something they did but because of something done by someone else who can no longer be reached by the arm of justice. Collective punishment does not require incriminating evidence or mitigating circumstances. It convicts a person because he is a Jew living in a city with a Muslim majority, a settler in the midst of a community hungry for withdrawal, a simple man whose neighbors are both evil and foolish. His indictment and his sentence were both preordained in his identity card. Our forefather Abraham rebelled against collective punishment when he argued with the Lord about the fate of sinning Sodom, in which a handful of righteous men still remained. "Wilt thou indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked?" he asked. Moses and Aaron similarly implored the Lord not to punish Korah and his congregation: "Shall one man sin, and wilt thou be angry with all the congregation?" But all this belongs to the ethics of Hebrew law, and Hebrew law is not all that popular in Israel of 1994. Now we are concerned with calculations: 48 families in Hebron (or 28 in Netzarim) and how many soldiers will be needed to protect them (as if the Israeli Army had any other mission than to protect Jews!) In sum: Collective punishment is wrong and usually ineffective. It is totally absurd when it does not come to serve law and justice but rather political needs or even emotional blackmail (I have a hard time finding a more accurate description of what the Palestinians are hoping to gain from the tragedy in Hebron). It seems to me that even people who totally identify with the PLO's argument that the presence of Jews in a Palestinian city is an obstacle to peace should, like me, hesitate somewhat before deciding that a certain Jew and the members of his household should be banished from Hebron not because of some sin they committed but because they are Jews and, as such, are not wanted there, or because they are settlers and, "as is known," every settler is a potential murderer. This sounds like a complete repeal of all the principles of law and justice, like an untenable injustice, and like trampling on every Jewish right in Eretz Yisra'el. Nonetheless, that is exactly what those ministers and Knesset members who openly side with the PLO's demand to revise the Oslo agreement are demanding, and the first step they envision is complementing the results of the 1929 pogrom in Hebron by expelling the Jews from homes that were looted then and which have only recently come under Jewish ownership again. Jews were expelled from Spain, France, Germany, and England, from countries, provinces, and cities, but never by a Jewish regime and definitely not from the land of the Jews. It is a monstrous, unconscionable, and ungodly thought. The nightmare of a Jewish government banishing Jews from a city in Eretz Yisra'el, of a Jewish army using such a punishment against Jewish citizens, is seen by some people as something desirable, as a goal that should be voiced out loud and promoted. I ask myself: How did they get into such a blind alley of obtuseness and self-hate? How did they become so blind that they do not understand that one of the first victims of their impetuous demand will be the very same peace agreement on which they are pinning all their hopes for their future and ours?
