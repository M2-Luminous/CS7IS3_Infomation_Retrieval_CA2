"The two reactors still in operation are highly dangerous," said IAEA head Hans Blix in an interview with TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA. The reactors should really have been shut down by now, but last fall Ukraine reversed this decision. The reason given was that the country could not afford to do without them. A group of inspectors from the IAEA, a UN agency, visited Chernobyl a few weeks ago, and on Thursday [30 March] IAEA headquarters issued a statement highly critical of the power station. The group found that there was much to be criticized at the nuclear power station. "During the inspection several several shortfalls in the field of safety were discovered at the two units still in operation at the power station," the announcement states. "Trained personnel have left and there is no money for spare parts," Blix said. "I have recently informed Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk that the Chernobyl reactors are completely unsatisfactory from the safety viewpoint," he added. Hans Blix has also offered to arrange a meeting in Vienna to discuss with Ukraine how the safety crisis at Chernobyl can be resolved. According to Thursday's statement form the IAEA in Vienna President Kravchuk has responded positively to the offer. A 70-page report on the visit to Chernobyl by the group of inspectors is being put together, but an IAEA spokesman said that it is still to early to be able to say whether the inspectors' conclusion will be that Chernobyl should be shut down completely. The IAEA's negative criticism of safety at Chernobyl was received with mixed feelings in Ukraine, SVENSKA DAGBLADET's Moscow correspondent reports. "If there were any real danger we would be ordered to shut the installation down. I view this simply as a call that we continue to improve our work in the field of safety," said Mikhail Umanets, the man chiefly responsible for Ukraine's nuclear power industry. But there were other voices which agreed completely with the IAEA's criticism. Valentin Kupnyy, who is responsible for the safety zone around the installation, said that "the quicker the installation is shut down, the better it will be for Ukraine and the country's neighbors." Valentin Kupnyy also said that those who today support the continued exploitation of Chernobyl are more interested in the enormous amounts of money which have already been invested than in safety improvements. "The IAEA did nothing more than note the facts and this is something we have to accept, whether we like it or not," Kupnyy said. There are plans to reopen next year the third reactor, which was damaged by fire in 1991. However, the authorities have still not reached a decision on a new vault around the fourth reactor which caused the 1986 catastrophe. "I have received information that the protective covering that exists today has already begun to crack. We are sitting on a time bomb and a frightful catastrophe could occur," Yuriy Bagrov, the president of the fund to help the victims of Chernobyl, told SVENSKA DAGBLADET during a visit to Kiev a little over a month ago. It was the economic crisis in Ukraine which prompted the authorities -- despite international protests -- to reopen Chernobyl. Ukraine had suddenly been forced to pay world market prices for gas and oil from Russia -- something for which there was not the money. Nuclear power provides 40 percent of Ukraine's electricity supplies and in order to reduce dependence on Russia Ukraine is intending to bring another three new reactors into service over the next 18 months.
