Soon afterward Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, in an interview with SEGODNYA, claimed that there are 2.1 million men in the Russian Army. Literally the next day Defense Minister Pavel Grachev stated at a press conference in the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense that there are 2,341,000 men in the Russian Armed Forces. Such acute discrepancies are today the object of serious analysis by many Russian and foreign military experts. In the main two conclusions can be drawn from the analytical materials: Either Russia's top generals do not know the true state of affairs, or they are deliberately bluffing, misleading both the "enemy" and the authorities so as to extort as much money as possible for military needs. In favor of the latter hypothesis is the fact that CIA Director James Woolsey recently told the U.S. Congress that, according to data compiled by all branches of U.S. intelligence and verified many times over, the numerical strength of the Russian Armed Forces as of the beginning of 1994 stood at 1,554,000 men. Our Military-Industrial Complex Reaches the Republic of South Africa A large group of engineers and designers from the Russian military-industrial complex set off 17 April on a TU-204 aircraft for Johannesberg. The aim of the trip is to participate in the international air show "Aviation Africa 1994." This will be the first time that Russia has been represented on such a large scale in the RSA [Republic of South Africa]: from major defense enterprises to the Tupolev, Beriyev, Mikoyan, and Kamov firms. What, were our weapons in short supply only in the RSA? "Let me stress: The exhibition is a purely civilian affair. We are not taking any military items to the RSA, especially since no one has lifted the corresponding UN embargo," E. Neymark, chief of the Russian Federation Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry Aviation Industry Main Directorate said. "The only real exhibit that we are presenting is the TU-204; the rest are models, artillery boards, and video trailers. We hope that our participation in the air show will promote Russian aviation technology and know-how on the South African market." [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] But aren't you afraid? More than 10 Russians who went to an air show in Chile recently were robbed on the streets, and one was almost shot. [Neymark] You can get shot in Moscow too -- it's no big deal. And anyway, two of our people are already there; they phoned recently: Everything is quiet, the Germans, Americans, and French have confirmed their participation. We will be flying back 26 April, the day before the [South African] elections. [passage omitted] Mission in Beijing M. Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, visited China last week. The aims and results of the visit are shrouded in secrecy. However, according to certain information, in addition to talks on additional arms deliveries, the general tried to dispel Beijing's extreme caution over Russia's signing of the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program, now in preparation, and also over plans to build the "Svobodnyy" Space Center near the Chinese border. Did he manage to reassure the Chinese, and if so, at what price? "Land Reform" in the Ministry of Defense KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA has learned that a major furor has erupted over the publication in a newspaper of the scandal over the "land reform" of Grachev aide General Ivanov. As a result of the reform around 100 land plots intended for officials of the military department's central apparatus have disappeared somewhere. Early on Saturday morning Grachev had a stern talk with Ivanov, after which the Ministry of Defense threw all its efforts into composing a refutation. There is so far no talk of any investigation.
