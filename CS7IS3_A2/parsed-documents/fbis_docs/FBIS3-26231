This means that the proportion of import and export trade of foreign-funded enterprises will rise to about 40 percent of the national total. An official from the general office of the China customs said that exports of foreign-funded enterprises are expected to surpass 34 billion U.S. dollars, up 35 percent on last year, and imports may reach around 62 billion dollars, 50 percent more than in 1993. China approved the establishment of 70,000 foreign-funded enterprises last year, about half the total set up by the end of 1993. These new enterprises will contribute to the projected growth of China's foreign trade, the official said. Figures from the China customs showed that exports by China's foreign-funded companies reached 25.24 billion U.S. dollars last year, an increase of 45.4 percent or 7.88 billion U.S. dollars over 1992, accounting for 27.5 percent of the country's total as against only 20.5 percent in 1992. Imports by these enterprises in 1993 were 41.83 billion U.S. dollars, 58.6 percent or 15.44 billion U.S. dollars more than in the previous year, accounting for 40.2 percent of China's total as against 32.8 percent in the year before.
