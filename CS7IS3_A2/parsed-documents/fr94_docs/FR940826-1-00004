FR940826-1-00004 FR940826-1-00001 Findings and Conclusions The following findings and conclusions on the material issues are based on evidence presented at the hearing and the record thereof: 1. Class II milk price. A proposal to replace the Class II milk price formula with the basic formula price for the second preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.30 should be adopted. Further, this price will be announced by the fifth day of the preceding month. Thus, for example, the Class II price delivered by producers in September would be announced on August 5, and would be the M&hyph;W price for July plus $0.30. Adoption of this proposal will result in the Class II milk price and the Class I milk price being announced at the same time and being applicable for all Federal milk orders. Adoption of this proposal would eliminate the need to retain in Federal milk orders the section providing for the basic Class II formula price. Adoption of this proposal also eliminates the ``add-back'' provision of current Class II pricing where, for a given month, if the Class II price is less than the Class III price for the same month, the difference between these prices are ``added-back'' in computing the second succeeding month's Class II price. For most Federal milk orders, the current Class II milk price is the Minnesota-Wisconsin (M&hyph;W) price for the second preceding month as adjusted by an ``updating'' product price formula (the basic Class II formula price provisions of those orders), plus an amount by which the simple average of the basic formula prices (M&hyph;W prices) for the most recent 12-month period, plus ten cents, exceeds the same 12-month period's average of the basic Class II formula prices. The Class II milk price is announced by the 15th of the previous month. However, if the announced Class II price for a given month is less than the Class III price for the same month, the difference between these prices is ``added-back'' in computing the second succeeding month's Class II price. This feature is often referred to as the ``add-back'' provision. The purpose of the basic Class II formula price (Section 51a in most orders) is to provide a mechanism for updating the M&hyph;W price for the second preceding month so that the Class II price for the current month can be based on the M&hyph;W price but still reflect more current marketing conditions that might indicate forthcoming changes in the M&hyph;W price. This updating is done by comparing movements of wholesale prices for butter, nonfat dry milk, and Cheddar cheese during the first 15 days of the preceding month with such prices during the same period a month earlier. The current Class II differential, which is included in the Class II milk price, in most orders is 10 cents. A 15-cent differential applies under the three Florida orders, and a 25-cent differential applies under the Pacific Northwest order. The proposal recommended for adoption was proposed by the Milk Industry Foundation and International Ice Cream Association (MIF/IICA) and the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), Proposal One as published in the hearing notice. The MIF/IICA are national trade associations for processors of fluid milk, cultured dairy products, and manufacturers of frozen desert products. The MIF comprises some 220 member companies who operate nearly 500 plants nationwide and process about 80 percent of all the Class II cultured dairy products in the United States. The IICA comprises some 186 member companies who operate about 350 plants nationwide that manufacture, as well as distribute, approximately 85 percent of the ice cream and related frozen products consumed in the United States. The NMPF is the national farm commodity organization that represents dairy producers and the dairy cooperative marketing associations they own and operate. The Federation's members produce a substantial majority of the U.S. milk supply and market milk in all Federal milk order areas. A second proposal, Proposal Two as published in the hearing notice, was offered by Friendship Dairies, Inc. Like the proposal recommended for adoption, this proposal would replace the Class II price formula with the basic formula price for the second preceding month, but would add a fixed differential of $0.10 instead of $0.30. Announcement of the Class II milk price under this proposal would also be by the fifth day of the preceding month. Friendship Dairies, Inc. (Friendship), is a family owned and operated cultured dairy products manufacturer regulated under the New York-New Jersey (Order 2) marketing area and processes most of the 250 million pounds of milk which it receives annually from about 175 independent producers and milk marketing cooperatives in Class II products such as cottage cheese and yogurt. A third proposal, Proposal Three as published in the hearing notice, was offered by Women Involved in Farm Economics (WIFE). This proposal would replace the Class II price formula with the basic formula plus a fixed differential of $0.50. No witness from WIFE testified. However, testimony was received by a witness from the National Farmers Organization (NFO) in support of a $0.50 Class II differential. The NFO represents about 4,000 member dairy farmers and others who market their milk through NFO in at least 13 Federal milk orders. A fourth proposal, Proposal Four as published in the hearing notice, would replace the Class II price formula with a Class II price of $0.60 above the Class III or Class III-A price, whichever was higher. This proposal received no evidence or testimony at the hearing and is considered abandoned.
