James Rowe. But, he said, beneficiaries of such a proclamation should first apply for this. De Venecia, who was given by Malacanang a draft copy of the two proclamation orders that would cover insurgents on one hand and government forces who committed crimes in the course of the counter-insurgency campaign on the other, said: "It (the application) is not a condition but a procedure that is but logical and reasonable. We cannot just go to the top of Mount Olympus and announce that we hereby declare an amnesty. My God, who are these people?" he said. De Venecia said amnesty that is granted even without being asked for would make the program vulnerable to abuse. He said he would favor the inclusion of Juanito Itaas and Donato Continente, convicted killers of Rowe, in the program. Both have appealed their cases before the court. "I have not studied their cases but in principle, amnesties should be wide-ranging and general application," he said. When asked how an application for amnesty would affect the contention of Itaas and Continente that they are innocent of the murder charge, De Venecia said seeking inclusion in the program would not necessarily be an admission of guilt. "You're just applying for amnesty," he said. De Venecia expressed confident that the second amnesty program will result in the faster resolution of armed conflicts with rebel groups whose number has been estimated at 25,000. The first was declared by former President Aquino. The amnesty proclamation needs the concurrence of Congress. [passage omitted]
