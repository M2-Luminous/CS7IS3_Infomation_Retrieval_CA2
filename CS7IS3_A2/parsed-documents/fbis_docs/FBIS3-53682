Al-Biyari told DAVAR yesterday he was unanimously elected by more than the 50 union heads, and will serve in the post for another term of two years. Three lists competed in the elections: Fatah, the People's Party (the former Communist Party), and the Democratic Front. The results of the elections indicate that control over the trade unions remain in the hands of Fatah, considering the fact that al-Biyari is affiliated with this organization. The radical Muslim groups have absolutely no foothold in Gaza Strip trade unions. [passage omitted]
