FBIS4-5851 "dreas072_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 South Korea Seoul To Ask UN To Intervene Seoul To Ask UN To Intervene SK1404013694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0104 GMT 14 Apr 94 SK1404013694 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 14 (YONHAP) -- Seoul will refer to the UN High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) in screening North Korean loggers fleeing from Siberian camps to determine whether they are criminal offenders before settling them in South Korea, officials said Thursday. The government will try to find homes in third countries for those seeking settlement outside South Korea but focus on blocking their repatriation to Pyongyang, also in cooperation with the UNHCR, the officials said. An inter-ministerial meeting is planned for Friday, when the government is expected to confirm the principle of accepting North Korean loggers escaping from Siberian gulags that reportedly violate human rights. The South Korean Embassy in Moscow said over 170 escapees have asked to be resettled in Seoul. President Kim Yong-sam had earlier said his government would not accept the escapees, lest it anger North Korea and aggravate their already strained relations. But he changed his mind and Kim's spokesman announced Wednesday that he has ordered a thorough study on bringing the loggers to the South. Friday's meeting will discuss various possibilities, focusing on how to screen the escapees to sort out those fleeing punishment for criminal offenses, according to the officials. One option is to have Moscow perform the screening, but the best method is referral to the UNHCR, one official said. "Moscow would have a tremendously difficult time in screening the escapees since most of them do not have any form of identification," he said. "For all we know, they may not even be from the logging camps but North Koreans who are in flight in China, or even spies." "The best way is to have the UNHCR do the job. It would be the most objective, and be less tough than Moscow in screening procedures since it would place humanitarian concerns above political implications," he said. If some did turn out to be criminal offenders, Seoul would arrange to have them serve time before they are considered for resettlement in South Korea, the official noted. Seoul will start negotiations with the UN Commissioner soon, including resettlement in countries other than South Korea, he said.
