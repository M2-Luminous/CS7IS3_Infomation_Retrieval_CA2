In a three-hour session, in which, apart from the members of the working group, only the minister and his state secretaries, Wilz and Mrs. Geiger, participated, almost all working group members took the floor. Its chairman, Breuer, made critical comments, just like former Parliamentary State Secretary Wuerzbach and the following deputies: Hauser, Uehlhoff, Adam, Mrs. Marienfeld, Strobe, Augustinowitz, Janovsky, Stockhausen, Ganz, and Kossendey. They did not show any understanding for Ruehe's decisions. The assessment of the security policy situation in Europe, which Ruehe takes as a basis in the recently published white book and the "conceptual guidelines" deduced from it, is too positive. The situation is far less stable and calculable than it is presented. His decision to reduce the basic military service from 12 to 10 months is a serious danger for the preservation of compulsory military service, it was stated. Some deputies expressed the fear that the reduction will pave the way for a professional army. At the same time, with the criticism of the material effects of Ruehe's planned cuts, members of the Bundestag Group expressed the fear that the financial endowment for the remaining units will not be improved by the reduction. Rather, one has to prepare for the possibility that the finance minister will justify further budget cuts by the Bundeswehr's reduction and "collect" the savings. Ruehe has not promised that this will not happen, it was stated. This fear was not refuted in the debate. Ruehe resolutely rejected the criticism of his decisions. He referred to the fact that he had made his decision in coordination and full agreement with the chancellor. The government had adopted the assessment of the security policy situation in the white book. The deputies have to accept that, he said. The further course of action was also controversial. First Ruehe reported that he is no longer prepared to participate in the closed meeting that the working group had fixed in Siegen for the weekend. After a discussion of half an hour, Ruehe took his decision back. However, after the three-hour debate, an agreement in Siegen seemed to be unlikely to members of the working group. Ruehe also did not make the impression that he is once again prepared to strive for an improvement of the Bundeswehr's financial means and thus to create the prerequisites for the preservation of the Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 men. [passage omitted] Before the beginning of the meeting, Ruehe had pointed out that nobody gets around "some hard facts." This includes that a Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 men cannot be maintained with the means that are provided by the government. A few days ago, in a speech, State Secretary Schoenbohm made it clear how great the cuts in the Bundeswehr budget after reunification are. With the inflation rate being taken into account, it was reduced by 18 percent from 1989 to 1993, next year the cuts will amount to 25 percent, that is, one-fourth of the amount available in 1989. In this way, the means available for materiel and investments decreased by 43 percent until 1993, he said.
