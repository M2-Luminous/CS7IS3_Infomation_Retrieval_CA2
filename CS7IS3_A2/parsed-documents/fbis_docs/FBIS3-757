Speaking to journalists from his home he said he wanted to think of his future in politics before making a decision or commenting on it. Mr Cronje, who also holds the ministerial portfolios of state affairs and civil aviation, said that he had spoken to South African Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha on Saturday night regarding Mr Mangope's removal from power. He also spoke to Mr Mangope who "told me what had happened -- without comment. I think he has accepted what has happened," Mr Cronje said. He said he did not think he would take part in the April elections, adding "for what party?" But Mr Mangope was "fairly keen" to participate as part of the registered party, the North-Western Democrats. "The president has enhanced this country in a very short time with development, infrastructure, leadership and services -- which is remarkable for Africa and all this will stand to his credit," he said. One of the reasons for the collapse of order in Bophuthatswana was due to agitation from outside. "There were statements from the ANC's [African National Congress] premier designate for the North-Western area, Mr Popo Molefe and from Mr Carl Niehaus of the ANC threatening rolling mass action. There have been a lot of foreign cars and a lot of strange faces on the streets since Wednesday," he said. Mr Cronje said the Freedom Alliance [FA] was a negotiating alliance and not a political one, and the FA had managed to negotiate constitutional decisions by a group that differed politically. "We managed to get more powers for the provinces and this was to be able to give more power to the provincial public service to ensure more jobs for civil servants and to allow them to have work close to home, Mr Cronje said. He was not able to confirm talk of any collusion between the BDF [Bophuthatswana Defense Force] and the massive group of right-wing insurgents that infiltrated the capital of the fragmented homeland on Friday. What there was evidence of was that the BDF, one of the top defence forces in Africa, had rounded them up and kept them contained at the air force airfield on Friday. He also could not confirm reports of officers siding with the rightists fleeing the homeland. Mr Cronje added that there were a number of officers in the BDF who had been seconded from the SADF [South African Defense Force]. He added that the government pensions fund had been audited by a firm of British actuaries whose finding was that it was the "soundest pension fund in Africa". He also said the fund did not even run to the R2 billion [rand] that was allegedly siphoned off from it. He also denied any possibility of house arrest for Mr Mangope who was being secured by SA Government personnel. "All governments have a responsibility for all heads of state and former heads of state for life. If you go to a country place in George, you will find security around former State President P W Botha. He is not under house arrest."
