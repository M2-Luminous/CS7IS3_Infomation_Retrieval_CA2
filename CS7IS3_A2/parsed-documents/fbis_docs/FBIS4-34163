During a radio and television network today, an announcer just announced the date for the referendum and read the seven-question questionnaire Duran-Ballen presented three days ago. The results of the referendum will decide whether another plebiscite will be held on 2 January 1995. This second plebiscite will be held to learn of the people's wishes regarding the summoning of a constituent assembly to make changes to the Constitution. "Our most heartfelt wish is to make actual changes to the social, political, economic, and moral plans," President Duran-Ballen said during last week's radio and television network.
