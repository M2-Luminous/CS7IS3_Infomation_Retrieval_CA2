However, such views are the minority opinion within the government, and the agreement is not a guarantee that the Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade Act (sanction measures against unfair trade partners) will not be applied to Japan. Therefore, the majority of opinions within the government is that "it is dangerous to have an optimistic view" (according to a top official of Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]). The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have remained deadlocked. Regardless of the outcome of the recent negotiations on mobile phones, how the United States will assess details of market opening measures which the Japanese Government plans to announce late this month is the key to the resumption of the economic framework talks. The U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] is to pick out unfair trade partners and trade areas as the subject of sanctions under the Super 301 provision from a list of unfair trading nations and areas described in a annual report on foreign trade barriers which is scheduled to be worked out by the USTR late this month. It is most likely that dozens of trade items -- which involve some areas of trade with Japan -- will be listed in the report as unfair trade areas. The recent agreement has both a bright and a dark side. Underlying the conclusion of the negotiations is how the U.S. Motorola and the USTR steamrolled the negotiations, and it seems that the results of the negotiations helped the United States reaffirm its view that "Japan gives up when pressure is applied." Now, the USTR can propagate that showing a stand of imposing sanctions is effective when holding negotiations. However, there is the bright side, too. This is because the agreement can be taken as "a concrete signal" (according to a senior official of MITI) that reflects the position of the United States, which has said that failure in the economic framework talks "will not lead to a trade war between Japan and the United States" (as stated by Secretary of State Christopher). But it seems that the current jerky Japan-U.S. relations will remain uncorrected until the Naples summit (of industrial nations) is held in July.
