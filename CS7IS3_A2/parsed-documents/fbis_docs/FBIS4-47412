FBIS4-47412 "jpust012___94166" JPRS-UST-94-012 JPRS Science & Technology Central Eurasia 8 June 1994 LIFE SCIENCES MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH Measures Proposed to Encourage Childbearing Measures Proposed to Encourage Childbearing 11111111 [VRACH Sep 93, etc.] 11111111 [VRACH Sep 93, etc.] CSO [Editorial report] Russian media have reported various initiatives to overcome what has been characterized as a continuing demographic crisis. In an article published in the Minis try of Health periodical VRACH [Physician], Candidate of Medical Sciences V. Brutman, who is a member of the administration of Independent Association of Pediatric Psychiatrists and Psychologists, reported that a group of physicians, psychologists, legal scholars and sociologists has proposed a program for women deemed likely to obtain abortions or to reject their newborns (Sep 93). A key element of the draft program ``Prevention of Early Rejection of Motherhood'' is a crisis center, which would identify and counsel pregnant women at risk of rejecting their infants. The crisis center would maintain a hot line and a crisis team, which would visit maternity hospitals to intervene in cases where rejection seems iUinent. Women with high-risk social indicators would be hospitalized at maternity homes to receive ``intensive assistance in continuing their pregnancies.'' After providing therapy to restore normal parent-child relations, a live-in ``rehabilitation center'' would keep its graduates under observation for several years. The measures are intended to support women without coercion. More recently, a different approach to demographic problems was suggested by biologist Evgeniy Tsenov in an article on the first page of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI (26 Feb 1994). Tsvenov, who blames the country's demographic decline on its acute environmental problems, excessive consumption of inferior quality alcohol and abortions, opposes the manufacture of contraceptives in Russia.
