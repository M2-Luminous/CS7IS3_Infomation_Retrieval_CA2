But we oppose an illusion of accord or a myth about accord which is being specially created. In the draft Agreement on the Attainment of Civil Accord, which has been made public by the Russian Federation president, everything testifies either to the naivete of its authors or their desire to use the text only as a tactical weapon in the struggle against those who -- even to some extent -- do not support one administration and government policy or another. The document's period of validity, its demand for unilateral compromises, its declarative nature, the betting on embryonic party structures that have virtually no social support base in society, a lack of clear- cut obligations to be assumed by the executive branch, the restriction of constitutional rights for entire categories of people, the hastening of the preparation, discussion, and adoption of the document, and, finally, its mechanism of arbitration and sanctions for violating the agreement -- all this makes us warn: the document will not have any role to play at best, but at worst (which is most likely) it will, on the contrary, aggravate the standoff in society. The very idea of civil accord may be discredited. Holding talks on the attainment of accord is, of course, better than not holding them at all. But the result is attainable when it can be attained in reality, not by an earlier set -- and apparently politically motivated -- date. This is why, while welcoming the president's readiness to strive for civil accord in society, but at the same time thinking it impossible for us to assume responsibility for the consequences of putting into practice the published draft Agreement under the established mechanism of finalizing and signing it, we propose different principles of the Public Agreement on the Attainment of Civil Accord: 1. The renunciation of the use of armed force in resolving any political and social conflicts. 2. The adherence to the current Constitution, while at the same time working out a mutually agreed mechanism of adjusting it. 3. The renunciation by all political institutions and structures of the claim on the introduction of any "state ideology" and the use of "the image of an internal enemy" in their campaigning. 4. All parties to the agreement, particularly chiefs of state structures, ought to conduct policies that are as moral as possible and that would not raise opponents' suspicions of insincerity. 5. The restoration of an independent, strong judicial branch as soon as possible. 6. The determination of clear dates and the mechanism of all elections for all elected government authorities. The parties to the agreement should forgo any changes in the dates or rules of elections. Democratic, free, and regular elections are the best mechanism of realizing the idea of civil accord. 7. Political forces that lay claims on power should publicly pledge to forswear revenge on the vanquished and yet another redistribution of property in favor of the winners in elections. 8. The joint determination of further stages of political reform. 9. The agreed determination of the minimum social standards and the quality of life standards of the population to be binding on any government. 10. The orientation of economic policy toward the domestic market as an engine of Russian economic development, and therefore a precondition for raising the living standards of Russian citizens. 11. A gradual, phased, and agreed upon introduction of a new model of Russia's federal structure and its policy in the post- Soviet space. 12. All parties to the agreement ought to pledge to take part in the comprehensive, full-scale struggle against organized crime, and also to expel those who may have even indirect contacts with any persons, organizations, or businesses dubious in that regard from the organizations signatories to the agreement. The text of the Public Agreement should be signed by the leaders of public and political movements and organizations, political parties, trade and professional unions, associations of commodity producers, banks, and other corporate structures, and only afterward by top government officials. Those who have signed the agreement will become members of a roundtable which at the same time will be an arbitration agency responsible for exposing violations of the agreement by its individual members.
