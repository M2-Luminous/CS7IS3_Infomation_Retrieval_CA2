FR940418-1-00004 FR940418-1-00001 Available-for-Sale All securities that are not classified as either held-to-maturity or trading will be considered available-for-sale securities. The available-for-sale category replaces the existing held-for-sale category. However, it is likely to include some securities previously considered held for investment. The accounting treatment also has changed. Under existing accounting requirements, held-for-sale securities are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, with the offsetting entry reported directly in the income statement. Under SFAS 115, available-for-sale securities will be recorded at fair value and any unrealized appreciation or depreciation will be excluded from earnings and reported, net of applicable tax effects, as a separate component of common stockholders' equity. Impact of SFAS 115 on Regulatory Capital This proposed rule would amend the OCC's capital adequacy rules by revising the definition of common stockholders' equity. Specifically, the proposed rule would remove the adjustment for net unrealized losses on non-current marketable equity securities and replace it with the net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities under SFAS 115. Since common stockholders' equity is a component of Tier 1 capital, the proposed rule would affect the calculation of an institution's Tier 1 capital under the OCC's capital adequacy rules. This amendment is intended to adopt SFAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes and to ensure greater consistency with GAAP. As discussed earlier, SFAS 115 restricts the circumstances in which securities may be reported at amortized cost. Thus, a greater proportion of a national bank's securities will be carried at fair value. While this proposed rule to adopt SFAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes will not affect reported earnings, it could result in an increase in the volatility of regulatory capital. Under the current interest rate environment, the precise impact of this proposed rule is difficult to predict. Until recently, interest rates were declining. Consequently, the fair value for most banks' securities portfolios generally exceeded their book value. Therefore, the impact of this proposal likely would have resulted in an increase in the regulatory capital of national banks. However, with the recent upturn in interest rates, it is not possible to generalize the impact of this proposed rule on regulatory capital. Over time, as the interest rate environment changes, the proposed rule could result in periods of lower regulatory capital for some national banks and possibly subject a bank to regulatory action under the OCC's prompt corrective action rules. See 12 CFR part 6. Nonetheless, while the amount of regulatory capital may vary with changes in interest rates, banks can exercise some control over the volatility through effective interest rate risk management techniques. Issues for Comment The OCC invites comments on all aspects of this proposal regarding the regulatory capital treatment of net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. However, the OCC specifically seeks comment on (1) the costs and benefits of adopting SFAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes, and (2) the extent to which banks will adjust their behavior to manage the potential volatility in regulatory capital if the OCC adopts the proposed rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. This rule may increase the volatility of small banks' regulatory capital. However, it should not lead to a significant increase in the number of small banks that do not meet regulatory capital standards because most small banks operate with capital levels well above regulatory capital standards. Even if there were a significant decline in the market value of banks' available-for-sale securities, most banks would still meet regulatory standards.
