The list corresponds to a list of East European and African countries that Germany has been using since August of last year. [passage omitted] However, according to Justice State Secretary Kosto, asylum-seekers from so-called safe countries will continue to be able to seek asylum in spite of the list. To do so, they must "immediately" come up with compelling arguments which show that they are at risk in their own country. If the Justice Ministry does not accept these arguments, then the asylum-seekers can lodge an appeal, but they will not be given any assistance during this period. "We do not expect asylum-seekers to make use of this possibility very often," Kosto said. [passage omitted] According to the bill, roughly 5 percent of asylum-seekers originate from countries that the Justice Ministry considers "safe." [passage omitted] Kosto says that "it is already so that virtually all asylum-seekers from `safe' countries are turned away. However, the 5 percent of refugees involved are causing an unwanted blockage of the capacity to accommodate asylum-seekers." He believes there is no ready answer to the question on the precise criteria for classifying a country as "safe." [passage omitted]
