Implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" and Helping Impoverished Regions Change Their Backwardness Is the Historical Responsibility of the Party and the Government It has been seven or eight years since we began assisting the poor in development on a large scale across the country. Since we have always stuck to the principle of assisting the poor in development, we have obtained very great achievements. Vast numbers of cadres and people in impoverished regions across the country have made huge efforts on this, and various relevant quarters, both in the central and local authorities and all circles in society, have given vigorous support, thus making an important contribution to assisting the poor in development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping says socialism is about eliminating poverty. This is a long-term and arduous historical task. The task of the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan," as was discussed at the meeting, is to resolve the problem of food and clothing for 80 million people in the seven years from now to the end of this century and to help them escape poverty and attain prosperity. This is an unshirkable historical responsibility of our generation of communists and the people's governments at all levels. Completing the task of the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" is of great significance. First, it has a bearing on whether or not we can satisfactorily achieve the second-step strategic goal of China's modernization. At present, everyone across the country is striving hard with a view to doubling GNP again and allowing the people to lead a comparatively comfortable life. If the problem of clothing and food for tens of millions of people in China remains unsolved by the end of this century, then we cannot say that the second-step strategic goal has been satisfactorily achieved. Second, it has a bearing on whether or not our party and the people's government stick to the goal of attaining common prosperity. The PRC will have through half a century by the year 2000. If, in struggling for two generations, tens of millions of people still cannot solve the problem of food and clothing, but live in poverty, how can we embody the aim of communists wholeheartedly serving the people? How can we bring to light the superiority of the socialist system? Whenever we, communists at all levels who shoulder heavy responsibilities, recall this question, we will feel uneasy when eating and sleeping. The "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" formulated by the State Council is determined to steadily solve the food and clothing problem of the masses by the end of this century. We must never postpone the problem to the next century. This is a major strategic plan which is of significance both economically and politically and which must be carried out without failure. Leading comrades in party committees and governments at all levels and comrades in charge of all quarters and divisions must consider this task an important matter, attach great importance to it, do it properly, and strive to complete it as scheduled. II. Implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" and Assisting Impoverished Regions To Develop Their Economies Is a Strategic Measure To Gradually Narrow the Difference Between the Eastern and Western Regions Of the 80 million people throughout the country at present who have not completely and steadily solved the problem of food and clothing, over 80 percent are concentrated in the central and western regions, and most are concentrated in the southwest and northwest. Speaking in this sense, solving the problem of food and clothing for the masses in impoverished regions and helping them escape poverty and attain prosperity is a question of gradually narrowing the difference between the eastern and western regions. On this question, we should have a correct and comprehensive understanding. 1) Differences exist objectively. The development of things is unbalanced. There are differences between different countries around the world and differences also exist within countries. This is determined by historical, natural, geographical, social, economic, and other factors. It is impossible to completely eliminate differences within a short time. 2) We should gradually narrow differences with a positive attitude with a view to eliminating them in the end. We will stick to the policy of encouraging some people and areas to get rich first through honest labor and legitimate operations so they can bring along and help the development of backward areas in order to achieve the goal of ultimately attaining the common prosperity of the whole nation. If all are poor, then nobody can help. Only when some areas are a little developed earlier and have stronger economic strength will they be in a position to help the backward areas. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Poverty is not socialism (The Collected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume Three p 225)." He also said: "Socialism is not where a small number of people are rich while the majority of people are poor." "The greatest superiority of socialism is common prosperity. This is something that reflects the nature of socialism (p 364, the same volume)." In order to narrow differences and achieve common prosperity, we have already done a great deal of work. Viewing the matter vertically, we see when comparing ourselves that both developed areas and impoverished areas are developing. Viewing it horizontally, the difference between impoverished and developed areas is tending to widen. Therefore, we must draw the great attention of party committees and governments at all levels, adopt effective measures, and make efforts to narrow differences between regions. Encourage and urge advanced coastal areas which have become prosperous first and large and medium-sized cities to bring along and help the impoverished regions. Generally speaking, there are two channels to help and assist impoverished regions. The first channel is that we distribute national income a second time through the state and then tilt toward the impoverished regions. The second channel is that we have those who have become prosperous first help and assist those who will become prosperous later. Big cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, as well as the coastal provinces whose economies are comparatively developed, all have this responsibility and obligation. But this does not mean the simple uncompensated supply of money and goods, but union and cooperation on the basis of common development mainly through mutual benefit and reciprocality. There are varied forms. They can jointly exploit resources and transform the resource advantages into economic advantages. They can offer technical support to help upgrade quality and product standards and enhance the ability of economic growth. They can offer a stable sales market to encourage the development of production. They can offer employment opportunities through the importation of labor services. They should combine the resource advantages and labor advantages of impoverished regions with the technology, information, and capital advantages of the developed regions to achieve a rational allocation of resources. This is both beneficial to the development of impoverished regions and developed regions and to the coordinated developed of the entire national economy. This kind of cooperation is worthy of vigorous promotion and must be carried out. The state will give sufficient financial and monetary support to impoverished regions. To assist the poor in development, there must of course be appropriate capital inputs. Without inputs, there will be no output, nor will there be enough food and clothing or development. Over the years, financial authorities and banks at all levels have made very great efforts to increase inputs to assist the poor in development, and they have attained good results. But in our work to assist the poor, we have now entered a stage where major difficulties have to be tackled. As time is very limited, it is will be very difficult to completely and steadily resolve the problem of food and clothing for the masses by the end of this century. Without corresponding guarantees of capital, it will be very difficult to do so. The State Council has already decided to provide an additional one billion yuan of work relief funds and one billion yuan of poverty-assistance credits at discount interest rates [tie xi dai kuan 6317 1873 6313 2949] beginning this year. In the future, as financial strength expands, the state will continue to increase inputs to assist the poor. Local governments at all levels should also increase inputs in impoverished regions accordingly. The three municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, as well as the six coastal provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Fujian, and Liaoning, should raise their own poverty-assistance funds. The central authorities' poverty-assistance funds will be concentrated in the poverty-stricken central and western provinces (regions). To increase inputs in poverty assistance, we cannot merely depend on the government, but also forces in society must pool poverty-assistance funds in various areas within the scope allowed by state policy. The state should tilt major projects toward impoverished regions. Although impoverished regions in the western regions are comparatively poor at present, they are rich in resources, which is a big advantage. When formulating development plans, all divisions of the State Council should fully consider this advantage. They should arrange for some resource exploitation projects of a comparatively large scale and some infrastructural projects for impoverished regions in keeping with the principle of giving equal priority. Fundamentally speaking, in order to thoroughly change the backwardness of impoverished regions, we should, to a very large extent, depend on the impetus of these key large-scale projects. Gradually straighten out prices of raw materials and primary products through reform. Under the previous planned economic structure, prices of raw materials and primary products were very low, and prices of farm products were not high either. Presently, the price structure and the circulation structure are being reformed in keeping with the requirements of establishing a socialist market economic structure. As reform is deepening, it will be possible to achieve exchange at equal prices for timber, petroleum, coal, nonferrous metals, and all other resources in nationwide integrated markets and developed areas. This is an important measure to promote the development of the central and western regions. The impoverished central and western regions should also use the favorable opportunity of reform and opening up to develop themselves. Improve the quality of personnel and scientific and technological levels in impoverished regions. This is a very important measure of fundamental significance. Over the years, we have had very good progress in training personnel in impoverished regions and in exchanging cadres between the western and eastern regions. We should continuously stick to this and expand it. There are now two kinds of noteworthy large-scale flows across the country. The first is that of the labor force flowing from the west to the east and that the scale of labor service exports is continuously expanding. The second is that craftsmen and skilled personnel are flowing from the east to the west and that they are found in every corner of the cities and countryside of the western regions. The flow of labor from the west to the east not only enables impoverished regions to participate in the development of the national economy by making use of the large numbers of employment opportunities created by developed coastal regions, but can also improve the quality of laborers in impoverished regions. This is a special kind of training. The flow of craftsmen and skilled personnel from the east to the west is, in fact, a kind of technology export. It can improve the technological level and expertise of impoverished regions in a more effective and more practical form. These two flows are of very great significance to improving the quality of laborers and improving scientific and technological levels and must be fully affirmed and continuously developed. As for the large-scale "wave of migrant workers," we must not let it flow freely but should actively divert it and rationalize its flow in an orderly way to reduce confusion in social order and economic losses. It is necessary to experiment with open-style poverty assistance on the basis of sticking to developmental poverty assistance. In order for impoverished regions to develop, they surely need to develop township and town enterprises and develop their tertiary industry. While setting up township and town enterprises in these regions, we can also experiment with developing industry in areas with appropriate conditions by giving profits and tax income back to the impoverished regions and arrange for the employment of the labor force in these regions. This may overcome the unfavorable position of impoverished regions in developing enterprises and is beneficial to enhancing the efficiency of enterprises, enhancing the efficiency of poverty-assistance funds, and upgrading poverty-assistance work overall. Mobilize forces in society to support the development and construction of impoverished regions. Over the years, various quarters, including state organs, mass organizations, democratic parties, large and medium-sized cities, developed regions, industrial and commercial enterprises, universities and colleges, scientific research academies and institutes, and the People's Liberation Army have carried forward the spirit of assisting and aiding the poor and have actively participated in the development and construction of the impoverished regions. In addition to giving financial and material support, they have utilized their own advantages and assisted the poor with their knowledge, science and technology, and talented personnel. They have acted as go-betweens for impoverished regions, come up with proposals and plans, and introduced projects and technology to them. They have undertaken to help a region until it finally gets out of poverty and attains prosperity. All these methods have made important contributions to poverty-assistance work at the previous stage. This not only reflects the affectionate concern of all circles in society for the impoverished regions but also embodies the traditional virtues of our Chinese nation. We hope that all circles in society can further mobilize themselves, have genuine affection and love, and make contributions. Here we have to specifically stress that I hope that large state industrial and commercial and foreign-trade enterprises extend to the impoverished regions, set up projects there, choose projects with good efficiency, and combine their own development with the development of the impoverished regions. Alleviating poverty and eliminating poverty is a global issue. It is also the duty of the United Nations and numerous other international organizations. China's elimination of poverty is part and parcel of the world's elimination of poverty. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation between China and international organizations in assisting the poor in development so that the international community can better understand and support China's poverty-assistance work. Impoverished regions should carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle. Support from the state and help from society are both necessary, but the efforts of the impoverished regions themselves are more important. External factors act through internal factors. Henan's Lin County and many other counties, townships, and villages that have become prosperous first have a history of arduously pioneering a cause. We should learn from their spirit and experiences. Only when we have this can we overcome difficulties, escape poverty, and attain prosperity. Moreover, we should pay attention to picking good cadres who have a spirit of making sacrifices, who can bear hardships and stand hard work, and who maintain ties with the masses; consolidate leading groups at all levels in impoverished counties; maintain relative stability; and allow them to rest assured and lead the masses in changing their backwardness. III. In Implementing "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan," We Should Carry Out the Provincial Governor Responsibility System, in Which Responsibility Rests at Every Level, Mainly at the Provincial Level, Under the Unified Leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council I agree to the principle of unified leadership with responsibility resting at every level and mainly at the provincial level stressed in the 80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan. Taking the provincial level as the mainstay demands that the major responsible comrades in the provincial CPC committee and provincial government care for and pay good attention to assisting the poor. We should be clear about one point, however, namely that the provincial governor takes charge. Implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" and solving the problem of food and clothing for the masses is a systematic project. It involves such economic activities as finance, banking, agriculture, water works, industry, and commerce, as well as various aspects such as culture, education, public health, and family planning. Practice over the years proves that it is not enough for vice governors to take charge separately as it is very difficult to coordinate various aspects and various quarters. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the head of the government to take charge of everything and make overall plans and arrangements. The very criterion with which to measure whether or not leading cadres at all levels really work for the benefit of the people and care for the plight of the people is whether or not they can complete the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" as scheduled and solve the problem of food and clothing for the poor population of their own localities. When determining the good and bad work of a province, region, or municipality, we must not merely look at the rate at which its economy grows but also at whether its efficiency is good or bad, whether the people's living standards have improved quickly or not, and how well the problem of food and clothing for the poor population has been solved. Our leading comrades at all levels must not merely pay attention to developed regions, but must all the more place in their hearts the plight and warmth of the ordinary people of the impoverished regions. All provinces, regions, and municipalities must formulate their own plans in keeping with the demands of the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan." They must set demands for progress and make specific plans regarding how many people have had their problems solved this year, how many will have their problems solved next year, and how the problem has been solved. They should conduct an inspection each year during which the good will be commended and the bad criticized so that everyone is urged to complete their tasks as scheduled and do not slacken their efforts at all. All divisions of the government should continue to make it their unshirkable duty to assist the poor in development. In addition to mainly helping a particular impoverished region, they must formulate poverty-assistance plans for their own business or division in keeping with the tasks set forth by the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" as specific contents and measures for implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan." Implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" is an arduous and glorious duty. I believe that as long as everyone has confidence, is united as one, makes concerted efforts, and courageously tackles difficulties, we will surely be able to achieve the goal of the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" by the end of this century, and the economic and social development of the impoverished regions will enter a new stage.
