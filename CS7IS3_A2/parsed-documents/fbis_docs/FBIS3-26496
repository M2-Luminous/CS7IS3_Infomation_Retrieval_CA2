He declined, however, to make a conjecture on the exact timing for the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Public opinion has taken note of the fact that it was after U.S. President Clinton announced the lifting of 19-year trade embargo against Vietnam on 3 February that Le Mai made known Vietnam's stance. It has been learned that the U.S. liaison office in Hanoi is currently under construction. The United States started imposing trade sanctions against Vietnam in 1964, targeting them exclusively at North Vietnam at that time. In 1975, the U.S. Army lost the war on the Vietnamese battlefields and the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese puppet regime collapsed soon after. Flying into a rage from shame, the United States expanded the trade sanctions to all of Vietnam. Since it carried out reform in the mid 1980's, Vietnam has seen an economic growth of 5.3 percent. Now, per capita annual income has reached $217 and the inflation rate dropped from 70 to 15 percent. Over the past few years, the Vietnamese Government has approved 560 investment projects, entailing investment of $4.5 billion. Vietnam is now attracting foreign capital in the following ways: On the one hand, Vietnam has stepped up efforts to hold negotiations with the United States, the "chief" of the Western allies, has strongly demanded that the United States lift its trade embargo against Vietnam on the condition that Vietnam provide help in finding U.S. servicemen missing since the war. On the other hand, Vietnam also is trying to do business with other Western countries through various channels, with a view to breaking the U.S. blockade. In recent years, many countries and regions -- including France, Japan, Britain, Hong Kong, and Taiwan -- have made huge investments in Vietnam. The anti-Vietnamese alliance pieced together by the United States has collapsed. Moreover, having long been resentful of the stubbornness of the government, U.S. business circles have made repeated appeals for an early lifting of trade embargo against Vietnam. Under this pressure, the Bush administration announced in February 1992 a partial lifting of trade sanctions against Vietnam; meanwhile, it also lifted bans prohibiting U.S. enterprises from establishing representative offices in Vietnam as well as signing contracts with Vietnam. U.S. enterprise circles immediately responded to the call. In no time, two world-famous companies -- Whirlpool and Compaq -- had signed contracts with Vietnam on selling computers and other products to Vietnam. Companies like Lockheed [luo ke xi de 3157 0344 1585 1795], Goldman Sachs [ge de man sa ke si 2047 1795 2581 5646 0344 2448] and Coca-Cola also were unwilling to lag behind; one after another they sought business opportunities in Vietnam. However, the new Clinton administration was not eager to improve U.S. ties with Vietnam. Clinton once indicated in clear-cut terms that the trade embargo would not be lifted before "substantial" headway had been made in the search for U.S. servicemen missing in action. This position has deterred U.S. enterprises from investing in Vietnam, and all contracts already signed between the two sides were subject to the additional condition that they could take effect only after the overall lifting of trade sanctions. In the face of increasingly intensified global economic and trade wars, however, the United States has become more and more reluctant to give up the huge Vietnamese market, and it began to quicken its steps toward reconciliation with Vietnam. Last year, some U.S. congressmen and government officials visited Vietnam, and they reaffirmed the efforts Vietnam had made in helping investigate the whereabouts of missing U.S. military personnel. Since the beginning of this year, the United States has sent to Vietnam nearly 10 delegations from Congress, military organs, and enterprise circles. Charles Larson, chief of the U.S. Pacific command, visited Vietnam on 16 January. He is the highest-ranking U.S. officer ever to visit Vietnam since the United States broke off diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 1975. Public opinion believed that the U.S. plan to lift trade sanctions against Vietnam was in the run-up. On 27 January, the U.S. Senate passed a bill, with 62 votes for and 38 against, urging the government to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam. The result of the vote meant a cardiac stimulant to Clinton, for it enabled him to deal with the strong resentment of U.S. veterans' groups with perfect assurance. Conditions for the lifting of trade sanctions against Vietnam finally became ripe.
