It was a publicity campaign aimed at the outside world, personally staged by the president himself. To the question: "How are you going to settle the nuclear issue?" put by one of the guests, Ms. Mun Myong-ja, a Korean-American journalist, President Kim replied: "So far, we have made all kinds of proposals and let them see all that has to be seen for settlement of the nuclear problem. In spite of this, throwing doubt on us is what matters. This time, the Western mass media including CNN has come to report on us, and I have instructed: `Let them take pictures and see all that they want to.' My instruction is intended to enable them to come to understand the realities by themselves, by letting many people see our situation as it is." At the same time, he expressed a strong distrust of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) saying: "When we let them -- the IAEA -- see what they want to, they then say they are suspicious of other places and so we let them see those. Then, they continue to take the attitude that they are suspicious about still other places. They are suspicious about a military base, but military facilities are a different matter, having nothing to with IAEA inspections." Ms. Mun is one of the few journalists who has been able to meet President Kim personally. In Tokyo on her way home, she gave a Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter her impression: "Though it may not be simple, the issue seems to be heading toward solution." Young Leadership Feared To Have Gone Its Own Way on Nuclear Development On 13 June, less than two months after the meeting, the DPRK abruptly announced its intention to "withdraw from the IAEA." It was made immediately before announcement of the schedule for the third round of high-level talks between the United States and the DPRK; and as the result of the DPRK's unilateral replacement of fuel rods without IAEA's inspectors on hand -- an act apparently intended to "destroy the talks." The DPRK Foreign Ministry announcement of the intended withdrawal said: "We absolutely cannot permit any unjustifiable inspections, until such time we decide on whether we either return to or withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)." Though the DPRK withheld the decision on whether it will withdraw from the NPT, most specialists conclude: "Thus it became impossible to verify how much plutonium the DPRK had extracted." There is a big discrepancy between President Kim's reply to the journalist and the recent DPRK decision. The IAEA's presence at the scene of nuclear fuel rod replacements does not constitute an entry into a military facility; it is a routine inspection activity. Why then, did the DPRK refuse this at the sacrifice of the "U.S.-DPRK high-level talks," which the DPRK so ardently wishes to hold? The first conceivable reason is to "conceal the plutonium." The DPRK has insisted it processed "a very small quantity of plutonium" only once in 1990. But, from what has been detected by satellite photographs, the IAEA suspects the DPRK processed a considerable amount (several kilograms) of plutonium when it ceased operations of the experimental reactor for more than one month in 1989. Special inspections were requested to resolve these suspicions. The year 1989 marked a period during which the DPRK felt a sense of crisis about its own existence due to the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and East Europe, in contrast to the Republic of Korea which was in high spirits after the success of the Seoul Olympics the previous year. It is highly conceivable that the younger generation of the DPRK leadership headed by Secretary Kim Chong-il ordered the processing of plutonium with the aim of developing nuclear weapons, without consulting President Kim Il-song. The President Cannot Be Made a Liar Meanwhile, President Kim Il-song has repeatedly declared: "We have neither the intention nor the ability to build nuclear weapons." If, through inspections, the processing of plutonium turns out to be true, the President will be made a liar, downgrading his international dignity; severe punishment would await those who had brought this about. So, it is presumed that the young leadership decided not to allow this to happen at any cost, thus deterring the inspections. A businessman who recently visited Pyongyang does not deny this possibility, saying: "Last year's report of good harvests reflected a good harvest of rice in certain areas, despite the reports of poor crops in the substantial staple food, corn, on the east coast and other areas. Those close to the president deleted the part on poor crops in their reports, giving him the wrong impression that the whole country had a good crop. In fact, it was only a little better than the year before last, which was a lean year. It is said that the usual practice is not to inform the president of anything bad." In recent days, President Kim Il-song seems to be taking measures to restrain Secretary Kim Chong-il's activities. Late last year, the DPRK Government closed the so-called "Room No. 39," the office overseeing consolidated business enterprises [sogo kigyo] which served as a big source of income for Secretary Kim Chong-il; and dismissed his confidant Choe Su-gil, chairman of the board of directors of the Tae-song Bank, from the responsible position as head of the Room. The Room had a supralegal authority and was engaged in the amassment of foreign money. Powerful enterprises such as Kumsan, which had actually been managed by Secretary Kim's group, were put under the cabinet's management. It was said these measures were taken under the president's instructions and were intended to reform the economic policy which had given priority to the party and armed forces, and to make a good use of civilian vitality. In an interview with the WASHINGTON TIMES in April, President Kim declared: "Secretary Kim's thought and guidance are completely identical to mine," indicating the order of succession was solid and firm. On the other hand, Kim Yong-ju, his younger brother, was appointed to the post of vice-president; and Kim Pyong-il, his second son, was recalled from his newly appointed post as ambassador to Finland. These actions were interpreted as signs of Kim Il- song's discontent with the leadership of Secretary Kim Chong-il. The United States Wants To Prevent the DPRK's Withdrawal From the NPT Another factor contributing to the DPRK's high-handedness is China's attitude. Immediately before the announcement of the DPRK's intended withdrawal from the IAEA, China extended an invitation to Choe Kwang, the DPRK's chief of general staff. Chinese President Jiang Jemin met and extended him a superlative welcome address: "China and the DPRK are friendly neighbors with inseparable relations like lips and teeth." This is a complete change from the situation several years ago when it was said: "The DPRK is no longer an ally." Details of the talks were not made available but they were presumed to have negotiated the supply of weaponry parts which Russia had refused; military assistance in case of contingencies; and the exercise of veto power when a resolution on economic sanctions on the DPRK was presented before the UN Security Council. A Chinese source in Tokyo assumed: "China has probably responded favorably." Although tensions have mounted on the Korean peninsula as the result of the DPRK's announcement of its intended withdrawal from the IAEA, I do not see the danger of war breaking out as long as President Kim personally takes command. Even though the DPRK actually processed plutonium for weapons and continues to conceal the fact, the United States looks likely to approve it. A U.S. expert on international affairs close to the Department of State who visited Japan this spring said: "Late last year, the Clinton administration decided on a DPRK policy that viewed several kilograms of plutonium in the DPRK as almost irrelevant to the U.S. security. What is important is the maintenance of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). So it has probably been decided that efforts have to be made to prevent the DPRK from quitting the NPT, with eyes closed to bygone facts." The DPRK is letting IAEA staff members stay on to watch the replacement of fuel rods, despite the fact it has withdrawn from the IAEA. A slight chance is still left for resumption of a dialogue with the United States.
