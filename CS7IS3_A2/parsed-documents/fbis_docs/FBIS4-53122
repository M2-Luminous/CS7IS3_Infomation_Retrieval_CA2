FBIS4-53122 "dreas095_l_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-095 Daily Report 12 May 1994 Philippines Communist Group Steps Up `Trial' of Officials Communist Group Steps Up `Trial' of Officials BK1605045994 Quezon City MALAYA in English 12 May 94 pp 1, 3 BK1605045994 Quezon City MALAYA English BFN [Text] Senate President Edgardo Angara, Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr., House Majority Leader Ronaldo Zamora, and all Cabinet members except Health Secretary Juan Flavier are now being tried by the people's court of the armed group Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB). Sergio Ramirez, spokesman of the ABB which claimed the Saturday gunslaying of Chief Inspector Timoteo Zarcal yesterday said Angara and De Venecia are being tried for their alleged involvement in the acquisition of behest loans and for "enriching themselves at the expense of the masses." Without giving details, Ramirez said the Cabinet men, except Flavier who is pro-people, are being tried for "sins against the masses." The other day, Filemon Lagman aka Carlos Forte, chairman of the breakaway group Manila-Rizal Committee, said his group is targeting De Venecia, Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim, Presidential Legal Adviser Antonio Carpio, and Senior Supt. [Superintendent] Romeo B. Maganto, WPDC [Western Police District Command] deputy director for administration. He said Pring was also targeted but he proved to be a "slippery target." He also said the ABB is pursuing a public relations campaign by ridding the metropolis of criminals, a task the government has failed to accomplish. Reacting to Ramirez' statements, Angara said: "I welcome the investigation. Wala naman tayong ginawa na masama sa taongbayan. Sana'y tapusin lang nila kaagad [I have not done anything wrong to the people. Hopefully, they'll conclude it as soon as possible.]" He expressed confidence that an inquiry, if it will be on allegations that he benefited from the grant of behest loans to the Batong Buhay [Live Stone] Gold Mines, will finally clear him of the charges. He reiterated that as nominal director of the firm, he did not participate in decision-making in the company. De Venecia Jr. refused to believe he was in the ABB hit list. He quoted Carpio as saying his (De Venecia's) name was included in the supposed ABB hit list by "political enemies." He refused to identify the "enemies." "This is just black propaganda. They're making it legitimate through you guys," De Venecia told reporters. Maganto belittled the threat saying, "Matagal na `yan. Di na `ko nagre-react diyan [It has been there for so long. I don't react to it anymore]," he said. President Ramos said police reports dispute the ABB's claim. "The police progress reports indicate that it is not necessarily that the ABB did the killing. That is not the conclusion on the part of the police. They are looking at other angles," the president said in his weekly conference. He also belittled the ABB's continuing threat to kill officials. "This is not new. They have been making all kinds of threats in the past and they have always wanted to disrupt our society and the well-being and peace of mind of our people." Senior Supt. Hermogenes E. Ebdane Jr., director of the Western Police District Command, said probers are not "buying hook, line, and sinker" the ABB claim. "We are pursuing all angles in our ongoing investigation. We will come out with a statement after we have gathered sufficient evidence," he said. Ebdane also said the WPDC will honor Zarcal during his burial next week. Despite Zarcal's dismissal from the police force, the WPDC still considers him a policeman, Ebdane said. Zarcal is an organic member of WPDC. The Western Police District Command released cartographic sketches of two of six suspects in the Zarcal murder. One of them is 24 to 26 years old, 5'6" to 5'7" tall, of medium build, and dark complexion. He hit Zarcal in the left temple. The second is 25 to 30 years old, 5'4" to 5'5" tall, of medium build, and brown complexion. He monitored Zarcal's movements prior to the attack. Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon appealed to the ABB to stop summary execution of government officials allegedly involved in corrupt and nefarious activities. While there are defects in the country's justice system, Drilon said, no group should take the law into its hands. Steps are being taken by government to correct defects in the criminal system and strengthen the rule of law," Drilon added.
