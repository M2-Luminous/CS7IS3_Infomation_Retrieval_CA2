Speaking today at a China petroleum investment conference being held here, he said that in the medium to long-term plan, China will "take coal as the basis and electric power the focus in developing energy resources." At the same time, he said, it is necessary to make great efforts to develop fine quality, relatively clean energy sources such as oil and natural gas. More than 300 world oil leaders, senior executives, bankers and experts attended the two-day conference, the highest ranking of its kind so far held in China. Chen said that in order to ensure an average annual growth rate of 8-9 percent for China's national economy in the 1990s, developing and conserving energy should be equally stressed. By maintaining the energy saving rate at the average annual level of 3.6 percent during the 1980s, China's annual energy consumption increase in the coming years will be kept below 4 percent, he added. The minister said that by the year 2000, China is expected to produce 160-170 million tons of oil and some 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Last year the production of oil was 150 million tons and that of natural gas was 16 billion cubic meters. Meanwhile, Chen said, China's electric power output is continuing to grow at an average annual rate of more than 8 percent in the 1990s, with power generating capacity increasing by about 15 million kilowatts each year. He pledged that the government will help create a more favorable climate for the development of the energy industry through deepened reforms and greater openness. China has lifted controls over coal pricing and is adjusting the prices of electric power to ensure a reasonable return for investors. The prices of oil and natural gas will be gradually brought in line with those on the international markets. Chen said that state-owned large and medium-sized energy enterprises, the main body of China's energy industry, should be introduced to the modern corporate system through a change-over of the management mechanism, in order to develop even better in a market economy. He said that state development banks will grant preferential loans to accelerate the construction of the energy industry. In addition, he said, initiatives should be taken to attract local funds and socially idle funds to energy investment, by forming joint ventures and share-holding companies. He said that the Chinese Government will continue to encourage and support the energy industry to open wider to the outside world and welcomes international investors to enter fields such as onshore oil, offshore oil, petrochemicals, electric power and coal. The participants discussed issues concerning joint and cooperative exploration of China's oil and natural gas resources and voiced their views at the forum aimed to increase understanding and exchange information. The conference, sponsored by the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and China's four oil and petrochemical giants, ended here today.
