"Give us a break," he said. "To allow ourselves to be lectured and hectored on freedom and human rights after 100 years of struggle to regain our own liberty and human dignity, by those who participated in or benefited from our subjugation, is to willingly suffer impudence." Datuk Sri Anwar was speaking at The Asia Society's business conference at Shangri-La Hotel. He said that the debate between the developed and developing world had not achieved anything because of the "cultural arrogance" of the West. "There are those who consider they still have a civilising mission in Asia, namely to sermonise Asians about freedom and human rights." Datuk Sri Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, acknowledged that Asia had to catch up in many areas. Countries like China and Vietnam had adjusted to join the world community. But Europe and North America had to contend with a host of economic, social and political problems in recent years, he said. "While Asian countries have made the necessary adjustments, the West too need the will and vision to steer their societies out of the present morass."
