FR940110-1-00077 FR940110-1-00006 (A) Pass the entire grant on to the recipient; (B) Use the entire grant to lower the interest rate on a loan to the borrower; or (C) Lend the entire grant to the borrower to finance a rental housing project for a term of not less than 30 years, with all principal and interest payments deferred until the end of such term. If such loan is repaid before the end of the 30-year term, the entire amount of the grant must be repaid to the applicant, which in turn must forward the funds to the Bank to be used for additional AHP projects. This is a change from the provision in the Board's existing policy guidelines that prohibits a loan fund or loan consortium from using a grant from an applicant to make a loan to the borrower. The Board believes that if a loan fund or loan consortium lends a grant to a sponsor to finance rental housing units that will remain affordable for and occupied by income-eligible households for not less than 30 years, with all principal and interest payments deferred until the end of the loan term, then the loan fund or loan consortium has passed on the full amount of the AHP subsidy to the recipient or borrower of the funds, as required by section 10(j)(9)(E) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(E). However, if the borrower repays the loan before maturity, the entire amount of the subsidy must be repaid to the applicant and forwarded by the applicant to the Bank to be returned to the AHP fund. Therefore, a loan fund or loan consortium may use a grant under the AHP to make a loan to the borrower under the conditions specified in ยง960.17(c)(2)(i)(C) of the proposed rule. Section 960.17(c)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that if a loan fund or loan consortium provides both a loan and a grant to the borrower and the loan fund or loan consortium charges an origination fee for providing the loan, then any fee charged by the loan fund or loan consortium for providing the grant may not be paid with AHP subsidized advances or direct subsidies. The Board does not believe that such funds should be used to pay a fee for providing a grant to a project if the loan fund or loan consortium charges a fee for underwriting a loan to the same project. Section 960.17(c)(2)(iii) of the proposed rule provides that when a loan fund or loan consortium receives a grant from an applicant pursuant to the AHP and uses the grant to lower the interest rate on a loan to the borrower, the interest rate calculation must be consistent with the procedure used by the Bank for calculating the amount of AHP subsidy needed for a subsidized advance, taking into account the source of funds used by the loan fund or loan consortium for its loans and the rate that normally would be charged for a loan of the type and term that is provided to the borrower.
