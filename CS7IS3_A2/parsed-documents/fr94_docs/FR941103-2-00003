FR941103-2-00003 FR941103-2-00002 Forest Service Bear Valley Ski Area Expansion, Stanislaus National Forest, Alpine County, CA AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice; intent to prepare environmental impact statement, delay in filing final environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: The Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement for the expansion of the Mt. Reba Ski Area was published in the Federal Register on Friday, October 30, 1981, 46 FR 53734. A Revised Notice of Intent setting new dates for the release of the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) and the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) was published in the Federal Register on Thursday, September 23, 1982, 47 FR 42011. Another Revised Notice of Intent setting new dates for the release of the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) and the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) was published in the Federal Register on Friday, July 7, 1989, 54 FR 28704. The scoping process included numerous public meetings and Forest Service interdisciplinary team analysis. The DEIS was released on December 20, 1990. Five alternatives were identified, including a No Action Alternative, a Full Development Alternative, and a Preferred Alternative which would authorize a 450 acre expansion. The primary issues addressed include transportation system, parking, and local community services effects. The decision to be made is to select an Alternative or modify an Alternative(s) in response to the ski area expansion proposal. The comment period for the DEIS ended March 4, 1991. In June of 1991, a change of ownership of the permitted facilities occurred and a new Special Use Permit was issued to the Bear Valley Ski Company. Due to planning priorities on the Forest, and in order for the new Bear Valley Ski Company to have time to evaluate the expansion proposal, the expansion planning project was put aside until the fall of 1992. During the latter part of 1992 and early 1993, the planning process was once again put on hold when the Forest Service was developing a policy and program to address management of spotted owl habitat in California. In the summer of 1993, the Forest Service made a decision that any spotted owl potential habitat would be evaluated prior to final approval of actual habitat disturbing activity. This cleared the continuation of the planning process. The estimated date for filing the FEIS is August, 1994.
