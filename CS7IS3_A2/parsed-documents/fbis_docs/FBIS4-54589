Kadar later told reporters that the protocol leaves the agreement essentially unchanged, with only customs elimination deadlines modified. Accordingly, duties on CEFTA goods -- with the exception of farm and food products -- will be scrapped by January 1, 1998, three years ahead of schedule. As for deregulation of trade in agricultural products, from July 1 duties on Hungarian exports to Poland will be cut by 50 percent. The original agreement called for these duties to drop by 20 percent in two years, and by 50 percent in five years. Hungary agreed with Czech and Slovak partners to lower duties on farm goods by 50 percent, instead of 20 percent, by January 1, 1997. The ministers said they expected trade liberalization between the four countries to improve European Union accession chances and offer better market access for a wide circle of regional exporters.
