His proposal was prompted by the scandal involving the Homsany Group, which the National Bank of Panama [BNP] and the Comptroller General's Office are accusing of stealing millions of balboas from the BNP. "We cannot let the secrecy of corporations serve to commit crimes," Comptroller Chen said. He said that in this particular case his office is using a precedent set by Panamanian law regarding corporations. It would be up to the courts to determine if it is possible to remove the cover of secrecy from corporations, he said. Regarding meddling by the Comptroller General's Office in this case, he said the office acted according to its responsibility and the law through the Directorate for the Recovery of State Property. In those instances, the delegated District Attorney's Office continues gathering evidence, which clearly proves a crime was comitted. The Homsany Group is trying to evade justice by using the veil of corporations. "I hope the courts will do their work and that the proofs--which are categorical--will be sufficient for justice to prevail in Panama." Chen Barria described what the Homsany Group did--using 38 companies to steal 5.6 million balboas--as detrimental to the BNP's funds, which belong to all Panamanians. In fact, 33 out of these 38 companies were never in business, but their legal representatives and those who signed as loan debtors were employees earning between $200 and $250. "All of this shows a duly structured and planned crime," Chen Barria commented. The companies involved in this crime are not operating, but the comptroller general revealed that the Homsany Group is running these companies under other corporations.
