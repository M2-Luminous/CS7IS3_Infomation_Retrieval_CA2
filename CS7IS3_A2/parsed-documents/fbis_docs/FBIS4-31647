Mikuljanac: "Vojislav Seselj -- `Milosevic Wants To Remove Karadzic'"] [Text] The unification of the Srpska republic and the republic of Serbian Krajina with Yugoslavia is not in Slobodan Milosevic's interest as that would mean having 1.5 million voters out of whom not even 100,000 would vote for him, Vojislav Seselj, chairman of the Serbian Radical Party, said at a news conference yesterday. Seselj claims that Milosevic had constructed a plan (supported by the West) for a four-month truce in Bosnia, so that he could organize elections during that time and, with the help of the State Security Service, secure Karadzic's defeat at them. However, when it became clear to him that Karadzic cannot be defeated at elections "even with tricks," Milosevic decided in favor of a one-month truce and uninstitutional methods in order to replace Karadzic, Seselj said. The Radicals have nevertheless said that they support any kind of truce, even a one-month one, although, according to them, one should insist on a permanent cease-fire and a separation at the achieved front lines. Seselj sees the recent statement by [FRY President] Zoran Lilic at the recent Trade Union meeting in Belgrade as proof that a showdown between Milosevic and Karadzic is in the offing. "With that statement, Lilic has weakened the Serbs' negotiating positions in Geneva, so now he should be careful lest he experience [Dobrica] Cosic's fate, as he has also been violating the Constitution," Seselj said and added that "there is absolutely no doubt that Lilic is in fact Milosevic's mouthpiece." Yesterday, the Radicals also distributed to journalists photocopies of ("top secret") orders on handing over weapons belonging to the Yugoslav People's Army's to the former Bosnian Territorial Defense. According to these documents (and Seselj claims that he has many more such papers), in September of 1991, Generals Nikola Uzelac and Zivan Mircetic approved of several hundred pieces of infantry weapons and the appropriate quantity of ammunition being given over to territorial defense commands in Bosanska Krupa, Cazin, and Velika Kladusa. Seselj claims that these documents prove a direct involvement of the League of Communists-Movement for Yugoslavia in arming the Muslims just before the war broke out.
