Members of the Political Executive Committee attended 12 rayon party conferences. In most cases the communists favored the unity of party ranks and expressed the wish that the all-Russian party conference pass a resolution on permanent membership in the UCP-CPSU. In Dzerzhinskiy Rayon, however, delegates supporting the UCP-CPSU were kept out of the party conference. In Proletarskiy Rayon the conference rejected the previously approved plan for UCP-CPSU membership, as a result of which the three largest primary party organizations announced their withdrawal from this rayon organization of the CPRF. An initiating group made up of members of the CPRF gorkom, including two members of the UCP-CPSU Council, is organizing a parallel municipal party conference. They have invited delegates from CPSU organizations which did not join any of the active communist parties in Russia and from the CPSU party organizations which do belong to the CPRF but do not agree with its leaders' views and are not certain that the all-Russian party conference will settle the issue of CPRF membership in the UCP-CPSU in a positive manner. The UCP-CPSU Political Executive Committee feels that the withdrawal of CPSU organizations from the CPRF and the organization of a parallel municipal conference are inadvisable. This will fragment communist forces again and can benefit only the anti-people regime. The communists agree on the main goal--restoration of a single Union state, a soviet government, and the socialist pattern of development. Existing ideological and organizational disagreements can be settled at an all-party conference in accordance with the CPRF Charter. Today, however, communists must concentrate on work in labor collectives, discussion and finalization of CPRF policy-planning documents, and the choice of delegates to the all-Russian party conference from among comrades agreeing with the resolutions of the 29th CPSU Congress and the UCP-CPSU Program and Charter and favoring the CPRF's full membership in the UCP-CPSU. The preparations for the 124th anniversary of V.I. Lenin's birth were discussed at the meeting. The Political Executive Committee advised all parties and movements regarding Leninism as their ideological foundation to commemorate this important date with joint ceremonial gatherings and rallies and a weekend tour of places of significance in Lenin's life and the monuments to the leader of the world proletariat. A statement was adopted on the results of E. Shevardnadze's meetings with the leaders of the United States, United Nations, and NATO and the resulting escalation of tension in the Caucasus.
