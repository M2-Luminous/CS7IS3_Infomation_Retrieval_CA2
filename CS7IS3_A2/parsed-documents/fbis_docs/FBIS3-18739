The rest will follow." Gianfranco Fini said that he has never believed in either opinion polls or horoscopes but is going to war in the belief that he will return home with a fine booty of votes. The National Alliance leader is so confident as to be challenging [Northern League leader] Bossi on the latter's own territory: "Last Sunday [27 February] I was in Bergamo for a rally. It was extremely cold, but there were a lot of people there... The League leader will suffer a rude awakening after the elections." [Caviglia] Let us take things in order. Why must the defeat of the center precede that of the left? [Fini] Because it will signify the end of any misunderstandings. If [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli are still able to deceive the Italian people and to grab a handful of votes, then we will have a situation of ungovernability, with every possible attempt at clumsy pacts and institutional governments. Or perhaps a new edition of the center-left which, because of the new balance of forces, will be called the left-center and have a nonconfessional rather than a Catholic leadership. This is the surest way to recycle old faces such as [lower house speaker] Napolitano or [Prime Minister] Ciampi, who is a man for all seasons. I see that he has now set his sights on the Quirinale Palace [president's office]. I think that the time has come for him to retire. [Caviglia] So do you also think, as many others do, that the next parliament will be more ungovernable than ever? [Fini] No, no, on the contrary. I believe that a center-right numerical majority can be achieved. But in order for it to become a political majority, it needs to see whether the League will accept the points that we consider fundamental, such as national identity and solidarity. This was discussed in past weeks, but no answer has ever been received. [Caviglia] Such an agreement seems very unlikely at the moment. Bossi still attacks you at every opportunity... [Fini] It is the voters who will decide on this, too. I expect an adjustment of the balance among the forces immune to [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary ] Occhetto, a result that will scale down the League's presumptions by reducing its vote. The League formed an alliance with Forza Italia partly in order to conceal its electoral decline. But the result will be very apparent in the proportional quota. [Caviglia] You surely do not expect to have deputies and senators elected in the League's north? [Fini] I certainly do. How many there will be, I cannot tell you, but you can be sure that the National Alliance will not be a force enjoying electoral support only in the south. This, especially since Bossi is still doing his utmost to make his rude reawakening even more painful for himself. By attacking us and the center-right, he is repelling the very voters who have hitherto voted for the League because they had nothing else. [Caviglia] At the moment there is talk about a League prime minister, perhaps with the National Alliance in a position of external support, or about a minority government. What do you think? [Fini] A League prime minister? No, that is impossible for several reasons, not least the League's representation solely in the north. It is unreasonable to entrust the government to a politician who is unknown in two-thirds of Italy. [Caviglia] So whom do you see as prime minister? [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi? [Fini] To name individuals now means not only to ruin their prospects, but to set the cart before the horse. This will be discussed after the elections, in the light of the results. [Caviglia] In your latest confrontation with Occhetto, Berlusconi was virtually the sole topic of conversation... [Fini] Well, Occhetto did indeed always return to that, perhaps because he felt uncomfortable talking about substantive matters. Berlusconi deserves credit for having ruined the plans of the left, which was already savoring victory and which is now terrified. This is why he is being diabolized. [Caviglia] Are you as confident about the opinion polls, which for weeks have been forecasting a victory by the center-right? [Fini] Opinion polls never excite me nor depress me. But it is true that I am confident. There is a new awareness on the part of the public, and I believe that very few people can still believe in the center alignment. It is enough to consider the business of Segni's votes. He is not gathering votes because he no longer enjoys people's confidence. [Caviglia] The latest front in the conflict is education... [Fini] Yes. It is a good test. The left has started talking about church schools. We are in favor of freedom of choice between public education and private education. [Caviglia] You will be competing with [Radical] Marco Pannella in Rome's constituency 24. How do you view this contest? [Fini] I really do not think about it. I will tell you that I will spend only two of the 25 days of the election campaign in Rome.
