Guenter Verheugen, federal manager of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), says that he is "more than happy" with the preliminary election result, which sees the SPD at about 34 percent and only marginally behind the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). It has been a "brilliant victory" for the SPD, which has made "a leap ahead" compared to the election of four years ago, but also to the European election of two weeks ago. He believes that the SPD congress in Halle and "the convincing appearance of Rudolf Scharping" have "boosted" the motivation of the voters. This means that "the race for the Bundestag election is entirely open again." He emphasizes that the CDU/Free Democratic Party of Germany (FDP) coalition government in Saxony-Anhalt has been "chased out" by the voters, thus leading to the "worst election defeat" of the past few years anywhere in Germany. As far as the Bundestag election is concerned, Verheugen says that we, the SPD, "do not want a grand coalition." The voters have to make sure that one can establish "a reformist alliance against the current government" after the October election. CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze argues that, since the CDU is ahead of the other parties, this is "a very nice success." He praises the work of new Minister President Bergner, who was elected minister president only six months ago after his predecessor resigned and whose "hard work has been honored by the voters." The "second reason" for the good result is that "the positive trend at the federal level has continued." He praises Chancellor Kohl's great efforts in the CDU's election campaign in Saxony-Anhalt. Hintze says that today's election was "not a test election" and that "it is clear" that the Bundestag election in October has not been won yet. Nevertheless, today's victory "was another important step." FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer admits that the election result, in which support for his party plummeted from approximately 14 percent in 1990 to under 4 percent today, has been a "debacle." He blames the result partly to the "poor relations" between the FDP group in the Saxony-Anhalt Landtag and the party's Land Executive Committee, something the "citizens have not forgotten." He says that the result will "certainly" have its consequences. He also points to the fact that the result clearly reflects a rejection of a coalition between the SPD, the FDP, and the Greens. The FDP now has to go into the Bundestag election and the remaining Landtag elections with "more solidarity." As far as a possible grand coalition after the next Bundestag election in Bonn is concerned, Hoyer says that this would be a "disaster for the FRG." This is why the FDP will and can fulfill "a central function" in the Bundestag election. Gregor Gysi, chairman of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) Bundestag group, which scored some 19 percent in today's poll, says that the "stabilization" of his party makes him "very secure" and "optimistic" also for the Bundestag election in October. Gysi says that the "national front" that was established against the PDS has "failed." This means that "the parties must learn to treat us differently than they have done so far." He says that in the Saxony-Anhalt Landtag there is now a "clear majority left of the CDU and the FDP" and adds that the PDS would be "ready" to "tolerate a coalition government between the SPD and Alliance 90/Greens." If the SPD were to prefer a grand coalition, then this is the SPD's "problem, not ours." Nevertheless, a grand coalition between the SPD and the CDU would "not" be a "catastrophe" for him. Marianne Birthler, spokeswoman for the Alliance 90/Greens, which won just over 5 percent of the vote, believes that the party's "still very weak structures" in eastern Germany are partly responsible for the result, which is not as good as expected. Moreover, the "potential" of voters for "clear ecological and civil rights policy" as "offered" by her party is weaker in eastern Germany than at the federal level. With regard to the good result of the PDS, Birthler says that the people know "what they do not want" but that they are still "far from knowing what they do want." Christian Social Union (CSU) Secretary General Erwin Huber stresses the necessity for all "democratic parties" to "even step up the fight" against the "left-wing extremist" and "communist" PDS. Huber believes, though, that in the Bundestag election, the voters will "vote differently." At the end, all officials express their disappointment at the low voter turnout in the Saxony-Anhalt election, which fell to some 54 percent.
