Both the participation proportion and the number of votes per candidates could differ considerably from the expected figures if an event takes place in the remaining time that considerably affects the evaluation of the political parties that enjoy greater support, namely the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn's car accident before the first round of elections was such an event. On the basis of this, it is possible that the current chances of the MSZP might change considerably if the public's ideas connected with the aforementioned accident become stronger. Such a change would also affect the chances of parties that can still count on obtaining individual mandates. At the time of this forecast, namely 10 days before the elections, it is not yet fully known who will really run in the second round from among the candidates who made it to the second round. Withdrawals, the parties' call to the voters of candidates that have withdrawn from the race, and the campaign finish will also have an effect on the real election results and the differences in forecasts. In its first prognosis regarding the second round of the elections, the Szonda Ipsos took into consideration the results of the first round as well as the trends and connections emerging from the opinion polls of recent months. We mainly considered the following factors among the research data: the voters' readiness to participate in the elections and the firmness and nature of their party affiliation; secondary preferences; the viewpoints and motivations of choosing among various individual candidates; the extent to which the candidates are known and their evaluation; and the personal factors that affect their chances. We modelled the voters' expected attitude in the second round of elections by comparing the composition of remaining candidates in various districts, the results they achieved in the first round, and the main parameters that determined the voters' decisions. According to the results based on the aforementioned considerations and the stipulations of the electoral law, we calculated the mandates of the national list according to the parties. The parliamentary mandates obtained in the first round and the most probable individual and compensatory mandates show the expected composition of the new parliament according to our current knowledge. In addition to its two mandates already obtained, the winner of the first round, the MSZP, is leading in 158 electoral districts and it will also emerge as the strongest parliamentary party after the second round. However, it will be unable to preserve its advantage in some of the electoral districts and turn this advantage into mandates. The extent of this drop is decisive regarding the possibility of obtaining the majority of parliamentary mandates or having to share two-thirds of the mandates with the SZDSZ. Regarding the possibility of an absolute majority, 10 days before the elections we cannot provide a firm answer, because the most probable figure of the MSZP mandates falls precisely on the critical border line. This means that, at the moment, we see equal chances of the MSZP falling behind the 50 percent by a few percent, and crossing this border by a few percent. Regarding the two-thirds border equally important for coalition and legislation considerations, the chances seem to be clear: There is a high probability of the MSZP and SZDSZ filling up at least two-thirds of the parliamentary places. At the same time, we must also consider the fact that a large number of citizens have double preferences, their party commitment is generally loose, and their current approach to the stronger parties has proved more unstable than previously. Just like before the first round, this time too, various media effects lead to greater uncertainty and unpredictability than usual in the voters' decisions. Along with all this, it is justified that, together with a prognosis of the election results, we should provide the realistic values of difference from the most probable values. The electoral law bans the publication of opinion poll results eight days before the elections; therefore, we will make our next forecast public on 29 May, immediately after the closure of the polls. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Expected Minimum and Maximum Mandates | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Individual mandates |All mandates | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fidesz [Federation of Yo-|0-1 |20-21 | |ung Democrats] | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |FKGP [Independent Smallh-|0-2 |25-26 | |olders Party] | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |KDNP [Christian Democrat-|2-6 |20-24 | |ic People's Party] | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |MDF [Hungarian Democrati-|12-23 |45-54 | |c Forum] | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |MSZP |108-148 |175-208 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SZDSZ |14-38 |67-86 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agrarian Alliance |0-1 |0-1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Entrepreneurs Party |0-1 |0-1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Independent candidates |0-2 |0-2 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
