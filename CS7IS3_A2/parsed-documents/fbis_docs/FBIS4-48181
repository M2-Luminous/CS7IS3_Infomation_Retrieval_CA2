All the countries neighboring Rwanda are hosts to millions of Rwandese refugees. Burundi, Zaire, Uganda and Tanzania have hosted millions of Rwandese refugees for a long time. This mission to exterminate Rwandese refugees in neighboring countries is more likely to succeed in countries where the refugees live in areas that are easily accessible from the Rwandan border. The UNHCR should take appropriate measures to preempt this impending catastrophe, otherwise they may start reacting when the situation is out of control.
