He expounded on our country's independent and self-governing peaceful foreign policy, fundamental viewpoints on the human rights issue, as well as on the issues of reform and opening up and modernization. Li Ruihuan pointed out: As in observing any other issues, it is necessary to attach importance to and study the objective reality so as to base our observation of international issues on the objective reality. There are over 180 independent sovereign states on our planet which are not totally similar in their social systems, historical and cultural traditions, nationalities and religious beliefs, and existing stages of social development but which possess their individual character. It is exactly these types of character that make our world rich and varied. As a result, different countries with different strengths and inadequacies may learn from one another and draw on the others' strengths to supplement their inadequacies; and countries with different social systems and ideologies may seek common ground while reserving differences as well as coexist peacefully. Different countries in the world also share many similar things, many common interests, common desires, and common tasks. There is commonness among them, and it is exactly this commonness that forms the foundation for international cooperation and exchanges. And, different countries, on the basis of mutual respect, may seek to establish an international code of conduct by which everyone will commonly abide through consultations on the basis of equality. This is an important condition for mankind's progress as well as an important symbol of mankind's further maturity in handling mutual relations. Mankind should transcend all kinds of outworn concepts left over by history and should jointly tackle the increasing number of problems on this planet that can only be solved with understanding and cooperation. Li Ruihuan said: During this visit, some state leaders and friends spoke on the human rights issue from different approaches and in different ways. I would like to take this opportunity to give a briefing on China's concept of human rights. First, we respect the universal principle of the international community on human rights. The correct principle on human rights generally recognized by the international community has a positive meaning for human development and progress. As a member nation of the UN Human Rights Commission, China supports UN efforts in promoting and protecting human rights as well as man's fundamental freedom, undertaken in accordance with the purpose and principles of the UN Charter. In addition, China has actively participated in various UN activities on human rights. China participated in drafting and formulating UN human rights documents and also has acceded to eight international documents on human rights, including the "Universal Declaration on Human Rights", the "Tehran Declaration," and the "Declaration on the Right to Development." China made important contributions through active participation in discussing, drafting, and formulating the "Vienna Declaration and action plan" passed at the World Conference on Human Rights last year. Second, we stress that the universal principle on human rights must be combined with the specific situations of individual countries. Like any other thing, once the human rights issue is allowed to deviate from the unification of the ordinary and exceptionalness as well as of a common and specific character, it is impossible to attain practical results, and the issue will result in empty talks. Due to different historical backgrounds, cultural traditions, and levels of socioeconomic development, each country will be different in the content and form as well as methods and measures while implementing the universal principle on human rights. It will not succeed to ask different countries to indiscriminately use the same preconceived model, continually use the same method, and adopt equal measures. The universal principle on human rights can be implemented practically only when consideration is given to various different situations. As for many developing countries, the human rights that should first be realized are the right to subsistence and the right to development. If the majority of people in these countries do not possess the minimum conditions for survival, then what more can we say about other human rights and freedoms? Currently, the people of many developing countries are living a poor and difficult life, and they are shouldering heavy burdens of foreign debt. The international community, particularly developed countries, should be concerned about the human rights situation in these countries and give full and earnest consideration to finding solutions to these problems. Third, we believe that the manifestation of human rights is a historic process. All countries are, without exception, passing through this historic process. Yet, the human rights conditions in various countries have been inevitably constrained by their levels of social progress. Meanwhile, as their societies progress and they deepen their understanding of human rights, various countries have been continually improving their human rights conditions. They cannot stay aloof from the issue as they all have the obligation to further improve their peoples' human rights standards. If we divide various countries in the world into two groups -- one group specializing in supervising other countries' human rights conditions without the need to improve those conditions in their own countries, while another group is under other countries' supervision without the right to speak up -- this action itself is a rejection of the universal principle on human rights. In fact, in some developed countries, quite a number of people live below the poverty line, and some minority nationalities are being discriminated against. They also have the problems to further improve their human rights conditions. Fourth, China guards against [jing ti 6226 1912] some countries that interfere with other countries' internal affairs on the pretext of human rights. We affirm that while pursuing the universal principle on human rights, various countries should respect one another, foster mutual understanding, seek common ground while preserving differences, and make progress together. However, we are opposed to human rights issues being used as a means to exert political pressure and to interfere with another country's internal affairs. This action itself is an encroachment on the human rights of all the people in that country. The Chinese people have been invaded and dreadfully bullied by imperialists for more than a century, and fully understand that personal human rights and freedom are closely linked with the state's sovereignty. Once the country loses its independence, all personal human rights will be lost completely. Therefore, the Chinese people are very sensitive to, and cannot stand, any form of interference in China's internal affairs. Fifth, the Chinese Government is willing to participate in international dialogues on human rights issues. It is normal for the international community to have different opinions on human rights issues. If there are differences, we can hold consultative dialogue and exchange views, but should not frequently resort to applying pressure and sanctions. Holding dialogue is better than waging confrontation. Many facts show that dialogue can enhance understanding and comprehension, eliminate misunderstandings, and attain mutual understanding. China will, as always, fulfill its own obligations as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and make its due contributions to enhancing cooperation in the international community on human rights issues. In his speech, Li Ruihuan also commented on China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive, and on the relations between China and West Europe and between China and Belgium. He said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping has profoundly pointed out: "Two conditions will decide whether China's modernization drive will succeed. The first condition is the domestic situation. We have to uphold the current policies on reform and opening up, and to maintain a peaceful and united political situation. The second condition is the international situation which is characterized by a lasting peaceful environment." The independent and peaceful foreign policy pursued by China is required for us to enhance economic and social progress. Only if the international environment is peaceful and stable for a long time, can we make concerted efforts to facilitate economic construction, carry out friendly cooperation with various countries in the world, and learn from all the advanced achievements of civilization in other countries. Diplomats, economists, and businessmen in Belgium who attended the meeting welcomed Li Ruihuan's speech. After his speech, Li Ruihuan also answered attendees' questions. Former Belgian Prime Minister Tindemans chaired today's meeting.
