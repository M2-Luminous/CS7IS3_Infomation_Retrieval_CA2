Investigators have focused their attention on the Muslim fanatic group which calls itself "Jihad" or militant Muslim groups which have been long-standing enemies of Israel. According to a report, in 1992 members of these groups detonated a bomb-laden truck which they parked in front of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 20 instantly and wounding 240 others. This method is similar to the one planned for Thailand. The C-4 explosives used in that explosion are the same type that were found in the tank on the six-wheel truck in Bangkok on 17 March. The method and type of explosive, in addition to support from terrorist groups seeking the separation of southern Thailand, led police to focus on the above mentioned groups. This theory matches the investigation result which shows that part of the financial support came from Sungai Kolok District, Narathiwat Province. Also, there must be support from residents in Thailand to facilitate travel by the suspects around the country. The Metropolitan Police investigation team's questioning of witnesses reportedly resulted in naming four suspects: Mr. Wudera Wankuwa, Mr. Konsak Ayat Manusuk, Mr. Mohamad Talao, and Mr. Asmal Dansis Hakare. The Immigration Office has been asked to check the arrival and departure records of these people.
