The State Duma has requested President Yeltsin to revise the drill expediency, bearing in mind "the Russian social-economic situation and progress towards civic peace". On the eve of signing the Civic Accord Agreement, the president said he understands the Duma's concern and recommended the defence minister to hold additional consultations with the U.S. side with due account of "the stand of Russian law-makers and the public". The presidential statement provoked diverse reaction both in Russia and abroad. Chairman of the Duma defence committee and member of the Choice of Russia faction Sergey Yushchenkov is sure the decision on holding the drill is an "exclusive prerogative of the executive power, which has nothing to do with the State Duma," and the president's stand "testifies to the weakness of the executive power and its poorly-considered actions". In his turn, presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov explained Yeltsin's stand with his striving for foreign and domestic political decisions to help the consolidation of civic accord. He denies the president's concessions to "certain forces", or, the more so, a certain cooling of the Russian leadership to the United States. Chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko told ITAR-TASS that "any politician should strive for increased combat readiness of the armed forces, and all means are important in this respect, including a possibility to interact with other armed forces". In his opinion, the drill should be held, and forces outraged with "the Yankee stepping on Russian soil" should understand "the Yankee is not an occupant but an ally". Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev thinks the same. "The drill must be held to bring the two peoples closer together if we really want to become partners and avoid the return to the cold war. The Totsk drill is symbolic," it will include only 200 servicemen on each side and a small quantity of materiel. The aim of the drill is to practice the organization of joint peace-making posts in separation, evacuation of wounded and delivery of humanitarian aid. "We must hold the drill for the sake of those we are striving to protect by our peace-making operations," said Grachev. Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Lieutenant-General Valeriy Manilov thinks the drill can be held on the area of the Russian Western Group of forces or on the Pacific coast. In his words, the question will be revised and all conclusions and proposals will be used in the final decision with due account of the public opinion. The last word is to be said by the president.
