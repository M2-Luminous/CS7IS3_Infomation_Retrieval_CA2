According to statistics by the provincial financial department, Guizhou attained 5.55 billion yuan of revenue in the 1993 fiscal year, surpassing the plan by 4.6 percent, an increase of 18.25 percent over the previous year. Tax collections amounted to more than 860 million yuan. The province's financial expenditure amounted to more than 6.69 billion yuan, an increase of 10.35 percent over the previous year. Due to a large-scale decrease in bank deposits last year, province's revenue kept declining for more than eight months. In this situation, leaders of party committees and government at all levels throughout the province carefully discussed the financial and economic situation and helped enterprises overcome difficulties in production and tax payments. [passage omitted] The provincial government also formed a leading group to strengthen financial and taxation work. As a result of common efforts in all circles, the province fulfilled the revenue and expenditure plan.
