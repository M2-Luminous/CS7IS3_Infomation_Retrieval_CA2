For purposes of the present rules: a) the term "CIS state" shall be understood to mean CIS states that have signed the Agreement on Cooperation in the Area of Foreign Economic Activity (15 May 1992, Tashkent); b) the term "country of origin of commodities" shall mean the CIS state in which the commodity was completely produced or subjected to sufficient processing. For application of the criterion of sufficient processing it shall be possible to apply the cumulative principle of origin, that is, when there is sequential processing of commodities in the CIS states these states shall be regarded as a single whole for purposes of determining origin; c) the term "criterion of sufficient processing" shall mean the term according to which the commodity in whose production two or more countries participate shall be considered to originate from the country in which it was subjected to the last essential processing sufficient for imparting to the commodity its typical feature; d) the term "customs control" shall mean the totality of measures taken by national customs organs for purposes of ensuring observance of national legislation in customs matters and also national legislation and international agreements, control over whose implementation is the responsibility of customs organs; e) the term "commodities" shall mean any mobile property including thermal, electric, and other kinds of energy transported across the customs border; f) the term "commodity classification" shall mean the Commodity Classification of Foreign Economic Activity (TN VED) used in the CIS states based on the Harmonized System of Description and Codification of Commodities and the combined tariff-statistical classification of the EC. The procedure for determining the country of origin of commodities shipped onto the customs territory of the CIS states from third countries and shipped to third countries from the states shall be regulated by national legislation of the CIS states. 1. The country of origin of a commodity shall be considered to be the state where the commodity was completely produced or subjected to sufficient processing. 2. The following commodities shall be considered to have been fully produced in the given country: a) minerals extracted on its territory or in its territorial waters, on its continental shelf and in the seas if the country has exclusive rights to the development of these minerals; b) vegetable products raised and harvested on its territory; c) living animals born and raised in it; d) products obtained in this country from raising animals there; e) products of hunting, fishing, and sea fishing; f) products of sea fishing caught and/or produced in the world ocean by ships of the given country or ships leased (chartered) by it; g) secondary raw material and wastes which are the result of production and other operations conducted in the given country; h) high technology products obtained in open space on space ships belonging to the given country or leased by it; i) commodities produced in the given country exclusively from products mentioned in subpoints "a"-"h" of point 2. 3. When two or more countries participate in the production of a commodity, the origin of the commodity shall be determined according to the criterion of "sufficient processing." 4. The criterion of "sufficient processing" may be reflected: a) by a rule that requires a change in the tariff position of the corresponding commodity classification with a list of exceptions: (Footnote 1) (The list of exceptions may include: a) a list of production or technological operations which, although they lead to a change in the commodity position, are not considered a sign of sufficient processing or are considered such only with observance of certain conditions; b) a list of production or technological operations which, although they do not lead to a change in the tariff position, are considered a sign of sufficient processing with the observance of certain conditions. The conditions mentioned in subpoints "a" and "b" may pertain both to operations conducted with the commodity and to the rule of "ad valorem share.") b) a list of production or technological processes either adequate or inadequate for the commodity to be considered as originating from the country where these processes took place; c) the rule of "ad valorem share" when the percentage share of the value of the utilized materials or added value reaches a fixed level in the price of the franco-plant delivered commodity. 5. In the event that the criterion of origin of the commodity is not especially stipulated with respect to specific commodities or a specific country (countries), the general rule shall be applied whereby a commodity is considered to have been subjected to sufficient processing if there has been a change in the commodity position (classification code of the commodity) on the Commodity Classification at the level of any of the first four indicators. The following shall be regarded as not meeting the criterion of sufficient processing: a) operations for providing for preservation of the commodities during storage or transportation; b) operations for preparing the commodities for sale and transportation (breaking down batches, forming shipments, sorting, repackaging); c) simple assembly operations; d) switching of commodities (components) without imparting to the product obtained characteristics that are significantly different from its initial ones; e) a combination of two or more of the aforementioned operations; f) slaughter of livestock. 6. In the event that the criterion of "sufficient processing" is reflected through the ad valorem share, the value indicators shall be calculated: a) for imported materials--according to the customs value, that is, the value subject to customs duties when shipped in (on the basis of the SIF [expansion not indicated]) or in the event that their origin is unknown--at the price established for the first sale on the territory of the country where the production is being carried out; b) for finished commodities--at the price franco-plant or export price of the seller. 7. Objects in disassembled or unassembled form shipped in several batches when because of production or transportation conditions it is impossible to ship them as one batch (Footnote 2) (This rule shall also be applied in cases where the batch has been broken down into several by mistake or because of incorrect addressing.) must be regarded, at the request of the importer, as a single object from the standpoint of determining origin. (Footnote 3) (The conditions for the application of this rule shall be: preliminary notification of the customs office where it is shipped in of the breakdown of a disassembled or unassembled commodity into several branches with an indication of the reasons for this breakdown, a detailed specification of the contents of each batch referring to the TN VED, the value, and the country of origin of the commodities included in each batch; the delivery of all batches from one country and by one exporter; the shipment of all batches through one customs office; the delivery of all batches of commodities by a date not exceeding six months from the date of the first dispatch.) 8. For purposes of determining the origin of commodities, the origin of thermal and electric energy, machines, equipment, and instruments used for their production shall not be taken into account. 9. A commodity is considered to have originated from the country of export only if this commodity not only meets the criterion of origin and other conditions established by the present Rules but also is purchased directly from an enterprise or firm registered in keeping with the established procedure in the exporting country and is imported through direct dispatch from this country to the importing country. The requirement of direct shipment shall also be met by commodities transported through the territory of one or several of the countries as a result of geographical, transportation, technical, or economic factors and also when they are temporarily shipped into or warehoused on the territory of these countries under the condition that the commodities remain the whole time under the customs control of the country of transit. Additionally, the rules of direct dispatch are complied with by commodities purchased by an importer at exhibits or trade fairs under the condition that these commodities were not used for purposes other than exhibits after dispatch to the exhibition or trade fair and remained under customs control during the course of the exhibition or trade fair. 10. When certifying the origin of the commodity in the given CIS state it is necessary to submit to the customs organs of the country into which it is shipped a declaration-certificate (hereinafter referred to as certificate) concerning the origin of the commodity. 11. When commodities are exported from the CIS states the certificate of origin shall be issued by an organ of the country of origin of the commodity authorized in compliance with national legislation. The CIS states shall exchange samples of stamps of organs and signatures of individuals authorized to endorse the certificates. The certificates shall be considered invalid without the aforementioned samples and the preferences envisioned by agreements on trading conditions shall not apply. 12. The certificate must contain the following necessary information about the commodity for which it is issued: a) name and address of exporter; b) name and address of importer; c) means of transportation and route of travel (to the extent that this is known); d) the number of places and kinds of packaging and a description of the commodity containing all the information necessary to identify the commodity; e) weight brutto and netto. (Footnote 4) (These indicators may be replaced by others such, for example, as the number of units or volume when the weight of the commodity changes significantly during transportation or when these units are regularly applied to the given type of commodity.) 13. The certificate of origin must clearly state that the given commodity originates in the corresponding country, that is, it must contain: a) a written declaration from the exporter to the effect that the commodity meets the corresponding criterion of origin; b) a written certification from the authorized organ that issued the certificate to the effect that the information presented by the exporter on the certificate is accurate. 14. The certificate of origin shall be submitted to customs organs in typed form without corrections in the Russian language. 15. The certificate of origin shall be submitted along with the freight customs declaration and other documents necessary when filling out customs documentation. 16. In the event of the loss of the certificate of origin an officially notarized duplicate (copy) shall be accepted. 17. On a certificate of origin for small batches of commodities (valued at up to $5,000) the exporter may declare the country of origin of the commodity on the shipping invoice or other accompanying documents attached to the commodity. 18. If there are doubts about the accuracy of the certificate of origin or the information contained in it the customs organs shall apply to the authorized organizations that endorse the certificate or other authorized organs of the country indicated as the country of origin of the commodities with a justified request to provide additional or clarifying information. 19. The commodity shall not be regarded as having originated in a given country until the proper confirmation of origin or the requested information is provided. 20. As a general rule, failure to provide the properly filled out certificate of origin or information about the origin shall not be considered grounds for refusing to let the freight pass. The customs office may refuse to let freight pass only if there are sufficient grounds to assume that it originated in a country whose commodities must not be allowed into the country in compliance with international agreements in effect for this state and/or its national legislation. Taking into account the provisions of the second paragraph of the present point, commodities whose origin has not been reliably established are allowed to be shipped into the country with the payment of customs duties at the maximum rates of the customs tariff of the country into which they are being shipped. 21. Most favored nation or preferential conditions may be applied to commodities indicated in the third paragraph of point 20 upon receipt of the proper certification of their origin no later than a year after the delivery (output) of the commodity. Figure [box, p 17] Resolution on Changing Points 9 and 10 of the Rules for Determining the Country of Origin of Commodities In connection with the conclusion of the Agreement on the Creation of a Free Trade Zone and the need to change Points 9 and 10 of the Rules for Determining the Country of Origin of Commodities of 24 September 1993, the heads of the governments of the states participating in the Commonwealth of Independent States have resolved: 1. Points 9 and 10 shall be worded as follows: "9. A commodity shall be considered have originated on the customs territory of a state participating in the Agreement on the Creation of a Free Trade Zone if it meets the criteria for origin established by the present Rules and is acquired by a resident of one of the states participating in the Agreement on the Creation of a Free Trade Zone. "10. As certification of the origin of a commodity on the customs territory of a state participating in the Agreement on the Creation of a Free Trade Zone it is necessary to submit to the customs organs of the state to which it is shipped a declaration-certificate of the origin of the commodity (form ST-1 is attached) issued by an authorized organ of the country of origin participating in the Agreement on the Creation of a Free Trade Zone." 2. The rules for determining the country of origin of a commodity, taking into account the changes that have been made, shall be applied only for participants in the Agreement on the Creation of a Free Trade Zone. Done in the city of Moscow on 15 April 1994 in one authentic copy in the Russian language. The authentic copy shall be stored in the Archives of the Government of the Republic of Belarus, which will send a certified copy to the states that signed the present Resolution.
