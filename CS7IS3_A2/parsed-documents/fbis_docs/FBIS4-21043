The document was signed by Cuban Justice Minister Carlos Amat and Argentina's Secretary of State Alberto Lestelle. Lestelle said Cuba "has important traffic by large (drug) producers in the south and important traffic by large consumers in the north." The island "still does not have consumption problems but is facing an incipient trafficking problem," the secretary added. Cuban Justice Vice Minister Zenaida Osorio, who was mentioned by PRENSA LATINA, said: "The development of tourism and the opening of the country to foreign investors might also attract traffickers." Secretary of State Lestelle, the highest ranking Argentine federal authority on the repression of trafficking and addiction prevention, after signing the agreement said the document will enable the exchange of information between specialized security organizations from the two countries. For this work, Lestelle said Argentina uses the National Maritime Prefecture and the National Border Police. Lestelle said that under the "mutual agreement," an ad-hoc committee has been created--its members will be appointed later--to define the way this information cooperation and exchange will operate. The agreement also covers social assistance and the legal aspects of trafficking repression and consumption prevention. Lestelle said that in the Central American and Caribbean region, Argentina has similar cooperation agreements with Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Guatemala and similar proposals are being negotiated with Nicaragua and Honduras.
