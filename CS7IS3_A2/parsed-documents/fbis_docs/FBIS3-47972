[passage omitted] 'The external economic relations have been broadened in the line of diversification and multilaterization. We have overcome the consequences of the sudden [words missing] of our traditional market, widened the interflow with new partners, and increased the export value by roughly 20 per cent annually. Up to the end of 1993, we have granted 836 licences for direct foreign investment with a total registered capital of 7.5 billion USD recorded initial successes in attracting more development assistance and loans on preferential terms from governments and reestablished normal relations with international financial and monetary institutions. 'The economy has started to yield internal accumulations, albeit small. The life of the majority of the population has been improved. 'A multi-sector economic structure is taking shape. Initial steps have been taken to re-arrange and re-register state enterprises. The number of long-time loss-making enterprises has been largely reduced. The number of efficient business units has increased. In general, the state economic sector has kept developing and continues to hold key areas and a leading role in the national economy its share in GDP has grown from 34 per cent in 1990 to 39.9 per cent in 1992. Since the 5th plenum of the Central Committee, the agricultural cooperatives have got a more clearly defined orientation for renewal the autonomous role of the peasant households has been confirmed. New forms of the cooperative aconomy have appeared. Wuth the land law formally granting peasants the right to use land has got additional development motive. The individual economy on a stable and durable basis, the peasant household economy and private capitalist economy have developed considerably. There have emerged a growing number of stock holding enterprises and joint ventures with investments from various forms of ownership. 'The market mechanism under management by the state and with socialist orientation is becoming the operational mechanism of the economy. The amendment of laws and the continous renewal of the mechanism and policies related to planning, pricing, exchange rates, finance, banking, labour, remuneration, land..., have created a more favourable environment for the enterprises to bring into full play their dynamism, autonomy and self-responsibility in production and business. 'The state has accumulated more experience, and made progress in the macro-management and administration of the national economy... 'The second most important achievement is that we have maintained and consolidated political stability. 'Thanks to the many-sided achievements of renewal, especially socio-economic achievements, thanks to the firm leadership of the party and the political awareness of the people and armed forces throughout the country, we have surmounted the recent political upheaval in the world. The party's leading role has been consolidated, the state's management effeciveness has been heightened, democracy has been broadened, national defence and security have been secured, the people's confidence in the party, the state and the renewal process has been strengthened, and the mass movement in certain economic and social fields has been some development... 'The third achievement is that our external relations have been expanded, our country's prestige in the world has been heightened, and a favourable international environment has been created for our efforts in national construction and defence. 'The 7th congress defined the task related to our foreign policy which is to maintain peace, broaden relations of friendship and cooperation, create favourable international conditions for national construction and defence, while actively contributing to the common struggle of the world people for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress. The congress emphasized the open character of our foreign policy: 'Vietnam wishes to be a friend of all nations in the world community, endeavouring for peace, independence and development.' 'In the face of the new developments of the world and regional situation after the 7th congress, the third plenum of the central committee concretized and developed that line. We have taken the initiative and actively expanded our external activities, and have recorded very important results. 'We have restored normal relations with the People's Republic of China and initially developed relations of friendship and cooperation with it, 'strengthened and consolidated our relationship of special solidarity with the Lao People's Democratic Republic, signed and strictly implemented the Paris Agreement on Cambodia, and established friendly neighbour relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia. 'We have improved and opened a new stage in our relations of cooperation and friendship with ASEAN vountries and with ASEAN as an organization and expanded our relations with other countries in Asia and the Pacific. 'We have preserved and developed our traditional relations with Cuba, India and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 'We have maintained and promoted our existing relations of cooperation with the Russian Federation, other countries of the former Soviet Union, and Eastern European countries. 'We have accorded continuous support to the just cause of the peoples of Palestine, other Arab nations and South Africa, broadened our relations with developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America and contributed actively to the consolidation of the Non- Aligned Movement and the promotion of its role in the new situation. 'We have improved our relations with countries of Western Europe, Northern Europe and the European Economic Community, with Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and newly industrialized countries. We have restored normal relations with international financial and monetary organizations. The process of struggle to get the United States lift the embargo and normalize relations with Vietnam has made certain progress'. On weaknesses and and newly emerging issues, the report says: 'The ecomomy retains the character of a backward agricultural economy. Industries remain minor and infrastructure facilities, underdeveloped. Not much has been achieved in the construction of the material and technical basis. Accumulation from within the economy and develophent investments are still limited and not given adequate attention. Although the economy has known a fairly high growth rate, productivity, quality and efficiency remain very low. Not much production capacity has been added up as a reserve force to be utilized in the time to come, leaving negative effects on the growth tempo of the coming years. '... Certain achievements have been recorded in the cultural and social fields, but here, many major and urgent problems remain unsolved. 'Total or partial unemployment in both urban and rural areas, especially among young people coming of labour age, remains aburning question and one of the basic causes of social evils. 'The policies related to social equity have not been properly implemented. Beside people who get rich by lawful means, there are not a few who have got rich quickly through illicit businesses. Meanwhile, many families who made great sacrifices and suffered great losses duging the wars of resistance, or who rendered great services to the motherland, are still beleaguered with difficulties. The number of persons living in poverty and food shortage is still high. The people's living standards are still very low in many areas, especially on the highlands, in out-of-the-way places, and localities inhabited by ethnic minorities... 'In the political situation, there remain many complicated factors not to be slighted. 'The party and state agencies and offices are not yet really pure and steady. Political security is still indequate and social order yet to be secured'... Part ii on the main tasks for the coming period, the report points out: 'Our people are faced with acute challenges as well as great opportunities. 'The challenges are: the danger of our economy falling further behind other countries in the region and the world due to our low starting point, our still low and unstable growth rate and to the fact that we have to develop in an environment of tough competition the possibility of our going astray from the socialist orientation if we fail to correct errors in the conduct of the implementation and our failure to repel corruption and other social evils the scheme and acts of 'peaceful evolution' by hostile forces. 'However, we also have many fundamental advantages: our party has set out a correct line, is of one mind and united our people are diligent, intelligent and patriotic, possessed of a firm character and a staunch revolutionary will, and confident in the party leadership, the armed forces are absolutely loyal to our party's and people's revolutionary cause, our successes in the cause of renewal are giving the country a new posture and strength to more forward the development of the scientific and technological revolution and the tendency toward broad cooperation for development in the world and the region are providing us with possible additional resources of importance...[as received] Following are the main tasks: 'To encourage the economic restructuring along the line of industrialization and modernization... 'To consistently effect policies for the development of a multisector economy, create more motivations and favourable environment for the economic sectors and businesses of all forms to make fast development and achieve high efficiency... 'To build synchronously the market mechanism under state management and with socialist orientation... 'To care for cultural and social matters: the guiding idea threading through the party and state decisions and policies in the cultural and social fields is to care for, foster and promote the human factor as both motive and objective of the revolution. Outstanding problems in this work now are employment, social justice, improvement of the people's intellectual level, making the society wholesome and preserving and promoting the national cultural identity... ...'Fighting against corruption is a burning and pressing problem at present. It must be carried out in a resolved and thorough manner throughout the apparatus at all levels and in all branches from the centre to the grassroots... ...'To ensure national defence and security. 'To continve broademisg external relations'. We will broaden relations of friendship and cooperation with other countries on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, peaceful co-esistence, respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, settling disputes by negotiations, and maintaining stability, security and development... 'To build a law-governed Vietnamese state of the people, by the people and for the people... And...'To renew and streamline the party, consolidate the relationship between the party and the people...'.
