Peleg, who heads the Israeli delegation to the conference of Mediterranean countries in Tunis, handed the Tunisian minister an invitation to visit Israel from Environment Minister Yosi Sarid. Minister Mlika hoped that his visit to Israel would be possible as soon as Israel wrapped up the last details with the Palestinians. "God willing, I will come to visit," Mlika said, sending personal regards to Yosi Sarid. [passage omitted] At the end of the second day of discussions, there was disagreement between the Tunisians and the other delegations on the establishment of a special committee that would promote development projects independently of the Barcelona Treaty for Environmental Protection. A proposal initiated by the the Israeli delegation facilitated a compromise according to which Tunis' recommendation to establish a Mediterranean committee for sustainable development was accepted. The date for a discussion of the proposal's details, however, will be scheduled at the next conference in 1995. At the end of the session, the Tunisian representative said he appreciated Israel's contribution in breaking the impasse.
