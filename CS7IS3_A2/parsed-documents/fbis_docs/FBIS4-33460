Chamorro and Lacayo have not said anything new. They are still offering the same they did three years ago. They repeated the same old argument -- that the privatization of the Nicaraguan Communications and Postal Services Institute will be used to back the payments. This is a clear sign that the government has no intention of returning those properties the Sandinistas divvied up. U.S. Congressmen Robert Torricelli and Cass Ballenger are leaving today. Torricelli, Ballenger, and Nicaraguan Blanca Perez Macias -- formerly Bianca Jagger -- came last week to discuss several topics with the government, including the issue of confiscated properties and the need to return them to their true owners. They discussed political topics and U.S. investment in Nicaragua with military leaders, Cardinal Obando y Bravo, the private sector, and others. Although the congressmen were rather brief at the end, they clearly conveyed to the government that aid to Nicaragua might be stopped if properties are not returned to those Lacayo called the Nicaraguan caitudos [pejorative term for some Nicaraguans who are naturalized U.S. citizens]. The caitudos are claiming their properties as U.S. citizens. [Begin recording] [(Roberto Basalli), president of the association of U.S. owners of confiscated properties] We know that from now until the end of July, it is impossible to entirely resolve the property issue, which is highly complicated. Our goal is that if the Nicaraguan Government shows enough progress, then aid will be given for a year. According to the amendment, the Secretary of State must, each year, confirm any progress made in countries where properties have been seized from U.S. citizens. Consequently, if Nicaragua shows enough progress, it must receive aid for a year so that it has the opportunity to continue and finish resolving the problem. We are very aware that the problem cannot be resolved in 90 days. [Unidentified Reporter] The first 30 days have already gone by [words indistinct]. Do not you think they might have used some sort of strategy to avoid resolving this problem? [Basalli] We do not know precisely what the Nicaraguan Government is doing or plans to do. Thus far, there have been no results. However, we must give the Nicaraguan Government the benefit of the doubt because they might be preparing to make a move regarding this issue. [end recording]
