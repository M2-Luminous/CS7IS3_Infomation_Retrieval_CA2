These have ranged from the decrease in inflation and terrorist actions to the president's authoritarianism. But very little has been said of what is perhaps the decisive measure by which a regime can be judged, namely, the state of the institutions. A careful examination of a few of our institutions may help in arriving at this judgment. The Judiciary Following the coup d'etat, the government acted in a totally discretionary manner, dismissing those it wanted to rid itself of and appointing those it felt like appointing. Then a Panel of Honor, appointed by the government itself, carried out an evaluation and appointed a new Supreme Court. In sum, a reorganization was made short work of by exercising powers that no democratic government ever had. The result is devastating. It is devastating not only because of unusual cases like that of the Cantuta Law, in which meddling by other powers clearly demonstrates the subordination of the judiciary, or that of the unconstitutional appointment of Miss Nelida Colan as the nation's attorney general, owing to her well-known relationship with the administration, but because the functioning of the judiciary continues to be the same or worse than before: slow, inefficient, corrupt. Any citizen who through misfortune falls into its net becomes only too aware of this. Congress Made exactly to measure for the regime, its characteristics, prerogatives, and limitations were all decided by the regime itself. And the regime is able to count on an absolute majority to control the structure it has created. Congressional oversight is a complete nullity, since not a single investigation concerning the period of the present administration--which is what matters--has produced any result whatever. Even investigations concerning previous administrations--which the present government seeks to discredit--have amounted to nothing of any consequence. The Constitution created by this Congress is a travesty that is violated by the government itself, and that today, less than five months after its promulgation, requires immediate amendments, such as that of the wretched Habeas Data. As for its legislative accomplishment, it is difficult to remember anything remarkable. And from the political point of view, it remains completely subordinated to Fujimori, to the Armed Forces' leadership, and to anyone who wields a modicum of power. The Police The government or, better said, the SIN [National Intelligence Service] and the Army leadership took control of the Ministry of Interior on 28 July 1990. Their first step was to remove the minister and reorganize the institution. Their last step was to deal the coup de grace to the DINCOTE [Counterterrorism Directorate], and begin its dismantlement on December 1992, immediately after the capture of Abimael Guzman. Today the Police as an institution are afflicted by the same ills of yore, only modified and amplified: low salaries, faulty equipment, demoralization, corruption, inefficiency. Up to a certain point, the institution has begun being supplanted by night watchmen. Armed Forces Even though their morale and their image improved after the capture of Guzman, their professionalism and their constituted authority have been severely compromised. Politicization of command, expulsion or retirement of many of their best officers, factionalism, the system of internal espionage that corrodes camaraderie and creates a mistrust bordering on paranoia, have brought the Armed Forces to a situation of dangerous fragmentation. To these must be added the penetration of drug trafficking, a peculiar and extremely dangerous type of corruption that is not being held in check. The foregoing list of institutions is not by any means exhaustive. It includes neither municipalities, nor ministries, nor the diplomatic service, nor other public agencies; but it exemplifies the situation. The noticeable improvements in SUNAT [National Tax Administration Superintendency] and a few in IPSS [Peruvian Institute of Social Security]--the dismantlement of which is, on the other hand, being sought--are not even remotely sufficient to compensate for the government's systematic work of corroding the institutions. The importance of solidly-based institutions is paramount in two respects. First, as to the long-term outlook, they are the essential prerequisites to the modernization of a country. U.S. political expert Samuel Huntington cites the institutionalization process as the determinative factor in the transition from a traditional society to a modern one without falling into chaos and disintegration. "A government with a low institutionalization level is not only weak; it is also bad," says Huntington. This is because, among other reasons, "a society in which institutions are weak lacks the necessary capability to contain the excess of personal and parochial ambitions," and because a simple political system that depends upon a single individual "is also less stable." And second, institutions are a key factor in determining the success or failure of the processes involved in a return to democracy. As the Argentine Guillermo O'Donnell has stated, the transition that has taken place in Latin America, from authoritarian regimes to governments elected through clean elections, requires a second transition, from those governments to democratic governments. According to O'Donnell, this second transition has not happened yet, except in countries that had a developed institutional system prior to the establishment of the dictatorships: Chile and Uruguay. The rest are still mired in uncertainty. Although today the merry beneficiaries of Fujimorism may not care two hoots about institutionalized values, the consequences for the future of the country will be far-reaching.
