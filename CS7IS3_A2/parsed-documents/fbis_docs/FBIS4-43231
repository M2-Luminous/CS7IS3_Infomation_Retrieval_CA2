Differing answers have been given to this question. Maij-Wegen, heading the list of CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] candidates, considers that the election results will favor Lubbers since the CDA remains the largest Netherlands party in Europe. De Vries and Bertens, who are heading the list of VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] and D66 [Democrats 66] candidates, respectively, feel on the contrary that the poor turnout will work against Lubbers. EC Commissioner van den Broek said that the low level of interest shown by Netherlanders in the elections does not bode well for Lubbers. He fears that the Netherlanders' European convictions may be questioned. [passage omitted]
