One, the multilateral economic meeting to be held next month, in the beginning of June [as heard]; two, a conference dealing with desertification initiated by us; three, a conference on Middle East development scheduled for late October or early November. The Americans are deeply involved in preparing this conference. There will also be a business conference between Israel and Morocco. Most of us are obsessed with the past, with symbols and gestures. There is a different world out there, however, with different rules, and I see things differently. [Baum] Will future political relations be facilitated by the economic relations to be forged in these conferences? [Peres] If you really want to understand, allow me to explain with these phrases. The idea is that American, European, and the Japanese governments grant their companies guarantees for investments in the Middle East. We will give all these companies a list of proposals for factories in the entire Middle East -- both regional and national factories. When they decide on a certain factory, their government will guarantee their investment. This is unprecedented--an extremely original idea that Clinton and other leaders have accepted. You should not compare this to anything else, because it is not similar to anything else. This conference, which will be held in Marrakech, is being organized by two companies, one European and one American, along with the U.S. and Israeli Governments. A senior U.S. Administration representative will participate in the conference, apparently Christopher himself. Some 1,500 companies worldwide will participate. We have to realize that at the present time the main problem worldwide is economic prosperity, education, and health. This is what people are interested in. People are sick and tired of all this diplomatic business, of the outworn diplomatic minutiae. [Baum] Mr. Foreign Minister, if we are speaking about the economic issue, I would like to address Yasir 'Arafat's economic problems. He is complaining that he is not receiving the aid he was promised. [Peres] He, too, is not doing what he has to do. We are trying to help in this respect, too. [Baum] Do you think foreign countries could provide more aid? [Peres] They can do so and are willing to do so. 'Arafat, however, must establish institutions that have what is known as transparent bookkeeping. No democratic country will give even one penny unless it knows precisely where and for what purpose it is being used. Look, no country will donate toward vague and unclear aims. The truth is, however, that we are going to lose the world. Look, the world is big and does not revolve around us. We are not the only country in the world. Many places in the world are crying out for help and aid. This is one of the reasons why we should act more quickly. There is still a lot of goodwill toward us, but it will not hold out for ever. We must harbor no illusions about this. We must act more quickly in this issue; we are trying to facilitate this process as much as possible, but we are encountering considerable difficulties from all sides. You know, there is an American expression entitlism, I am entitled to [last five words in English], and 'Arafat for some reason seems to subscribe to this view. We have to realize that the world is built on mutuality, on give and take. Nobody deserves to receive bread from heaven; this happened only once to the Jewish people, when it kept them going for 40 years in the desert. [Baum] Turning to another issue, Mr. Foreign Minister, while you were abroad the press was rife with speculations regarding your reaction to the fact that no one from your camp was appointed as a new minister. [Peres] I am not advancing a camp, I have colleagues and I like to advance all of them. You know, people are trying to depict me in a completely unrealistic way. I am totally engrossed by the peace process. I support the advancement of young colleagues, but I am against appointments done on a factional and cliquish basis. I have advanced many young colleagues. I have never posed any conditions and I do not intend to do so in future. [Baum] Is there no rift between Yitzhaq Rabin and yourself regarding this issue? [Peres] There is no rift. The only issue that can cause a rift is the peace process. I already said as much at the beginning of my career in the government and I keep repeating this. Nobody can make me deviate from my path. I am not interested in press speculations on power games and on who screwed who. I will aid any young and talented Labor Party member, and those outside the party too. [Baum] Is there any particular candidate for such aid? [Peres] I will issue an announcement when I have something to announce.
