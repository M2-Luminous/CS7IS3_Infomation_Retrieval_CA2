FBIS4-37889 "drnes123_s_94012" FBIS-NES-94-123 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 Iran Closer Attention to Embassy Security Urged Closer Attention to Embassy Security Urged NC1606212394 Tehran RESALAT in Persian 11 Jun 94 p 16 NC1606212394 Tehran RESALAT Persian BFN [From the Foreign Policy Desk] [Text] The sensitivity of Iran's position and the miscellaneous plots that are planned against the internal and foreign security of our country demand a serious approach and the need to take greater security measures. The revelation of Britain's espionage plot against our embassy in London once again highlighted this point for our officials, that we should take security measures seriously. The sensitivity of the situation and stances of the Islamic Republic of Iran necessitates a closer look at our security measures abroad. A newspaper published in Turkey claims that the building of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy in Moscow is being constructed by a Turkish company. According to a report in the newspaper VAKET published in Istanbul, the Iranian Embassy is being constructed by the Alarco company, the proprietors of which are Turkish Jewish investors. According to a report in the Alarco news bulletin, the building of the Iranian Embassy complex will be handed over to the Iranian officials on 1 September. If the claims of the Islamist newspaper VAKET are true, the relevant officials should view this matter in a more serious and precise manner. We wish to draw the attention of our relevant issues to this point, that the British Embassy was renovated in Iran a while ago, but even the cement, gravel, and all other materials for the purpose were transported from London to Tehran in sealed containers. However, our embassy in London was renovated by British contractors and listening and espionage devices were planted in it. If the report of the Turkish newspaper is true, it will have unpleasant repercussions especially since the Turkish Jews have undertaken this task!
