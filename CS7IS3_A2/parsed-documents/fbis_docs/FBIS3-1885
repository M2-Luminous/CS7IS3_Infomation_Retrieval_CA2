The INTERFAX news service quoted Kolesnikov as saying that the military bases will be set up on the sites inherited from the former Soviet troops. Russia will sign relevant agreements with the countries concerned so as to legalize the process of establishing those bases. Armenia has already signed such an agreement with Russia. Some CIS countries called for the withdrawal of Russian troops following the break-up of the Soviet Union. But due to difficulties in establishing their own army, these countries have changed their mind in order to have an army to maintain order and security. Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced for the first time Russia's desire to establish military bases in CIS countries when he was visiting Georgia in January. CIS defense ministers also held a meeting in late February in Moscow on military cooperations.
