The mission from the institute under the Japanese investment giant Mitsui & Co. was led by the institute's President Yoshikatsu Hironaka. The visit was due to Mitsui's interest toward the economic situation and development opportunities in Estonia as well as prospects for the company's operation in the region, the government press office says. Laar at the meeting spoke at some length about the country's economic policy guidelines and explained that his government had based its steps on the principle of radical reform. He said that in order to attract someone's attention in the present-day world, one had to make steps that may not be common elsewhere. The guests at the meeting praised Estonia's speed in proceeding on the reform path. They said the country's resolve in introducing a proportional 26-percent income tax was impressing. The discussion further focused on the situation in the sphere of foreign investments and trade between the two countries. The mission members were particularly interested in facts about the free trade treaty to be signed between Estonia and the European Union soon.
