FR940805-2-00113 FR940805-2-00057 [Docket No. 50&hyph;139] Renewal of Facility License No. R&hyph;73; University of Washington The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 16 to Facility License No. R&hyph;73, issued to the University of Washington (the licensee), which converts the operating license to a possession only license and renews the license for the facility located on the University campus in Seattle, Washington. The renewed license will expire on February 14, 1999. The amended license complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I. Those findings are set forth in the license amendment. Notice of Consideration and opportunity for hearing was afforded in the notice of the proposed issuance of this renewal in the Federal Register on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12629). No request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following notice of the proposed action. The Commission has prepared a related Safety Evaluation of the renewal of Facility License No. R&hyph;73 and has, based on that evaluation, concluded that the facility can continue to be maintained by the licensee without endangering the health and safety of the public. The Commission also has prepared an Environmental Assessment which was published in the Federal Register on July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38213), for the renewal of Facility License No. R&hyph;73 and has concluded that this action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. For further details with respect to this action, see: (1) Application for amendment dated August 10 and 31, 1989, as modified on February 14 and May 2, 1994; (2) Amendment No. 16 to Facility License No. R&hyph;73; (3) the related Safety Evaluation; and (4) the Environmental Assessment.
