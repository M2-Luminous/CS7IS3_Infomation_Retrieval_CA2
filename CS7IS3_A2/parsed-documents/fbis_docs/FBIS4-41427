Rong Yiren, vice president of the People's Republic of China, said this during his meeting with the Tajik Supreme Soviet delegation headed by Abdulmajid Dostiyev, first vice chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan, which is currently visiting China. Rong Yiren expressed satisfaction at the development of relations between the two countries following the establishment of diplomatic relations. He said Tajikistan and China, as developing countries, (?ought) to develop their national economies and enhance the standards of living of their peoples. We should develop relations and expand cooperation with other countries. He said the Chinese economy is developing fast and the standard of living is improving. However, despite this, there is still a large gap between Chinese economic growth and the standard of living, and the standard of living in developed countries. [passage indistinct] Dostiyev said the main objective of the Tajik parliamentary delegation's visit to the PRC is to familiarize themselves with Chinese experiences on social and economic reforms. Informed sources said that the head of Tajik delegation explained the situation in Tajikistan and the position of the Tajik Government vis-a-vis the inter-Tajik talks that are continuing in Tehran during his meetings with Chinese officials. According to Chinese experts, military actions that are taking place between the Tajik Government and the Tajik Islamic opposition are causing serious concern in Beijing. It is believed that the continuation of armed clashes there could destabilize the situation along the Tajik-Chinese border. Therefore, it is not a coincidence that Qiao Shi, chairman of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, during his meeting with the Tajik delegation, said that China has an interest in seeing the border between the two countries be transformed into a border of peace, stability, friendship, and cooperation.
