She will take the nation into her confidence on national issues and inform it of the steps the government is taking on behalf of Kashmir. The prime minister's speech will be broadcast on TV and radio at 1430 GMT. Talking to newsmen in Islamabad last evening, the prime minister stated categorically that the government will fully support the strike called by the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee on 5 February to protest the atrocities against the Kashmiris in the occupied territory. She said that the strike call will be considered an appeal by all the parties because the appeal has been made by the Kashmir Committee, which is comprised of both ruling and opposition members of parliament. She said that her government has decided to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN human rights organization so as to secure world support for the early implementation of the UN resolutions on Kashmir. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that Pakistan has never refused to hold talks with India for a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir issue. However, she added, that talks cannot be held in a situation in which Kashmiris are being oppressed and supressed by Indian forces. She asked how the talks can be held in a situation in which arrested Kashmiri leaders have not been released and the siege of the Hazratbal shrine is still continuing. The prime minister said that 600,000 Indian forces are deployed in occupied Kashmir, which means one soldier is deployed for every four Kashmiris. Such a situation cannot be helpful for a purposeful dialogue. She said that the Indian Government should take steps to reduce atrocities in occupied Kashmir. Noting the seriousness of the Kashmir problem, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that the issue is linked to future global peace. Political stability in the region also depends on the cessation of human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. She urged the United Nations and other world bodies to consider the Kashmir issue as a human rights issue. The prime minister said that it would be unjust if the UN resolutions were not implemented. The prime minister said that Pakistan has always supported the UN resolutions, including those on Kuwait, Somalia, and Bosnia. Pakistan hopes that other countries will support it on the Kashmir issue. Sheikh Rafiq Ahmad, Pakistan People's Party [PPP] secretary general, has said that his party has decided to launch a massive campaign to apprise the people of the importance of the rights of Kashmiris and the government's policies. In a statement in Lahore yesterday, he said that the PPP will hold seminars and rallies to focus light on the present situation in occupied Kashmir and to draw international attention to the Kashmiri brethren. He said that the government has a clear and concrete policy on Kashmir.
