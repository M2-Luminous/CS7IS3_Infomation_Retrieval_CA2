"However, it failed to seriously convey all the remarks we had voiced during the last talks in Pale," Krajisnik said in a statement for TANJUG prior to the beginning of the Bosnia contact group's two-day work in Washington. Our first remark, Krajisnik went on, is that the Serbs cannot take part in the continuation of the conference without receiving equal treatment, meaning that the sanctions should be lifted and that the pressure now being exerted on the Serbs should end. "The second thing concerns territorial demands put to the Serbs so the Muslims could get 51 percent of the territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina--this was demanded of us without explanation and was not backed by any arguments," Krajisnik said and expressed hope that the contact group will acknowledge these remarks on the basis of new information at its disposal, and find an acceptable solution. "True, there will be problems with the territories because our remarks will be construed as a condition for continuing the talks--which would be a mistake because we are not setting any conditions for the cessation of hostilities and the continuation of the conference. Hope lies in negotiations, but we cannot allow ourselves to be under pressure while the Muslims and Croats are not, and this only makes the continuation of the talks more difficult," Krajisnik added. Commenting on reports of a new international conference on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik said that thorough preparations must be carried out ahead of such a meeting, and certain dilemmas must be settled because which part of Bosnia belongs to one or the other side is not immaterial. What is good and provides a good basis for talks is the fact that the stance has finally been agreed that Bosnia must finally be divided into two parts. Attempts to create obstacles to division by calling for a unified Bosnia, and by linking its parts either into a federation, a confederation, or a union--all these things are, in fact, attempts to turn back the clock, although it is clear that it cannot be turned back, Krajisnik said. In his opinion, the most important problem has been resolved and that is that Bosnia must be divided into two parts, while the West has resolved the problem of what it will do with the Muslims. Speaking about the current Muslim offensive, the National Assembly speaker expressed his disappointment with the role of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] because, he said, "we have noticed bias on the part of the peacekeeping forces." Not only do they tolerate the Muslim offensive, but they fail to react at all to their offensive actions, hoping that the Muslims will improve their position, and that this will be a good basis for the continuation of negotiations. We must accept and realize--and this is the most difficult thing in this war--that there is no justice for the Serb people either, because we are an obstacle to the realization of major interests, but we must hold out because we have a great chance of achieving our goals, although the road to accomplishing this will be difficult, Krajisnik said. Momcilo Krajisnik also hinted at a new session of the republic of Srpska's parliament, most probably next Tuesday or Wednesday [24th or 25th May]. Owing to large-scale diplomatic preparations for the upcoming international conference on Bosnia, the assembly session--instead of being held this week--has been postponed until the beginning of next week, Momcilo Krajisnik, concluded in a statement he made to TANJUG today.
