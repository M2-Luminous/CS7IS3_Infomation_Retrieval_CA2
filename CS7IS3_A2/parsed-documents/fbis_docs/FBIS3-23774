He was born in Homel, where he completed his high school education. He graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations. Sychow has been working at the Belarusian Foreign Ministry for 15 years. He has gone up all rungs of the diplomatic ladder, from attache to deputy foreign minister. He worked at the Belarus Diplomatic Mission to the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva. Alyaksandr Sychow speaks English, French, and Spanish. [Lakhmanenka] Alyaksandr Mikalayevich, what is the attitude of the United Nations attitude toward Belarus in general? I believe that it is not very good. I have drawn this conclusion, for example, from the fact that the amount of our financial contribution to the United Nations has been increased at a time when our economy is being transformed into a market economy, and our Republic is spending huge amounts of money on eliminating the aftermath of the Chernobyl catastrophe. Now we are supposed to contribute more than certain other European countries, that are in much better shape than we. Why? I have the impression that you have been sent to New York to ease the situation. Is that true? [Sychow] I believe that the world's attitude toward us, and the way we are treated by international organizations, reflects the real position of Belarus in the international community. To say that we are treated by them deliberately unfairly is, to say the least, unjustified. I must, however, frankly admit that we have certain grievances against the United Nations. The news about the increase in our contribution to the UN budget was received rather bitterly in our Republic. I think that the UN General Assembly was too formal when it voted on the increase. The same lot also befell our southern neighbor Ukraine and other republics of the former Soviet Union. If you do not mind, I would like to dwell on this issue, particularly since this has not always been reported or described objectively, including by the press. [Lakhmanenka] Excuse me, but I think that our readers would also like to know your viewpoint. Although much has been said about this unpleasant surprise, people do not know enough about all the reasons behind this -- to put it politely -- unpopular UN decision. [Sychow] There are several aspects to this problem. When the distribution of the Soviet Union's contributions among the countries established on the territory of the Union was discussed, the UN Committee for Contributions dealt with the issue mechanically. An entire range of procedural and methodological miscalculations and errors were committed. Moreover, the committee fulfilled the recommendation of the so-called "powerful" states which did not want those contributions to be distributed among other UN member states. According to procedures, additional contributions by new members and the amount that is lost when a country leaves the United Nations should be dealt with and distributed taking into account the entire amount of the contributions. As a matter of fact, the amount would have had to be reexamined, and this, believe me, is very hard work. The committee, of course, preferred to avoid this task. Russia's stance played no small role in this. The Russians wanted to shed the financial responsibilities inherited from the USSR as quickly as possible. It was not taken into account that Belarus and Ukraine were among the founders of the United Nations. Nobody paid attention to the fact that the UN General Session, which preceded the UN General Assembly, had earlier defined Belarus' contribution at 0.31 percent of the UN budget. What did the committee recommend in this situation? It distributed the Soviet Union's contribution among the former Soviet republics in the same way as the USSR's foreign debt was divided among the CIS countries. To avoid additional contributions, Belarus and Ukraine were included in the list. This was improper in terms of legality and procedure. An abnormal situation was thus created. Belarus and Ukraine, countries that had been among the founders of the United Nations, were treated like new members. There is another interesting aspect to this issue, which is glossed over in silence by media observers. Today, the issue of Belarus' contribution is being related only to the activities of the Foreign Ministry, while the most important fact is being kept concealed: The contributions by a member country are estimated on the basis of its GNP, its population size, and the ruble's exchange rate against the dollar for the last ten years of economic development. It is 1994 now, and the basis for estimates begins from 1984. The economic performance of our Republic was different then. Therefore, the economic situation in Belarus looks generally better than in Greece, Hungary, and many other countries. As you know, the economic situation is actually not so rosy in Belarus. The reasons behind the overestimated contribution lie in the Soviet heritage and statistical data that did not reflect the levels of economic development. Do you think it is easy for the Foreign Ministry and its officials to defend their position on the contribution when there are no reliable state statistics? On the other hand, although the Baltics -- Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia -- believed that their contributions would amount to 0.01 percent, they are, respectively -- 0.13, 0.15, and 0.07 percent. It was the same situation with Kazakhstan, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and other CIS countries. In those countries, however, they are not looking for scapegoats, but are trying to put together appropriate statistics. The issue of contributions to the UN budget is very complex, and is connected with the activities of various state institutions, first of all, the State Committee for Statistics, the Finance Ministry, the State Committee for Economic Planning, and the National Bank, which define the above-mentioned figures. [Lakhmanenka] As they say, what happened, happened. Has our country really put up with this unfair decision? Is there nothing left for us to do but wave our arms in a gesture of helplessness? [Sychow] Of course, we will not be sitting idly, as certain politicians and observers are predicting. First of all, the Republic of Belarus has not recognized this decision, and it is not going to pay the contribution that was calculated according to the reexamined scale. Moreover, we have not recently transferred a single dollar of the additional amounts to the UN accounts. Our Republic endorses the special position on financing peacekeeping operations from the UN budget. Thanks to the efforts of our diplomats at the latest UN session, recommendations for formulating a new scale of contributions for 1995-1997 were approved, and the methodological mistakes that were committed with regard to Belarus and Ukraine will be taken into account in the future. This way, perhaps the entire scale of contributions will be reexamined. However, we see certain obstacles that are connected with the data on our economic development. Compromise has almost been reached that the basis for calculations will be reduced to seven or eight years. This gives good grounds for reducing our contribution to the UN budget. [Lakhmanenka] Well, although the problem of contributions has been more or less clarified, it is still not clear how we were "routed" in the elections for the UN Security Council. Belarus, as you have already said, is one of the UN founders. All Belarusian diplomacy was connected with the activities of UN international bodies. The Republic's image in the eyes of the international community is quite good following its abandonment of nuclear weapons, and suddenly such a failure occurs. Why? [Sychow] I would not dramatize what happened in the elections and say that it was a big failure that Belarus was not elected a member of the UN Security Council. The defeat of any state in the elections is not considered by the United Nations as something extraordinary. For instance, Sweden, which commands great authority and has been neutral for a long time, lost in the elections to New Zealand. Nevertheless, Sweden has not lost its world prestige and influence. We have analyzed the situation very carefully and have drawn our own conclusions. I would like to point out that the results of elections reflect the actual rating of Belarus in the world. This is a specific evaluation of our country. However, we also see this as a certain line in relations with CIS countries. For example, Kazakhstan lost the elections for the UN Economic and Social Council, and Russia was not elected chairman of the UNESCO Executive Council. Regarding these elections, the principle of rotation was breached in our regional group. There is a UN rule that candidacies are discussed in regional groups. For example, along with the West European, African, Latin American, and Asian groups, there is also the East European one including Belarus. Earlier, it comprised 10 countries, now it has 20. Every state has the right to be represented in the Security Council. We applied for membership in the Security Council in 1987. Prior to that, Belarus had only once been a member of the council -- from 1974 to 1975. It must be said that we always respected other countries and made room for them. This time, however, we decided to put forward our candidacy. Later, Czechoslovakia also proposed its candidacy. When such a situation occurs, it should be discussed within a group to avoid extensive competition. In the first place, we agreed with Czechoslovakia that it would withdraw its candidacy for our benefit, since it had already been a member of the Security Council two times -- most recently from 1978 to 1979. Certain countries from our group have been members three or four times. Czechoslovakia, however, was soon divided into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The leadership of the Czech Republic decided to argue over seats in the Security Council. Although we held numerous consultations with the Czech Foreign Ministry, we did not reach any compromise. [Lakhmanenka] These are very interesting details. We do not know much about the mechanism of UN operations. I think that the Czech Republic won the elections not only because it put forward its own candidacy. It also conducted a secret electoral campaign, as everybody knows. [Sychow] The situation that existed in the United Nations at that time did not guarantee us victory. Many subjective and objective reasons prevented our victory. I would relate the subjective reasons to the fact that Belarus' contribution to the improvement of global security and disarmament is not adequately appreciated in the world. The West's rigid assessments of Belarus' economic and democratic reforms and statements that we are following Russia's foreign policy also played an important role. I do not, however, agree with these opinions. Unfortunately, all this was taken into account during the vote. The lack of ability to conduct appropriate work at our embassies was the real reason why we lost the electoral race to the Czechs. Wile the Czech Republic has more than 70 embassies, we have only 14. We must also not forget the popularity of Czech President Vaclav Havel as a politician and a person. The activeness of the Czech side was amazing. On the eve of the vote, the Czech prime minister toured Latin American countries where he tried to garner some support. During the last three days before the elections, the Czech side conducted intensive preparations and even "worked on" certain politicians. Havel telephoned [former Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislav Shushkevich. The Czech authorities even sent a special envoy to Stanislav Shushkevich to influence him. Our side did not show such activeness. The work was conducted at the level of prime minister and foreign minister, and when we asked the Supreme Soviet chairman to send a letter to the Czech president, he refused to do so. [Lakhmanenka] In my opinion, you did not mention yet another important reason behind our hardships in the United Nations. Belarus was too long hidden under the shadow of the USSR, and it always played into the latter's hands. This made people suspect that we would continue to do the same. [Sychow] I would not be so adamant on this issue. Naturally, all our activities were coordinated and approved when we were in the USSR. However, even then our Republic came forward with many resolutions and initiatives that were later adopted by the UN General Assembly, including the resolutions on Nazi criminals, new types of weapons of mass destruction, disarmament, human rights, scientific progress, etc. [Lakhmanenka] Perhaps you are right. Nevertheless, the experience of Belarusian diplomacy was reduced to participation in international organizations, and it was gained during the Cold War, a period of confrontation between the two former camps of capitalism and socialism. Although these camps no longer exist, the "combat" experience still remains. Does this not disturb our diplomats? [Sychow] I do not agree with you. We do not have experience in bilateral relations. Belarus' achievement is undoubtedly it participation in multilateral diplomacy. This valuable experience is very useful for us today. Other countries of the former Soviet Union, other than Ukraine, do not have such experience. As a professional diplomat, I am very concerned by the fact that we do not have enough cadres. We have a chronic lack of specialists. At the Foreign Ministry, people work 12-14 hours per day for a pitiful salary. It is the same situation in our foreign missions. Our ministry employs only 125 people, while foreign ministries of the former Soviet republics employ three or four times as many, not to mention Russia. How can we work efficiently if we do not even have one expert for each country, not to mention the legal and legal treaty work and economic diplomacy that we should actively develop. We generally rely on enthusiasm today. I believe that the Supreme Soviet and the government should pay more attention to Belarusian diplomacy, because it is impossible to solve the numerous problems facing our Republic with our scarce resources.
