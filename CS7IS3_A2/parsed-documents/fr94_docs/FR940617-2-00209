FR940617-2-00209 FR940617-2-00116 V. Other Matters Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319 of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352), and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the Federal Register on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 29912). See 24 CFR Part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they are urged to read 24 CFR Part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A. Any questions concerning Part 86 should be directed to Garry L. Phillips, Acting Director, Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (TDD Voice). (This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office. Prohibition Against Advance Information on Funding Decisions Section 103 of the Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons not authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance that entails a competition for its distribution. HUD's regulations implementing section 103 are codified at 24 CFR part 4 (see 56 FR 22088, May 13, 1991). (See also Section II.C. of this NOFA.) In accordance with the requirements of Section 103, HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions under a competitive funding process are restrained by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted by 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815. (This is not a toll-free number.) Environmental Impact A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations that implement Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection during business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410. Federalism Executive Order The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that this Notice of Fund Availability will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationship with the Federal Government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of government. Family Executive Order The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this Notice of Fund Availability will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance or well being, and therefore, is not subject to review under the order.
