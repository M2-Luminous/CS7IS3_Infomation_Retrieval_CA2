Composites? Everyone talks about them, everyone uses them. But what is actually known about their behavior, about their process of deterioration? Not much! Yet, in order to determine the useful life of a part and define intervals between maintenance, this knowledge is indispensable. By comparison, metallic materials no longer conceal any secrets. For many years ONERA has worked on a realistic description of the (nonlinear) behavior of these materials. A little more recently, it was able to extend its field of activity to include the gamut of organic-matrix composite materials. Building on its experience in that area, which included the developing of methods that have now the test of wide usage, ONERA is turning its attention today to thermostructural ceramic-matrix composites (SiC-SiC), and tomorrow to C-C and Ti-SiC composites... Why is it so difficult to define realistically the behavior of composite materials? Complexity is the key word. A composite material presents itself as a stack of layers, each of which is made up of unidirectional fibers embedded in a resin. Its complexity, or rather diversity, gives rise to a process of deterioration having multiple origins: fissures of different types and delamination. Unlike metallic materials, whose descriptive laws of the destruction of the piece are posited on a macroscopic scale, the microscopic aspect of those concerning composite materials cannot be circumvented. The studies being conducted by ONERA are of particular interest to the engine manufacturers (hence, close collaboration with Turbomeca, SNECMA, SEP, Rolls-Royce, Fiat, etc...), but also to the aircraft manufacturers, in whose case the fields of application can be grouped under two main headings. The first is aeronautical and space engines, particularly insofar as concerns characterization of the phenomena that occur in pieces where the temperature gradient is high and where the stresses are of thermal origin; and the second is aircraft frames, stabilizers, and wings, from the standpoing of their problem of a vibratory nature, stemming more naturally from fatigue brought on by an extensive number of cycles. In the case of engines, stresses are linked to the run/stop cycles and to the takeoff/cruising/landing cycles (at frequencies ranging from several minutes to several hours), but also to the high-frequency aerodynamic abrasion on the turbine vanes (1,000 to 10,000 Hz). In that of air frames, stabilizers, and wings, the cyclicities are more complex and include a minimum of three levels of frequencies corresponding respectively to flight, maneuvers, and turbulences. Analysis in Four Stages. The study of a particular material in a particular piece is made in four stages of successively concatenated computations. First, the material's behavioral laws are modeled with the aid of cyclic, uniaxial, and multiaxial stress test analyses. The piece itself is then calculated by a finite-element method, so as to determine its constraints and its local deformations (mechanical, thermal, etc...). This is a digital stage that utilizes the priorly determined laws, and codes that take into account the cyclic phenomena. Currently, pieces are calculated on the basis of a service life of 500 successive cycles. ONERA's long-term objective is to be able to base computations on all the cycles of the piece, until its rupture. The third stage determines the critical fault (onset of fissure) and computes the number of cycles prior to the advent of this fault. And in the final stage, the propagation of the fissure (fissuration) is studied. Depending on whether the piece is a component of the engine or of the structure, the approach is inelastic or elastic, respectively. The work done thus far on metallic materials has enabled, among other things, the development of vanes cast under an anisotropic oriented monocrystalline phase. This technique eliminates the packing of grains, hence pits that can oxidize and give rise to fissures.
