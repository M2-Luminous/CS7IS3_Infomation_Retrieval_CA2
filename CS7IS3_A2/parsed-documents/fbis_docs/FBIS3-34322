Our sources in the south reported that a resistance group launched a lightening attack against al-'Amarah governor's headquarters in al-Mashtal using medium-caliber machine guns and RPG-7's, causing damage to the building. The sources said that a large number of the regime's henchmen and officials of his organs of repression were present in the building at the time of the attack. Ambulances and fire-fighting teams were seen hurrying to the destroyed headquarters and spent many hours pulling out the dead bodies of the regime's henchmen. Our sources later learned that the al-'Amarah governor was away in Baghdad at the time of the assault. The regime placed its forces on alert, adopted emergency measures in al-'Amarah, and conducted an extensive search operation that included arrests of citizens. Another group of the Islamic resistance forces attacked a military command vehicle belonging to the tyrant Saddam's forces in Mid-January while it was traveling in al-Kahla' district in al-'Amarah Maysan Governorate. Our sources said that the vehicle was completely destroyed and the occupants killed included a major, a lieutenant, and the driver. Following the attack, the tyrant Saddam's forces conducted extensive patrols and set up checkpoints manned by security personnel to search, arrest, and interrogate citizens. Kurdish opposition sources reported that an explosion has occurred in the Border Guard headquarters which is adjacent to the General Security Directorate in Baghdad. They said the evacuation of those killed or wounded by the blast lasted for two hours. The same sources said that another military building used by the Special Forces in Baghdad Governorate was the target of a machine-gun attack in mid-January, killing army captain Sabri Yasin al-Rawi and three other mercenaries. According to our sources, the headquarters of al-Hindiyah's district officer, a man known for his criminal behavior, was the target of a lightning attack by five mujahidin. Our mujahidin in Karbala' Governorate earlier attacked the car of Kazim Marhun, a tribal chief in the area, forced him to get out of the car, and then shot him. They then left behind leaflets warning all those who terrorize our people to stop such actions or they would meet the same fate. Our heroic mujahidin inflicted just retribution on the criminal Sattar 'Adday Taha in al-Jurn in al-Kaba'ish District because he had perpetrated treasonous acts against our people in that area. He had received several warnings to stop implementing the tyrant Saddam's orders and to learn from the death of his brother Samir 'Adday, who used to spy on our people and who later received his just retribution at the hands of our mujahidin.
