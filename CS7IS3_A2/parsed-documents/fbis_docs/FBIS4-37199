The meeting, held for the first time in an Arab country, consecrates Morocco's active role in the promotion of peace in the Middle East. The previous meetings were held in Brussels, Rome, Copenhagen and Paris. The Rabat meeting agenda highlights activities taken under the umbrella of the Copenhagen action plan which sets a work program in the short and medium term. The meeting will examine the activities undertaken in several sectors since the last session and explore means of making further progress, said head of the delegation of the European Union which is chairing the 5th session Constantin Prevedorakis (Greece) in an opening statement. He added that the session will also look into proposals for the monitoring of the action plan by the regional parties so that effective follow-up be assured and discuss guidelines for future activities in regional economic cooperation. "The challenge we face is to lay a firm basis for the promotion of prosperity through regional cooperation in the Middle East", he said recalling that since its first session in 1992, the group has made substantial progress in pursuing its principal immediate goals: Transforming ideas and initiatives into practical proposals, establishing priorities, creating a framework for regional economic cooperation and building confidence among the people of the region. The Copenhagen action plan deals with 35 development projects mainly in the sectors of transport, communications, energy, tourism, agriculture, financial markets and investment, trade, electricity. The carrying out of each project is entrusted to a country or a financial institution such as the World Bank. The head of the US delegation Daniel Kurtzer whose country is co- sponsoring along with Russia the negotiations process said the Copenhagen action plan proved to be an important milestone in the progression from a stage of planning and discussion to one of implementation. However, in spite of these positive steps, we must assess our work to see if we are doing all that we can at this time to advance prospects for regional economic development and cooperation, the US delegate said. He also called for further efforts to include Syria and Lebanon in this important work. The two Arab countries have been boycotting the group since its inception arguing that no progress can be made in the multilateral negotiations before a noteworthy progress in the Israeli-Arab bilateral negotiations. The US delegate pointed out further that the group should examine how to address the needs of the private sector and take advantage of their energy to advance regional economic development. He also stressed the importance of the projected establishment of a comprehensive database for the working group as it will offer linkages to the academic community, research institutes and the private sector. The participants in the meeting, he said, should consider what sort of organizational structure for the group will be required to develop these goals and priorities. "The regional parties will certainly have to play a major role in directing the process", he said adding that the US plans to announce a new initiative related to air transportation. The head of the Japanese delegation echoed the US delegate stressing the need to involve the private sector wherever possible. Economic development is not only the greatest reward of peace but also most effectively strengthens peace, he said. The Japanese delegate also stressed the importance of the participation of Syria and Lebanon saying this participation "is essential if regional cooperation is to be fully promoted on a regional scale". The Jordanian delegate on his part stressed the need to consider financing requirements of priority projects and renewed the idea to establish a regional bank or fund to bankroll these projects. "Another requirement to enhance regional cooperation is to resolve the debt problem facing some of the regional parties", he said. The Chinese delegate pointed out that economic development in the region must be sustainable and steady and should benefit all. "It is therefore important to formulate long-term and phased development programs", he said before calling for increasing assistance to the areas under the Palestinian self-government and other territories still under occupation through bilateral or multilateral channels to enable an earlier start of the reconstruction of Palestine. He equally stressed the need to establish as soon as possible a regional research body of economic experts to work out medium and long-term plans for regional economic cooperation and identify priority projects.
