The move is viewed as an attempt to gain a leadership role by establishing an industry group because of the expected rapid growth in new information-communications businesses. Services connecting with the domestic commercial Internet system were initiated in November of last year. Two companies known as AT&T Japan ENS (AT&T JENS) and Internet Initiative (IIJ) have already begun offering services and Fujitsu will initiate services in June. Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) is also considering the idea of joining in the competition because its operating base will be compromised if international telephone calls are routed through the Internet system. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) is also studying the situation. Internet is a worldwide computer network created in the United States and its subscribers are estimated to total 20 million. It can be used for electronic mail exchanges and to access remote data bases through the use of computers. It is projected to develop into a multimedia system for the transmission of voice and animated images. In December of last year, MOPT began seminars attended by companies involved with Internet. The seminars have been attended by a total of 14 companies, including two commercial services firms, NTT, KDD, personal computer Communications firm Nifty, and communications equipment maker Japan Cisco Systems, and three academics, including professor Junsuke Murai of Keio University. As stated in the prospectus for the seminar, its goal is "to aid in the growth of our nation's Internet system," but the collective opinion of several attendees say MOPT has an ulterior motive. The aim of MOPT is to operate an agency called Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) under its initiative to provide for the efficient interconnection of commercial networks and to use the seminars as a means to set up such an organization. The seminars were originally scheduled to end in March, but a decision has been made to extend them beyond April. The seminars will soon progress into a discussion on the establishment of CIX. The Japanese international communications market is valued at 300 billion yen. Currently, fewer than 500 firms subscribe to Internet. However, when the services are expanded on a full-scale basis, the market situation could change drastically. Some sources take the view that, "MOPT has embarked on a program to regulate the market as a means to extend aid to KDD and existing communications companies that will be impacted by changes."
