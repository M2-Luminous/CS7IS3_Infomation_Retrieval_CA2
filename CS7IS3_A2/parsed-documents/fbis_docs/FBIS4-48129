Mozambique and Malawi have agreed to hold the sixth meeting of the Joint Defense and Security Commission in Maputo within a few days, according to a communique released to the press yesterday at the end of a meeting between the Mozambican defense minister and his Malawian counterpart. The meeting in the National Defense Ministry allowed the Malawian defense minister to get acquainted with the activities of the countries' joint commission in his capacity as the new co-president of the commission, replacing John Tembo, minister of state in the President's Office. During the talks, the Mozambique-Malawi Joint Defense and Security Commission reviewed relations between the two countries in the military field since the signing of the general cooperation agreement in 1984. The two ministers also exchanged views on political developments in both countries, after welcoming the new nonracial and democratic government in South Africa. Meanwhile, the sixth meeting of the Joint Defense and Security Commission, scheduled to be held in Maputo soon, may discuss such issues as the presence in Mozambique of the Malawi Young Pioneers, an armed wing of the ruling Malawi Congress Party. Regarding the presence of the Malawi Young Pioneers in Mozambique -- which is a serious violation of Mozambican territory -- it has been reported that the last session of this commission held in February directed military experts from both countries to report on the situation for the relevant authorities to make their decision on the issue. We also learned yesterday that the commission's experts may meet soon, before the holding of the sixth meeting of the Mozambique-Malawi Joint Defense and Security Commission.
