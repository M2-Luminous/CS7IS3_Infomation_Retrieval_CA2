During his first official China trip since taking office last August, Hosokawa will hold talks with President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng on bilateral and international issues, Chinese and Japanese officials said. He will also fly to Shanghai on Monday to visit the Pudong Development Zone, the officials said. The prime minister told a group of Chinese journalists today that he hopes to reaffirm the consensus arrived at by Japanese and Chinese leaders that the bilateral relationship should be future-oriented and contribute to the world. "I hope that the two sides will hold very meaningful talks and exchange views frankly with each other," he said. Hosokawa's visit comes at a time when there are no major pending issues between Japan and China, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said. Both countries feel satisfied over the smooth development of bilateral ties and hope to further develop them toward the 21st century, the officials said. They said recent exchanges between Chinese and Japanese leaders have brought the mature relationship into "a new era of development." Jiang visited Japan in April 1992, while Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko toured China in October of that year in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties. Under Hosokawa's government, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata met his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen in September, and Hosokawa held talks with Jiang in Seattle in November when they met at an unofficial summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. In January this year, Hata visited Beijing and Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji came to Japan last month. The bilateral trade volume reached 39 billion U.S. dollars last year, when Japan took over Hong Kong to become China's largest trading partner while China became Japan's second largest trading partner after the United States. The officials said Hosokawa will express Japan's continued support for China's reform to shift to a market economy and backing for Beijing's bid to become a full member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Hosokawa will also supervise the signing of an environment cooperation treaty during his visit, they said. Under the accord to be signed, Japan will provide China with technology to combat acid rain, and air and water pollution in the wake of China's rapid industrialization, according to the officials.
