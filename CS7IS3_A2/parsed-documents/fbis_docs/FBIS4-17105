The seven heads of state met at the end of last week in the Czech city of Litomysl (roughly 100 km east of Prague) to discuss in an informal setting topical questions concerning their region, relations with Russia, and the situation in the Balkans. The initiator of the meeting was [Czech President] Vaclav Havel; the presidents of Austria, Hungary, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia also took part. During a television discussion held at the end of the meeting the Czech president noted that "peace in Europe and the world as a whole is impossible without normal partnership relations between the West and Russia." At the same Russia was warned against trying to turn central Europe into its zone of influence. The presidents of the Czech Republic and Germany reacted most sharply to the well-known Russian objections to the possible shift of NATO's eastern borders toward the CIS borders. The former stated that the period when the Soviet Union dictated to the socialist countries what they were allowed to join and what not, was over." The latter stressed that cooperation with Russia should rule out any desire on its part to "impose its diktat upon us." The participants in the meeting in Litomysl stated that they are not seeking to create any kind of pact, although... Although they did clearly exhibit one tendency -- an anti-Russian tendency. The presidents of the seven countries of Central Europe did not adopt any documents at Litomysl. The meetings of the Central European "G-7" will be continued. Hungary, in 1995, will be the next host.
