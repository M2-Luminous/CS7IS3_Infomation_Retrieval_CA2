It appears there were two possible reasons for North Korea proceeding with the replacement of fuel rods in its nuclear facilities on the eve of the third round of high-level negotiations with the United States. One was the fact that some quarters in the United States and in the international community said they could tolerate North Korea's past nuclear-related attempts if it fully returns to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and guarantees it will not extract plutonium from the replaced fuel rods. North Korea probably thought it was worth finding out if they really meant it. Another reason was, judging from the mood in the United States and the international community, North Korea thought it unlikely they would react strongly to fuel rod replacement. That was probably a gamble, but it ended up as a miscalculation. 2. Concerning possible sanctions against North Korea, the ROK Government has a three-point principle -- sanctions should be implemented 1) effectively, 2) swiftly, and 3) on a step-by-step basis. Our stance is that, while measures should be strengthened gradually, there would always be room for negotiation. 3. Generally speaking, sanctions can be classified in three steps -- "limited sanctions," "further sanctions," and "heavy sanctions (like sea blockade)." The latter may bring about excessive tension in the region. Since bans on oil, food exports, and remittances are unlikely to trigger military conflicts, these should be incorporated in the first or second stages. 4. We are seeking a UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution on the sanctions as early as next week. Even in the worst case, the resolution should be adopted within three to four weeks. The United States is in accord with us on this point. 5. While we have an option of three-party sanctions by Japan, the ROK, and the United States, if China opposes UNSC sanctions we must focus on discussions in the UNSC for the time being. The objective of the trilateral talks is to clearly show the grave concern of the three nations and not let North Korea get any wrong idea that the UNSC is the only obstacle to overcome. 6. China has great influence on North Korea since it supplies 75 percent of North Korea's oil needs. China does not want any nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula, and, to achieve this objective, we hope China will take considerable positive action on the issue. 7. It is my understanding that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's proposal for an eight-party conference (of the United Nations and nations concerned) is not a prerequisite for Russia's approval of UN sanctions. We take the stance that the eight-party conference cannot replace the sanctions bill already under debate in the international community. 8. Even if North Korea formally proposes bilateral talks with the ROK, we would not agree. Since the issue is currently under debate at the UNSC, such an offer confuses the focal point of the problem. 9. At the end of 1991, the North and South signed a joint non-nuclear declaration, and this is an absolute promise between the two Korean nations. The ROK declared its policy not to develop technology for reprocessing of nuclear fuel to encourage North Korea to remain in the bilateral framework instead of embracing nuclear weapons development. However, the non-nuclear declaration would lose its effect if North Korea obtains plutonium through reprocessing. 10. In explanation of the ROK policy to stick to the non-nuclear declaration, we have been telling the public that reprocessing of nuclear fuel can be regarded as an attempt to develop nuclear weapons. If North Korea breaks the declaration, we would no longer have justification for staying away from reprocessing technology. In that case, we would have to take some action. If we fail in removing concern over nuclear warfare from the Korean Peninsula, that would endanger the entire Northeast Asia in the 21st Century. 11. Some quarters in the ROK insist the non-nuclear declaration should be abolished to promote the ROK's own nuclear energy policies. Those people are questioning why we have to drop nuclear reprocessing while Japan is doing it for peaceful purposes. To my surprise, most National Assembly members of both the ruling and opposition parties believe this, so there is the possibility of future adoption of active nuclear energy policies in the ROK. 12. At present, North Korea is taking no major military actions to provoke us. However, the Korean situation is often affected by political and psychological factors. The ROK citizens are working hard to strengthen the nation's competitive power in the international market by pursuing democratic politics and a modernized economy. For such people, war is the very last choice. North Korea is taking our antiwar sentiment hostage.
