He will invite President Itamar Franco to the hemispheric summit that will meet in the next few months. Gore's agenda also includes a debate with political leaders, entrepreneurs, and environmentalists, possibly with radio and television coverage. It is one form of doing politics based on the tradition of British colonizers who promoted debates with communities before making decisions. The Clinton administration has started doing that, domestically. Gore wants to do it in Brasilia. The issue will be a single one during his meeting with Itamar Franco, during the summit meeting or during the public debate: the Americas' integration. The issue has become vital to the United States' future leadership, in the Clinton government's view. Jeffrey Garten, former banker and Wall Street broker and current U.S. commerce under secretary for international trade, summarized it this way: "Our future capacity to compete, create jobs, and remain world leaders will depend on our capacity to succeed in the larger emerging markets." For Washington there are three "large emerging markets" in Latin America: Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. The candidates to succeed President Itamar Franco should begin pondering this new U.S. diplomatic offensive in Latin America that started with the signing of the free trade agreement with Mexico. It is crucial for any political power project in the region. It is the main condition for any government such as the Brazilian Government, which is betting on an "autonomous" foreign policy based on the full dominion of the Amazon basin (in the north) and the River Plate basin (in the south). The "Gore mission" is an act that intends to prepare the Latin American political arena for the application of the new foreign relations "model" that Washington developed with Mexico and Canada during NAFTA's negotiations. Gore's agenda during his 48 hours in Latin America is eloquent: Before coming to Brasilia he will travel to Buenos Aires. In Buenos Aires he is scheduled to give a strong speech at the World Telecommunications Conference -- the most coveted business circle in the world. He will speak about "reinventing governments" through a reduction of the state role in the economy. He should not repeat the same speech in Brazil. The State Department is afraid of hurting the feelings of nationalists who might possibly identify Gore's words with "an interference in domestic affairs" at a moment Congress is trying to revise the Constitution. In Buenos Aires, the U.S. vice president must confirm the possibility of closing with Argentina, possibly this year, the first protocols on free trade. That "strategy with Argentina," as the U.S. bureaucracy defines it, will represent progress in the direction of a common commercial promotion project (environmental technology and spare parts); the sale of capital goods, telecommunications equipment, transportation, and basic sanitation with assured financing; assistance in the financial sector's deregulation; and "technological cooperation" in urban and environmental engineering and biotechnology. It is a "package" in NAFTA's direction with the White House's stamp on it and the parallel support of multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. Franco's successor will be installed on 1 January 1995. That day, the borders of the Common Market of the South [Mercosur] will open up. Mercosur, as well as NAFTA, are already part of the scenery. Both projects have problems, but they might represent converging solutions. It will depend exclusively on the capacity of rulers to use these projects as political instruments for introducing changes in this absurd picture of income distribution that is threatening the future of democracy in Latin America. The alternative is a political confrontation.
