He reacted to a report that Amnesty International has just released in which it directly accuses the Colombian Armed Forces of committing most of the political crimes and social cleansing homicides in Colombia. [Begin recording] [Pardo] The statistics are being manipulated. They cited a number of facts and events and accused the military forces of committing crimes that have not been tried and for which no sentencing has been handed down. With ill intention they mentioned these cases. They claim that the military forces are involved. This is evidently highly ill-intentioned. [Vergara] That report suggests that the Armed Forces are working with paramilitary forces or that they are allied with the death squads. [Pardo] I repeat, I know nothing about that report. We will react to it as soon as we know about it. The claim that there is an alliance between military forces and paramilitary groups is absolutely false. Paramilitary groups are not our allies. In fact, the Colombian military forces pursue them. [end recording]
