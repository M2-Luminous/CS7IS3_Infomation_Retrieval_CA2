Jovanovic stressed that Hungary had shown a flexible attitude in connection with the application of the sanctions, in spite of the fact that Hungarian representatives at international forums were still objecting to Yugoslavia's participation in the work of these bodies. Belgrade would like Hungary to change this position. Jovanovic especially held as a grievance the fact that a few weeks ago the Hungarian representative to the UN General Assembly voted in favor of lifting the Bosnian arms embargo. Talking about the intimidation of the [ethnic] Hungarians in Vojvodina, the Yugoslav foreign minister said that this was suggested to them from beyond the border. Jovanovic added: Fears that are voiced in Hungary from time to time concerning the fate of the Vojvodina Hungarians are absolutely unfounded and unjustified. As a matter of fact, many people from Vojvodina fled because they were influenced by the propaganda that is disseminated in Hungary as well. Jovanovich said that Yugoslav citizens could return home except those, of course, who had deserted because until they are granted amnesty, the latter are responsible for what they have done in the eye of the law. The Yugoslav foreign minister said about the Democratic Community of Hungarians of Vojvodina that it was a recognized organization and the Yugoslav leaders would assess its operation positively as long as it functioned within a constitutional and legal framework.
