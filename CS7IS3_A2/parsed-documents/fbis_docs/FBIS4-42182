What now? Having a government is not the same thing as having governability, that is, a government capable of governing, having the strength to govern. Berlusconi has leapt into the saddle, but his steed has every appearance of being an tired old horse. The new government has at least two weaknesses. The first is that it has an incomplete, or at least precarious, majority. Berlusconi gained his confidence vote in the Senate by a single vote "fabricated" by means of absences and abstentions. A single vote is nothing. And neither is it true that all the government needs (still in the Senate) is a handful more votes. In order to be able to govern without daily hindrances and anxieties, it needs about another 30 votes. Nobody yet knows whether Berlusconi will be able to obtain them, or how he could do so. Berlusconi knows how to charm people with his smile, but he will need more than smiles. The Berlusconi team's second weakness is the fact that it is not a team. The first problem is that Berlusconi has chosen -- or in any case allowed to have imposed on him -- too many second-league (and even fourth-league) players. Apart from which his players -- especially the best ones -- are almost all in the wrong positions -- backs assigned to the attack, wingers playing center-field, and goalkeepers all over the place. And the biggest problem is that his team was not born to play a team game. One-third of the group are playing for an Inter victory, one-third for a Milan victory, and the other third for a Catania victory. Leaving the soccer field for the field of government, I would say this: Italy is accustomed to having disunited and uncooperative coalition governments, but the government of the so-called pole for freedoms promises to beat all records for disunity. However much power may unite and create solidarity, the fact remains that we have inaugurated a government with three faces, three heads, that we could call the "Trimurti government." This observation implies no offense (indeed, rather, divination), since Trimurti is an Indian divinity portrayed as a single body with three faces -- that of Brahm, symbol of creation; that of Vishnu, symbol of conservation; and that of Shiva, symbol of destruction. I will not say -- even I do not know -- which of these will be represented by Berlusconi, Bossi, and Fini. But I am willing to bet that this Italian-style Trimurti will not be a harmonious one. Of course, the weaknesses of the Trimurti government are counterbalanced by a strength. It is not merely the fact that Berlusconi is on the crest of a wave, that he can count on the (very great) strength of having granted the Italian people confidence and hope. It is also the fact that Berlusconi has a very big stick, as well as a carrot. This stick has already been displayed in connection with the Senate confidence vote: Either you grant us a vote of confidence, they shouted, or there will have to be another election right away. In fact neither Bossi, nor Fini, nor Berlusconi has the power to dissolve Parliament and call another election. This is the prerogative of the head of state. But even to those acquainted with the Constitution, the fact is that the threat of another election remains a credible one. The question is whether it would serve any purpose. If the electoral law remains unchanged, it would serve no purpose: We would again have the same ridiculous and distorted election results that we have already seen. What would be excellent and would serve a very good purpose would be the electoral system indicated and promised in Forza Italia's election program, that is, a single-candidate system with two rounds. But now Berlusconi is saying that he prefers a different system -- a 100-percent British-style first-past-the-post system in one round, that is, with no 25 percent proportional quota. I can well understand that many electoral promises are bound to remain promises. The million new jobs are not dependent solely on the government's will. The reduction of the public deficit has hitherto been promised by everyone but nobody has achieved it (not even the Ciampi government). But if a proposed electoral reform held good two months ago, it cannot be dismissed with the excuse of force majeure. If you promise a two-round system and then immediately reject it, that is purely and simply breaking a promise. Your government, Mr. Berlusconi, prevailed not only by requesting a "technical" vote of confidence but above all by requesting confidence in your word. I therefore find it very unseemly that you have started by breaking a pledge, going back on your word. Right To Change Your Mind Of course, I do not deny you the right to change your mind. But in that case you have a duty to explain yourself, you must explain why you have changed your mind. I hope that your secret idea is not this: to free myself in the future -- by eliminating the proportional quota -- of that irksome handful of centrists (the Pact and the Popular Party) who now deprive me of a majority in the Senate. But if that were your secret idea, it would be a really bad idea, both because it is unworthy and because it is mistaken. The fact that you head a Trimurti government with a precarious majority is not the fault of the proportional component resulting from the existing electoral law (which I have always opposed and therefore feel no duty to defend), but is due to the fact that Italian cunning has already discovered how to circumvent the British system. [Radical leader] Pannella has not yet realized it, but on 27-28 March our parties succeeded in "proportionalizing the single-candidate system." Electoral Prey How is it done? Like this. On the Left you maintain a nonexistent party, or you invent a new one; then you go to [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto (or his equivalent) and say: Either you grant us 10-20 seats in advance by withdrawing your candidates, or I will field my own candidates in every constituency, in the knowledge that I may not win but also that I could make you lose. And the same on the Right. You go to Berlusconi (or his equivalent) and use the same blackmail technique. After that, once the electoral prey has been captured, the so-called poles are recomposed, and in Parliament we find more fragmentation than ever. And that leaves those who believe in Pannella's remedies looking rather silly. Of course, Prime Minister, you wield the electoral big stick, that is the power to threaten another election. But the stick that you have now does not resolve anything, and that of a plain single-candidate system would cause more confusion than ever. It would be more correct, and certainly more intelligent, to honor the promise made in your program, that is, to aim at a French-style single-candidate system with two rounds. Which is what is recommended by everyone who knows anything about it.
