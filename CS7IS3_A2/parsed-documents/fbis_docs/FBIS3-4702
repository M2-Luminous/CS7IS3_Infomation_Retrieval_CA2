FBIS3-4702 "dreas040_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-040 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Mar 1994 South Korea Announcement of Agreements With DPRK Postponed SK0103073794 Seoul YONHAP in English 0729 GMT 1 Mar 94 SK0103073794 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. Government is expected to postpone the announcement of sequence measures agreed with North Korea that was slated for March 1, timed with the commencement of the long-delayed nuclear inspections, after resumption of inter-Korean dialogue was rescheduled for Thursday [3 March]. Washington and Pyongyang were to announce the agreements reached in New York last Thursday simultaneously on Tuesday. Their agreements required North Korea to resume dialogue with South Korea and fully implement International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections of its nuclear facilities in order to realize the third round of bilateral high-level talks. Seoul proposed Pyongyang to meet on Tuesday and planned to announce the suspension of this year's South Korea-U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit", but cancelled the announcement until Thursday, a date the communist regime later proposed for inter-Korean dialogue. The U.S. Government was to announce the Seoul government's decision to put off the 1994 Team Spirit drill and reopening of third round of talks with North Korea in Geneva on March 21 on Tuesday when the IAEA inspection team arrives in Pyongyang and inter-Korean working-level contact takes place, a senior diplomatic source in Washington said Monday. But North Korea broke its promise made in the New York meeting and did not response to Seoul's proposal of talks, the source said. If South Korea postpones the announcement to suspend this year's Team Spirit, the United States is expected to follow suit and cancel announcement of sequence measures until Thursday, he said. Washington reportedly will closely discuss Pyongyang's delay of inter-Korean dialogue with Seoul on Tuesday. But as State Secretary Warren Christopher is due to present himself to the Congress hearing on Tuesday, he may well announce the agreements reached with Pyongyang in last week's meeting and explain the U.S. position.
