There is a lot of argument. The formula for the deployment of UN troops in Abkhazia changed four times. In effect, the Abkhazians do not want troops to be deployed to allow the refugees and displaced people to return home. They are playing a cat-and-mouse game with us. They want to accept a minimum number of people, very few people. The talks were about military aspects. They should have discussed how and where UN troops were to be deployed. However, the Abkhazians had devised their plans with the knowledge that unless troops are deployed, the refugees will not return. So, when we agree to something they want, they come up with new demands. In a word, they do not want it to go ahead. Pressure on them can only be applied by the Russians. There can be no pressure from the United Nations. The rule is that everybody should sign the agreement. Troops cannot be deployed unless there is mutual consent. What can we do when they do not agree? We cannot impose it upon them by force, can we? The Russian delegation seems to have taken some steps, however, there is no final result yet. There is a fourth formula. Our representative, General Vladimir Chikovani, is taking this formula to Tbilisi today. Let us see what happens. Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Eduard Shevardnadze will see it. Perhaps consultations will be held about it. We will act in accordance with what they decide in Tbilisi. But it is a rather complicated formula. At the same time, there is a formula envisaging CIS involvement. We were told by the Russians, by General Georgiy Kondratyev: Forget them. You see, nothing works out with them, the Americans. We will establish order in Abkhazia in three days. I do not know, but this is what they are saying. The United Nations is really a bureaucratic and retrograde organization. The United Nations say: We have no right to do this and that, we have no rights at all. I told them: If you have no rights, we do not need your ornamental presence there. They want to do the job wearing white gloves, but nothing can be done wearing white gloves. [Correspondent] Batoni Jaba, what about Abkhazia's status? [Ioseliani] This will be discussed on 19 April. But if we fail to solve this problem here, how can there be any talk about the status of Abkhazia. What is the need for a status when the issue of the refugees and the deployment of troops has not been solved? So, we will act according to the will of the authorities, the people and Supreme Council. [Correspondent] Batoni Jaba, does Russia have a concrete plan? [Ioseliani] Russia agreed to our plan. When we produced it on the first day of talks, both the United Nations and Russia welcomed it, saying it was a businesslike and good plan. However, on the second day they said that the Abkhazians disagreed. What could we do if they disagreed? All right, we made concessions. They did not agree to the third formula either, and we are now discussing a fourth formula today. There will be no end to new formulas because, in effect, they are against the deployment. They want just a minimum number, about 5,000 [as received] troops to be deployed at this stage. It will not work that way. [Correspondent] Batoni Jaba, when the Russians ask us to let them in and promise to establish order in three days, what do they mean and what is their plan? [Ioseliani] They are saying two parties should be involved. They or the CIS should be involved. They asked me if we wanted the Ukrainians, on behalf of the CIS, and the Turks to be deployed there together. I told them that we did not want the Turks, but if it is the Ukrainians, then all right. They do not want to act alone and be blamed for anything. They want to be peacemakers in the eyes of the world. [passage indistinct] They want either the CIS to be involved, or the United Nations. Then there will be UN observers. If this does not work, let it be a two-party thing, they say. They say: It is not a problem at all to make two airborne landings and finish it off. We will establish order in three days. [Correspondent] Batoni Jaba, when will this round of talks finish? And also, did we achieve any goals or not? [Ioseliani] [Words indistinct] I personally think that the Abkhazians will not agree to anything. They will only agree...[pauses] They are now having their heads turned by victory, so they will not agree to anything. Until you hit them in the head and do something to them...[pauses] People are like that -- if everything goes unpunished, they carry on doing it. Nevertheless, we won and they lost the information war. All countries support us, the United Nations supports us, the Russians, in fact, also support us. However, this is only verbal support. When it comes to the crunch...[pauses] All right, it is a matter of money. The United States promised money but it has not been allocated so far. Then, countries will have to gain the agreement of their parliaments to send troops. Then, a force has to be set up. Then, their rights have to be determined. Unless they are attacked, peacekeepers have little freedom of action. They just carry out a policing function. [passage indistinct] We have influenced world public opinion to believe that we are right and that our territorial integrity is necessary. And now, if we can do it, even if we burn and scorch everything there [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] Are you in favor of a peaceful or military solution? [Ioseliani] Of course, I am in favor of a peaceful solution. But I doubt that it is possible because unless they feel some pressure, the Abkhazians will not budge. If the Russians allow us to do it, if the Russians do not resist us, then my Mkhedrioni [special militia] will be enough to deal with them. I told the Russians: Leave us alone, do not interfere, and I will show you what kind of people the Abkhazians are. If the Russians cannot allow this to happen, then they should deal with the problem themselves. Let the United Nations do its business gradually. After it solves organizational issues in three or four months, then it will send troops and do whatever it likes. But before the United Nations does it...[pauses] I do not think we should say no to the United Nations. Let the United Nations do its business. Meanwhile, we will turn to Russia and the CIS. But this should happen under UN auspices. When UN troops are ready, they can be deployed. If not, may the Russians leave us alone and we will deal with the Abkhazians. This is my answer. [Correspondent] If the peace talks are not successful, do you think that there is a chance for us to win in the war? [Ioseliani] If the Russians do not interfere, of course, there is. The Mkhedrioni alone is enough to deal with them, provided the Russians do not interfere.
