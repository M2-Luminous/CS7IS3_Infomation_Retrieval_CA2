FR940810-1-00005 FR940810-1-00001 Second, we also propose to require U.S. and foreign air carriers and ticket agents (including travel agents) to provide written notice of the transporting carrier's identity in conjunction with the sale of any air transportation sold in the United States that involves a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease. The proposed rule would therefore require that, if a separate itinerary is issued with the ticket, the itinerary contain a legend that states ``Operated by'' followed by the name of the transporting carrier in conjunction with the listing of any flight segment on which the designator code is not that of the transporting carrier. In the case of single-flight number service where a segment will be operated by a carrier other than the carrier in whose name the transportation was sold, the rule would require the carrier identity for that segment to be disclosed, e.g., ``Service between XYZ City and ABC City will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines.'' If no itinerary is issued, the proposal would require the selling carrier or ticket agent to provide a separate written notice that clearly identifies the transporting carrier for any flight segment on which the designator code is not that of the transporting carrier. The following notice would satisfy this requirement: ``IMPORTANT NOTICE: Service between XYZ City and ABC City will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines.'' Many ticket agents and airlines already provide written information that specifies the carrier that will operate the service on behalf of the airline shown on the ticket. Thus, addition of this notice should not be unduly burdensome. The Department intends that this written notice be given to any consumer buying, in the United States, air transportation involving any arrangement whereby one carrier uses the code of another except for short-term wet leases, as discussed below. The separate written notice requirement would apply whether or not the consumer is given an actual ticket to evidence the transportation, and it must be given or sent when he or she buys the transportation. Further, the Department tentatively concludes that it would not be acceptable to make this written notice a standard part of tickets given to every consumer, because consumers would not be able to tell from a universal notice whether their particular flight was a code-shared operation. However, the Department remains concerned that the appearance of one carrier's designator code on the face of the ticket, or flight coupon, when the service is in fact being provided by a different carrier may mislead some passengers. In particular, we are concerned that some passengers may rely on their flight coupons for information, notwithstanding the presence of an itinerary. We are seriously considering a requirement that, where the designator code on the ticket is not that of the transporting carrier on any flight segment, there must be printed on the flight coupon covering that segment (1) the asterisk that already identifies flights listed in the CRS under an airline code different from that of the transporting carrier; and (2) a legend elsewhere on the coupon that states the transporting carrier's identity preceded by the words ``operated by.'' This information is already available in the CRSs, and the Department invites specific technical comments on the feasibility and costs of implementation or on alternative ways of providing the information on the ticket. Comments should be supported by concrete data and economic analysis and should contain sufficient detail to allow the Department to evaluate the position advocated. If the Department were to adopt such a requirement, it would be in addition to the separate written notice requirement. The above oral and written notification requirements would apply to most situations in which the operating airline is different from the one in whose name the service is being held out, including code-sharing arrangements and long-term wet leases. The Department believes that, as a general rule, consumers are entitled to know both the identity of the company that will be transporting them and the one holding out the transportation. However, the Department recognizes that periodically situations arisewhere full disclosure is impractical or would be extremely disruptive. For example, advance notification is impossible where an aircraft is rendered unusable and temporary substitute transportation is arranged at the last minute. For this reason, the Department proposes to apply the rule only to long-term wet leases. The proposed rule would use the same definition of long-term wet lease that appears in other parts of the Department's regulations, i.e., a lease of aircraft and crew that either lasts more than 60 days or is part of a series of such leases that amounts to a continuing arrangement lasting more than 60 days. The Department would nonetheless expect that, in the interest of maintaining good customer relations, an airline or ticket agent would make every effort to notify consumers of changes in the operator of a flight that take place after they have purchased their transportation. Finally, the Department proposes to clarify the current obligation of code-sharing partners to include clear notice about the code-sharing arrangement in public advertisements. As written, the current policy statement merely directs the partners to advertise the fact of the arrangement and the identity of the actual operator periodically. To comply, carriers have routinely included general and often uninformative language in advertisements, whether or not they are advertising code-shared services. We tentatively conclude that this does not suffice. We consider that it would be more useful to the public if the partners were required to include both the nature of the operational arrangement and the identity of the transporting carrier only when they are advertising services in a city-pair market where the service is provided under a code-sharing arrangement or by long-term wet lease.
