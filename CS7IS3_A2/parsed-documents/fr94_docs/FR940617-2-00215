Project Evaluation and Sustainability Maximum Score: 9 points (3 points for each of the three elements identified above) d. Appendices: Attachments to the work plan which contain information on the budget, key personnel, and letters of commitment. (1) Budget: An appendix with a budget describing how funds will be used for personnel/salaries, fringe benefits, travel, equipment, supplies, contract costs, and indirect costs. You must include budget milestones for each major proposed activity and a timetable showing the month/year they will be completed. This subsection will be scored on the extent to which (a) the budget information clearly and accurately shows how funds will be used, and (b) the funding request is reasonable given the activities proposed. Subsection maximum score: 10 points (5 points for each of the two elements described in this paragraph) (2) Key Personnel and Letters of Commitment: An appendix with one or two page resumes for up to three key personnel implementing the project. Also, you are required to include one page letters of commitment from any partner with a significant role in the proposed project. Letters of endorsement will not be considered in evaluating pre-applications. This subsection will be scored based upon whether resumes of key personnel are included and the extent to which the resumes show that the key personnel are qualified to implement the proposed project. In addition, the score will reflect whether letters of commitment are included (if partners are used) and the extent to which a firm commitment is made. Subsection maximum score: 10 points Appendices Maximum Score: 20 Points Work plans must be no more than 10 pages for requests for federal funds of more than $5,000 from this environmental education grants program and no more than 5 pages for requests of $5,000 or less. These page limits apply only to Section V.S.3.a, b, and c. of the work plan (i.e., the ``summary,'' ``project description,'' and ``project evaluation and sustainability''). These page limits do not apply to Section V.S.3.d. (i.e., the ``appendices''). ``One page'' refers to one side of a single-spaced typed page. The pages must be letter sized (81/2 Ã— 11 inches), with normal type size (10 or 12 cpi) and at least 1 inch margins. To conserve paper, please provide double-sided copies of the pre-application. The only appendices EPA will accept are a budget, resumes of key personnel, and commitment letters from organizations with a significant role in the project. EPA will not accept brochures, video tapes, notebooks, photographs, curriculum samples, or any other supporting material not described as part of the work plan under Section V.S.3.a, b, c, and d. T. How Must the Pre-Application Be Submitted? The applicant must submit one original and two copies of the preapplication (a signed SF 424, an SF 424A, and a work plan). The pre-application must be signed by a person authorized to receive funds. Please sign the original pre-application in blue ink to help EPA distinguish which document is the signed original and which documents are copies. Pre-applications must be reproducible. They should be stapled once in the upper left hand corner, on white paper, and with page numbers in the upper right hand corner.
