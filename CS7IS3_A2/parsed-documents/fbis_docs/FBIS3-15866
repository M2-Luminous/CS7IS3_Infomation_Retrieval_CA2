Around 200 such families need material assistance in Latvia, according to figures at the disposal of the committee. The committee decided to send the collected files for Cabinet consideration, said its secretary Anita Stankevica. The necessary funding could be demanded from Russia during bilateral talks or the Latvian Government could allot the money from the state budget, the committee said. The future task of the committee is to gather information about people who were crippled while in the Soviet Army. Then, the group will contact assistance funds in Germany which offer financial help to Latvian citizens disabled in the Soviet Army.
