The offer was conveyed to top defence research and development officials and air force and navy brass at the just-concluded Avia-93, South Asia's first-ever air show held near Bangalore by top Sibat officials, the Israeli foreign defence assistance and exports organisation. "Israel is very keen for defence tie-up with Indian armament firms, specially in collaboration for development of missile systems," a top Sibat official said. In fact, next to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Israelis had put up a massive display at the Avia-93 show. The scientific adviser to the defence ministry, Prof A.P.J. Abdul Kalaam, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul, and the naval chief, Admiral V.S. Shekawat, held talks with top Israeli aviation and missile experts during the show. The Israeli aviation firm, Elbit, which has developed one of the world's most extensive facilities for comprehensive upgradation of aircraft, particularly the MiG-21, is in serious contention with Russian Sokol company in bidding for the upgradation of the MiG-21 aircraft. Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul said that the Indian air force, during the next two to three years, would have to get in for upgradation of at least 18 of the 26 MiG-21 squadrons and that the government was seriously looking at various offers. Elbit officials, who had put up a comprehensive design of the upgradation they had carried out in the MiG-21, said they had installed advanced avionics, including weapon delivery navigation, communication and display systems, and equipped the remodelled aircraft which they had labelled as MiG-21 2000 with sophisticated smart bomb delivery system as well beyond visual-range missiles. The chief of the Air Staff and the naval chief were at the Israeli stall for more than two and a half hours having a special study of the upgraded MiG-21 systems. Elbit officials said they were offering the Indian air force an upgradation of MiG-21 which would also include improved radar, and head-up display combine with colour and mono-multifunction display system for weapon handling, facilities for ballistic calculations. The other highlights of the modification which the Israelis have undertaken in the MiGs are installation of opher (a terminal guidance kit that transforms dumb bombs into smart weapons), dash (a display system and sight helmet for effective utilisation of advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles). The two sides are likely to further discuss the Israeli offer on upgradation of MiGs when Air Chief Marshal Kaul visits that country early next month. The air chief said once the final decision was taken, the upgradation would be carried out at HAL [Hindustan Aeronautics Limited] and would only take 24 to 30 months for the upgraded versions to roll out. Elbit has also offered to collaborate with India on development of nightsight systems for both the air force and army weapons systems. On the light combat aircraft, the Israeli aviation companies are offering to collaborate in light-weight weapon delivery system, aerospace composite material components, range-finder target designator laser, ECM [Electronic Counter Measures] and counter-ECM systems.
