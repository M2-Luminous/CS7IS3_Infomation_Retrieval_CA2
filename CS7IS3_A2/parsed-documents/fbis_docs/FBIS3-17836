He named such former Russian military bases as Loksa, Keila-Joa, Klooga and Tapa as being the first where similar activities should be conducted. Olesk said that besides the need to guarantee security and order in Paldiski during the dismantling work of the nuclear reactors of the training base, the registry was a good experience for the authorities to test the new methods of registering. Olesk added that after the census of 1989 the number and structure of population in Estonia has changed greatly, with no new census being in view before 2000. According to the preliminary results of registering of inhabitants in Paldiski, over six thousand people live there, Olesk told ETA on Monday. In the course of registration that lasted from March 22 to 25, 3,684 registration questionnaires were fulfilled. In addition, a list of 892 Russian military and their families from the submarine training centre and 69 military from Tallinn fleet headquarters is in the possession of Estonian Government. Children up to 16 years were inscribed in the questionnaires of their parents and their exact amount, estimated at about one thousand, will be clear next week. Another thousand people did not appear at the registration mainly for being on a business trip. Olesk added that people that did not register themselves will have difficulties in moving in the town when the dismantling work of the nuclear reactor at the former military base will start and people that do not have a registering inscription in their documents or do not possess a special permission to be in the town, will be detained until their identification is determined. Up to now the exact number and composition of population in Paldiski, largely inhabited by non-Estonian population and Russian military, was not known, for the former town authorities, subject to Russian military authorities and dissolved by a law adopted by Estonian Riigikogu [parliament] on March 9, refused to hand over data on the subject. Government's special representative in Paldiski Juri Tikk told a press conference, on Tuesday, that the dismantling work of the nuclear reactor, which will bring about a special order to be enforced in the town, will start in the second decade of April and last till the nuclear fuel is deported from Estonia at the end of June or beginning of July. Tikk said that at the first stage of dismantling, the Russian side will not allow anybody but "his own men" to observe the process, for several allegedly secret mechanisms are situated at the object. Later Estonian and international observers are allowed to observe the liquidation process. Tikk added that the possibility of a "black scenario", which would mean a radioactive contamination of the environment, is about zero but should not be excluded. In an emergency situation Russian side intends to bring 200 chemical specialists from Kaliningrad in an hour. In case there is a need to evacuate local population, the Estonian side will pay the costs, he added.
