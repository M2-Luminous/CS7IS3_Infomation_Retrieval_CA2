Approximately $17.1 million is available in FY 1994 for competing applications for the SDS Program from eligible health professions and nursing schools. Of the funds available, 30 percent shall be made available to schools agreeing to expend the grants only for nursing scholarships. An estimated $5.1 million will support approximately 2,040 scholarships averaging $2,500 for students at schools of nursing. The balance of $12.0 million will support approximately 4,858 scholarships averaging $2,450 for eligible health professions students. The period of fund availability will be for one academic year. Use of Funds Funds awarded to a school under this program may be used as follows: (1) To award scholarships to eligible students enrolled in the school, to be expended only for tuition expenses, other reasonable educational expenses, and reasonable living expenses (as defined by the school for all students attending the school) incurred while enrolled in a school as a full-time student. The amount of the scholarship may not, for any year of attendance, exceed the total amount required for the year for the expenses specified above. (2) To provide financial assistance to undergraduate students who have demonstrated a commitment to pursuing a career in the health professions, in order to facilities the completion of the educational requirements for such careers, provided that the total amount used for this purpose may not exceed 25 percent of the funds awarded to the school under this program. Any school receiving SDS funds will be required to maintain separate accountability for these funds. School Eligibility Grants under this program will be made available to accredited public or nonprofit private health professions schools. For purposes of the SDS program, as defined in section 737(a)(3) of the Act, the term ``health professions schools'' means schools of medicine, nursing, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, optometry, veterinary medicine, public health, or allied health or schools offering graduate programs in clinical psychology and which are accredited as provided in section 799(1)(E) of the Act, schools of allied health as defined in section 799(4) of the Act, and which are located in States as defined in section 799(9) of the Act, and schools of nursing as defined in section 853 of the Act. As required by statute, to qualify for participation in the SDS program, a school must be: (1) Carrying out a program for recruiting and retaining students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including racial and ethnic minorities; and (2) Carrying out a program for recruiting and retaining minority faculty. In addition, each school that received funds in FY 1993 must demonstrate in its fiscal year 1994 application that they are carrying out all of the statutory requirements listed below: (1) Ensure that adequate instruction regarding minority health issues is provided for in the curricula of the school. This does not include normal course work, that by definition includes minority health issues ( e.g., sickle cell anemia in a pathology class), but refers to course work reflecting an institutional awareness of the special health needs of minority populations; (2) Enter into arrangements with one or more health clinics providing services to a significant number of individuals who are from disadvantaged backgrounds, including members of minority groups, for the purpose of providing students of the school with experience in providing clinical services to such individuals;
