FR940920-1-00003 FR940920-1-00001 Technical specifications cannot be changed by licensees without prior NRC approval. However, since 1969, there has been a trend toward including in technical specifications not only those requirements derived from the analyses and evaluation included in the safety analysis report but also essentially all other Commission requirements governing the operation of nuclear power reactors. This extensive use of technical specifications was due in part to a lack of well-defined criteria (in either the body of the rule or in some other regulatory document) for what should be included in technical specifications. This use has contributed to the volume of technical specifications and to the several-fold increase in the number of license amendment applications to effect changes to the technical specifications since 1969. It has diverted both NRC staff and licensee attention from the more important requirements in these documents to the extent that it has resulted in an adverse but unquantifiable impact on safety. On March 30, 1982 (47 FR 13369), the NRC published in the Federal Register a proposed amendment to part 50. The proposed rule would have revised §50.36, ``Technical Specifications,'' to establish a new system of specifications divided into two general categories. Only those specifications contained in the first general category as technical specifications would have become part of the operating license and would have required prior NRC approval for any changes. Those specifications contained in the second general category would have become supplemental specifications and would not have required prior NRC approval for most changes. The NRC review of the first general category of specifications would have been the same as that currently performed for technical specification changes, which are amendments to the operating license. For the second category, supplemental specifications, the licensee would have been allowed to make changes within specified conditions without prior NRC approval. The NRC would have reviewed these changes when they were made and would have done so in a manner similar to that currently used for reviewing design changes, tests, and experiments performed under the provisions of §50.59. Because of difficulties with defining the criteria for dividing the technical specifications into the two categories of the proposed rule and because of other higher priority licensing work, the proposed amendment was deferred. In the early 1980s, the nuclear industry and the NRC staff began studying whether the existing system of establishing technical specification requirements for nuclear power plants needed improvement. During this time frame, an NRC task group known as the Technical Specifications Improvement Project (TSIP) and a Subcommittee of the Atomic Industrial Forum's (AIF) Committee on Reactor Licensing and Safety performed two studies of this issue. 1 The overall conclusion of these studies was that many improvements in the scope and content of technical specifications were needed and that a joint NRC and industry program should be initiated to implement these improvements. Both groups made specific recommendations which are summarized as follows: 1 SECY&hyph;86&hyph;10, ``Recommendations for Improving Technical Specifications,'' dated January 13, 1986, contains both ``Recommendations for Improving Technical Specifications,'' NRC Technical Specifications Improvement Project, September 30, 1985, and ``Technical Specifications Improvements,'' AIF Subcommittee on Technical Specifications Improvements, October 1, 1985. (1) The NRC should adopt the criteria for defining the scope of technical specifications proposed in the AIF and TSIP reports. Those criteria should then be used by the NRC and each of the nuclear steam supply system vendor owners groups to completely rewrite and streamline the existing Standard Technical Specifications (STS). This process would result in the transfer of many requirements from control by technical specification requirements to control by other mechanisms [e.g., the final safety analysis report (FSAR), operating procedures, quality assurance (QA) plan] that would not require a license amendment or prior NRC approval when changes were needed. The new STS should include greater emphasis on human factors principles in order to make the text of the STS clearer and easier to understand. The new STS should also provide improvements to the bases section of technical specifications, which gives the purpose for each requirement in the specification. (2) A parallel program of short-term improvements in both the scope and substance of the existing technical specifications should be initiated in addition to developing new STS as stated in Recommendation (1). On February 6, 1987 (52 FR 3788), the NRC published in the Federal Register for public comment an Interim Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors containing proposed criteria in response to Recommendation (1). These criteria were generally derived from the criteria proposed in the AIF and TSIP reports and were modified slightly on the basis of discussions between the NRC staff and the industry. The public comment period for the interim policy statement expired on March 23, 1987. The criteria were developed with the intention that they would apply to limiting conditions for operation (LCOs). The NRC staff believed that the safety limits needed to remain as is in the technical specifications because of their more direct link to protection of the physical barriers that guard against the uncontrolled release of radioactivity. At the time the criteria were developed, the industry did not wish to address administrative controls and design features in the effort to improve the STS. Later, however, both the industry and the NRC staff realized that it would be beneficial to include upgraded administrative controls and design features in the improved STS, and these were handled separately from the application of the criteria to the LCOs. The NRC has developed a program for short-term improvements as described in Recommendation (2). These are known as ``line-item'' improvements and are generic improvements developed and promulgated by the NRC staff for voluntary adoption by licensees. Subsequently, improved vendor-specific STS were developed and issued by the NRC in September 1992. The improved STS were published as the following NRC reports: •NUREG&hyph;1430, ``Standard Technical Specifications, Babcock and Wilcox Plants''
