Maria Eugenia Lima, deputy for Chimborazo, said that the 52 signatures needed to make the special congress official have not yet been obtained. [Begin Lima recording] One serious problem is that [words indistinct], the required 52 signatures have not been obtained, even counting the opposition parties and the one that made the proposal. Anyway, the government has made several mistakes by sending us proposals that cause a social commotion and aggravate the country's problems. I think this mechanism itself guarantees that problems will not be solved. [end recording] Lima blames Congress President Samuel Brettini for the Congress' paralysis. Lima added that the people are eagerly awaiting 10 August, when Brettini will be replaced.
