On behalf of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] I would like to express the following view concerning the discussion of the meeting's agenda: 1. The cease-fire; 2. The minimal policy program; II. Concerning the cease-fire on the meeting's agenda, the PDK delegation has already expressed its view in its earlier address, i.e. the PDK is happy to have a cease-fire now, and have been in the past and in the future. This is because the PDK, like the Cambodian nation and people, is the victim. The PDK, like the Cambodian nation and people, does not want war and fighting. We only want to end the war quickly and achieve national reconciliation and peace. We have said that it is necessary to have a genuine and permanent cease-fire nationwide with proper and adequate control. This is the issue all of us should discuss to seriously put together a cease-fire. Why has the other side refused to discuss this issue in depth? The PDK holds that it is imperative to avoid using the cease-fire as a trick to cheat one another and the local and foreign public in order to continue fighting. In such a case, this would not be a genuine cease-fire and fighting will continue. Can the cease-fire be genuinely and permanently observed throughout the country if there is only empty talk about it and national reconciliation, and without any basis upon which all sides have agreed upon first? The entire Cambodian nation and people are waiting to see a genuine and permanent cease-fire. This is vital to them. III. The first item on the agenda was raised for discussion at the meeting. Each side expressed its views and the meeting took note of all of them. Therefore, we should discuss the second item about the minimal policy program to set up a political basis for genuine national reconciliation and peace. Those on the side of the two-headed government wanted to end the meeting half way and refused to discuss the second item on the minimal policy program for national reconciliation. It refused to discuss the national reconciliation in depth. National reconciliation is the key issue. The sacred goal of our roundtable meeting is to achieve this in accordance with the sacred aspiration of the entire Cambodian nation and people. We would like to ask: Do you agree to have national reconciliation so that Cambodia will have genuine peace? If you do agree on national reconciliation and peace for Cambodia, there should be a discussion. The PDK holds that to reconcile the nation, all Cambodian sides should have a common political basis and decide to work together. There should be talks about what various sides should give one another in order to have a political basis that everyone can agree on. Even in business and investment, there are agreements and contracts that have to be jointly signed. To marry their offsprings, there are discussions among parents on what each side will give to the other, on the dates of the various ceremonies, and on the number of guests, and so on. In short, the two items on the agenda -- the cease-fire and the minimal policy program for national reconciliation and peace -- are to be discussed one after another at this meeting and subsequent meetings of our roundtable commission because this is a topical issue that should be solved in accordance with the aspiration and call by the entire Cambodian nation and people.
