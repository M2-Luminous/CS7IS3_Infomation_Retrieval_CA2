The areas being added include lands managed by the BLM within the Vale, Lakeview, and Burns Districts in portions of Malheur, Harney, and Lake Counties in southeast Oregon. The subject BLM managed lands are covered by the Northern Malheur, Southern Malheur, Andrews, High Desert, and Warner Lakes Management Framework Plans, all of which may be amended or revised to incorporate the new ecosystem management strategy and rangeland reform standards and guidelines. The entire BLM Prineville District area in north central Oregon and all portions of the Baker Resource Area in northeastern Oregon will also be addressed in the EIS.
