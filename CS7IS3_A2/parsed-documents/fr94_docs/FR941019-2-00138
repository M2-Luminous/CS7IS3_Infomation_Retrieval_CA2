FR941019-2-00138 FR941019-2-00081 9. As An Alternative, Pilkington Should be Barred From Asserting Any Trade Secret Rights Based on Information in Existence Prior to December 31, 1982 and Identify Any Other Trade Secrets on the Basis of Which Pilkington Imposes Any Restraint of Trade Change: Paragraph IV.A.2 should be changed to read: ``No defendant shall assert against any U.S. LICENSEE OR U.S. NON-LICENSEE any proprietary FLOAT TECHNOLOGY know-how rights based on information in existence prior to December 31, 1982, the date referred to in ¶26 of the Complaint. Within sixty (60) days of entry of this Final Judgment, Pilkington shall identify and specifically describe any trade secrets developed after December 31, 1982, which it claims may justify a restraint of trade to the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division; and identify such trade secret to all U.S. LICENSEES and to all U.S. NON-LICENSEES who shall request the same in writing. Reason for Change: Should the Department believe it inappropriate to bar defendants from asserting any trade secrets in existence as of the date of the Final Judgment, the Department should at least bar defendants from imposing restraints of trade based on technical information in existence prior to December 31, 1982, and require defendants to identify and specifically describe any trade secret developed after December 31, 1982, which any defendant may claim justifies a restraint of trade, to the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division; and identify such trade secret to any U.S. LICENSEE and any U.S. NON-LICENSEE who requests the same. Such relief is minimally necessary to prevent defendants from continuing to rely on stale claims of trade secrets and refusing to disclose with reasonable specificity any trade secret created after December 31, 1982, upon which it may seek to impose a restraint of trade. Without such relief, defendants will be enabled to continue their past practice of threatening their competitors with litigation based on some ambiguous assertion of trade secret rights. Defendants' public announcements make it clear that they intend to continue the assertion of some unidentified body of trade secrets, notwithstanding the Final Judgment. (See pp. 1&hyph;2 above.) 10. Justice Department Scrutiny of Litigation Brought by Pilkington Change: Alternatively, paragraph IV.A.2(b) should be changed to add subparagraphs (iii) and (iv): (iii) defendant has, within fourteen (14) days after any such assertion: (a) made a showing in writing to the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division in support of the arguments described in subparagraphs 2(b)(i) and 2(b)(ii), above; (b) identified, enumerated, and described such item or combination of items (in sufficient detail and with sufficient clarity to distinguish them from information not a trade secret under applicable law) on a list submitted to the Antitrust Division and to the U.S. LICENSEE against whom such right is asserted; and (iv) such U.S. LICENSEE is unwilling to make lawful and commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the CONFIDENTIALITY of any such item or combination of items for which it has received actual notice of a defendant's claim of proprietary rights therein pursuant to subparagraph 2(iii)(b), above, and for which a defendant has made the requisite showing pursuant to subparagraph 2(iii)(a), above. Reason for Change: The change is necessary to provide for the same scrutiny for Pilkington suits against licensees as is provided for suits against non-licensees (as is set forth in paragraph IV.B.2(c)). No adequate justification exists for discriminating against licensees, especially given that competition has been stultified principally through use of Pilkington's licensing scheme. 11. Adjudications in Which Information Alleged To Be Confidential by Pilkington Has Been Held To Have Been Publicly Disclosed or Otherwise Unenforceable and Related Disclosure Obligations Change: Paragraph IV.G.1. should be changed to replace ``public knowledge in the FINAL AWARD'' with ``public knowledge found to have been such or otherwise found to be not an enforceable trade secret in the FINAL AWARD or in any other prior proceeding␣.␣.␣.␣'' Paragraph IV.G.2(b) also should be modified accordingly. Paragraph IV.G.2 also should be changed to replace ``public domain'' in subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) with ``public knowledge or otherwise not a trade secret'' in each subparagraph.
