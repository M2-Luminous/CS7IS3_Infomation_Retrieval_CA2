The `TEHRAN TIMES' in its editorial expressed pessimism over the new policy which was launched to curb the inordinate price hikes and ease down the existing economic pressures faced by the consumers. The paper referred to the incompatibility with economic liberalization and with the supply-demand trend, its requirement to a monitoring body which is in conflict with the policy for manpower adjustment and its insufficiency for the commodities whose prices were perpetually undergoing changes as some of the disadvantages of the policy. Without a tinge [of] doubt, the paper said, such a policy will not slash or stabilize the prices. To the contrary, it will cause a qualitative and quantitative slump in production, it added. The article noted in conclusion that the officials should reduce inflation rates and curb price hikes by "opening up avenues to promote economy and production and ultimately to warrant economic prosperity."
