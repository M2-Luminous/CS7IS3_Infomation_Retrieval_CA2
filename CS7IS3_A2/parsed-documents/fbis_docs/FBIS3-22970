The strike was also a message to other fugitive terrorists, warning them that any acts they might commit are doomed to fail, especially in light of the prevailing national unity and the complete popular support for the security agencies and all their actions. This preemptive strike is the fourth of its kind to take place in the center of a heavily populated poor neighborhood, in which no citizen or policeman was hit. The first blow was the arrest of nine terrorists who carried out the failed attempt to assassinate the prime minister on 25 November, during which not a single shot was fired. They are currently being tried by a military tribunal. The second blow was in the al-Ma'sarah incident during security sweeps in the area where two terrorists were killed and two others, one of whom was a Palestinian, were arrested. In this incident a dangerous terrorist named Tharwat Hajjaj managed to escape, only to meet his death yesterday along with two others in a clash in the al-Sayyidah Zaynab neighborhood. The third blow was delivered in the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' area late in January against terrorist hideouts, in which seven dangerous terrorists, known as the Asyut group, were killed and no civilians or security men were hit.
