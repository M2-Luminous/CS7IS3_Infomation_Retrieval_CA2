The U.S. Forces' military exercises are frequently conducted in various places in Japan, and the aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines are frequently calling at Japanese ports. This shows that the U.S. bellicose circles continue to pursue their Korean and Asian policy from a force-oriented position [himui ipchangeso]. It is the invariable U.S. policy to maintain and intensify the domination over the Asia-Pacific region. This U.S. policy is becoming more conspicuous today when the power balance is broken in the international arena. The United States is particularly nervous about the Western powers taking increasing interest in this region in recent years with the economic development of the countries of the Asia-Pacific region and with the strategic importance and significance of this region brought to the fore. This is leading the United States to head in the direction of further strengthening its influence and power sphere over the Asia-Pacific region. Here the U.S. ruling circles give great significance to the force-oriented policy [himui chongchaek]. A typical example of this is the present U.S. scheme to continuously maintain and strengthen the U.S. Forces and their bases in Japan under the pretext of our nuclear issue. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are claiming that the maintenance and strengthening of the U.S. Forces in Japan is aimed at strengthening the Japan-U.S. security. But this is a lie, and a deception and mockery at the peace-loving people of Asia and the world. It is not hard to know this from the composition and the particulars of the U.S. Armed Forces in Japan. The U.S. Armed Forces in Japan are the mobile strike forces of an offensive type composed of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. They have all the arms and equipment--from tactical to strategic weapons--enabling them to carry out operations in any region of Asia, and their function is to carry out the role of a shock brigade for the aggressive U.S. Asian strategy. The U.S. Forces and their bases in Japan participate, without exception, in the war exercises conducted in the Asia-Pacific region, and are used as supply and launching bases for war exercises. Here they are strengthening the operational and commanding system among the U.S., Japanese, and South Korean forces and accelerating the preparations for overseas aggression. This shows that the U.S. Forces in Japan are not for the Japan-U.S. security but they are aggressor forces aimed at the Asia-Pacific region using Japan and South Korea as a stepping stone. The U.S. Armed Forces in Japan are the nuclear forces aimed at maintaining nuclear superiority in the Asia-Pacific region and attacking other countries. Not to be overlooked is the fact that the operational focus of the U.S. Armed Forces in Japan is directed at our country. The U.S. imperialists, who overturned [twijibo opun] the DPRK-U.S. talks, are busily moving the U.S. Armed Forces in Japan, babbling about coping with our nuclear development. The U.S. Armed Forces in Japan aimed at our country are prepared to be put into war at any time. The U.S. ruling circles are advertising, brazen-facedly, that the U.S. Forces in Japan are a so-called war-deterrent. This is nothing but a sophistry. The U.S. Forces and their bases in Japan are the source of misfortune that threatens the sovereignty, independence, peace, and security of our country and other countries in Asia. The United States should immediately withdraw its Armed Forces in conformity with today's environment in which the Cold War ended, and clearly know that the force-oriented policy is far from an omnipotent prescription.
