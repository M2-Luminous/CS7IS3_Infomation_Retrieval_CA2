The paper notes that O'Reilly "hosted ANC [African National Congress] president Nelson Mandela at his home in the Bahamas at Christmas and New Year," and it would be "stretching credulity to the limit if we were asked to believe that they did not discuss the possibility of a bid by Mr O'Reilly for Argus. Or that Mr O'Reilly did not establish ahead of time that the takeover would not be blocked by the ANC when it became the government." THE CITIZEN believes O'Reilly's relationship with the ANC has "raised fears that he will influence the future policy of the group, making these newspapers even more willing to promote the ANC than they are now." THE STAR FA Must Not Deny Others Right To Vote -- By embarking on an election boycott strategy, the Freedom Alliance (FA) members "risk being marginalised," warns a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 14 February. "Whether they like it or not, the new government will be regarded by the vast majority of South Africa and the outside world as legitimate and representative." Although the FA is entitled to pursue the boycott option, "the reverse applies equally." "People have the right to vote and provide South Africa with its first democratically elected government." BUSINESS DAY Election Nonparticipation FA Bargaining Chip -- Referring to a confidential Freedom Alliance document on strategic options "`leaked'" to the press, Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 14 February in a page-4 editorial remarks that the alliance tactics "are absolutely dependent on using threatened nonparticipation as the main bargaining chip to obtain the best deal possible." However, the document shows that the alliance's members are "too divided on policy to contest the election as a united front," and that "secession is not an option." This leaves the alliance only the choice between "a passive boycott of the election and the `new South Africa', or an active campaign against them, with the latter more likely. It may be disruptive, but it offers little long-term security for alliance supporters." SOWETAN Negotiations With Freedom Alliance `Exercise in Futility' -- "It is apparent from documentation recently made public that the sometimes desperate negotiations held with the Freedom Alliance have been an exercise in futility," begins a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 14 February. "The trilateral talks between the FA, the ANC and the Government could not be allowed to succeed because it meant submission to the one thing the alliance's members feared most -- the April elections." "While it is owed to the people of this country to use all possible means to achieve a settlement, there comes a time when certain hard realities and challenges must be faced squarely." CAPE TIMES Detention-Without-Trial Remains--"The delay by the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) in implementing the repeal of the obnoxious section 29 of the Internal Security Act -- the detention-without- trial clause -- is profoundly disturbing," says a page-6 editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 10 February. The TEC's law and order subcouncil "has not yet even considered the issue and Section 29, inexplicably, remains in force, in spite of Parliament's repeal of the measure. The lame excuses offered raise serious questions about the commitment of the major TEC parties, the NP [National Party] and the ANC alliance, in upholding civil liberties."
