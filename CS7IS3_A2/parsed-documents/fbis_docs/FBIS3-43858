Sporadic firing was heard on Saturday night, but according to reports it wasn't serious. The shots came from the Makoanyane Military Base about 11km outside the capital, home of the faction whose demand for a doubling of army salaries led to the clash. Residents nearby told SAPA on Sunday it appeared the shots had been fired into the air, and there were no reports of injuries. Members of the Royal Lesotho Defence Force's Reccie Unit -- the other faction which is believed to be loyal to the government -- remained stationed in the mountains on the outskirts of Maseru on Sunday. Fears of a possible coup in the tiny enclave were quashed on Saturday with the help of South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha. He flew in at the request of the Lesotho Government, met separately with all the parties involved -- including political -- and brokered a truce. However, Mr Botha told his guests South Africa would not tolerate a Lesotho Government which came to power by force, and vowed to bring it to its knees. Lesotho and South African Government officials confirmed to SAPA the pay issue was believed to be a smokescreen for political opposition to the ruling Basotholand Congress Party, which swept to power in elections last year. Mr Botha also met the leader of the main opposition Basotho National Party during his one-day visit.
