At the meeting, CPCCMC First Vice Chairman Liu Huaqing announced an order that had been signed by CPCCMC Chairman Jiang Zemin: A transfer of the leadership tier of the PLA's seven military regions, as well as of the Navy and the Air Force was to be conducted in a big way. (Please refer to the attached table for the new list of senior officers.) According to a well-informed figure, in the recent transfer of PRC military brass, some 100 PLA senior officers were involved, and both the scope of the reshuffle and the number of generals involved has been rare in the PRC military over the past 10 years. Western military observers in Beijing believe that the recent reshuffle was the boldest action involving high-ranking militry personnel taken since Jiang Zemin succeeded Deng Xiaoping as the supreme commander of the Chinese military, and it was aimed at ensuring Jiang Zemin's firm control and command of military power from both the organizational and personnel framework. The recent great change in the PRC high-ranking military personnel was quite unusual; it did not follow past practice, which was characterized by briefings beforehand. Jiang Zemin had no military background, and very few historical connections with the military; how could he be so bold on this most sensitive issue of the high-ranking tier of the military? It has been learned that Deng Xiaoping masterminded the scheme behind the scenes. The Chinese people's army all along has been the pillar on which the CPC has maintained its rule. Since Jiang Zemin had become the CPCCMC chairman -- the No. 1 man of the Chinese military -- he had suffered from a lack of confidence in command and control over the Army. Under the pressure of the internal and external situations in September 1989, Deng Xiaoping resigned, and allowed Jiang Zemin to succeed him as "the supreme commander" of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. On 12 November 1989, when Deng Xiaoping met the military brass participating in the enlarged session of the Central Military Commission, he expressed the hope that Jiang would "genuinely control the Army, and would do a good job of it, at that" in the presence of the commanders of the three services, whereas he required the Army -- especially intermediate- and senior-ranking officers -- to be subject to the command of the Central Military Commission with Jiang Zemin as the core. Over the past few years, Jiang has been working hard at his office as CPCCMC chairman, doing his best to have a hand in Army affairs, and playing the role of the "supreme commander" to the three services, but it was not easy for Jiang Zemin to have genuine command and control over the Army, owing to his lack of experience and prestige. He was helpless and had to seek Deng Xiaoping's advice on running the Army on the eve of the convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee. It has been learned that the experienced and astute Deng Xiaoping personally gave him the instruction that it was imperative to achieve a flow of military brass, and that none of them should stay too long at a post in the same locality, saying that Mao Zedong and Deng himself had resorted to this effective approach when they ran the Army. In the wake of Jiang Zemin taking "the Central Military Commission" office, there was instability in the Army's thinking owing to the aftermath of the "4 June" incident; Jiang Zemin did not dare take any great action in the personnel framework. Even when Deng Xiaoping removed the Yangs from their military offices [Yang Shangkun, former president and formerly permanent vice chairman and secretary general of the CPCCMC; and his half-brother, Yang Baibing, former director of the PLA General Political Department and former member of the PRC Central Military Commission], Jiang Zemin resorted to comparatively mild methods to handle the cases of those senior officers who had followed the Yangs, and refrained from taking extreme measures. Now it had been five years since Jiang Zemin took command of the three services, and Deng Xiaoping believed the time was ripe for Jiang to conduct a major reshuffle of high-level military leading bodies in a big way. At the same time, the measure also could be used to test whether or not the top echelon of the military was obedient to Jiang Zemin's leadership, and whether or not Jiang Zemin had "complete command over the whole Army." Jiang followed Deng Xiaoping's instructions. To ensure the political stability in mainland China after Deng Xiaoping and to remove hidden dangers, the influences nurtured by the Yang brothers have been purged mercilessly during the recent military brass reshuffle. Yang Shangkun was in the office of Central Military Commission vice chairman and concurrently secretary-general for many years, and his brother Yang Baibing all along had had a grip on the power to appoint senior officers at and above the division level since he had taken office as director of the PLA's General Political Department in 1985. In the wake of the 4 June incident, one of the two brothers was first vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and the other was the commission's secretary-general and concurrently PLA General Political Department director, responsible for the routine work of the Central Military Commission. The two brothers would hesitate at nothing, and they built up their own influence within the Army in a big way. The recent transfers have resulted in eliminatng the Yangs' men through selection. For example, Lieutenant General Zhang Gong, former political commissar of the Beijing Military Region, first was transferred to the office of political commissar of the Chengdu Military Region -- a demotion after the 14th party congress; he was transferred again during the recent reshuffle, and was replaced by Lieutenant General Zhang Zhijian, former commander of the Beijing Garrison, who was chosed personally by Jiang Zemin. The surfacing of some new faces among the PRC military brass in the recent reshuffle is another point that catches people's attention. For a long time, problems in the top echelon of the PRC military -- such as aging, low educational background, and making decisions on personnel affairs according to qualifications and seniority -- had been very difficult to change, and were not in conformity with the CPC goal of achieving army modernization. In the wake of the recent transfer, at the military region, Navy, and Air Force leadership level, two or three deputies below the age of 50 have been equipped, and a number of new faces in the prime of life have come out in the open. For example, the deputy commander of the Air Force, who formerly was commander of the Wuhan Airborne Corps and who made his debut recently, is only 44 years old. These new faces at the top echelon of the military all have been regarded as absolutely reliable politically, and they have a tertiary educational background, as well as rich experience in commanding troops. They should be regarded as the Chinese military's "stars of tomorrow." In two or three years, they will be chief responsible persons of various military regions. With Deng Xiaoping's behind-the-scenes backing, Jiang Zemin's recent transfer of the military brass has been completed already, and the military brass who participated in the secret meeting at the Jingxi Guest House had quietly accepted the accomplished fact of the "great change and transfer," while expressing their support for the decision by Jiang Zemin, "the Central Military Commission chairman," one after another. This has eased Jiang Zemin's mind. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Current Chief Officers of PLA's Seven Military Regions, Navy, Air Force, and | |Military Institutes | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |New Post |Name |Explanation | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Beijing Military Region |Lt.
