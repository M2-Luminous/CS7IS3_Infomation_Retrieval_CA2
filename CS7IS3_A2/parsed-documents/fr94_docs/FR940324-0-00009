FR940324-0-00009 FR940324-0-00003 Only one comment was received on the proposed amendment to 8 CFR 212.12(g)(1). That comment suggested word changes to the proposed amendment. The suggested change has been incorporated in the final rule, which replaces the phrase ``if such detainee's return to Cuba has been negotiated'' with ``if such detainee's prompt deportation is practicable and proper.'' The remainder of the comments addressed the proposed changes to 8 CFR 212.12(e). One commenter indicated that the detainee should not be advised of a release decision if the Service is aware that the few programs that are available for the placement of released detainees will not accept those detainees. Unfortunately, this situation may arise despite Service efforts to prevent its occurrence. It is beyond the scope of this rule to address that issue. However, one commenter suggested that the panels making release decisions should be informed of the criteria used by the Community Relations Service and the Public Health Service in determining whether an individual is suitable for their programs. The Service has and will continue to address this issue with the review panels. Two commenters expressed concern that those making the placement decisions sometimes rely on incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate information. The Service attempts throughout the parole process to obtain updated, accurate information and to make reasonable efforts to identify suitable sponsorship opportunities, as described in 8 CFR 212.12(f). For example, detainees are asked at the time of each panel interview for the names of potential sponsors. In order to further address this concern, however, the Service, where appropriate, may extend an additional opportunity to detainees to demonstrate that there are unexplored reasonable sponsorship alternatives. One commenter asserted that the proposed rule was too broad in scope. The commenter also faulted the proposal because it does not require the Service to notify detainees of the reasons for withdrawal of parole approval, and advise them of what efforts had been made to secure sponsorship. Furthermore, the commenter objected that the proposed rule does not provide detainees with an opportunity to secure appropriate sponsorship. The Service has attempted to provide such notification whenever possible in cases where suitable sponsorship has not been located. Such notification specifies what sponsorship efforts have been made and the results of each attempt to secure suitable sponsorship. Where appropriate, detainees may be provided with the opportunity to submit evidence of appropriate sponsorship prior to withdrawal of parole approval. Further, if the detainee's parole approval is withdrawn, he or she will continue to receive a yearly interview at which time he or she may advise the Service of any sponsorship opportunities.
