"The Davos forum," said A. Volskiy, "which has been bringing leaders of the world of business and politics together for almost a quarter of a century already, presents broad opportunities for the establishment and development of both bilateral and multilateral business contacts. Moreover, besides Davos, meetings are held regularly in one or another country of the world. In May of this year, for example, such a meeting will be held in Moscow under the motto 'Business in Russia.' Approximately 400 representatives of the business world abroad have already expressed a readiness to come to the Moscow forum. "We have been participating in the World Economic Forum for only a few years, starting in 1990, when the RUIE [Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] was empowered to represent the interests of our country in Davos. We have used this short period to establish business contacts with foreign entrepreneurial circles. Literally dozens of different contracts have been signed. "This time our presence in Davos was not without results. On the whole, that which we were striving for was achieved at the negotiations that were held: a deep and professional discussion of the problems and difficulties of present-day Russia. The work of the forum, as is well known, was not limited to plenary meetings. I would say that it was conducted mainly in sections, or, as it is also put, in thematic seminars. And here I would especially like to note the effective work of two sections: banks and business. "In the first of them, details were worked out and conditions were agreed to for financial transactions in today's Russia. In addition, the agreements achieved were formulated through conciliatory decisions. "In the business section, practically every Russian entrepreneur came out with meaningful information about how to conduct business under present-day Russian conditions, what difficulties will be encountered, how to overcome them, etc. This brought results: Numerous transactions were outlined with a real promise of their being signed in the near future. The greatest interest was displayed by Indian and Japanese firms, although others also were not detached onlookers. "It seems to me that a real return can also be expected from meetings with our former CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] partners. Talks with the leaders of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Poland took place in a constructive and friendly spirit. The exchange of practical experience in the radical reform of political and socioeconomic structures will not occur without leaving a trace either for us or for them." [Zhemchugov] In his speech at the plenary session of the Davos Forum, our prime minister announced Russia's readiness to create a multilateral council of foreign and Russian bankers, investors, and entrepreneurs for the specific study together with them of possible investment cooperation by industries and enterprises. Your comments... [Volskiy] I will note right off that the initiative of our prime minister was met by broad support at the forum, first of all on the part of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development and the IMF, which intend to send their representatives to Moscow, where this international organ is supposed to be established in May-June. Representatives of the large banks of Russia who were in Davos reacted just as positively to this. But if we are talking about the essence of the matter, the initiative of Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin implies the creation first of all of multilateral banking and foreign trade structures. And this is why. The representatives of world business continuously reproach us for the fact that the necessary legislative basis is lacking in Russia to this day, and that in this respect Russia noticeably lags behind Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. And this is actually the case. These two republics have already adopted, for example, such normative acts as the law on concessions and the law on guaranteed export of profits, and insurance of the entrepreneurial market against political instability has been introduced. But we have not yet come close to any of this, although we have been discussing it for two years already. The result of our sluggishness is not slow in coming: In the last two or three months 19 foreign firms moved from Russia to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. We, i.e., along the RUIE line, have already prepared six draft laws to protect the rights of foreign entrepreneurs. We will strive for their adoption through our Duma group--we have 20 deputies there. However, it seems to me that our legislation should satisfy both sides: us and our partners from abroad. It will be possible to achieve this through the multilateral council conceived by our prime minister, in whose structure, for example, joint groups on problems of business and legislation, etc., will be established. It is in this that I see the main objective of his initiative in Davos. [Zhemchugov] It was reported in the mass media that Russian representatives in Davos expressed sharply differing estimates on the current situation in our country and on the progress and outlook for economic reform. What can you say in this regard? [Volskiy] Strictly speaking, there were two groups of Russians in Davos. One of them consisted of the official representatives of Russia, among whom were representatives of private entrepreneurial structures, the director corps, well-known economic scientists, and political figures. People like Ivan Kivelidi, Mark Goryachev, Irina Khakamada, Aleksandr Vladislavlev, Professor Yevgeniy Yasin, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, and many others. The other group consisted of those who were in Davos at the personal invitation of the organizers of this forum. They were Boris Fedorov, Nikolay Shmelev, Sergey Vasilyev, and some others. I do not question the right of the hosts to present different points of view to the forum participants about what is happening in Russia. It is very likely that they tried to see to it that the picture was objective. But what turned out was absolutely different. Two diametrically opposed points of view were brought to the attention of forum participants. One--reforms are proceeding in Russia, and they will continue, but they need certain adjustments. The other--reforms are at an end, and economic collapse and a return to the past are in store for the country. Our prime minister, barely having set foot on Swiss soil, had to talk not about the outlook for cooperation between Russian and world business, but, in fact, to disavow the statements of some of his contemporaries who are unnecessarily dramatizing the situation in Russia.
