ITAR-TASS learnt from Valeriy Gerasimov, head of the State Duma's office, that "the meeting between the two lasted 45 minutes instead of the planned ten". The sides discussed cooperation between the president and the lower house. Asked by ITAR-TASS about the meaning of the notion "succession of the State Duma" which will be debated at the Duma's session this Friday, Gerasimov replied that "we mean succession from pre-revolutionary time, since the present State Duma is not the first in Russian history". According to Gerasimov, legislators intend to study valuable experience accumulated by Russian dumas before and after 1917, mindful also of positive achievements of the former Russian parliament. Gerasimov refuted rumours about a possible intention by the State Duma to put forth property claims, saying that the lower chamber intends to dissociate itself from petty property issues. According to Gerasimov, the State Duma will deal only with projects which cannot be financed from local budgets, including the State Duma library in St. Petersburg as well as the Tavricheskiy Palace in the same city where inter-parliamentary assemblies of the Commonwealth of Independent States are held.
