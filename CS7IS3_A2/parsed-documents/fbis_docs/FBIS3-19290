Provided the referendum is positive, this would give the go-ahead for Austria to join the European Union [EU] as of 1 January 1995. Kinkel was essentially involved in the success of the EU negotiations. Every time the talks were stalling, he provided a new impetus with proposals for a compromise. [Kopeinig] Minister, will there be a breakthrough for Norway during the forthcoming EU negotiations -- and thus a solution to the institutional issue? [Kinkel] I will do everything for the negotiations to be concluded successfully for Norway, too. I am still optimistic. It must not and cannot be that the expansion fails because of a few thousand tonnes of fish or because of the institutional question, important though this is. [Kopeinig] Have you received any signals that Great Britain and Spain are willing to give in regarding the raising of the blocking minority? [Kinkel] I am in permanent contact with my colleagues Hurd and Solana. Both countries want expansion, but the British Government is under domestic pressure. It is quite clear that the blocking minority must be raised from 23 to 27 votes. The European Parliament will not agree to the membership treaties as long as the blocking minority has not been raised. [Kopeinig] London continues to insist on 23 votes. Where do you see a compromise in this respect? [Kinkel] A solution could emerge by coming to a temporary settlement with 27 votes until the government conference in 1996 and by making a final decision only in 1996. [Kopeinig] What do you expect of Austria as a future EU member? [Kinkel] Austria is highly welcome in the EU. As a state in the center of Europe, it will contribute its political vitality, its economic capacity, and its culture to the EU and it will constructively participate in shaping this Europe, which is subjected to great changes as a result of the disappearance of the East-West conflict. Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway belong in this EU. In the future all members must master the common tasks with a readiness for compromise and in the European spirit.
