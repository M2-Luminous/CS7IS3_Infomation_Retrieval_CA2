FR940104-1-00016 FR940104-1-00004 Another significant change in Order No. 636 was the Commission's determination that pipelines must provide shippers with flexible receipt and delivery points. The Commission provided this flexibility to promote efficient use of pipeline capacity particularly through the capacity releasing mechanism. A shipper obtaining released capacity (replacement shipper) is not restricted to using the receipt or delivery points of the releasing shipper; it is able to select alternate receipt or delivery points for that capacity to accord with its requirements for transportation service. The Commission previously has addressed the effect of EBBs and capacity release on the Order No. 497 requirements. In Order No. 497&hyph;D, the Commission eliminated the requirement that pipelines file the Form No. 592 containing the affiliated transportation log with the Commission, requiring instead that they provide this information on their EBBs. 6 The Commission also determined that Order No. 497 does not apply to temporary capacity releases, because such releases are not a request for transportation to the pipeline. 7 The releasing shipper, not the pipeline, controls and makes the determination to release capacity; the pipeline merely facilitates the transaction. 6 Order No. 497&hyph;D, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles at 30,737. 7 Northwest Pipeline Corporation, 65 FERC ¶61,007 (1993). A temporary capacity release occurs when the releasing shipper retains its rights to the capacity when the release period ends. A permanent release ends the releasing shipper's rights and responsibilities under the contract and the contract is transferred to the replacement shipper. Now that Order No. 636 has been implemented on virtually all pipelines, the Commission finds this to be the opportune time to do a comprehensive reevaluation of the Order No. 497 requirements in light of the requirements of Order No. 636 as well as the Commission's experience under Order No. 497. In Order No. 636, the Commission stated that increased competition resulting from the unbundling of gas sales from transportation service might reduce the pipelines' incentive for granting preferences to affiliates, but it concluded such competition probably would not eliminate the incentive altogether. 8 Similarly, the implementation of capacity release may reduce the pipelines' incentive to provide its marketing affiliates with preferences for interruptible transportation, because shippers seeking interruptible service are not restricted to the pipeline as the sole avenue for such service, as they were in the past; they now can obtain firm service through capacity release which is superior to the pipelines' interruptible service. 8 Order No. 636&hyph;A, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles at 30,621. At this juncture, the Commission does not deem the evidence sufficient to warrant rescission of the Order No. 497 standards of conduct and tariff and reporting requirements. As part of its continuing assessment of the need for these regulations, the Commission will consider in the final rule any comments relating to the need for, and retention of, these regulations as a whole. Nevertheless, the significant changes wrought by Order No. 636 do appear to warrant substantial revision of the Order No. 497 standards of conduct and tariff and reporting requirements to eliminate unnecessary information and to reduce and streamline the compliance burden. Modifications to the Order No. 497 filing requirements also are needed to conform the regulations with the requirement that affiliate information be posted on pipeline EBBs. 9 9 The Commission is proposing to eliminate current §161.3(h), §§250.16(b)(1) (ii) and (iv), and §§250.16(b)(2) (ii), (iv), and (vii)&hyph;(xiv). It proposes to modify current §250.16(a), §§250.16(b)(1)(i), §§250.16(b)(2) (iii), (vi), and (xvii), and §§250.16(c)&hyph;(e). III. The Proposed Rule A. Standards Of Conduct The Commission proposes to eliminate §161.3(h) of the regulations which prohibits pipelines from conditioning or tieing an agreement to release gas subject to take-or-pay relief to the purchase of services from a marketing affiliate. The Commission in Order No. 636 established procedures for dealing with gas supply realignment costs resulting from the reformation or termination of take-or-pay contracts after the unbundling of sales from transportation service. 10 Accordingly, a standard of conduct provision relating to take-or-pay relief should no longer be needed. 11 10 Order No. 636, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles at 30,458. 11 For the same reason, the Commission is proposing to eliminate current §250.16(b)(2)(xiii) requiring pipelines to include in their transportation log a statement of whether the gas being transported is subject to take-or-pay relief.
