FR940407-2-00120 FR940407-2-00064 6. Applicants state that the partial relief granted in rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) from the requirements of section 9(a), in effect, limits the monitoring of an insurer's personnel that would otherwise be necessary to ensure compliance with section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section 9. Applicants state that rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or for the purposes of the 1940 Act to apply the provisions of section 9(a) to the many individuals in an insurance company complex, most of whom typically will have no involvement in matters pertaining to an investment company in that organization. Applicants submit that there is no regulatory reason to apply the provisions of section 9(a) to the many individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies (or affiliated companies of Participating Insurance Companies) that may utilize a Fund as the funding medium for variable contracts. 7. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) provide partial exemptions from sections 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act to the extent that those sections have been deemed by the Commission to require ``pass-through'' voting with respect to management investment company shares held by a separate account, to permit the insurance company to disregard the voting instructions of its contractowners in certain limited circumstances. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii)(A) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A) provide that the insurance company may disregard voting instructions of its contractowners in connection with the voting of shares of an underlying fund if such instructions would require such shares to be voted to cause such companies to make, or refrain from making, certain investments which would result in changes in the subclassification or investment objectives of such companies, or to approve or disapprove any contract between a fund and its investment advisers, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A) of each rule. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii)(B) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(B) provide that the insurance company may disregard contractowners' voting instructions if the contractowners initiate any change in such company's investment policies or any principal underwriter or investment adviser, provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (b)(7)(ii) (B) and (C) of each rule.
