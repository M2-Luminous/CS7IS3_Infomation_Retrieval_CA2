FR940228-1-00151 FR940228-1-00010 (X) The institution must advise students that any notifications of withdrawal or cancellation and requests for refund must be in writing and addressed to the designated institution officer. A student's written notification of withdrawal or cancellation and request for a refund provides an accurate record of transactions and also ensures that the request will be processed on a timely basis. Acceptance of oral requests is an undesirable practice. (XI) The institution must pay or credit refunds due in accordance with ยง668.22(h)(4). (XII) The institution must publicize, as a part of its dissemination of information on charges and refunds, that an appeals process exists for students or parents who believe that individual circumstances warrant exceptions from published policy. The informational materials must include the name, title, and address of the official responsible for handling appeals. Although charges and refund policies should reflect extensive consideration of student and institutional needs, it will not be possible to encompass in these structures the variety of personal circumstances that may exist or develop. Institutions are required to provide a system of due process to their students, and charges and refund policies are legitimately a part of that process. Students and parents should be informed regularly of procedures for requesting information concerning exceptions to published policies. PART 690_FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM 17.
