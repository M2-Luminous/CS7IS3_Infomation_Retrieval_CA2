Over the last three years, the Pudong development has been guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideological line of "emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts," with the 14th party congress's "one spearhead, three centers" as its strategic targets. The development has seized the historic opportunity, launched comprehensive development and construction, rapidly expanded opening up to the rest of the country and to the outside world, and achieved substantive progress. 1. Comrade Xiaoping's Decision To Develop Pudong and Steps for Opening Up and Development The Pudong development in Shanghai was announced in the 12th year of our country's opening up and development policy. In these 12 years, economic reforms made two big steps of great significance in regional and industrial opening up. The first step, from 1979 to 1988, saw the establishment of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan Special Economic Zones and 14 economic and technological development zones along the coast. The second step occurred in 1990 with the decision to develop the New Pudong District in Shanghai. Both these strategic steps were personally planned and decided on by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. As a great historic figure, all of Comrade Xiaoping's decisions are made with insight into the world situation and are based on China's reality. China has a large population but a weak foundation, hence a comprehensive start to development and construction was out of the question. Economic revitalization must be jump-started at certain points of breakthrough. Therefore, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Let some areas with the conditions become developed first, and let some areas develop slowly. Then areas that have developed will bring along the areas slower in development, thus leading to common prosperity." He repeatedly stressed: "This is a big policy, one that can influence and set in motion the entire national economy. I suggest comrades consider and study it seriously." This was a scientific conclusion based on 40 years of experience and lessons. Practice over the last decade or so has proved again and again that this conclusion is right and unshakable. Under the auspices of Comrade Xiaoping, China's massive opening- up and development policy was first tested out in relatively backward areas adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, which, more exposed to economic development in developed areas, would have fewer labor pains and could be jump-started. A decade of effort finally established, step by step, a large group of "windows" and "bases" for opening up to the outside world. The areas grew from buying technology and "processing and assembling investor-supplied materials and components" to direct introduction of foreign capital, advanced technology, and management methods; extended domestic and foreign markets; and scored encouraging results. At a time when south China and coastal regions have acquired greater experience in opening up and development, it is necessary -- and the conditions also permit -- to make the more critical second step toward regional and industrial opening up. So Comrade Xiaoping turned his eyes firmly toward Shanghai -- the fount of China's finance, trade, and industry and an extraordinarily large metropolitan area. Early in 1990, when touring Shanghai, Comrade Xiaoping showed great concern for preparations for the Pudong development. When he returned to Beijing, he told Political Bureau leaders: Though I have retired, there is one more thing I would like to say, and that concerns Shanghai's Pudong development. You must show more concern for it. In April 1990, the Central Committee and State Council declared the second strategic step of opening up to the outside world by formally announcing the important decision of developing and opening up Pudong of Shanghai and marking it as the focus for China's opening up and development for the next decade. From a regional development point of view, if opening up and development in the 1980's began with underdeveloped regions which did not have much influence on the national economy, then opening up and development in the 1990's can be said to be spearheaded by efforts in extraordinarily large cities and to be moving into the Chinese heartland. Comrade Xiaoping said in this regard: Once Shanghai is opened up, nothing will be the same for reform and opening up in the Chang Jiang Delta, the entire Chang Jiang region, and the whole nation." From an industrial standpoint, the 1980's was characterized by the opening up of secondary industry, whereas the Pudong development in the 1990's centers on tertiary industry. Four of the 10 policies in central Document No. 10 have to do with opening up tertiary industry with foreign capital, all of them opening up policies of an entirely novel character, which can be appreciated in the opening up of tertiary industries such as commerce, trade, finance, and securities. This shows that China's opening up policy in the 1990's has extended the area of opening up from mainly "foreign-invested" manufacturing industries to tertiary industries. The integration of the global economy is marked by the integration of tertiary industries such as finance, commerce, trade, information, and technology. For its economy to take off, China must create a new dimension in its opening up to the outside world, opening up not only primary and secondary industries, but also tertiary ones in order to speed up structural adjustment and meet the requirements of the integration of the world economy. The opening up of tertiary industry requires a developed economy, modern communications and telecommunications, and various interdisciplinary and specialized professionals as a foundation. According to the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's keynote addresses made on tours of Shanghai in the last two years, Shanghai's Pudong development has the following advantages: 1. General advantages. "Shanghai enjoys obvious advantages in talent, technology, and management over extensive areas," "Shanghai people are smart and have good quality," and "the popular sentiment in Shanghai is amenable, which is an infinite force." 2. Starting from a high level. In February 1991 Comrade Xiaoping pointed out when touring Shanghai: "Pudong development starts off later than Shenzhen, but from a higher level. I think it can catch up with and overtake Shenzhen." 3. A broad influence and great significance. In 1991, Comrade Xiaoping said: "That year the four special economic zones were chosen mainly out of consideration of geographical conditions. Shenzhen borders Hong Kong; Zhuhai is near Macao; Shantou because there is a large Chaozhou population in Southeast Asian countries; and Xiamen because there are many Minnan [southern Fujian] people doing business overseas. But we never thought of the talent advantage of Shanghai." "I wish that Pudong had been developed a few years earlier, like Shenzhen. As for the Pudong development, it is a project with wide influence. More than Pudong is involved here. The whole Shanghai development is at stake. It is nothing less than developing the Chang Jiang Delta and the entire river region through this base in Shanghai. Get a grip on Pudong and stick to it until it is completed." Summing up the above, Comrade Xiaoping displayed the farsightedness and insight that befits a great historic figure in choosing Pudong of Shanghai as the spearhead for expanding opening up in the 1990's. Shanghai was formerly a financial and trade center and a key port on the western Pacific coast, and still enjoys advantages in talent, technology, and management. Every condition exist for restoring Shanghai to a modern international city through opening up and developing Pudong, which incidentally will give us experience in experiments in integrated reforms in finance, securities, trade, commerce, and information. It was a brilliant move by Comrade Xiaoping, the party Central Committee, and the State Council. 2. Comrade Xiaoping's Strategy for Opening Up and Developing Pudong and the Pursuit of the Pudong Development The fact that the Pudong development contains new elements in the stage of reform in which it finds itself, location, and industry determines that any development strategy for the project will have to break new ground. The New District of Pudong has upheld the "three orientations" and laid down the new strategy of "three priorities." The high level from which Pudong development starts can be seen in the "three priorities" strategies revolving around "orienting to the world, orienting to the future, and orienting to modernity"; and the "three priorities" flew from Comrade Xiaoping's strategic thought. 1. Priority for finance and trading. When being briefed by Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji on the Pudong development in Shanghai in February 1991, Comrade Xiaoping made some incisive statements on New Pudong District's "giving priority to financial policy": "Finance is very important and is the core of modern economies. With finance in good order, it will be like a decisive move that energizes a whole game of chess. Shanghai used to be a financial center and a place of free currency exchange. It should be the same from now on. China is relying on Shanghai to gain a foothold in international finance." With profound thoughts characteristic of a great historic figure, Comrade Xiaoping spelled out in short statements what was significant at four different levels: First, he clarified the essential position of finance in a national economy; second, he pointed out the method for developing the economy, that is, focusing effort on financial reforms and development; third, he named the key to becoming an international financial center, that is, an international financial center must be a place of free currency exchange; and fourth, he hoped that Shanghai would do things according to international conventions and become a financial center as quickly as possible. The policy of prioritizing finance has paved the way for foreign investment and led to flourishing finance, commerce, and trade in the New District of Pudong. In banking, the last three years saw the establishment of 38 new Sino-foreign financial institutions on both shores of the Pu Jiang. Banks in the new district boast 25 billion yuan in savings balances and 24 billion in loan balances, 12 times the balances in 1990. The securities trading network in the new district is continuously expanding, with considerable growth in trading amounts. In the financial and insurance industries, total insurance in the new district amounts to 120 billion yuan, a fourteenfold net increase from 1990. Rapid development in the banking industry has promoted rapid growth in various trades and industries in the new district. In commerce, a 600,000-square-meter modern shopping mall complex is under construction, a number of these malls, covering an area of over 100,000 square meters, being supermarkets financed by Sino-foreign investment. Once built, these commercial buildings will be the country's largest shopping malls. The last three years saw the opening of an additional 25,000 industrial and commercial enterprises in the New District of Pudong, and this has created a climate of all businesses converging on the district. 2. Priority for infrastructural projects. Comrade Xiaoping said on a tour of the Nanpu Bridge project: Shanghai is so big. We must build a couple of big bridges. He stressed more than once the urgency of expediting energy, transport, and other key projects: "Launch whichever projects can be launched first; and they should command all the necessary funds. Launching a project a year earlier means reaping profits a year earlier; a delay may well stretch into the next century." To improve its tangible investment environment, Shanghai Municipality plans to spend 15 billion yuan in the Eighth Five-Year Plan on the 10 great projects in the new district. At present, the construction of Nanpu and Yangbu Bridges, the Pudong section of the Yanggaolu inner ring, Waigaoqiao Port district, Pudong Coal Plant, and Heliu sewage plant has been completed, while Lingqiao Water Works and Waigaoqiao Power Plant are under construction. Shanghai people took three years to complete the infrastructural investment project scheduled for five years. To establish the framework of a large modern city as early as possible, the New District of Pudong is pressing ahead with the planning work for Pudong International Airport, the outer ring, Phase II of the electric power plan and the port, Pudong subway, the tunnel line connection, trunk communication lines, and other key projects. These urban projects will go into construction over the next few years and will lay a solid foundation for Pudong to develop into a modern multifunctional city with a rational urban layout, an advanced communication network, a convenient and easy telecommunications system, and a good ecological environment. 3. Priority for high- and new-technology industries. "Science and technology is the primary productive force" is the scientific characterization by Comrade Xiaoping of modern economic development. In one of his southern inspection tour addresses, Comrade Xiaoping stressed: "Faster economic development has to rely on science, technology, and education. One high-tech breakthrough can trigger development in a whole group of industries." "China must also gain a place in the international high-tech world." Over the last three years, the New District of Pudong focused its eyes on absorbing domestic and foreign investment, gradually raising the technological input of the investment projects. A group of noted multinational corporations has transferred world advanced technologies to the New District of Pudong, such as the sophisticated chemical works from Dupont of the United States, Rothmaunds' autometers, programed switchboards from Bell of Belgium, Japan's JVC electronic products, and so on. Zhangjiang High- Technology Zone started operation earlier than planned and 13 high- tech projects have moved into the zone, such as computer software, magnetic tubes for microwave ovens, integrated circuits, and so on. Some 300 scientific and technological groups comprising research institutes and institutes of higher learning have moved into Pudong. In the last three years, Pudong development's "three priorities" strategy has, through "mutual east-west interaction," created a favorable impact on invigorating Shanghai and serving the whole country. 3. Comrade Xiaoping's Developmental View on Opening Up and Development and the New Takeoff of the Pudong Economy Following Comrade Xiaoping's southern inspection tour addresses, the New District of Pudong rapidly opened up both to the rest of the country and to the outside world, and China's reform and opening up entered a new stage. Comrade Xiaoping's keynote addresses are very rich in content and shot through with one theme: "Development is the last word [fa zhan cai shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 3810]." Economic development is the ultimate element and form of expression for international competition. Development is also a main theme for China, and in the 1990's the key to survival for a people. Therefore, Comrade Xiaoping demanded that we "seize the opportunity and develop ourselves, and the key is developing the economy." Comrade Xiaoping stressed: "Low speed is tantamount to halting, even sliding backward." He also pointed out: "Shanghai is our ace. Getting Shanghai off the ground is a shortcut." "Shanghai has every condition to progress faster." In early 1992, Comrade Xiaoping cautioned us: Pudong development can move ahead and can not go back. At the present rate, by 1995 Pudong should see some great changes, which means I may still live to see it. All these instructions by Comrade Xiaoping pointed out that development must break out of equilibrium and create some momentum. Aimed at Shanghai's practical situation, Comrade Xiaoping specifically stressed: "I hope that Shanghai people will emancipate the mind more, be bolder, and take greater steps," pointing out: Some people worry Pudong might have trouble. I do not think it will. Even those who worry cannot name the trouble. Comrade Xiaoping made known his earnest hope for Pudong development in Shanghai in February 1992: "It can learn from the Shenzhen, Guangdong experience. Do a better job in Pudong, build it higher and make it more modernized." In Shanghai on New Year's Eve, 1993, Comrade Xiaoping again advised: "Make more effort this year, ride on the crest, plant the feet firmly on the ground, overcome difficulties, and move up to a higher level." The greatness of a distinguished revolutionary lies in the fact that his strategic decisions will inevitably be transformed into all-embracing social practice. Comrade Xiaoping's remarks egg us on and make Shanghai increase the pace of opening up and developing Pudong and initiate comprehensive construction, which promotes the rapid development of Pudong's economic functions. Domestic- and foreign-funded projects increased considerably. Before 1990, there were only 37 "foreign-funded" enterprises in Pudong; now there are over 1,700 foreign-invested enterprises setting up their bases in Pudong. Total investment from these foreign-funded enterprises amounts to some $5 billion, while the absorption of foreign capital amounts to $3 billion. Foreign- capital projects are characterized by large scale and high economic efficiency, technological inputs, and success rates; and many of them are multinational companies or corporations. Over 2,500 enterprises from the other Chinese provinces, cities, and central ministries have invested in Pudong a total of some 14 billion yuan. Develop subdistricts, take note of strengthening functions. By the end of this century, the New District of Pudong will have built four key subdistricts, of which the central portion of the Lujiazui Financial Trade Zone has drawn up a blueprint of first-rate world standards; and over 50 financial and commercial trade buildings are being constructed, with another 50 in the planning stage. The total construction area of the central portion is 4.1 million square meters and will, with Shanghai Waitan, make up China's CBD [preceding initials published in Roman alphabet] (central business district). The Jinqiaokou Export Processing Zone is constructing an all-purpose export processing base in pursuit of its targets of good economic efficiency, high-grade products, and an export-weighted structure, has signed contracts on 200 domestic and foreign-funded projects, and has embarked as planned on the construction of over 100 projects; and 30 projects have been completed and are in production. Waigaoqiao Bonded Area is taking advantage of the "domestic customs-free [jing nei guan wai 1064 0355 7070 1120]" situation to pursue vigorously international trade, bonded markets, and off-shore financial services; and over 1,000 domestic and foreign companies have moved into the area. With the operation of Xingan District, the area will become a genuine free-trade area. Zhangjiang High-Tech Garden will integrate scientific research, production, and services in a vigorous bid to develop high-tech industry and establish a new economic growth base. The pursuit of the above key subdistricts will lay a foundation for the emergence of an all-purpose modernized metropolitan pattern in Pudong. Vibrant social and economic development. The 1993 GDP is expected to top 16 billion yuan, more than double the 1990 GDP, fulfilling Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee's target of doubling the GDP in three years' time promised to Comrade Xiaoping in 1991. By the end of this century, the New District of Pudong is expected to have raised 200 billion yuan through the absorption of foreign capital, joint domestic funds, bank financing, funds raised through securities, land rents, mutual funds operations, "BOT [preceding term published in Roman alphabet; expansion unknown]" mode, and financial inputs, to finance various projects in the new district, of which 40 percent will go to infrastructure, 30 percent to modern high-tech industry, and the remaining 30 percent into tertiary industry. By then, the GDP of the New District of Pudong is expected to top 80 billion yuan, achieving the target of increasing its GDP by seven times, and by then its economic power will account for one-fourth of Shanghai's economy, as against one-fourteenth in 1990. Meanwhile, the new district is stepping up efforts to establish a coordinated education system featuring universities, special institutes of higher learning, technical colleges, and basic education; to build a group of high-end medical, cultural, and sport facilities; and to develop the New District of Pudong into a first- rate commercial center with a first-rate urban infrastructure, a first-rate all-purpose free-trade zone, an export and processing base, a suburban agricultural zone, and a high-quality residential area in Shanghai. 4. The Future Scenario Charted by Comrade Xiaoping for Pudong's Opening Up and Development and for the Effort To "Spearhead" Shanghai's Pursuit of "Three Centers" With the Pudong Development Comrade Xiaoping stressed repeatedly: "We have to create a few more Hong Kongs in the mainland." This is one key element in Comrade Xiaoping's opening up and development strategy. It is not aimed at creating a Hong Kong-style social system, though it does mean that to achieve the targets of our development strategy, we have to be more open and, where conditions permit, learn from Hong Kong's experience and allow an international financial, trading, and economic center to play its role. The 14th party congress report points out: With the Pudong development as the vanguard, further develop cities along the Chang Jiang, and as quickly as possible develop Shanghai into one of the international economic, financial, and trading centers, with which to trigger off an economic takeoff in the Chang Jiang Delta and the entire river region. This is the demand and target set by the party for the Pudong development in realizing the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's addresses. The conditions and potential for Shanghai to become a financial center. A financial center only emerges when there is a concentration of the headquarters or branches of international banks in a place which is, moreover, nourished by securities capital, foreign exchange, and gold markets. As the Pudong development unfolds, there are now over 50 banks' headquarters and branches and financial companies in Shanghai, all as legal entities, and over 80 offices of foreign-capital banks. In the next few years, both shores of the Pu Jiang are likely to add and capable of adding another 10 or more Chinese- and foreign-capital commercial banks or financial companies. In this way, by the end of this century, when Shanghai will have 150 or more financial institutions, Shanghai will -- with the addition of a few other financial operations -- have every good condition to become a financial center. At present, various types of financial markets have started business and are moving rapidly forward in Shanghai. 1. Rapid development in securities markets. The capital trading volume of Shanghai Securities Exchange in 1992 was 76 billion yuan, but in 1993 it is expected to have topped 400 billion yuan. The exchange now has over 400 members and over 1,200 seats. Operations at the exchange are increasingly standardized. 2. A capital market taking shape. Capital discount volume jumped from 10 billion yuan in 1990 to 160 billion yuan in 1992 -- proving that it is entirely possible for Shanghai to become a regional capital center, playing a leading role in financing, and helping form a monetary market in Shanghai. 3. Prospects for expanding the foreign exchange market. Last year 3.7 billion yuan changed hands in the Shanghai foreign exchange swap center. The next step should be slowly turning the swap center into a national foreign exchange trading market, with slow expansion in trading volume, the participation of enterprises of multiple forms of ownership and individuals in foreign exchange swapping, a greater variety of currencies traded, a widening range of discount transactions between foreign-exchange dealers, and development in foreign-exchange futures. Meanwhile, the "domestic customs-free" situation enjoyed by Waigaoqiao Bonded Area should be exploited to help launch cross-strait financial services. 4. Enormous potential in the gold market. Shanghai has a large and reputable gold jewelry market, which can serve as a base for the formation of a gold market, extending gold investment channels, creating intermediate agencies for the gold trade, and introducing spot gold and gold futures, gold certificates and accounts, and other investment and trading forms, eventually leading to a centralized gold market in conjunction with the international gold market and participating in its competition. Conditions and potential for Shanghai to become a trade center. An international trade center owes its existence to the convergence of Chinese and foreign mercantile and trading houses onto a place serving cargo transhipment and domestic and foreign trading. The policy of opening up and developing Pudong provides excellent conditions for Shanghai to become a trade center. 1. Make the effort of developing and expanding futures trading a springboard for turning Shanghai into a trading and circulating center of domestic and international capital goods and bulk cargoes. Already in operation are metal, coal, petroleum, cotton, chemical, grain, and various other futures markets, the total trading volume of which for this year is expected to top 300 billion yuan and possibly over 1 trillion by 1995, when they will have become China's largest futures markets. 2. Give play to the role of big ports, create conditions in the New District of Pudong for setting up foreign-trade trading companies; establish foreign-trade holding companies; experiment in pilot joint-investment, joint-venture commercial wholesaling business; and implement the new district's preferential policies for foreign trading in order to attract more international multinational [as published] corporations and noted trading houses to set up bases in Pudong. Meanwhile, actively explore ways to enhance the role of Waigaoqiao Bonded Area; build China's largest free-trade zone where things are done in conformity with international conventions; work hard to increase the proportion of Shanghai's entrepot trade in total trading volume from the present 30 percent to over 70 percent by the year 2000; and create a climate such that businesses all converge on Pudong through the operation of the large Pudong port, with which to stimulate a vibrant growth in Shanghai's domestic and foreign trade. 3. Attract domestic and foreign capital; set up a group of super-wholesaling markets, supermarkets, chain shops, and 24-hour- operation commercial networks to facilitate great flows of international goods in and out of Pudong, Shanghai. Shanghai's conditions and potential to become an economic center. The formation of an economic bloc relies on a great modern industrial underpinning, takes large-sized multinational corporations and business conglomerates as the main force, and aims at the aggregate economic turnover and combined economic indicators of an international city. Shanghai has been making rapid progress in this direction in recent years/ First, direct the effort to speed up the development of Pudong Jinqiao Export and Processing Zone and Zhangjiang High-Technology Garden, and develop Minxing Industrial Development Zone and Caohejing High-Technology Development Zone in Puxi; and introduce with selective emphases new industries characterized by large size, high efficiency, and a strong, fanning-out impact on other industries, which will create the necessary momentum for the emergence of a group of modern industries that typify the functions, status, and role of a mega-economic center city. Second, exploiting the advantage of capital movements on Shanghai's finance and securities markets and Pudong's pathbreaking attempt to link itself up with international markets, we may establish a group of joint-stock, cross-regional, and industrially integrated business conglomerates at an optimal level of composition and resource allocation to boost competitiveness in international markets. Third, strengthen the reform effort in the operation and management of state-owned assets in Shanghai and the New District of Pudong; quicken the flow of state-owned assets; and build dozens, even hundreds, of multinational and joint-stock corporations in Shanghai and Pudong to turn these two areas into financial command centers of multinational and joint-stock corporations. Through the study of Comrade Xiaoping's thought on opening up and developing and the practice of the Pudong development, we have come to appreciate the arduousness and role of the Pudong development and Shanghai's reinvigoration. We firmly believe that, guided by the line of Comrade Xiaoping's reform and opening up thought, supported by the central authorities, and through ceaseless struggle, Shanghai will be able to take advantage of the time, geographical location, and personnel harmony and complete this great task. The party's "grand objective of "one spearhead, three centers" will become a reality with the arrival of the new century.
