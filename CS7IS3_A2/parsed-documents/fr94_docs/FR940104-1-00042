FR940104-1-00042 FR940104-1-00009 NHTSA is considering additional tests for light vehicle antilock systems for three reasons. First, ABS requirements on passenger cars were originally developed in proposals for Standard No. 135, Passenger Car Brake Systems, which are based on the effort to harmonize braking standards with EEC and ECE requirements. These proposals included split mu tests and surface transition tests. Second, the agency believes that light vehicle ABS may need to have a higher level of capability for some aspects of performance than heavy vehicle ABS. For instance, the antilock systems on heavy vehicles do not have to be as quick as the systems on light vehicles in responding to impending wheel lock. The wheel lockup allowed by light vehicle antilock systems available today is about 0.2 seconds, compared with a lockup duration closer to one second for heavy vehicle systems. This is so because heavy vehicles typically have a longer wheel base than light vehicles, and a high vehicle moment of inertia about the vertical axis. On these vehicles, yaw movement during braking with ABS on a split mu surface or during a braking-in-a-curve maneuver takes place at a relatively slower rate than on light vehicles, primarily because of the higher vehicle moment of inertia. Third, in contrast to testing light vehicles, the availability of test facilities and the safety of the tests would make more extensive testing impracticable for heavy vehicles because such vehicles are larger and more prone to rollover than light vehicles. For the above reasons, the split mu and surface transition tests might be appropriate additions to the braking-in-a-curve test for light vehicles. The agency anticipates that each of these tests would be conducted at 30 mph using a full pedal application (200 pounds pedal force applied within 0.2 seconds) and that the vehicle would be required to stay within a 12-foot lane. There would be no stopping distance requirement as part of these tests. (The issue of separate tests for stopping distance is discussed below in connection with question 13.) 9. As mentioned above, NHTSA is considering whether to propose a ``braking-in-a-curve test'' in which a light vehicle's braking would be evaluated at a relatively slow speed on a slippery surface. This test is designed to evaluate the capability of a vehicle to be controlled while braking in a curve. The test could be conducted on a 500-foot radius curve on a surface with a peak friction coefficient (PFC) of 0.5 or less. What benefits would be obtained from such a braking-in-a-curve test? What problems, if any, would be associated with this maneuver? Would this testing approach be a sufficient indicator of the lateral control and stability expected from an ABS equipped light vehicle? How would rear-wheel-only antilock systems perform under this test procedure? 10. NHTSA is considering whether to propose another type of test, possibly as an alternative to the braking-in-a-curve test. This test is known as a ``split coefficient of friction test'' (or split mu test) and is designed to evaluate a vehicle's ability to be controlled when one side of a road is slick and the other side is much stickier. If NHTSA were to propose such a test, it probably would be conducted on a straight lane surface with the high mu part of the surface having a PFC equal to or greater than 0.5 and the low mu part of the surface having a PFC of less than or equal to one-half the PFC of the high mu surface. An alternative way to describe the test surface would be to specify the PFCs for both parts of the surface (e.g., the high mu part would be 0.9 or greater and the low mu part would be 0.45 or less). The test lane would be split down the centerline along its length, so that the wheels on one side of the vehicle are on the high friction surface and the wheels on the other side of the vehicle are on the slick surface. What benefits would be obtained from testing on such a split mu surface? What problems, if any, would result from such a surface? Would this test be a sufficient indicator of the lateral stability and control expected from an ABS-equipped vehicle? How would rear-wheel-only antilock systems perform under this test procedure? What is the best way to specify the test surface? 11. NHTSA is also considering whether to propose a ``low to high mu surface transition test.'' This test is designed to evaluate the capability of an antilock system to modulate brake pressure to achieve a high level of deceleration after the vehicle makes a transition to the high mu surface. NHTSA anticipates that if it proposes such a test, the high mu surface would have a PFC equal to or greater than 0.5, and the low mu surface would have a PFC of less than or equal to one half the PFC of the high mu surface. The agency is considering whether to propose requiring that the vehicle achieve at least 95 percent of the deceleration of the uniform coefficient deceleration on the high mu surface within one second. What benefits would be obtained from such a transition test? What problems, if any, would be associated with this test maneuver? Would this test be a sufficient indicator of the modulation capability expected from an ABS-equipped light vehicle? Would the suggested way of specifying test surfaces be appropriate? The agency requests comments about whether to specify the time needed to achieve a specific deceleration and to specify a maximum lockup duration during the transition. How would rear-wheel only antilock systems perform under this test procedure?
