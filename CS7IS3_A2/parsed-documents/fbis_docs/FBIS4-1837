FBIS4-1837 "drchi064_v_94011" FBIS-CHI-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 TAIWAN High-Tech Exports Decline Despite Incentives High-Tech Exports Decline Despite Incentives OW0404090594 Taipei CNA in English 0700 GMT 4 Apr 94 OW0404090594 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Sofia Wu] [Text] Taipei, April 4 (CNA) -- Taiwan has enjoyed an aggregate trade surplus for the past 18 years, but its annual trade in high-technology products has remained in the red since 1988, Ministry of Finance statisticians reported Monday [4 April]. The officials said that although the government has offered tax and other financial incentives to encourage investment in high-tech industries, the imbalance in state-of-the-art products trade continues to grow. High-tech imports reached U.S.$37 billion in 1993, while exports totaled about U.S.$29.1 billion. The U.S.$7.9 billion imbalance, roughly equal to Taiwan's total trade surplus for the year, was the largest gap since 1988 when the high-tech trade deficit stood at U.S.$2 billion, the officials said. And last year, Taiwan's high-tech exports even suffered a year-on-year 5.27 percent decline, reversing the steady upward trend recorded over the previous five years, the officials noted. They blamed the phenomenon on high demand for high-tech products here and slow progress in upgrading local industries. Shih Chin-tai, key components development project chief at the government-funded Industrial Technology Research Institute, said local high-tech companies have not yet established comprehensive overseas distribution networks, which has hindered Taiwan's export expansion. But Taiwan will soon be able to mass produce such key electronic and machinery parts as liquid crystal displays, data compressors and memory chips, Shih said. "These products will help increase Taiwan's high-tech production by an estimated U.S.$3.49 billion by 1997, and cut reliance on high-tech imports," he explained. Some economists suggested that the government offer even more incentives to encourage development of certain "strategic" industries, such as telecommunications, machinery and key electronic parts. Computers, machinery and chemicals are Taiwan's major high-tech exports, while electronic components and parts, sophisticated machinery and car engines form the bulk of Taiwan's high-tech imports, according to government tallies.
