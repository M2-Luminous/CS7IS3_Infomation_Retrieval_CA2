Addressing a news conference at the university, Goncz stressed that politically "Poland and Hungary want to become a part of Europe," but culturally "the two countries have always been its part." "We will submit European Union full membership motions at the same time which proves that we are the two pillars of the European stability," he said. Speaking about a cooperation between Poland and Hungary, Goncz stated that it has interesting prospects, as "future Europe is not only the Europe of nations but also of regions." The Hungarian head of state added that the Visegrad Group states, including Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, should go together on the road to a new Europe and that this cooperation does not need to be institutionalized.
