This is a very serious situation. First of all, North Korean leaders should stop using its "fuel rod card" but should comply with a call by the UNSC, which in a presidential statement issued at the end of May asked Pyongyang to remove and store fuel rods in such a way as to enable the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to accurately assess them in the future. Pyongyang has asserted that "we have extracted experimentally only a very small amount (about 90 gm) of plutonium from broken fuel rods." Fuel rods are real evidence that enables the IAEA to ascertain whether or not Pyongyang's assertion is true. North Korea is holding up its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Using this "special position," it has rejected regular inspections of fuel rod removal. Pyongyang has also asserted that if the nuclear issue is resolved at a third round of high-level talks with the United States, it will allow the IAEA to inspect the discharge of fuel rods. The IAEA, which does not approve of the DPRK's "special position," initially called for inspections of the ongoing discharge of fuel rods. Recently, the agency appears to have backed down from that position. It now proposes that Pyongyang should at least promote work to remove fuel rods in accordance with IAEA standards in the future. It can be said that the agency has made the proposal in consideration of North Korea's "special position." After the UNSC issued a presidential statement in May, a councilor at the North Korean Embassy in Australia reportedly told Western correspondents that although Pyongyang could not stop the work to remove fuel rods, it stored sets of 40 discharged fuel rods in a storage pool after attaching a plate showing each rod's location inside the reactor and its serial number. Moreover, he reportedly said that although the IAEA was demanding the storing of every 10 fuel rods as one set, this was a technical matter and that there was no big difference in opinion about it. If what he has said is true, and if Pyongyang has no intention of destroying evidence, the DPRK should not be hung up on the "technical matter." We hope that the UNSC will exercise prudence. The recent uproar caused by the discharge of fuel rods has increased suspicion over the DPRK's nuclear program. But at the present, it is no more than suspicion. What has been questioned is whether or not North Korea has extracted weapons-grade plutonium from spent fuel rods. However, removed fuel rods are put under IAEA supervision, so they will not be diverted to a military program. It is believed that India, Pakistan, and Israel have promoted the development of nuclear weapons, or that they already have them. As such, there are potential nuclear powers in the world. Unlike the DPRK, these countries are not obliged to accept nuclear inspections and not subject to sanctions because they are not NPT members. If economic sanctions are imposed on an NPT member over suspicion of its nuclear program, this will discourage other countries from joining the NPT. If North Korea withdraws from the NPT as a result of economic sanctions, it will become impossible for Pyongyang to realize its wish to normalize relations with the United States. But at the same time, the DPRK will be free from the obligation to submit to nuclear inspections. From the broad view of maintaining and expanding the NPT system, a hasty decision on economic sanctions should be avoided. We should not forget that it is ordinary people who suffer from sanctions. There is still hope that this nuclear issue will be resolved peacefully through dialogue. When the UNSC issued a presidential statement at the end of March to call on North Korea to accept additional nuclear inspections, Pyongyang "flatly rejected" it. However, in May, the country expressed a strong desire to settle the issue at high-level talks with the United States through the acceptance of additional inspections. Now is a very critical moment for dialogue diplomacy.
