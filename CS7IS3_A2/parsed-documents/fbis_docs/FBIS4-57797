It happens that, without congressional approval on both sides of the Andean mountains, the agreements signed in 1991 by then-Chilean President Patricio Aylwin and Argentine President Carlos Menem, which resolved 22 points under dispute between the two countries, but did not manage to untie the "Gordian knots" involving the lake and the Continental Glaciers, paved the way for international arbitration. Some diplomatic researchers speculate about the inexorably looming shadow of an "arbitration compensation" to settle the disputes with Chile. The researchers interpret that there are conditions for the court to recognize Argentine sovereignty in Laguna del Desierto. Nevertheless, based on the right, following the 1984 agreements on the Beagle channel, to submit other areas under dispute to the Arbitration Court, without a right to veto and with unappealable rulings, the researchers note that it would be a miracle if Chile does not submit the Continental Glaciers issue to international courts. This issue has been bogged down in the Argentine Congress since 1991. Following a Foreign Ministry request, now that the arbitration ruling is forthcoming, provincial authorities wisely chose to remain silent. Nevertheless, the experts note that Chile keeps the Glaciers card up its sleeve. The experts note that this alternative would actually allow the approval of the Aylwin-Menem agreements through some compensation mechanism to establish the "polygonal line" [not further specified] as the border between the two countries. Many people in this part of the country believe such a ruling would involve Argentina's loss of "the key" to the Continental Glaciers. As confirmed by maps and geographic charts, the area under dispute was sovereign Santa Cruz (Argentina) territory between the 1902 arbitration and 1965. The "official history," which is very well known by Santa Cruz residents, particularly confirms this fact. The 1902 arbitration had an adventurous side: Sir Thomas Holdrich, a British citizen appointed by His Majesty Edward VII to establish the borders between Argentina and Chile, buried a Dutch gin jug as a group of assistants looked on in surprise. The landmark was established at 72 degrees 47 minutes latitude west. Henceforth, it was established that from that point, called landmark 62, to the Fitz Roy Mount the border between Argentina and Chile would pass through the high Andean mountain peaks, the local water divide (lines that meet without cutting across rivers).
