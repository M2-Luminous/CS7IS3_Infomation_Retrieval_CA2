The electoral authorities, however, refrained from proclaiming the Reformist Social Christian Party (PRSC) candidate the victor because the official resolution on charges of irregularities filed by the opposition is still pending. The JCE considers the charges filed by the opposition parties to be "nonexistent" despite the lack of verification of eight voting tables, according to JCE spokesman Francisco Alvares. According to the results of the JCE, Balaguer obtained 42.44 percent of the votes, while the largest opposition party, the Dominican Revolutionary Party, led by Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, who made charges of alleged fraud, obtained 41.40 percent. Third place was held by the Democratic Liberation Party (PLD) of former President Juan Bosch, which obtained 13.8 percent. The results were suspended for a period of time until the authorities were able to explain which of the two presidential candidates had committed the least amount of electoral fraud at the polls. Even though the figures provided by the JCE gives Balaguer the victory, Pena Gomez said he would continue until he has exhausted all peaceful means to denounce the "colossal fraud" of which he claims to have been a victim.
