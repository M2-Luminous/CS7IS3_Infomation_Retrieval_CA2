FR940405-2-00108 FR940405-2-00043 51. Regulation: 24 CFR 811.114(d), 811.115(b), 811.117. Project/Activity: Fairfax, County, Virginia RHA refunding of bonds which financed a section 8 assisted project, Bridle Creek Apartments, FHA No. 051&hyph;35318. Nature of Requirement: The Regulations set conditions under which HUD may grant a section 11(b) letter of exemption of multifamily housing revenue bonds from Federal income taxation. Granted By: Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner. Date Granted: September 15, 1993. Reasons Waived: The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms of refunding transactions. This refunding proposal was approved by HUD on September 2, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 5.83%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $3,175,000 at current low-interest rates will save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt coupons of 10.4% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 5.83%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 10.7% to 5.85%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective. 52.
