The MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] has come out to defend its party members and former President Paz Zamora by stating that [former Interior Minister] Guillermo Capobianco has called a news conference this morning in Santa Cruz and is willing to subject himself to any investigation. At any rate, we are facing a unique situation because the drug trafficker has caused a political earthquake by slandering respectable institutions such as the Bank of Santa Cruz.
