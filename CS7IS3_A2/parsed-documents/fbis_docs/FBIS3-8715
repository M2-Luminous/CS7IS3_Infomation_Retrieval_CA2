[Silajdzic] As you know, the draft constitution has been completed. The constitution is based on the international subjectivity and integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so this is an issue of an internal transformation of the constitutional organization. The constitutional solutions remain open to the third side, as does the entire peace process. These are the main points. I can say that the proposed solutions are based on the well-known democratic solutions and the guarantees of the highest standards of human rights, including the collective, individual, and ethnic rights. The constitution establishes a federation with the usual competencies and the manner of decisionmaking that guarantees the principles of national equality and the influence of the democratic and multiparty political system. The agreement and the constitution imply the mechanisms of integrating Bosnia-Herzegovina into the integration processes, domestic and international guarantees of human rights and, if I may stress, particular stress is placed on human rights in this document, that is, human rights follow immediately after the establishment of the federation. Why? We believe, all of us here, that the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina is a case of an unprecedented violation of human rights. That means that we have to get used to the fact that human rights are not just an appendage, but rather the main point. We all have to get used to that. We have to try and live by that. All the people, all the individuals, on the territory of the federation enjoy the right to life, to freedom, to equality before the law, to no discrimination based on race, creed, language, political beliefs, and so on. All the people have the right to privacy, to freedom of movement, to asylum, to property, to the fundamental freedoms, the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of thought, consciousness, belief, religion, and so on. These are the fundamental freedoms that we will try and apply in reality. They are of course on paper in this document. I would like to stress that. The rest is practically technical stuff. [Karamehmedovic] You stated yesterday that this document, this agreement, is an important step toward the global solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The next step [words indistinct] is an attempt to try and get the Serb side to join the agreement in some form. Are you an optimist in that respect? [Silajdzic] I must say that I am not. The statements issued by the representatives of the aggressor's side so far do not seem to indicate that they are willing to join this process. We of course wish they would, but if one is to base one's conclusion on the statements that we have heard, then (?that will not be the case). [Karamehmedovic] Finally, there was an announcement that perhaps next weekend the official signing of the documents could take place, with President Alija Izetbegovic of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. Do you think it could happen within this announced deadline? [Silajdzic] Yes, Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman would sign the documents concerning the intention to form a confederation, that is, on the international level, and the documents concerning the constitution of the federation. I think that could happen on the 18th [of March], that is, on the set date.
