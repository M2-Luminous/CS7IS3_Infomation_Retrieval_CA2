However, when the danger started to appear on the horizon of finding ourselves in a television, and at the same time also in a radio vacuum, society united with incredible enthusiasm in the struggle for this narcotic accessible to all. But in the meantime Premier Chernomyrdin and the cabinet headed by him did not especially want to give to television the budget funds earmarked for it. As a minimum, beginning in November they stopped the transfer to "Ostankino" and to the Russian Television and Radio Company the funds which they, in turn, must, without keeping them back in their account, transfer into the pocket of the Ministry of Communications. And the Ministry of Communications, as is well known, holds the monopoly in Russia over the distribution of the SIGNAL. . . . Let Us Turn the Film Back At the end of October, Yeltsin decorates the television workers who have distinguished themselves in the events, including those from CNN. He acknowledges in public that they have done more for the country than all the democrats taken together. However, money for domestic RTV (radio, television) was nevertheless not found in the treasury. Further--November. All of the electronic mass media are also waiting for money, but can by no means wait for it. Their debt is growing with every day. For the time being, the communications workers are forgiving [the debt], understanding that those who prevent the triumph of the new constitution were almost enemies in November. Of all the forces, radio and television twist the election campaign, unprecedented for Russia. Every day, the citizens hear that one or another figure who felt the urge for politics in his blood has rented COMMERCIAL hours and minutes on the screen and on the air. Only a little time will pass and it will turn out that those who had the urge have also not paid radio and television for the election campaign. And here it is December. The whole world, in anticipation of Christmas, dances around the Christmas tree. We are dancing to different music: The government has stormed the parliament. It will never understand its debt to society, it is always fixed on the future, it promises the television chiefs that as soon as December 12 is over, we will assume all power and settle accounts, and we will go on, and everything will become splendid, and we will begin to live, will flourish, and the gardens will break into blossom. Alas, we have not started to live, and things turned out to the contrary. Those who promised did not seize power. Totally other people seized power. And how do things stand with the money? Where is it? The money in the amount of 67 billion in the national Russian currency? It should already have been turned over to the communications workers without delay. . . . They are also people--those who sit in the Russian steppes and hills far away from the large cities and service the relay stations, which transmit the signal from one region to the other, from one antenna to the other. And there are many such people--alone the departmental settlements of the Ministry of Communications, which arose for the servicing of the relay stations, come to 16,000 for Russia. And all the people there are without wages, and sometimes since the summer.... Where Is the Money? The Money Is Where? I hope is in Gosbank, because it cannot but be there. But at the same time, I am afraid, it is not. And in the meantime January has passed. From the government, which was unable to see to it that budget money went where, in accordance with the law on the budget for 1993, it should go--from this government there remain only horns and legs. The guilty, as always, do not remain, since all the guilty turn into the aggrieved and, in accordance with Russian tradition, are not subject to further beating. Boris Fedorov--the former minister of finance, or, as it turned out, minister without finances and without rights to control these finances--it now appears had nothing to do with it. Sixteen thousand settlements continue to sit without money. Patience is being exhausted. The Ministry of Communications is trying to improve its situation at the expense of the weakest--for example, it is announcing price increases for its services for newspapers and journals, moreover such an increase that, if it takes place, the majority of them would die at once. The Ministry has calculated correctly and shrewdly: For newspapers the people today will already not go into the square, and it is not to be beaten to death, and even for a demonstration it cannot be assembled, these are no longer the times of Gorbachev. But the journalists were able all the same to consolidate corporatively at that moment and some of them saved for themselves the old prices for the communications services. Although, of course, not for long. Another week passed by after the "good" papa-Chernomyrdin met with the indignant editors-in-chief of the leading publications and promised them to moderate the ardor of the commmunications workers, and peace for the newspaper all the same capsized: Quietly, without noise and ardor, the Ministry of Communications all the same raised the prices, but in a differentiated manner--for some threefold, for others fivefold, and still others tenfold. Thus, a mere branch ministry, nothing more, through economic methods effected a (political?) selection in the state. And here February came flying. The debts for the signal as before were not paid. The communications workers are on the verge of a strike--they are not being paid their wages. Where are they to turn? They demand. They threaten, they remember that they have in their hands the very knife-switch which can extinguish both sound and light. They engage in blackmail, which, of course, is very shameful. But what is to be done? . . . A month earlier they were blackmailed. The Hour `X' Is Announced If you don't settle the accounts, the communications workers scream, you will read books in the evening--and nothing else: Including prime ministers and janitors. Immediately before the discontinuation of television and radio transmissions, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin urgently convenes a meeting. The architect of perestroyka, Aleksandr Yakovlev, recently appointed as chief of the Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting, comes, the Minister of Communications Vladimir Bulgak comes, for some reason pulled hastily out of a polyclinic from tests. We are on fire, they say. Although, it is clear, we have been on fire for several months running. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin speaks his weighty state word at the meeting and promises to settle the accounts. He sent for Minister of Finance Dubinin. Although he knows very well that there is nothing to pay with at the moment. Minister Dubinin declares that he will not pay--there is no money, even if your life depends on it. Would there not be a question to put to Minister Dubinin, for what, they say, do you divide the money? But the prime minister takes a different road. The prime minister hammers out a telegram to all the communications workers of Russia and in a fatherly manner asks them, for the umpteenth time, to put themselves into the position of the poverty-stricken state. He asks not to touch the knife-switch, to leave to the people simply Mary and all the inhabitants of Santa Barbara. The prime minister gets up on his knees, as if he is old. . . . This produces an impression: Some people feel sorry for him, here and there they do not touch the knife-switch, but here and there they nevertheless turn off the knife-switch, and there a panic begins. It seized even the northern capital--for a whole day St. Petersburg did not see and hear anything from Moscow, and many decided that again a social cataclysm had occurred. The prime minister enters into a strict agreement with the minister of finance that the debts will be paid gradually during the first quarter. But this, too, is some kind of improbable oddity--for the time being, they are talking only about settlement of the accounts for the last year. Up to now they are not talking about the debts for January and February, which it was time to clear off long ago. For What Are They Hoping THERE? This, perhaps, is the only question in this story which one does not even need to try to answer proceeding from the classic laws of logic. Finale. Realm of fantasy [zapredel]. Anarchy. There is no money to be had anywhere. However, they will nevertheless take it from somewhere. And in very large quantities. And not for the poverty-stricken service personnel of the relay stations, but for quite different purposes. In the evening of the same day when Chernomyrdin hammered out the telegram, First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets visited Oleg Poptsov, head of VGTRK [All-Russia State Television and Radio Company], at Yamskoye Pole (Russian Channel). Why? They talk about various things. We will refer only to an, in our view, very correct opinion, because it belongs to a very interested person from among Poptsov's deputies. That evening they brought Mr Soskovets to Shabolovka, where the old historical television center is located, which the Russian Channel acquired some time ago. They showed Soskovets the unfinished building, and an oral agreement was reached to the effect that VGTRK, Poptsov's fiefdom, above all, falls under the patronage, and this means, the financing of the Russian government. But, you see, they screamed that there is a financial abyss, and they shed tears. . . . However, it is necessary to understand that these will be enormous expenditures for the budget, comparable even with the dollars which they threatened to throw at the new palace for the new deputies. And in order for it to be built in accordance with the latest state of technology, as Soskovets and Poptsov agreed! And in order for the installations to be like those at CNN! We would very much like to know this. Again precisely budget matters. Up to now only one of the points of such financing is clear: The government apparently decided to stop fattening "Ostankino" and to finance only its information service, and to give all the remaining time to the [air] waves of private business--in the disposition of independent television studios and companies. Strictly speaking, this is not a bad thing and remarkable; what arouses attention is only the fact that the government for the umpteenth time has forgotten to consult with the taxpayers, who are directly involved in the formation of budget funds. Again About Totalitarianism It, the accursed demon, is directly related to this story, too. The point is that those very relay stations with which the communications workers are blackmailing in order to receive what is theirs are the most essential stronghold of totalitarianism. It turned out that the civilized world already for a long time watches television and listens to radio without any "fools," it has no need for settlements abandoned a little farther from human habitation. The world uses satellites. This has proved to be more ecological and incomparably cheaper than the daily servicing of relay stations. A satellite is only expensive to make and to launch, then everything is simpler. But in the USSR, as is well known, they did not think about cheapness, and even less about ecology, they talked about the fact that everything must be listened to that can be listened to, and that everything must be suppressed that should be suppressed out of ideological considerations. The archaic relay stations, which during the time of the Soviets went through more for the KGB agency than for any other and which now require such financial infusions as not a single modern television company would dream of, precisely corresponded to the system of total control of the conscience of people. In connection with what has been set forth above, the next question arises: Perhaps, all of us will have to pull ourselves together, Mr Chernomyrdin, one last time, and launch the necessary number of satellites, in order for us to have everything like people [elsewhere], in order for 16,000 settlements, like the repressed, not to complain in the windy steppes, and in order for the future to be without relay stations? I would very much like to hear an answer.
