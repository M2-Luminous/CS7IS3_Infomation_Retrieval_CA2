But because it was found during all-night inspection work that an airduct attached to the rocket had developed trouble, the launch was again postponed until 0700 tomorrow morning. The Tanegashima Space Center, from where the H-2 rocket is to be launched, had carried on all-night work since yesterday for the launch of the rocket at 0700 this morning. However, when the doors of the launch pad, where the rocket was installed, were opened a little after 2200 [1300 GMT] last night, it was found that the airduct attached on the top of the rocket was diconnected. Because it takes a long time to reattach the airduct to the rocket, the National Space Development Agency [NASDA] of Japan decided to postpone the launch until 0700 tomorrow morning. According to NASDA, the airduct became disconnected because of a gust of wind. Because it is expected that a soft wind will blow tomorrow, NASDA plans to resume preparation work this evening. The launch of the H-2 was initially scheduled for 1 February, but because of bad weather the launch had been postponed until today.
