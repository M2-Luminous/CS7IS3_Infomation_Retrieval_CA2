However, it is known to all that before the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] launched the counterattacks on Anlung Veng, An Seh, and Pailin, the Khmer Rouge [KR] had continued to harass and attack the KRAF positions everywhere, especially in Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Siem Reap, Kompong Thom, Kampot, Kompong Speu, and Kompong Chhnang Provinces. Not only have these arrogant activities of the Khmer Rouge [KR] caused losses to the KRAF, but they have also wreaked untold destruction on the lives, property, and food of our people in those areas. Thousands of families have become refugees. They have been compelled to leave their villages and homes to take refuge in a safe area. Moreover, not only has the Khmer Rouge used its bases at Anlung Veng, Pailin, and so forth (?for waging war), but it has destroyed national property by allowing the foreigners to carry out fishing and gem mining activities that have ruined the environment, thus seriously affecting the future of the entire Cambodian motherland. Concerning the stubborn Khmer Rouge continuing its illegal control of a small part of the territory and its military activities that affect the lives and property of the population, the KRAF and Royal Government have the task and duty to provide the people with security and ensure public order in the face of the Khmer Rouge's suppression, massacre, and looting. Moreover, in line with Article 3 in Chapter 1 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia, which states clearly that the Kingdom of Cambodia is an indivisible state, the Royal Government has been compelled to take measures to resist the Khmer Rouge's offensives and to eliminate their military and economic bases. Everyone still remembers well that before making this final decision, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, braving all obstacles, made one attempt after another to hold a discussion with Khieu Samphan to jointly seek ways to end the bloodshed. In addition, the Prince Krompreah's colleagues, such as His Excellency [H.E.] Tea Chamrat, H.E. Toan Chay, H.E. Veng Sereivut, and Eng Roland, also tried to hold secret meetings and negotiations with the Khmer Rouge, such as Ho Bunheng, Mak Ben, and [name indistinct], to find an appropriate formula for reducing tension and seek a way out. But all these efforts have produced nothing good at all. The Khmer Rouge still refuses to accept the cease-fire. It has continued to raise the same old issue of Vietnamese being the obstacle. During the recent new year's day, Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen proposed a cease-fire on several occasions, but the Khmer Rouge stubbornly rejected it as a trick of the Vietnamese and their allies. In the face of this situation, what kind of a position should the Royal Government take? Should it continue the defense of the security, public order, and the people's property, food, and land while the Pol Pot clique stubbornly refuses to cease fire, resulting in the government being accused by some senseless persons and some newspapers as being the warmonger? Or should the Royal Government stop its military activities, stop defending the territory, security, and the people, and just let the Khmer Rouge do anything at will, thus pleasing some persons and some newspepers? These are the difficult paths for the government to choose. However, the Royal Government, which was born from the people's will expressed through the election, can do nothing without the support of our people throughout the country. The Royal Government cannot do anything that is against the people's will. Concerning this matter, our people, who are the owners of the country, should make thorough considerations before making any decisions. You should not allow yourselves to be misled at the instigation of those persons who lack common sense to an extent that might cause grave danger to the survival of our motherland. As voters, we should be confident in the leadership of the Royal Government, headed by the Prince Krompreah and Samdech Hun Sen, which always unconditionally follows our adored king.
