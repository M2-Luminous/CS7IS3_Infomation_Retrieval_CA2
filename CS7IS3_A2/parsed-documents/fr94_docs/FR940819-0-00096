FR940819-0-00096 FR940819-0-00019 The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions included in its alternative the provision for a flight attendant to refuse a work assignment that does not meet the Coalition's proposed duty time limitations and rest requirements. In contrast, TWU Local 556, representing the flight attendants of Southwest Airlines, commented that the provision of flight attendant responsibility could place a flight attendant in the impossible position of risking either a fine from the FAA or discipline for insubordination from the airline if the carrier's scheduling department makes a mistake. FAA Response In light of comments received, the FAA has determined that only an operator, not a flight attendant, should be responsible for ensuring that duty limitations and rest requirements are met. The FAA bases its decision on the fact that a flight attendant could be called upon to decide between the violation of a regulation and possible disciplinary action from the company. That misunderstanding and conflict between company scheduling personnel and flight attendants could occur at a time when flight attendants should be giving their full attention to the passengers. In cases in which a flight attendant is aware that an assignment does not meet duty period and rest requirements, the FAA recommends that the flight attendant bring the situation to the air carrier's attention. If the situation is not corrected, the flight attendant should then inform the FAA. However, this recommendation does not preclude a flight attendant from informing the FAA before contacting the air carrier. In addition, flight attendant duty and rest time records are subject to FAA review. Air carriers found to be in noncompliance with the regulation are subject to enforcement action. Recordkeeping Sections 121.683(a)(1) and 135.63(a)(5) of the NPRM proposed requiring certificate holders to maintain current records on flight attendant duty and rest time requirements. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, Southwest Airlines, TWU Local 556, and TWU of America agree with the proposed recordkeeping requirements. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions does not anticipate that the recordkeeping requirements as proposed in the NPRM would be unduly burdensome. NAA stated that the cost of tracking crew time for duty and rest could be very expensive. NAA noted that many small carriers do not have expensive computer tracking systems and cannot afford to do manual tracking. Delta Airlines stated that the one-time cost for computer software changes would be $368,000. NACA noted that one of its members estimates that the proposed recordkeeping requirements would cost $50,000 annually. FAA Response The information and recordkeeping requirements of this final rule are currently under review by the Office of Management and Budget. Provided that they are approved by OMB, the FAA adopts the recordkeeping requirements as proposed in the NPRM. These requirements will become effective when they have been approved by OMB. The FAA anticipates that this approval will be given soon. The FAA recognizes that a concern of the aviation industry has been the potential cost involved in tracking crew time for duty and rest periods. The regulation provides that carriers maintain current records for each flight attendant to verify compliance with flight, duty, and rest time periods. The FAA intends to be as flexible as possible in interpreting this recordkeeping requirement. Records may be maintained by computer, by hand documentation, or by any other method that will permit a carrier to assure compliance with the regulatory requirements. Since many carriers already track flight attendant duty periods to ensure that union contract or company guidelines on duty and rest time are met, the FAA expects that recordkeeping systems already in place will be sufficient to meet the recordkeeping requirements of the final rule with minimal modification. Carriers that do not currently track flight attendant duty periods will incur costs in developing recordkeeping systems; however, the flexibility built into the final rule should help to minimize these costs. Further, the FAA intends to assist these carriers by providing information and guidance based on already-implemented recordkeeping systems maintained by other air carriers. Implementation Time of the Final Rule ATA and Delta Air Lines requested that the FAA not implement this final rule immediately. They noted that operators will need time to revise their computer programs. ATA requested a 12-month implementation period; Delta requested an 18-month implementation period. FAA Response The FAA has considered the implementation periods proposed by ATA and Delta. However, in the interest of public safety, the FAA has determined that the final compliance date of this rule should be no later than March 1, 1995. Because most operators are currently using scheduling guidelines and tracking systems for flight attendants, the FAA has determined that the March 1, 1995, date is reasonable. Additional Issues Fatigue Commenters who addressed flight attendant fatigue include ATA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, NACA, NTSB, RAA, SCA, and Southwest Airlines. ATA emphasized that flight attendant fatigue caused by abusive scheduling or duty periods is not a problem in the scheduled airline industry. NACA, RAA, SCA, and Southwest Airlines emphasized that studies have found no correlation between flight attendant fatigue and the ability of a flight attendant to perform safety-sensitive functions. SCA point out that accident data do not specify flight attendant fatigue as a factor in delay of evacuation or in injuries or fatalities that occurred.
