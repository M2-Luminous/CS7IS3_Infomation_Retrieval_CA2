G. Grigoryev, Moscow State University imeni M. V. Lomonosov; UDC 629.195.3] [Abstract] The most rapid maneuvers of a spacecraft with a jet engine having a great but limited thrust in a gravity field in a vacuum with control of the thrust vector are analyzed. Such maneuvers have been inadequately examined in the literature. In this study they are analyzed on the basis of the so-called maximum principle. The influence of the admissible expenditures of mass on the character of the optimum trajectory is examined. Maneuvers with both limited expenditures and those not limited in advance are discussed. It is shown that in each of the problems of most rapid maneuvers there are three levels of limited expenditures of mass, dependent on the parameters of the problem: lower, corresponding to small expenditures, for which the problem has no solution; upper, corresponding to large expenditures or those not limited in advance, in which thrust is operative on the entire optimum trajectory and is maximum, but the maneuver is controlled by the orientation vector; intermediate, in which there can be changes in thrust with time or there are repeated engine firings. A method is proposed for numerical solution of such problems using a compromise "time-expenditures of mass" functional. The dependence of the solution on the admissible expenditures is illustrated in the example of the problem of most rapid transfers of spacecraft between coplanar circular orbits in the Earth's central Newtonian gravitational field.
