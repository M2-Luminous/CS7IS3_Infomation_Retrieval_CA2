It seems, however, the meeting will not take place in Ocosingo or Las Margaritas, bastions of the Zapatist National Liberation Army, EZLN. On 6 February, well-informed sources mentioned two possible sites: Palenque, located approximately 200 km from San Cristobal de las Casas, which has good access roads, or Comitan, located approximately 80 km from San Cristobal de las Casas, an area with a great degree of EZLN influence. In the early hours of 6 February, EZLN communiques were received in San Cristobal de las Casas demanding the establishment of security cordons by nongovernmental human rights organizations to provide more guarantees. Here is the reply given by Gerardo Pacheco, representative of the nongovernmental human rights organizations. [Pacheco] We are now in the initial process of reviewing the possibilities of establishing security cordons. Right now we are trying to adequately interpret the letter addressed to us, after which we will decide how we will give the necessary support to the proposed security cordons. We are also waiting for reactions from nongovernmental human rights organizations in other parts of the country, as the letter is addressed to all Mexican nongovernmental human rights organizations. In that manner, we can organize and coordinate efforts to make possible the creation of security cordons providing specific guarantees proposed by the EZLN. [Prieto] International Red Cross representative Maria Lude explained the Red Cross' role in establishing buffer zones in areas where the communities are becoming desperate. The creation of the so-called buffer zones in the Chiapas highlands has created some confusion among the people regarding the International Red Cross' role. [Lude] I will take this opportunity to explain the International Red Cross Committee's role. As I said, our main concern -- and this is how we operate in all countries -- is finding out what the main needs are. Our representatives are now in the area, evaluating the people's needs, and if necessary they will propose ways to provide assistance. At the same time, there is a great solidarity movement in Mexico toward that zone. In no way will we prevent Mexicans from helping Mexicans. Our role will be limited, as I said, to reopening those areas, after which we will let national institutions do the work. I really do not think national institutions need our presence to carry out their work once the situation returns to normal. In the past, it was confirmed they are efficient institutions, and if they really have the necessary assistance, we are not the ones to decide if people should or should not receive assistance by the Mexican people. What we will do is to work based on the people's needs, which is our policy. Once the zone is reopened, organizations willing to help can take over. [Prieto] The entry of the International Red Cross Committee in the buffer zones does not mean all nutritional and medical problems will be resolved. [Rodriguez] Sunday, 6 February was a normal day in San Cristobal and nearby communities. Apparently, everything was calm in the Chiapas highlands.
