Sergio threatens to withdraw from the Front if, among other unlikely happenings, the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] announces at its next special congress "that it is going to take up arms to overthrow the government." I had always thought that I knew Sergio well and, in addition to having great affection for him, have always respected his ideas and proposals. Now I sincerely no longer know what is happening. I cannot understand him. I wish someone would convince me that I have misunderstood his proposals, that they are not as opportunistic or "vote-seeking" as they appear. Shortly after Sergio said in the aforementioned interview that he would withdraw from the Front if the congress should announce that we are going to take up arms to defeat Violeta Chamorro, Helena Ramos, who was conducting the interview, correctly reminded him that no one here is proposing a guerrilla war, that the issue is the struggle in the streets, the strikes, and so on. That reminder from the reporter to the statesman is what is tragic-comic for me. The journalist was very politely urging Sergio to come back to earth, to reality. Ramos asked Sergio to give his opinion about the civil struggle. I think that is the best part of the excellent interview and the six ensuing paragraphs deserve to be read very carefully so that we realize once and for all that the basic problem is ideological, even if Sergio continues to deny it. In addition to the ideological aspect, Sergio's comments also naturally contain a healthy dose of manipulation and demagogy. If they do not, let someone else give me a better label for Sergio's attempt to make people realize that there is a very real danger of a decision being made at the FSLN's special congress to take up arms to overthrow the government. It was served to him on a silver platter, as they say, but Sergio was unable to take advantage of the opportunity to express the Sandinist thought on the civil, trade union, nonviolent struggle that is possible today in Nicaragua for the precise reason that we had 10 years of revolution. This, among other things, enabled us to create a police force and army that are unquestionably the most respectful of citizens' rights of any on the American Continent. I do not deny that they have occasionally been guilty of excesses which we must not minimize or let pass without taking appropriate measures, but it is a fact that, with respect to repression, our people are in a position of clear privilege compared with other nations in Latin America and the United States itself. We cannot forget that Martin Luther King was assassinated and that J. Edgar Hoover's FBI acted in a criminal fashion to neutralize him, that history is repeated every day against Father Roy Burgois, Brian Wilson, and many other distinguished followers of Dr. King in the civil struggle for peace and justice. However, it is also true that here in Nicaragua, the revolution gave us areas in which we may resort to a civil, nonviolent struggle in order to achieve justice without having to face tanks. When a Sandinist leader is asked about this--and even if he is not asked--the most appropriate response is to explain how we must make use of such opportunities for the civil struggle. Sergio's responses are totally unsatisfactory because Sergio actually clearly opposes the people's struggle, any struggle of the people, not just the armed struggle. His recent statements on the subject lead one to conclude that Sergio believes that members of Parliament and high-ranking party leaders are the only persons qualified to fight for justice in Nicaragua. It therefore follows that if the people's organizations become involved in the fight, instead of making a contribution, they would only hinder the great achievements that the "elite" groups always say they are "on the verge of obtaining." Why such contempt for the rank and file? Why must we think that only those at the top may control the reins of our nation's fate instead of recognizing that the fight to improve and develop our country must be waged from all three trenches: the party, Legislature, and the people's organizations? Every one of these three trenches has its own methods, rhetoric, and way of articulating things. They are different but complementary and it is a serious error to try to exclude any one of them from the struggle. All three of these trenches are important, but the most important one of all--because it is the only one that is indispensable--is none of the ones at the top! The most important trench from which the war must be waged has to be the people's organizations, whose main actions of persuasion do not take place in air-conditioned halls, but in the streets, the sun, often causing disturbances and sometimes unfortunate and even condemnable incidents. And yet, this is no reason to abandon the civil struggle. We must perfect our methods to make them more effective. On 22 May 1991, when we in the Communal Movement summoned a demonstration in front of the National Assembly in order to put pressure on the government of President Violeta Chamorro to turn over titles to the beneficiaries of Laws 85 and 86, and when, instead of the 3,000 persons that we expected, nearly 40,000 thronged to the square, I recall Sergio's great concern when he learned that we were approaching the National Assembly building. It was then that I began to notice Sergio's great distrust of the people. I do not know whether he also distrusts Tono Lacayo and the Alfredo Cesars. Sergio admitted in the EL PAIS interview that in countries such as France, transportation strikes manage to close the highways and even isolate Paris. He does not oppose such strikes because, he says, they are trade union rather than political strikes. However, what distinguishes a strictly trade union strike from a political strike is the goal it pursues rather than those who support it. Transportation strikes in developed countries could bring down governments, which would not necessarily be antidemocratic. In the case of Nicaragua, I do not think that anyone doubts that the FSLN has done more than any other opposition force would have done to prevent the government from growing any weaker and falling. I believe this was the right thing to do. However, while it is true that we would not like to see the government fail, we should be even less happy to see a "renewed" Sandinist Front, a "Feeble Front" with more of an interest, at this point, in keeping the government from falling than in helping the people channel their civil struggle toward a positive path in order to achieve the fulfillment of their more than legitimate demands. Such a civil struggle would not be less democratic if, because of it, the government were to become unstable and even fall. In a real confrontation between official policy and the interests or rights of the people, we must decide whether we are on the side of the people or the government. The Sandinist Front is and will always be on the side of the people. Even if some would like to change that identity, the vast majority of the FSLN, now aware of the danger, would never permit it.
