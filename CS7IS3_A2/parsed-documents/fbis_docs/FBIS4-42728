After two days of intensive discussions, foreign and trade ministers from 25 of the world's richest nations released the communique which proposed reinforcing the OECD's links with nonmember countries, especially China and other Asian nations. The communique recommended four major issues be addressed under the next round of global trade talks sponsored by the World Trade Organization (WTO), successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The recommended topics are the linkage between trade and environment, relations between trade and labor standards, trade and investment, and competition policy under global trade. The communique's proposals will form a basis for an economic declaration to be issued at the Naples summit of the Group of Seven key industrial countries next month.
