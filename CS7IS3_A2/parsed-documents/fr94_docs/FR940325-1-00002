ACTION: Notice of referendum. SUMMARY: This notice announces that a referendum will be conducted by mail during the period of April 4 through April 8, 1994, for producers of flue-cured tobacco who sell their tobacco at auction in Windsor, Williamston, and Robersonville, North Carolina, to determine producer approval of the designation of the Windsor, Williamston, and Robersonville tobacco markets as one consolidated auction market. DATES: The referendum will be held April 4 through April 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Larry L. Crabtree, Deputy Director, Tobacco Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, United States Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone number (202) 205&hyph;0567. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice is hereby given of a mail referendum on the designation of a consolidated auction market at Windsor, Williamston, and Robersonville, North Carolina. Williamston and Robersonville, North Carolina, were separately designated on August 16, 1941, and Windsor on June 16, 1950, (7 CFR 29.8001) as flue-cured tobacco auction markets under the Tobacco Inspection Act (7 U.S.C. 511 et seq.). Under this Act the three markets have been receiving mandatory grading services from USDA. On October 14, 1993, an application was made to the Secretary of Agriculture to consolidate the designated markets of Windsor, Williamston, and Robersonville, North Carolina. The application, filed by warehouse operators in those markets, was made pursuant to the regulations promulgated under the Tobacco Inspection Act (7 CFR part 29.1&hyph;29.3). On November 9, 1993, a public hearing was held in Williamston, North Carolina, pursuant to the regulations. A Review Committee, established pursuant to ยง29.3(h) of the regulations (7 CFR 29.3(h)), has reviewed and considered the application, the testimony presented at the hearing, the exhibits received in evidence, and other available information. The Committee recommended to the Secretary that the application be granted and the Secretary approved the application on March 18, 1994. Before a new market can be officially designated, a referendum must be held to determine that a two-thirds majority of producers favor the designation. It is hereby determined that the referendum will be held by mail during the period of April 4 through April 8, 1994. The purpose of the referendum is to determine whether farmers who sold their tobacco on the designated markets at Windsor, Williamston, and Robersonville are in favor of, or opposed to, the designation of the consolidated market for the 1994 and succeeding crop years. Accordingly, if a two-thirds majority of those tobacco producers voting in the referendum favor this consolidation, a new market will be designated as and be called Windsor-Williamston-Robersonville. To be eligible to vote in the referendum a tobacco producer must have sold flue-cured tobacco on either the Windsor, Williamston, or Robersonville, North Carolina, auction markets during the 1993 marketing season. Any farmer who believes he or she is eligible to vote in the referendum but has not received a mail ballot by April 4, 1994, should immediately contact Larry L. Crabtree at (202) 205&hyph;0235. The referendum will be held in accordance with the provisions for referenda of the Tobacco Inspection Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 511d) and the regulations for such referendum set forth in 7 CFR 29.74. Dated: March 22, 1994. Lon Hatamiya, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7199 Filed 3&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P
