Inter-Korean dialogue on exchanging envoys will resume Saturday, and officials here said they still haven't given up hope on reaching an agreement, although perhaps not before March 21 as expected earlier. But the highlight of the package deal, the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue, will probably be suspended indefinitely since the Stalinist state failed to meet the two preconditions for the meeting with Washington. Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae, chief Southern representative at the meeting, said the delegates spent two-thirds of the gruelling two-hour meeting on the North's demand for a joint press statement expressing both sides' desire to realize the envoy exchange. Song had gone to the meeting, held at the truce village of Panmunjom, with a revised proposal on the envoys' agenda but barely had the chance to get into it, officials said. Seoul and Washington cancelled this year's joint military drill Team Spirit and promised the high-level dialogue in Geneva on March 21 as part of a small package deal. Pyongyang, in return, was to allow unrestricted nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and exchange envoys with Seoul. In a key setback, however, IAEA inspectors reported last week that their activities in North Korea had been hindered. Now that neither of the two preconditions has been fulfilled, the March 21 meeting is virtually dead in the water. One official admitted that North Korea's intentions are becoming even more unclear, "but it's too early to say that the small package deal is entirely off." Seoul officials believe the North is trying to break the close coordination between the South and the United States. Pyongyang had once threatened to refuse IAEA inspections if the United States kept insisting on an envoy exchange. The officials said Pyongyang apparently is counting on differences surfacing between Seoul, which demands improved inter- Korean relations, and Washington, whose main interest lies in maintaining nuclear safeguards and keeping the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) regime intact.
