We are monitoring the market closely because we want to avoid controlling foreign exchanges as much as possible, the BCV president said at the Miraflores Palace. Casas Gonzalez presided over a special BCV directorate meeting last night. He later went to the Miraflores Palace and met with President Rafael Caldera and Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez for almost two hours. We are following the same foreign exchange system we have used in the past. It is difficult to combat speculation in a situation of distrust such as the current situation. There are rumors about situations that do not exist and there is apprehension that the price of the dollar will rise. However, the mechanism has worked and we believe it will continue to work. We are constantly observing the market. You must have noticed that today, the bolivar to dollar exchange rate reached almost 200 bolivares to the dollar but it later dropped to 192 bolivares to the dollar. Thus, the mechanism is working, Casas Gonzalez stated. However, he warned that the situation could get difficult if the campaign of rumors to discredit the banks, the issues regarding Congress, the votes of censure, and things of this type continue. Such actions create distrust and the system cannot operate without trust, Casas Gonzalez added. [Reporter] Could an economic emergency be declared? [Casas] No, I don't think so. [Reporter] Do the BCV and the government agree on the monetary policy? The government stated that it is not responsible for those decisions. [Casas] It is our responsibility, but we have agreed up to now.
