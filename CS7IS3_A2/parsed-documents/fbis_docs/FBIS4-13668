Israeli and PLO leaders have said the talks may be completed next week, though this was not certain. If they are, the agreement could be signed in Cairo by Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat in the first week of May. Jack Katzenell reports: [Begin Katzenell recording] Taking part at this morning's meeting at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv were Prime Minister Rabin, Justice Minister David Liba'i, Environment Minister Yosi Sarid, and the Israeli negotiators at the Cairo talks, headed by Major General Amnon Shahaq. It emerged that the civilian issues being negotiated with the PLO were almost completely settled. These have to do with the transfer of power in Gaza and Jericho from the Israeli civilian administration to the Palestinian authority and many other matters. But certain issues have not yet been settled -- for example, the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released. The criteria for their release were discussed at this morning's meeting. They will not include those who have murdered Israelis, and Israel insists that they should not include people who committed terrorist acts after 13 September, when the Oslo agreement was signed. The most difficult issue not yet settled is that of jurisdiction. Minister Yosi Sarid said after this morning's meeting that no Israeli will be tried in a Palestinian court. If an Israeli is accused of committing an offense in Gaza or Jericho, he will be tried in Israel, Sarid said. If this or any other issue is not settled by next week, the Israeli and PLO liaison committee will meet in Cairo under the joint chairmanship of Foreign Minister Peres and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas].
