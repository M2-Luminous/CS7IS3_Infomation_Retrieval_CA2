FR940216-0-00150 FR940216-0-00010 g. Baseline adjustment for extraordinary circumstances. In the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA requested comments on allowing the baseline fuel parameters, volumes and emissions of a refinery to be adjusted due to the occurrence of specific extraordinary or extenuating circumstances which caused its 1990 gasoline production to be different than it would have been had the circumstance not occurred. Many commenters felt that baseline adjustments should be allowed for the proposed situations as well as for others. One commenter stated that every site is unique, thus baseline adjustments should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Still others suggested that EPA allow adjustments only for small refiners, or for several other specific circumstances. Several commenters, however, felt that no extenuating circumstance baseline adjustment should be allowed. Among the reasons cited for not allowing adjustments were: competitive inequities; Congressional intent to account for 1990 only; difficulty in defining extenuating circumstances; use of this provision as a method of voiding work-in-progress requirements. While EPA's policy objective is not to establish a broad adjustment program, EPA is allowing adjustments for specific extenuating circumstances. Allowable circumstances include unforeseen, unplanned downtime of at least 30 days of one or more gasoline blendstock producing units due to equipment failure or natural cause beyond the control of the refiner, or for nonannual maintenance (turnaround) downtime which occurred in 1990. These types of adjustments reflect instances where the 1990 baseline truly deviated from the otherwise expected baseline (historic and future), had the incident not occurred. EPA is also permitting baseline adjustments for certain refiners which produced JP&hyph;4 jet fuel in 1990. As discussed in the RIA, EPA believes that it has authority to allow such adjustments due to the discretion afforded EPA by Congress. Additionally, Alabama Power v. Costle 77 gives EPA ``case-by-case discretion'' to grant variances or even dispensation from a rule where imposition of the requirement would result in minimal environmental benefit but the would extremely burden a regulated party. While the anti-dumping requirements, in general, apply to all conventional gasoline whether or not reformulated gasoline is also produced, under the criteria mentioned above, no ``dumping'' will occur since no reformulated gasoline will be produced by such refiners. Congressional intent with regard to the anti-dumping program will be met while not unduly burdening those that meet the specified criteria. 77 Alabama Power Company v. Costle , 636 F.2d 323.357 (D.C. Cir 1979). JP&hyph;4 baseline adjustments are generally limited to single-refinery refiners because such refiners have no way to aggregate baselines 78 so as to reduce the combined burden of JP&hyph;4 phaseout and the anti-dumping requirements on their operations. In some cases, if no relief were granted in this area, the viability of a refinery could be at stake. EPA is also allowing baseline adjustments for multi-refinery refiners as long as each of the refineries meets all of the specified criteria. 78 As discussed in paragraph 6.d, a refiner with more than one refinery may determine an aggregate baseline, i.e., a conventional gasoline compliance baseline, which consists of the volume-weighted emissions or fuel parameters, as applicable, of two or more refineries.
