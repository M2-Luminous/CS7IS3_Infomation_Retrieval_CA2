The situation of coal industry workers is critical. The people have not been paid for January, February, and March, and the money for December has not been paid either to 15 percent of workers. There is nothing with which to buy foodstuffs or clothing, nothing with which to pay for housing and day care centers (in some day care centers they are already turning children away). According to Boris Lesovskiy, deputy general director of the Primorskugol Production Association, the debt to the association comes to 62.162 million rubles [R]. The government of the country is not keeping its end of the rate agreement. At present the cost of solid fuel in the Maritime area is the lowest in the country; its price has stayed at the level of the beginning of 1993. Moscow must cover the difference, but it is not doing this. Even now, the debt comes to R26 billion. Money is not being allocated for current expenditures. Arrears for the development of production and razing dilapidated housing already come to R20.5 billion (miners still live in huts, but funds to build new housing are simply not available). The list could be continued. It has been learned from unofficial sources that Moscow began to transfer money towards its arrears the day before yesterday. However, it was too late. Miners from Artem had stopped working. Yesterday they discussed the possibility of expressing their lack of confidence in the government and its prime minister.
