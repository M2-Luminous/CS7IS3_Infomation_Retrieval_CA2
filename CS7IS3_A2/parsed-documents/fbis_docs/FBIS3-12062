Garten, who will arrive in Brazil on 27 March, on 28 March will meet Strategic Affairs Secretary Mario Cesar Flores, who runs the Sivan project; President Franco; the ministers of industry, commerce, and tourism, and science and technology; and Jose Arthur Denot Medeiros, Itamaraty's official in charge of economic affairs. The objective of Garten's visit -- he also will visit Sao Paulo to meet entrepreneurs and then will leave for Argentina and Chile -- is to promote U.S. enterprises' interests within the framework of the large emerging markets, like those in the countries he will visit. Garten's visit will be made after that of U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who reiterated to Communications Minister Djalma Moraes his country's concern over the alleged difficulties that U.S. telecommunications and informatics enterprises face when trying to enter the Brazilian market. Garten's visit also will be made within the framework of a recent exchange of letters between Science and Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, who complained about alleged restrictions in the Brazilian telecommunications market. Garten recently provoked a diplomatic incident when he made negative references to Brazil. The Brazilian Embassy in the United States immediately sent a letter to Garten expressing "surprise" over his statements, because the next day the World Bank announced that "Brazil has made significant progress in his commercial reform." Garten recently announced that the United States is designing a new commercial strategy aimed at 10 specific developing countries: Brazil, China, Mexico, Indonesia, India, the Republic of Korea, Argentina, South Africa, Poland, and Turkey. According to Garten, the new commercial policy with those countries, which are grouped under the label of "big emerging markets," [preceding three words in English] was designed in proportion to their economies, to their capacity to expand over neighboring economies, and to their potential for U.S. exports. Garten recently said that within the next few years, most of the U.S. commercial expansion will come from the emerging economies, even if Europe and Japan remain the U.S.' main commercial partners. U.S. exports to those countries amounted to $102 billion in 1992, one-fourth of U.S. exports.
