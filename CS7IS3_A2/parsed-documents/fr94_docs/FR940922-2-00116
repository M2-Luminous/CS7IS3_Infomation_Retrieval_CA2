FR940922-2-00116 FR940922-2-00077 Federal Highway Administration Environmental Impact Statement: Mills County, IA/Cass and Sarpy Counties, NE AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed highway project in Mills County, Iowa, and Cass and Sarpy Counties, Nebraska. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Hubert A. Willard, FHWA Division Administrator, Federal Highway Administration, Ames, Iowa 50010. Telephone: (515) 233&hyph;1664. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Iowa Department of Transportation and the Nebraska Department of Roads, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to reconstruct U.S. Route 34 (U.S. 34) between Interstate 29 in Iowa and U.S. Route 75 (U.S. 75) in Nebraska. The length of the project is approximately 10 km (6 miles). Improvements to the corridor are considered necessary due to the narrow width and structural deficiency of the 65-year-old bridge over the Missouri River. Additionally, the existing route, west of the bridge, traverses through downtown and residential areas of Plattsmouth, Nebraska, on a low-speed alignment that restricts traffic flow, causes safety problems, limits economic growth of the region, and routes heavy vehicles through the center of the city. Alternatives under consideration include (1) taking no action; (2) using alternative travel modes; (3) reconstruction on or near the existing route; and (4) constructing a limited access highway on a new location. Incorporated into and studied with the various build alternatives will be design variations of alignment and grade. Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate federal, state and local agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest in this proposal. A series of public scoping meetings will be held at the Community Center, 625 Avenue ``A'' in Plattsmouth, Nebraska, on September 27, 1994, and the Glenwood State Bank, 32 North Walnut, in Glenwood, Iowa, on September 28, 1994. Both meetings will be held between 4 pm and 7 pm. In addition, a public hearing will be held. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the hearing. The draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.
