He told a press conference here that the "United States should not try to stifle and frighten the Korean people. The American side should not forget the historical experience of the 1950s Korean war." He was reacting to Washington's announcement that it was sending 200 Patriot anti-missile missiles to South Korea as a defensive measure and resuming its Team Spirit military exercises with South Korea. Those moves would "only accelerate the speed toward war. If they don't give up all these attempts, nothing can happen but war," said Chu. He said the United States was still carrying on a hostile policy towards the North. "We cannot expect beautiful songs from the mouth of U.S. Defence Secretary (William Perry)." Tension on the Korean peninsula rose dramatically last week after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) accused North Korea of refusing full cooperation with inspections of its nuclear programme, which has a suspected weapons element. The IAEA has now referred the issue to the United Nations for possible Security Council action to obtain full compliance. Chu said that if international sanctions were imposed on North Korea by the United Nations, Pyongyang would "make the necessary response." China, a permanent member of the security council and Pyongyang's main ally, is on record as being opposed to any form of pressure on North Korea. Prime Minister Li Peng said Beijing's UN ambassador would try to convince other council members not to vote for sanctions. But he did not say whether China would abstain or use its veto to prevent such a move. Chu expressed confidence about Pyongyang's relations with China, saying Beijing had "conducted an anti-Japanese and anti-U.S. struggle together with us" and quoted Chinese President Jiang Zemin as saying that "though there can be many changes in the universe, there can be no change in the friendly relations between China and Korea." Beijing is Pyongyang's main supplier of food and fuel and an international blockade would be ineffective without China's participation. During Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to Beijing at the weekend China made it clear it would not be a mediator in the dispute and said that pressure on Pyongyang would only complicate the issue. South Korean President Kim Yong-Sam, who arrives in China on Saturday, will also try to persuade the Chinese leaders to become more involved in the nuclear stand-off. A well-informed Asian source said that Kim would not hesitate to bargain economic aid to China in exchange for Beijing's playing the role of moderator in the dispute.
