Employment fell 8.8 percent, that is, by 40,512 jobs from the total recorded in December of last year, according to the latest survey of the industrial situation. In fact, the director of the Center for Information, Documentation, and Reference of Conindustria, Rogelio Carrillo Penso, explained that despite the slight uptick with respect to the fourth quarter of 1993 (the net balance jumped from 2.44 percent to 5.4 percent), industrial production has been sliding since March of last year, when a figure of 27.8 percent was recorded. He explained that the biggest impediment to an increase in production is the weakness of demand, which limits the possibility of passing on higher costs in the prices of goods, reduces the profit margin, weakens businesses, and shrinks employment. Carrillo stated that the industry's employment capacity is still declining. "Industrial employment has dropped by 109,964 since the first quarter, a decrease of 20.7 percent." He indicated that as of March of this year, 421,131 persons were employed, the second-lowest figure in the nine years that the industrial survey has been conducted. The lowest figure was 393,248, recorded in the first quarter of 1989. The survey also revealed that the sectors reporting the most employees were foods, beverages, and tobacco; textiles and clothing, chemicals, coal, rubber, and plastic. The regions where the most jobs are concentrated are the capital (191,511) and the central region (121,873). Another indication that this sector is in crisis is the weak backlog of orders, which fell 21.8 percent compared to the first quarter of 1993, and 5.9 percent with respect to December of last year. The document submitted by Corpoindustria states that both production and demand declined due to the effects of inflation. "This variable has increased this quarter with respect to 1993, since the bolivar depreciated. It is at 22.08 percent for this period, compared to 33.08 percent in 1993." Other Indicators The director of Conindustria explained that, as a result of the contraction of demand, businesses have had to implement measures to deal with their financial situation and cut costs. In this regard, expectations for the general situation and for investments declined by 19 and 17 points, respectively, compared to the same quarter of last year, and are now at 21.33 percent and 20.47 percent. "This decrease has been caused by the economic uncertainty that prevails in the country." The nation's utilized capacity has grown since the fourth quarter of 1993, from 57.36 percent to 58.34 percent in the initial months of 1994. Other important indicators are those related to stocks of raw materials (a slight increase, 0.9 percent over the first quarter of 1993), inventories of finished goods (a 6.8-percent jump during the same period), and prices of raw materials and imports (up 98.16 percent and 86.58 percent, respectively).
