This is due in large part to his proposal for a social coalition known as the Alliance for Colombia, which has made been well received by a variety of sectors. The candidate expects that his campaign will continue to proceed well, as his platform has more credibility than that of the conservative Andres Pastrana. [Murcia] How is the Alliance for Colombia doing? What support have you picked up from people who have joined the coalition, and what further support do you hope to get? [Samper] The response to that appeal has exceeded our expectations. All over the country there are large numbers of Colombians who want to join this Social Alliance for the people. We are appealing to all the people, without distinction of party, race, creed, or ethnic background, so that together we can bring about positive changes for the people of Colombia. The commitment I have made to those who have supported me and the people have made to Samper is to support the platform I presented to the Colombian people, which I ratified at the convention: to generate more or better jobs; to invest in social areas so that the benefits of economic liberalization will reach all Colombians; to increase decentralization; and a new peace policy that will enable us to achieve our dream of living together in harmony. This is a long-term proposal that arises from the liberal majorities, not a strategy to win the elections. [Murcia] Do you think you can renew liberalism so that it will once again represent broad sectors of society that today feel they have been abandoned? [Samper] Liberalism cannot simply sit back with its election majorities; it needs to reach out to the masses who have been isolated because they do not feel they are represented in the community. I have said that in Colombia there is much more liberalism than the Liberal Party, and with the task of modernization, institutionalization, improvement of ethical standards, modernization, and participation that the recently appointed commission will promote, which will be chaired by vice presidential candidate Humberto de la Calle, with the participation of young people and women, we will work so that this feeling will be converted into support for the party. [Murcia] Peace was a fundamental theme in your speech at the Liberal Convention. Will there be peace in your government? Do you not feel that the approval of Protocol II in Geneva, as proposed in your speech, means making concessions to the guerrillas? [Samper] At this time, there is no issue of more importance to the nation than achieving peace. If we take away from the nation the brake of violence, growth and opportunities for the Colombian people will take off. That is why I said that I will always listen to anyone in Colombia who wants to talk about reconciliation. We will bring about peace by returning to the state its legitimate monopoly over force, but also by increasing its social presence in areas in conflict with more and better health care, more and better education, more and better housing, and most of all, more and better jobs. Jobs are the new name of peace in Colombia. [Murcia] Pastrana says he receives support in public rallies and you in private meetings behind closed doors. What do you think of that statement? [Samper] That support which they scornfully say comes from "private meetings" is the same support that Andres Pastrana was seeking a few days ago. We cannot ignore the fact that politics is also conducted by presenting ideas to business groups, in forums, and in universities; these proposals are the very ones that have received majority support from major conservative, progressive, independent, and leftist sectors. [Murcia] Some critics oppose your ticket with De la Calle, saying that both of you have abandoned your principles in order to win votes.... [Samper] All the liberal candidates in the recent primary agreed on the need to promote the second phase of economic liberalization, the social phase, the phase of the people, based on this social capitalism program which rejects the option of savage capitalism. Those statements are made by people who are concerned because the Samper-De la Calle ticket has received impressive support not only from liberalism that is more enthusiastic and united than ever, but also from broad-based sectors of society. [Murcia] What will your relations be with the new secretary general of the OAS, and how will this position benefit Colombia? [Samper] President Gaviria's election is a recognition of his status as a continental leader and of the fight Colombia has waged against the drug traffic and narcoterrorism. I am sure that President Gaviria will provide extraordinary leadership for the OAS with his well-known ability and dynamism. Obviously, in the next government we will make use of his presence in this organization to promote issues of great importance to Colombia, like the creation of an Interamerican trade bloc. [Murcia] Will you alter your campaign strategy because of the change in the election date? Are you not afraid there may be more abstentions in the second round because of the soccer world championship? [Samper] We will continue the same campaign pace, presenting our ideas on creating jobs, paying the social debt to women in Colombia, and investing in people. For the second round, I have promised all the Colombian people to keep from spoiling the world championships. With their support, we will win the first round by a "knockout," so we will be able to enjoy the games without being concerned about the elections. I also have to keep the promise I made to accompany the team, as president-elect, to the United States. [Murcia] As president, what will your position be on economic groups? [Samper] The same that it was when I was minister of development: to establish strict controls to avoid monopolistic practices so that no company can abuse its dominant market position. Obviously, with economic liberalization and foreign competition the possibilities of monopolies will be limited, but we need to pass strict legislation to restrict practices which hurt the consumer. But we cannot forget that Colombia needs to strengthen businesses and groups that can compete in the world market. And finally, when public assets are privatized, that must help to democratize ownership of property, not concentrate it in a few hands. [Murcia] Do you think Luis Fernando Ramirez is ineligible to be a vice presidential candidate? [Samper] Humberto De la Calle Lombana has been studying the issue of ineligibility. I believe the Colombian people must have absolute legal certainty when they go to the ballot boxes to elect the next president and vice president. Still, the most important thing is for the Colombian people to meditate calmly and responsibly about whether they would feel more comfortable with De la Calle or with Ramirez if the president were no longer there. And what has been perceived so far in the polls is the confidence and support that Humberto De la Calle generates as a possible successor for the president. Today the candidate Samper is ending his "spiritual retreat" at a ranch near Bogota.
