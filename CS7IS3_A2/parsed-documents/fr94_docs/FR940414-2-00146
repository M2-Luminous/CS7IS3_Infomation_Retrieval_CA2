FR940414-2-00146 FR940414-2-00084 a. If estimated duties, taxes and charges are paid untimely, but payment is made before Customs is required to issue a Notice of Claim as described in Subparagraph B(1) above, the bond principal or surety shall be charged an administrative fee of $100 plus interest on the withheld duty at the rate of 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day that the withheld duty was late. The interest amount shall be rounded up to the next dollar. For purposes of this calculation, the withheld duty amount shall be rounded down to the next dollar. For purposes of these mitigation guidelines, the term ``withheld duty'' shall include unpaid duties, merchandise processing fees, harbor maintenance fees and any other taxes or charges due and owing at the time of filing of the entry summary. b. If estimated duties, taxes, fees and charges are paid untimely by the bond principal after Customs has issued a claim for liquidated damages for non-payment of estimated duties in accordance with Subparagraph B(1) above, the bond principal shall be charged an administrative fee of $200 plus interest on the withheld duty at the rate of 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day that the payment was late. The interest amount shall be rounded up to the next dollar. For purposes of this calculation, the duty amount shall be rounded down to the next dollar. c. When the surety deposits estimated duties, fees and taxes, in response to a demand made in accordance with Subparagraph B(1) above, the surety shall be charged an administrative fee of $200 plus 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day between issuance of the demand on surety and payment of the estimated duties, fees and taxes. C. Failure to remit collected passenger processing fees. Claims for liquidated damages for untimely payment to Customs of collected passenger processing fees shall be issued and mitigated as follows: 1. Notification of liquidated damages incurred; passenger processing fees not remitted. If at the time the demand for liquidated damages is issued the collected fees have not been remitted to Customs, the claim shall be issued on a CF&hyph;5955A citing 19 CFR 113.64(a) and 19 CFR 24.22(g) as the bond condition and regulations violated. No mitigated amount shall be offered under Option 1. As a prerequisite for mitigation, the principal must remit the collected fees or the surety must deposit an amount equal to those unremitted fees. 2. Notification of liquidated damages incurred; estimated duties paid late; modified CF 5955A. If at the time of issuance of the demand for liquidated damages, the collected fees have been remitted, the Notices of Claim for Liquidated Damages incurred shall be issued on a modified CF&hyph;5955A. The modified form shall specify two options from which the petitioner may choose to resolve the demand. a. Option 1. He may pay a specified sum within 60 days and the case will be closed. By electing this option in lieu of petitioning, he waives his right to file a petition. He may, however, file a supplemental petition, if he does so in accordance with the Customs Regulations and has some new fact or information which merits consideration in accordance with these guidelines. b. Option 2. Petition for relief. Pursuant to the provisions of 19 CFR 172.11, the bond principal or surety may file a petition for relief. By filing a petition for relief, the petitioner will no longer be afforded the Option 1 mitigation amount. The district director shall grant full relief when the petitioner demonstrates that the violation did not occur or that the violation occurred solely as a result of Customs error. If the petitioner fails to demonstrate that the violation did not occur or that the violation occurred solely as a result of Customs error, the district director may cancel the claim upon payment of an amount no less than $100 greater than the Option 1 amount. 3. Calculation of Option 1 amounts. a. If the collected passenger processing fees are remitted untimely, but are remitted so that Customs is not required to issue a Notice of Claim as described in Subparagraph C(1) above, the bond principal or surety shall be charged an administrative fee of $200 plus interest on the unremitted fees at the rate of 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day that the fees were late. The interest amount shall be rounded up to the next dollar. b. If the collected but unremitted fees are remitted untimely by the bond principal after Customs has issued a claim for liquidated damages for failure to remit those fees in accordance with Subparagraph C(1) above, the bond principal shall be charged an administrative fee of $1,000 plus interest on the unremitted fee at the rate of 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day that the payment was late. The interest amount shall be rounded up to the next dollar. c. When the surety deposits an amount equal to the collected but unremitted fees, in response to a demand made in accordance with Subparagraph C(1) above, the surety shall be charged an administrative fee of $1,000 plus 0.1 percent (.001) per calendar day between issuance of the demand on surety and payment of an amount equal to the collected but unremitted fees. D. Referral of petitions to Headquarters. The district director may always refer a petition for relief to Customs Headquarters, Penalties Branch, for advice or guidance. This referral is at the discretion of the district director and shall not be allowed to a petitioner as a matter of right.
