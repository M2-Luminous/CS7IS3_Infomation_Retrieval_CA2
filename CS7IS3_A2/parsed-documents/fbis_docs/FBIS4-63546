Our correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko reports: [Begin recording] [Naumenko] Given the heavy load of problems now facing the Ukrainian people which call for the soonest possible resolution, the Ukrainian president received quite a few questions. [Unidentified correspondent from Ukrayinske Radio] I would not like to talk about other issues on this festive day, but obviously, the Crimean issue is on everybody's mind today. How would you comment on the further course of developments? [Kravchuk] Once the Crimean Supreme Soviet rescinds the law that it passed, the Ukrainian Supreme Council's resolution will also be revoked. In other words, everything depends on the Crimean Supreme Soviet. If it suspends its law, the corresponding resolution by the Ukrainian Supreme Council will also be suspended. I hope that the delegation named by the Crimean Supreme Soviet will arrive in Kiev soon, and that we will find some solution to the issue. But this solution can only have one outcome: No changes as far as [Crimea's] status or Ukrainian territorial integrity are concerned -- and in the framework of this process, as they say, is the process of finding mutual understanding, without changing status or territorial integrity. If this is accepted as the basis, we will find solutions. However, integrity and statehood are the limit, beyond which there is no turning back. No one is allowed to cross it. Nor will the Crimea be allowed to cross it. [Unidentified correspondent] Do you not think that the Crimean parliament has gone too far in its claims regarding Ukraine's territorial integrity? [Kravchuk] I think they will end where they began. Because this will be a mandatory legal action by Ukraine -- and supported not only by Ukraine. I have information that an address by the Ukrainian foreign minister to world countries, providing an explanation of our position.... This position has met with comprehensive support for the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukrainian borders. The whole world recognized Ukraine, and it also recognizes our legal position. Incidentally, this was confirmed by Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev, who said that Russia cannot, and will not, bring up the issue of territorial integrity. It stands to reason that it cannot do so because this is recognized by the whole world. This was contained in the agreement between Russia and Ukraine in 1990 and in the trilateral agreement signed by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia in Moscow. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent, in Russian] What is your stance on the presidential elections? [Kravchuk, in Russian] It remains the same. While talking with the Mykolayiv Oblast leadership today, I convinced myself once again that one has to resolve today issues facing Ukraine and its people. Both the political and economic situation are complicated. Most important is that before holding elections, one needs to lay the legal groundwork for power, which should be constitutional, law-governed, and well grounded. And only then should elections be held -- so that there will be no situation of the legalities being established after the elections. By the way, the Crimea is a shining example proving this point. It was granted autonomy in 1990, and we adopted the power-sharing law two years later. As a result, the legal vacuum was being filled in the meantime, leading to the buildup of legal, political, and other problems. They can only be resolved when we move back to the starting point. We should seek to prevent a similar situation in this election, when you elect and then decide. It is always more difficult. This is why one needs to decide everything, dot all i's, and then conduct elections. [end recording]
