Inside the party the names mentioned as possible successors for Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta are Fernando Ortiz Arana, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, Fernando Gutierrez Barrios or "possibility another former governor." The same sources recognized that the two days of national mourning -- Thursday and Friday -- in memory of the former PRI presidential candidate "in addition to being justified, served the federal government by giving it time to maneuver in the face of a possible destabilization of the financial markets." The PRI has not decided yet how the new presidential candidate will be chosen, but "it is clear" that the decision will not be prolonged past this coming Sunday. The reason for this is that both the PRI and the government would be running a big risk if they do not contain as soon as possible the emotions unleashed by the assassination of Colosio Murrieta. The credibility of the PRI ranking leadership could be undermined, and there should be security in the economic sphere to avert a financial disaster. In the meantime, in the Chamber of Deputies a general comment heard among legislators and leaders was that following the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio serious tensions have arisen between the federal government and old PRI members, some of whom belong to the National Political Council. Several leaders said the reason is because in the PRI political ranks they are demanding that it not be the president, as the foremost PRI leader, who chooses the new candidate. They are demanding this to avoid "an erroneous decision," which might cause more friction and internal breaks. The stalwart PRI political class demands a part in the designation of the new candidate. Senator Humberto Lugo Gil spoke yesterday about the mechanisms that would have to be followed. He contends that the new election should be carried out in keeping with the statutes. It would require that the National Executive Committee convoke the Political Council in order to issue a call for the registration of candidates. The senator for Hidalgo denied that the announcement would be made in a surprise manner between Thursday and Friday night. He said that the period of national mourning should be observed first out of respect for the memory of Colosio. According to the sources of the Executive Committee, the PRI machinery will be in motion again tonight, once the leadership sectors have attended the funeral for Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta in his native hometown of Magdalena de Kino, Sonora. In other words, they will conduct a meeting of the Political Council, which would have to meet on Saturday to announce a call for the registration of presidential hopefuls, if the tradition is to be followed. Otherwise, according to its statutes, the council is empowered to designate a presidential candidate, At the same time, results were obtained of an assessment made among PRI deputies regarding the possibility of resorting to constitutional reforms to give the PRI a broader margin of maneuver in view of the situation surrounding the wake for Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. For the time being, the PRI has ruled out "forcing the Constitution" and promoting amendments to eliminate the requisite established in Article 82 of the Constitution that persons who aspire to being presidential candidates must resign six months before the elections. It was also considered unadvisable to change the date of the scheduled 21 August elections. In this respect, Maria de los Angeles Moreno, president of the Grand Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, said in an interview that the elections "should be held on the date established by law." The PRI legislator appealed "for calm, peace, prudence, and unity, because times of crisis and confusion are when we most need prudence and when we must rally around the president of the republic." Regarding the presidential hopefuls within the PRI, Fernando Ortiz Arana has a good chance, because he would represent a unifying force among those groups that voiced opposition to the presidential candidacy. He is considered to be one of the most politically experienced politicians, but he is also criticized for lacking experience as a businessman and because he has no connections to the financial and economic communities. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon is said to be the "natural replacement" for Colosio. In fact, as a coordinator of past PRI political campaigns, the party's unwritten rules would naturally tend to select him to replace Colosio. Important factions within the PRI, however, believe "he has not matured" and that his nomination "might signify maintaining the status quo of the political system." Regarding Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, former Veracruz governor and former government secretary, there are those who believe he could play a decisive role in enforcing internal party discipline and, above all else, in overcoming the nationwide unrest that is following in the wake the Indian armed uprising, the kidnapping of Alfredo Harp Helu, and the assassination of Colosio Murrieta.
