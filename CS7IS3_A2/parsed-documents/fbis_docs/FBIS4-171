The top two-thirds of the page contains a picture of a white hand sticking out of a trench and waving a white flag. The caption of the picture reads: "WHEN IT COMES TO EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION, THE NATS HAVE SHOWN THEIR TRUE COLOURS." Below the picture and caption is the following text: "We all know the ANC are going to win the election. If you're worried what they'll do when they get in, you'll be looking for an effective opposition party. And you really have only two choices -- the DP [Democratic Party] or the NP [National Party]. "As you know, the NP are real flag-waving South Africans. "Unfortunately, those flags are white ones. "They surrendered to the ANC on the issue of Federalism, so we're faced with an election boycott and possible civil war. They surrendered on the issue of the Constitutional Court, so the ANC nearly put their own judges into the highest courts (the DP only stopped this happening at the last minute). And when the Nats aren't giving in to the ANC, they're making deals with them: they've released over 10,000 convicted criminals onto the streets in secret amnesty deals, and they could release still more. "The implications for you are serious. "If you don't have an effective opposition in Parliament, you won't have anybody to protect you if the new government goes wrong. So vote for a party which won 5 times more issues at negotiations than the Nats. "Vote for the Democratic Party. "We might be smaller, but we'll never surrender. "DEMOCRATIC PARTY. PROTECTING YOU FROM THE ABUSE OF POWER. "JOIN THE GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE MOVING ACROSS TO THE DP, WRITE TO BOX 1475 CAPE TOWN 8000 FOR MORE INFORMATION."
