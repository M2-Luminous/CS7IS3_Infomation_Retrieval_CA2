Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Prime Minister Rabin emphasized to the ministers that in the talks which preceded the formulation of the Declaration of Principles he prevented the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] involvement because at that time political decisions were being made. Now, however, the military echelon is involved in the negotiations because military decisions are being made on issues such as external security, safeguarding the traffic axes, and securing the settlements. Mr. Rabin explained that he wants the 'Arafat-Peres meeting to proceed as planned in Cairo tomorrow. Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres will hold a private meeting this afternoon in order to decide on this issue.
