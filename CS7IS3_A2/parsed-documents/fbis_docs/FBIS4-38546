He told journalists how this document which was first elaborated by an initiating group of deputies, began to reflect -- after discussion and serious corrections in the committee -- the opinion of the majority of the parliamentarians, although it was a narrow majority. The journalists asked about various aspects of the work of the new Supreme Kenges, and about deputies' assessment of the specific measures of the government. Answering these questions, the deputy speaker said that the parliament is not going to demand the complete resignation of the government as there are quite a few lively and knowledgeable people. Nevertheless, in his opinion, the Cabinet of Ministers lacks accord and unanimity. People whose stance impedes the progress of economic reform and the implementation of practical and quite common-sense alternative proposals are also working in the government. Konstantin Kolpakov, personal representative of the president in the parliament, spoke at the news conference, stressing that there is no major discord between the Cabinet of Ministers and the parliament. The main thing is that they strive to achieve a dialogue in order to overcome the economic chaos. As far as the statement of the parliament is concerned, Kolpakov said, it is not quite correct and contains certain exagerrations, but we should hope that the statement will be able to promote the implementation of the market reform.
