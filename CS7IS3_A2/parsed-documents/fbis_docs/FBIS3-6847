The American approach calls into question United States commitment to multilateral trade negotiations and emphasises its reliance on bilateral approaches in which its own overwhelming power and influence can be exercised to the full. In part almost unnoticed, but in the first month after the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was signed, the US cut Australia's meat quotas into its domestic market and increased subsidies on exported grain in a manner damaging to Australia's export markets. There have been enormous claims made for the benefits to Australia and other countries as a result of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. I readily concede that the Australian Government's efforts were as good as they could have been and the initiative in establishing the Cairns Group was a worthy one. The claims, however, for Australia's future benefit are likely to be significantly overrated, for two reasons. First, nearly every country in Europe and the US and most of the successful Asian countries adopt aggressive industry policies designed to maximise the competitive strength of their own industries and to assist in the development of new industries. Asian countries use specific tax breaks, together with import protection and administrative devices to protect their industries. Such measures are not isolated. Throughout Asia, those countries with recently established car industries provide very significant protection, ranging up to 200 per cent. At the other end of the industrial scale, food processing industries are heavily protected so that they can develop free of threats from imports. The European and the American car markets are far more heavily protected than is the Australian. The US has voluntary export agreements with European and Japanese car manufacturers which limit market share of imported cars to around 15 per cent of the American market. In Europe, 8 per cent of the market can be filled by exports from other countries. In Australia, where governments have not worked to develop active industry policies, the import penetration of motor vehicles is about 40 per cent. Since 1988, the motor vehicle trade deficit has almost doubled from a little over $3 billion to well over $6 billion. There are widespread fears that Australia's current account deficit will blow out significantly as the recovery moves forward. The longer term trends are already ominous. A year ago the trend monthly current account deficit stood at S1.141 billion. Now, with the recovery only just gathering pace, it has already expanded to $1.422 billion. These factors provide substantial arguments in favour of an industry policy whose objective would be to strengthen Australia's industrial base and to expand Australian jobs, rather than foreign jobs. We should note in particular the specific methods and techniques the US is now threatening to use to force Japan to buy more products made in the US. In certain specific industry areas, the US wants Japan to specify quantitative targets for purchases of particular products from the US. Such a technique is of course, totally contrary to GATT. It is absolutely outlawed under any civilised code of international behaviour. It is sanctioned by America's own Omnibus Trade Legislation, which provides the American legislature and executive with every conceivable arbitrary and punitive power against other countries. If a country such as Australia passed equivalent legislation, it would be laughed at around the world. The US can pass such legislation and place the demands that it has recently placed upon Japan, simply because it is the most powerful country in the world. One should not be surprised, therefore, that the US is now getting very close to using its arbitrary powers against Japan. If it does, I suggest the entire benefit of the Uruguay Round will soon disintegrate. The European Union may be more subtle than America, but will not be far behind in using equivalent measures against Japan. The second reason is that both the US and Europe would then be likely to target other successful countries in Asia. All of Asia is watching the trade disputes between the US and Japan, fearful of the outcome. The American approach, if continued, will have disastrous consequences for relationships between nations. We often forget that the last World War in the Pacific was, in part at least, caused because Japan had been chucked out of market after market around the world. Japan's continuing trade surplus does create problems. Some part of that surplus is now currency driven because of the appreciation of the yen. My understanding is that a number of Japanese manufacturing companies are in fact under extreme pressure as a result of the present value of the yen and there is the possibility of a major collapse in some sections of Japanese manufacturing industry as a result of that currency appreciation. The US actions run the risk of aborting whatever results have flowed from the Uruguay Round and reversing those constructive elements. The US should take their case against Japan to GATT and argue it through in international forums. That might give a clearer understanding of the Japanese position than many people now have. It should not be forgotten that many companies, including many American companies, trade in Japan with a great deal of success. The GATT settlement procedure could lead to a result acceptable both to Japan and the US. GATT could have power to intervene in the dispute and to demand that it be settled within GATT procedures. That it, in effect, does not have such power demonstrates quite clearly that the great and powerful can ignore international institutions when they believe it suits their purpose.
