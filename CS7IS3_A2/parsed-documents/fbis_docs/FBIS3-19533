Here are some of the astonishing results, made public on Thursday 24 February, of the investigation conducted by the Center for the Study of Income and Costs (CERC)[.sup]1[/]. For instance, according to the study--which took as its starting point a 1986 INSEE [National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies] investigation of "disadvantaged conditions"--some 11.7 million people, or 46.9 percent of the 25 million people in the work force between the ages of 18 and 64 are currently, to one degree or another, in a situation of "economic and social fragility." Nearly 7 million of them have steady jobs, but as authors of the study point out, "they are vulnerable by reason of their income level or their tenuous integration into society." This marginal population, according to the researchers, is "above all unprepared to cope with job loss." Another 5 million people are already occupationally threatened--some finding it difficult to break into the job market, others simply unemployed. Within the latter category, 1.8 million people are gradually being pushed out of the job market, while 1.3 million others--people who have been out of work for more than 2 years--have dropped out altogether. Within that group is a yet more disadvantaged subset: 850,000 of the long-term unemployed are in danger of being cut off from their last links with society. Finally, according to authors of the report, "there are an estimated 250,000 persons classifiable as `desocialized'"--in other words, 1 percent of the work force, or 16-20 percent of those covered by minimum wage protection. The face of exclusion seems more heterogenous and inconstant than ever before. People are being dragged down into poverty in a web of circumstances which the researchers say "can push marginalized people step by step into the sphere of occupational inactivity and welfare." For persons coming from strata of society untouched by poverty, i.e. people who have regular incomes and a certain amount of social and cultural capital, the study shows that "problems begin either with difficulties getting or keeping a job, or with emotional and relationship problems." Investigators noted among other things that "the more degraded the individual's employment status, the more difficult it is, especially for men, to form couples." Indeed, couples with employment problems run a higher risk of ending up divorced or separated. Occupationally Threatened "The precariousness of their employment status and family disintegration have a strong effect on income and living conditions," the investigators say. Indeed, 40 percent of those who have been unemployed longer than 2 years live in households where income per person is less than F2,700 per month. "Finally, their precarious employment status is accompanied by a significant decline in sociability," especially among males and persons aged 35-50. In all, "32 percent of the work force can be considered socially vulnerable." The figure is only 25 percent for persons with steady employment but 50 percent for those already jobless for longer than 2 years. In that context, it can be observed in all the principal countries of western Europe that "the social welfare machinery, originally designed to help people cope with persistent problems, has proven poorly suited to arrest a gradual process of drift toward social disqualification," the authors say, even though some Fr180 billion is disbursed each year to 12-13 million people who otherwise would sink into poverty. For 7.5 million of them, income per household member is somewhere between the minimum wage for a single person (Fr2,300) and the minimum old age pension for a single person (Fr3,030). Incomes for the other 5 million range between 1 and 1.3 times the minimum old age pension. The future success of policies which were implemented over time in an effort to prevent exclusion--and which were intended, like the minimum wage, to bridge the gap between guaranteed minimum incomes and actual wages--threatens to become "increasingly uncertain." Indeed, according to authors of the CERC report, everything will hinge first of all on "the authorities' ability to articulate a genuine job policy in concertation with business, labor and management, and all the players involved in vocational training and occupational insertion." Prevention of exclusion also demands efforts to reduce academic failure, as well as "affirmation of fundamental rights" such as access to housing, medical care, a normal family life, and at least a minimum amount of personal possessions.
