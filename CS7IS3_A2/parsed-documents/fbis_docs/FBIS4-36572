This attack is still in progress. The Armed Forces of the DRY, which are absolutely and totally observing the cease-fire resolution in effect from 1800 this evening, so as to prevent the shedding of Yemeni blood in respect and appreciation for the good and sincere efforts of the UN envoy, affirm to the masses of our people in the DRY their complete ability to repel the cowardly aggressors, and to force them into respecting the international authority and its resolutions. The Defense Ministry wishes at the same time to praise the good efforts resulting from the high degree of responsibility on the part of the UN envoy, and to appeal to the UN Security Council to take stern measures against this raging aggressor, who not only sheds the blood of our Yemeni people, but defies the will of the whole international community.
