"After concluding a long process of deliberation and after all the results of the negotiations have been presented, the OeGB is convinced that Austria's accession to the EU is to be assessed positively after weighing all prospects and risks," a resolution entitled "Austria as a Business Location -- Europe as a Business Location," which was adopted by the Federal Executive committee, says. The OeGB sees "the participation in the referendum and the yes to the EU as a first step toward participating in the shaping of Europe's future and, at the same time, toward consolidating and expanding Austria as a business location. And it sees it as a chance for a peaceful, democratic, and social Europe, a Europe of the working people, which has the goal of work and prosperity for all." "Austria's trade unions are committed to a democratic, peaceful, and social Europe. Our goal is work for all, coexistence in peace and democratic freedom. This is the basic premise of the answer to the question whether the Austrian people are to decide for or against accession to the EU," the OeGB states in its resolution. The OeGB calls on the Austrian Government to play an active role in shaping the "social area of Europe." This involves jointly raising social standards, a common active employment policy, more intensive efforts in the field of basic and advanced training, and the active role of the EU in the fields of environmental and consumer policy, as well as solidarity with the weaker groups inside and outside the EU. In its resolution the OeGB points to the economic advantages of EU membership, but, at the same time, stresses that a purely economic point of view is not enough. "Our goal must also be the establishment of a social Europe. Only if the concerns of the working people are taken into account and social framework conditions are developed accordingly, can the single market have a beneficial effect for all strata of the population." Important concerns of the OeGB, such as safeguarding neutrality, preserving our social standards, or maintaining the ecological goals of the Transit Treaty, have been successfully pushed through in the membership negotiations. The government and the political parties now have the task of implementing accompanying measures so as to make sure that the problems arising from accession to the EU for the economic sectors and the regions as well as for the working people employed there can be overcome. The OeGB expects the Austrian Government to tackle labor's problems quickly and effectively. For this purpose labor foundations and other active employment measures are to be implemented as a priority measure. The financial means necessary for this purpose must also be ensureds. Furthermore, the OeGB expects that social standards will not be reduced with the justification of increasing competitiveness. In addition, the OeGB calls for a more effective struggle against illegal employment. OeGB President Fritz Verzetnitsch sees the recommendation to vote "yes" in the EU referendum not as patronizing but as an aid for orientation.
