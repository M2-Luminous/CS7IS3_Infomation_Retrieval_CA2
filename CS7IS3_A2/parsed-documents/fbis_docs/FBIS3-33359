It is absolutely untrue that there are differences between the government, "which maintains a tough stance," and the Prosecutor General's Office, "which is ready to give in to a substantial degree." There are no differences between the former and the latter. With respect to the Prosecutor General's Office, it is not a matter of giving in or not giving in. The Prosecutor General's office must follow a set of judicial procedures, in strict compliance with the law, and cannot be prejudicial So, this terseness has its origin in this circumstance and not in the differences invented in your "feverish" imagination 2. It is absolutely untrue that I told Mrs. Reno that "the situation with the Cali cartel could be resolved by pardoning its principle leaders." I cannot grant pardons. You, and the source who was the originator of this information, should know this. Allow me to recommend that you exercise caution with this source because this person either harbors bad intentions in giving you false information or is very poorly informed. Furthermore, the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] has officially told me that none of its agents said what you attribute to "authorized spokespersons" from that agency of the U.S. Department of Justice. Stop the irresponsible journalism!!! [Signed] Gustavo de Greiff R., Prosecutor General
