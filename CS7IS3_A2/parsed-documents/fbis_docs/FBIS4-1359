The first prime minister of the Fourth Republic, Kouadjovi Edem Kodjo, has taken over. The inauguration ceremony, held late yesterday afternoon at the Palais de l'Entente, did not have much pomp -- but it was a very important ceremony. Edem Kodjo received military honors and inspected the social and professional organizations. The two officials then held a brief, private meeting. They delivered speeches later. Most of the ideas which they talked about, such as reconciliation, dialogue, unity, peace, rule of law, and economic recovery, which were included in Mr. Koffigoh's speech, were also found in Mr. Edem Kodjo's speech. The only difference is that the new prime minister (?added) the issue of repatriating refugees. Listening to the outgoing prime minister's speech, one did not have the impression that he was someone who had been crushed by the transition, but was instead someone taking great satisfaction in having accomplished his mission, in spite of an uneasy climate. [Begin Koffigoh recording] Mr. Prime Minister, before extending my congratulations, I would like to express the happiness I felt at hearing your first statement when you were appointed prime minister by the head of state. You listed the priorities of your future policy, which included reconciliation, the consolidation of social peace, and economic recovery. These also formed the basis of my actions during the transitional period. I would now like to congratulate you on the confidence the head of state has placed in you by appointing you his first prime minister to the Fourth Republic. Your Excellency, Mr. Prime Minister, your appointment and the inauguration into your new duties mark the end of our long transition toward a new society. [passage omitted] [end recording] [Announcer] The new prime minister said he was filled with emotion in the face of the heavy task that lay ahead of him. Here is what he said: [Begin Kodjo recording] Your Excellency, Mr. Prime Minister, I would first like to thank you for the warm reception you have given me during this inauguration ceremony. I would also like to say that on this occasion my first thoughts go to all those in the country who lost their lives in order that we might obtain democracy. I would sincerely like to thank the Togolese people, who have suffered so much in order that the rule of law might prevail in our country and human rights might be respected. This ceremony is very moving, and I would like to express my emotion in the face of the heavy task which lies ahead of me. We will be able to accomplish this task only if we have a firm and legitimate footing within the parliamentary majority of which we are members, and only if we take the trouble to open up to the active forces of the nation. In this way we will be able to build our country together in harmony, understanding, and peace. This country needs to be turned into a place where rule of law prevails. We will work toward that, step by step. Democracy is not something one confers on oneself, one has to constantly worked at it. It involves constant effort, but I think the Togolese people are committed to making this effort. This effort must be continued so that, gradually, the establishment of the necessary mechanisms and institutions for a genuine state where the rule of law prevails will become reality. We have, in conjunction with our friends in the parliamentary majority, and with the same concern for openness which must be at the basis of all our actions in this delicate stage of the life our nation, emphasized a certain number of issues which are fundamental if we want our country to move once and for all out of the era of disturbances and into an era of stability. Of course, we should ensure that the Togolese get along with one another, that refugees are able to hope to return to their country some day. We should ensure that all those who are separated are reunited. This is a very important (?program). The security forces, the police, and our Army must feel constantly and totally integrated into this democratization process, which is intended for them as well. Our concern is to do everything possible so that our country is able recover its position within the international community as one of the leading African countries. In order to do that, we need to normalize our relations rapidly with the financial institutions and begin working rigorously toward reconstructing the economy. Social peace and security are also moral imperatives. In any case, they are essential aspects of a program that parliamentary majority parties have been formulating in order that, together, we might be able to bring this interesting task to a successful end. Our young people, our professionals, our women's associations, and the silent forces of farmers are our national assets. We must give new hope to all these people, and to all these national sectors, so that investors can find a stable and secure situation which enables them to move forward and contribute to building a solid national economy. I would like to add that we are determined to ensure that there is permanent dialogue among all the active forces of the nation, a daily dialogue between unions, workers, and representative associations. We need to find solutions through dialogue to the problem of employment, to the workers' salary problem, to the problems of our young people, to the problem of finding a public harmony -- which is necessary and unavoidable -- and to the problem of our (?uncertain) economy. Mr. Prime Minister, I said I would be brief and I will keep my word. I would like to end my speech by reiterating that all the Togolese people must assist us, so that if shadows exist the shadows are dispelled, and if there are clouds then they are dispelled, so that in this situation of strengthened unity, especially within our parliamentary majority, we can make of this country the modern state which it should be. Thank you very much for this ceremony. I will always remember this moving ceremony, since you said that you will always be at our disposal to give us any information we need -- be convinced that we have taken note of that. I would like to thank all your aides who are familiar to us, and all those who have attended this ceremony. Thank you. [applause] [end recording]
