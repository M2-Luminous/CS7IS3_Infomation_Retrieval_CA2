The SDPJ is the largest force in the seven-party coalition and Kubo is the party's secretary general. He did not directly refer to Takemura during an address at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan but it was clear he had Takemura in mind. Hosokawa and Takemura were once close political allies but their relationship has deteriorated to the point that they do not speak to each other unless they have to. Hosokawa told a cabinet meeting Tuesday that he intends to reshuffle the cabinet that has been in place since he took power in August. He said he would discuss the matter with other leaders in his coalition administration. Takemura heads Sakigake (Harbinger), one of the partners in the coalition. Well-placed sources said it was possible that Takemura could be offered another cabinet position. Kubo, one of the coalition's chief policymakers, told reporters that Takemura's removal would weaken the makeup of the cabinet. He urged Hosokawa to be "very persuasive" in demonstrating the need for a reshuffle of the 21-member cabinet during the current Diet session. Kubo, who became SDPJ secretary general last September, cited deliberations for the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 ending in March and the national budget for fiscal 1994 starting April 1994 as examples of the busy Diet schedule. Kubo said he could not understand why Hosokawa intends to reshuffle the cabinet and he urged the coalition parties to unite in tackling tricky issues facing the government. Takemura is known to be at odds with Hosokawa over the prime minister's proposal for a new national welfare tax. Takemura also clashed late last year with Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, over the handling of political reform bills. Ozawa reportedly asked Hosokawa to dismiss Takemura. Hosokawa rejected Ozawa's advice at the time, political sources said. Ozawa and Ichikawa are the chief strategists in the coalition.
