FR940504-2-00010 FR940504-2-00008 [A&hyph;588&hyph;834] Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Stainless Steel Angle From Japan AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Jenkins or Kate Johnson, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;1756, or (202) 482&hyph;4929. INITIATION OF INVESTIGATION: The Petition On April 8, 1994, we received a petition filed in proper form by Slater Steels Corporation, Specialty Alloys Division (petitioner), a U.S. producer of stainless steel angle. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, the petitioner alleges that imports of stainless steel angle from Japan are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. The petitioner has stated that it has standing to file the petition because it is an interested party, as defined under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petition is filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. Under the Department's regulations, any producer or reseller seeking exclusion from a potential antidumping duty order must submit its request for exclusion within 30 days of the date of the publication of this notice. The procedures and requirements are contained in 19 CFR 353.14. Scope of Investigation For purposes of this investigation, the term ``stainless steel angle'' includes hot-rolled, whether or not annealed or descaled, stainless steel products angled at 90 degrees, that are not otherwise advanced. The stainless steel angle subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheadings 7222.40.30.20, and 7222.40.30.60 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. United States Price and Foreign Market Value Petitioner based U.S. price (USP) on prices contained in a November 1993 price list for subject merchandise sold by an unrelated U.S. importer and reseller of Japanese stainless steel angle to its U.S. customer. Since these prices were quoted ex-dock, duty paid, petitioner deducted from USP amounts for U.S. duty, ocean freight, marine insurance, harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing fees. Petitioner used tax-exclusive, delivered prices of subject merchandise sold in Japan by three Japanese producers during the month of September 1993, as the basis for foreign market value (FMV). These prices were obtained from a market research report and pertained to the following three Japanese producers: Aichi Steel Works, Daido Steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries. To calculate an ex-factory price, petitioner used expense information from the market research report. Petitioner converted the home market prices to U.S. dollars based on the monthly average yen/dollar exchange rate effective during the month of the U.S. sale, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Petitioner deducted from FMV an amount for inland freight. Petitioner made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for differences in imputed credit costs between Japanese and U.S. sales based on the average payment period identified in the foreign market research report. Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the dumping margins alleged by petitioner for stainless steel angle from Japan range from 40.82 percent to 58.81 percent. Preliminary Determination by the International Trade Commission The International Trade Commission (ITC) will determine by May 23, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of stainless steel angle from Japan are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. A negative ITC determination will result in this investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigation will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b). Dated: April 20, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
