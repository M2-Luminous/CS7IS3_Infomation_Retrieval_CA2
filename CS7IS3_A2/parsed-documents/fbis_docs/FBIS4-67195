Information provided by US authorities linking Thanong to a conspiracy to smuggle 45 tones of marijuana into the United States from 1973-87 constituted grounds for an investigation, he said. "With or without US urging, it is the duty of Thai law eforcement officials to take action. Police have a duty to investigate alleged wrongdoers--no matter who they are," the prime minister said. "In the case in question, there are adequate grounds for investigation." House Speaker Marut Bunnak yesterday said a Chat Thai urgency motion asking the House of Representatives to consider taking action against Thanong had been put on the agenda. The motion was item 14 on the agenda, but could be brought forward if MPs wished. Submitted by Chamnong Phothisaro (Chat Thai-Sisaket), it asks the House of Representatives to decide what to do about the Nakhon Phanom MP, charging that the allegations against him have affected the credibility of the House.
