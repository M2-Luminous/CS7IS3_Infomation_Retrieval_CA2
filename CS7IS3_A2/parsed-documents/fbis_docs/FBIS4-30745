This was said by the MSZP chairman in Hungarian TV's "Napkelte" [Sunrise] program. Speaking about relations with the unions, Horn said that if the new government fails to reach an agreement with the organizations representing the interests of those living on wages and salaries, there will be no social peace, and in that case no self-moderation by the principal protagonists in political and social life could be expected, despite the fact that this is overwhelmingly necessary. If trade unions experience, as they have in the past four years, that agreements which they sign are subsequently kicked aside by the government, then whatever the composition of the new government, confrontation will inevitably arise between the unions and the government, Gyula Horn warned. He added that Sandor Nagy [chairman of the National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions] also believes that an economic and social agreement should be reached as soon as possible. In the framework of the agreement they would handle the crisis in a way contrary to the method used by the previous government, which would permit an improvement for those living on wages and salaries.
