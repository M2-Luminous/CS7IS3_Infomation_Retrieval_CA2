When the statue, tentatively called "China Colossus", is finished around the year 2000, it will be 118 metres high, twice the size of its New York counterpart, according to Xie Lin, of the city's statues commission. But comparisons with the Liberty Island lady, which ran rampant in the Shanghai press after the decision was made this week, were not being encouraged. "In terms of meaning, ours will be completely different from the Statue of Liberty," Xie said. "The China Colossus will be a profound symbol of the Chinese nation, symbolising the reform and opening policies of our powerful country at the onset of a new century." Like its New York counterpart, it would be likely to be a woman, but other human representations could also be considered, Xie said. An exact replica, as was erected by students in Tiananmen Square five years ago, was "impossible", Xie said. Xie said arguments were still raging about cost-sharing between the central and local governments and some political questions concerning the design. "Experts from the central government have many ideas. This is not something we can decide in a flash," he said. Xie said it might be premature for him to even talk about the choice of Shanghai, a decision made while Beijing's statues group was in the city this week. "I can't disclose which departments in the central government are in charge. But they feel this matter is not ready for public announcement," he said. But he could not restrain his enthusiasm over the city's success in winning the statue. Guangdong province had been the front runner when the central government first began secret discussions about erecting a "symbol of rising China" last November. "We will have to draw on all the experience of thousands of Chinese sculptors around the world for this solemn task," he said. Nor could the city's press refrain from a little chest thumping after the supposedly secret conclave on the statue left town this week. "Standing aloft in Shanghai will soon be a statue of 118 metres, twice as high as America's Statue of Liberty," the Shanghai Labour Daily said. Beijing leaders are understood to be angry at the reporting of the statue in Shanghai before the official New China News Agency (Xinhua) was informed. "Beijing will have the final say on what the statue looks like and where it stands, not Shanghai," one Shanghai official said. Present plans call for the statue to be built up-river of Shanghai proper along the Huangpu River, the official said. This would avoid any charge that the statue was incompatible with the traditional architecture of the Bund. It would also ensure that China's newest symbol is not diminished by the 450-metre Oriental Pearl television tower, which is already halfway to the skies across the river in the Pudong new area.
