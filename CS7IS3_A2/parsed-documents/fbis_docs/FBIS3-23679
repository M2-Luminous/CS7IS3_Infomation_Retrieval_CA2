What our cosmonauts in orbit felt at this moment only they know. The Soyuz TM-17 spaceship at an altitude 300 km had collided with the Mir orbital complex. Such accidents, before this described only in science fiction and not happening except in one's dreams, are extremely dangerous because a ship, experiencing rupture, very rapidly loses its air, which results in the inevitable death of the crew. It goes without saying that the air does not instantaneously escape into space and the crew for their salvation is left a safety window from 1-2 seconds to several minutes, depending on the size of the rupture and the air volume in the cabin. The cosmonauts, who, as is well known, are characterized by excellent reflexes, at the time of the collision already were in spacesuits and so it was that they only had to lift up an arm, make the helmet tight and make their airtight gloves secure. The variant of a landing in a depressurized ship had already been repeatedly practiced (the death of a crew of three men in 1971 due to the depressurization of the Soyuz 11 descent module had been able to teach us something), but no one could guarantee that the descent module would not itself be damaged during a collision. Incidentally, the principal impact on the Soyuz occurred precisely on the thick heat insulation of the skin of this compartment. And, happily, after this no one heard the ominous whistling of air. The walls of both vehicles withstood the impact... As the specialists at the Flight Control Center informed us, for several minutes the Soyuz landing was in question. Then when it became clear that the heat insulation had not been damaged (which would have threatened ship burnup during descent) and that the impact did not extend through to the cover of the parachute compartment (otherwise it could have jammed) it was decided to land the Soyuz TM-17. This also was done beautifully. "Information on what occurred will be analyzed by a special technical commission, which also will draw the necessary conclusions concerning the possible consequences of a collision," declared Aleksandr Serebrov, the expedition's engineer, immediately upon return. In the opinion of the cosmonauts who had been in orbit, the station, leaving aside a brief shutdown of the gyrodynes, also did not suffer, and as was planned, will be able to exist right up to the putting of the first functional units of the Alpha station into orbit. According to preliminary information, the reason for the collision was the untimely switching from automatic to manual control at a time when the Soyuz began to rotate slowly near the Kristall module. The crew intended to fly around the station for an inspection, but feeling the jolt fired the orientation engines and moved away.
