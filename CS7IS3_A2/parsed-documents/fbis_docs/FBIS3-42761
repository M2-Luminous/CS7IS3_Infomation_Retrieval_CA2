Having proclaimed their sovereignty, they among other things assumed a heavy burden of responsibility: New independent states encountered the need to deal with the difficult task of building their statehood in keeping with the principles of democracy. The institution of citizenship as one of inalienable attributes of a state represents a stable legal connection between the individual and the state, which is expressed in the totality of their mutual rights and responsibilities and is used for determining the relationship between a citizen and "his state," between a citizen and a foreign state, and between a foreign state and this particular citizen's state. In essence the institution of citizenship is closely tied to human rights, and refusing to grant citizenship leads to negative consequences both in this area and in other, no less important, ones. First of all, this infringes on such inalienable rights as the right to vote, the right of free movement (traveling abroad is impossible without properly formalized documents, in order to receive which, in turn, it is necessary to establish that one belongs to a certain state), and some social rights and freedoms. In addition, a state cannot extend diplomatic protection to persons who are not its citizens. Persons without citizenship residing in a state create an extremely undesirable situation when the question arises as to which state bears responsibility for such a person traveling abroad, or to the territory of which state he may return when necessary. It may also be a potential source of an international conflict. Forty years ago such arguments brought into existence the 1954 International Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons, which defines the basic rights and responsibilities of persons not considered by a state within its legal framework as citizens. International law traditionally applies a norm that envisages that every state has the right to decide which persons are and are not citizens. This norm is codified in a convention produced as long ago as 1930 in the Hague. According to Article 1 of this convention, each state, in accordance with its laws, has the right to determine who may be a citizen. Regardless of this, however, it should be noted that the state bears responsibility for not increasing the number of stateless persons living on its territory. This is confirmed by Article 4 of the same convention, in which another principle of international law is enunciated, which limits the sovereignty of states with respect to the issue of citizenship: "Citizenship laws are recognized by other states to the extent that they correspond to international conventions, international customs, and the commonly accepted principles of law with respect to citizenship." Finally, Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 sets forth: "Each person has a right to citizenship. No one may be arbitrarily deprived of citizenship or the right to change his citizenship." In the opinion of some scholars and specialists in the area of citizenship, the provisions of this article may not serve as a decisive argument in favor of limiting the sovereignty of states with respect to issues of citizenship, since they do not mention which state precisely must grant citizenship. Nevertheless, in most instances it is possible to identify such states by taking into account the principle of a stable association between the person and one or another state. This argument is particularly topical in the case of disintegration of the USSR and, in particular, as applied to the policy conducted by Estonia and Latvia with respect to ethnic Russians living on their territory. A change in sovereignty of one or another territory as a rule affects the citizenship of persons living within its boundaries--in other words, results in loss of such. This immediately brings up the issue of acquiring the citizenship of a state that has been formed in place of the "old one" by the persons who live in it. The principle of stable association in this case assumes that the state formed on this territory has an obligation, in accordance with customary international law, to grant citizenship to all permanent residents of this territory, with the exception of citizens of third countries. Nevertheless, the Russian-speaking population living in Estonia and Latvia has fallen into the category of foreigners who are de facto persons without citizenship. Part 3 of Article 20 of the Estonian Republic law on foreigners (1993) says directly: "A foreigner who has resided in Estonia since before 1 July 1990 and continues to live in Estonia, resides in Estonia on the basis of a permanent residence permit of the former Estonian SSR until he receives permanent resident status, but for not more than two years from the moment this law goes into effect." Moreover, in 1991 Russia signed agreements "On the Foundations of Interstate Relations" with Latvia and Estonia, in which the states take upon themselves the obligation to guarantee those living on their territory the right to preserve or obtain citizenship of one of the parties to the agreement in accordance with the freely expressed will of these persons. By conducting a policy of discrimination against ethnic Russians, Estonia and Latvia are thereby grossly violating not only generally accepted principles of international law and international agreements, but also the principles codified in their own constitutions, namely, the primacy of international law over domestic legislation. One of the positive examples of a solution to this problem was the signing on 23 December 1993 of an agreement between Russia and Turkmenistan, which represents an important step forward on the road of the development of the institutions of citizenship in the newly independent states.
