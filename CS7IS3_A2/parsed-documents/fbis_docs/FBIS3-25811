The two banks will be the Agricultural Development Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China, said Ma Yongwei, president of the Agricultural Bank of China. Ma said the move is in line with the government's decision to forbid State policy banks from providing commercial loans. The Agricultural Development Bank will implement the government's policy of supplying subsidized loans to farmers, starting this summer. Although the 15 years of economic reform have raised farmers' living standard impressively, granting them long-term, low-interest loans will continue to be a fundamental function of the government bank officials said. Many agricultural projects involving crop production irrigation and technological development will continue to receive government- subsidized soft loans. These kinds of projects usually need huge outlays but have slow returns and such loans are often considered highly risky by commercial banks. Bank analysts say the creation of the Agricultural Development Bank is part of the government's efforts to maintain its strong backing of agriculture while encouraging banks to do their business according to more commercial practices. They add that many villages remain undeveloped, even aside from problems such as slow growth of farmers' income, high inflation in general and skyrocketing prices of farming materials in particular, and the huge number of surplus rural labourers. But officials with the Ministry of Agriculture note that agriculture in China has its own character and in many ways is unlike agriculture in other countries. After the summer harvest this year, the Agricultural Bank of China can still find its clients in the countryside for its commercial loans, they added. The burgeoning rural industries, which grew by about 40 percent last year, have already become the backbone of the rural economy. Meanwhile, rural households' limited access to the markets requires the government to extend huge loans to its grass-roots commercial units each year to buy farmers' products. Since rural industries and grassroots commercial units can soon see profits from their investment, they should no longer receive government-subsidized soft loans. Starting this year, the Agricultural Bank of China will have to balance assets and liabilities and manage business risks. Both the Agricultural Development Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China will be under the leadership of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank. Both will have to be guided by the Central Bank's credit quotas to help the government ensure its control over total bank lending, according to bank officials. In response to the government's call for strong backing of agriculture, the Agricultural Bank of China raised its outstanding loans to 968 billion yuan ($111.26 billion) by the end of last year, up 176 billion yuan ($20.5 billion) from the previous year.
