ACTION: Proposed rule; reopening of public comment period. SUMMARY: The EPA is extending the public comment period for the proposed standards of performance for wastewater sources in the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry (SOCMI). As initially published in the Federal Register of September 12, 1994 (59 FR 46780), written comments on the proposed rule were to be submitted to the EPA on or before November 14, 1994 (a 60-day comment period). The public comment period is being extended and will end on January 13, 1995. DATES: Comments. Comments must be received on or before January 13, 1995. ADDRESSES: Docket. Docket No. A&hyph;94&hyph;32, containing supporting information used in developing the proposed rule is available for public inspection and copying between 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, at the EPA's Air Docket, room M1500, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC. A reasonable fee may be charged for copying. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Robert Lucas, Emission Standards Division (MD&hyph;13), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone (919) 541&hyph;0884. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Several persons who intend to submit comments concerning the proposed standards of performance for wastewater sources at SOCMI facilities have requested additional time to prepare their comments, beyond the 60 days originally provided. In consideration of these requests, the EPA is extending the comment period to give all interested persons the opportunity to comment fully. This extension of the public comment period is necessary to ensure that interested parties have adequate time to provide the EPA with written comments on the proposed rule. Dated: November 21, 1994.
