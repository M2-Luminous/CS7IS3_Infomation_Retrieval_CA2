The police in Arhus have asked Interpol for help in identifying three Egyptians that might be connected to terrorism. The three Egyptians, two of whom have applied for asylum, are in custody in Arhus, charged with arson of a Jordanian's home in Tranbjerg. However, during the investigation police found items that connect them to terrorism, according to ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE. While searching the home of one of the suspects the police found among other things, a "bomb cookbook" with recipes for making explosives. Two of the prisoners have also tried to buy chemicals for this purpose from a business in Arhus. They were refused because a special permit is required to buy some of the items. The search also revealed a leaflet urging all Muslims to kill infidels, a register of names and addresses of foreigners living in Denmark, and papers in Arabic urging anybody participating in subversive work to use false names. According to ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE, the potential political elements in the case caused an Arabic-speaking interpreter to become so nervous that he immediately asked to be excused from the job of interpreting. One of the Egyptians has lived in Brabrand for many years. The other two, after a stay at the Sandholm camp, have had as their address the Red Cross's asylum center in Odder for the last two to three months. However, they have been at the asylum center, where no other Egyptians live, only a few times, and the rest of the time they have been at Brabrand. The three men, who are 28, 35, and 42 years old respectively, were arrested on 18 November and so far are only charged with arson. But in court on Friday [3 December] the prosecutor reserved the right to expand the charges. According to ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE, one of the suspects informed them during a previous hearing that he is an Egyptian colonel who fled to Denmark because of having participated in a political attack earlier this year. He alleges that he has been sentenced to death in absentia.
