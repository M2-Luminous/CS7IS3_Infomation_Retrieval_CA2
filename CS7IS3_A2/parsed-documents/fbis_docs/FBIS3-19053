The program also includes a five-minute talk by pundit Giovanni Sartori about the meaning of the term "liberal-democracy." Mario Segni starts by saying that Vespa and the media as a whole does not seem to realize that as far as the first-past-the-post part of the general elections are concerned, the Pact for Italy is a unified alliance of which the Italian Popular Party [PPI], and the Italian Republican Party [PRI], are members. He explaines that for the purposes of the proportional representation part of the election, the alliance will split in two: the PPI and the Segni Pact, which includes the PRI among its members. Quoting the Pact for Italy manifesto, Vespa asks Segni how he intends to create a million new jobs over three years. Segni answers that unemployment is largely linked to the overall economic climate and that the important thing is to aim for zero inflation. He says that the state's role is to draw up large-scale plans for investing in infrastructure, and that Pact for Italy experts have calculated that a 100,000 billion lire investment over three years, largely paid for by the private sector, would enable the government to rebuild the economy and create jobs. Unemployed people would also be encouraged to invest in small businesses. Segni says that the Pact for Italy would not reduce taxes immediately, because the public deficit would have to be taken care of before this became possible. The Pact for Italy would not, however, increase the tax burden. More money would be raised by fighting tax evasion which would make it possible to reduce taxes in the longer term. Segni says that free health care should continue to be provided for poorer people, but that private health care and pension plans should be encouraged. Segni also reiterates that his party would not join a government coalition with either the Left or the Right, and in particular that there is no basis for believing that the pact would rather arrange a deal with Achille Occhetto's Progressive Alliance after the elections.
