The 3,254 projects concerning highway networks planned by the province for the past three years have all been completed, 6,020 km of road surface has been asphalted, 2,296 bridges have been extended by 64,056 meters, and 4,643 km of roadbeds have been rebuilt. Meanwhile, all province-renowned mountains, such as Fengchengqujia, Daling, and Xiuyanbeidaling, that blocked the traffic for a long time in the past, have all been got through. The province has also put an end to the history of there being no bridges on 898 rivers. Construction of the main highway framework has been under way in an all-around manner. Construction of the Shenyang-Benxi, the Shenyang-Tieling, the Shenyang Around-the-city expressways will be completed and open to traffic by 1 October 1995. The pre-phase work for the construction of Shenyang-Shanhaiguan Expressway is under full swing. As demanded by the provincial road traffic situation and by the economic layout, the province defined the strategic goal of building highway networks beginning 1991. It is also decided that at the late stage of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, the province will complete the building of the Shenyang-Dalian, the Shenyang-Siping, the Shenyang-Dandong, and the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan high-class highways as well as the Shenyang Orbital Expressway and the Shenyang coastal high-class highway. Meanwhile, on the basis of initially erecting the main highway framework that links up various cities with high-class highways, the province will comprehensively build highways in various counties and townships. All counties and townships will be linked up with asphalted highways to form a network and then cars will be able to directly drive from counties and townships to expressways. Thanks to the construction in the first three years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, the provincial highway network has become perfect day by day, and the general quality of the network has improved remarkably. Comparing the end of 1993 to the late stage of the Seventh Five-Year Plan period, the total mileage of highways increased by 1,529 km, high-class and less-high-class pavement increased by 5,210 km, bridges extended by 70,000 meters, the highway density rose from 27.5 km for per 100 square km to 28.54 km, and the mileage available for trafficking despite rainfalls increased from 29,690 km to 34,317 km. Among the 43 land counties, the counties linked up with others through asphalted highways rose from 6 to 9. Meanwhile, the townships and towns accessible by the oil-transporting roads increased from 662 to 844, and the villages accessible by highways increased from 14,620 to 14,909 in number.
