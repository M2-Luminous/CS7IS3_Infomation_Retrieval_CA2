Sinfuego] [Text] The Philippines has become a major transshipment point for international drug trafficking because of its proximity to the Golden Triangle, the major source of heroin and opium in the world. Drug trafficking in the country, particularly Metro Manila and other urban centers, has also developed into a billion peso mega-business, according to the Narcotics Command (Narcom) under the Philippine National Police (PNP). Narcom Director Ramsey Ocampo, in briefing four visiting officers of the National Police Agency of Japan (NPAJ) at Camp Crame yesterday, estimated that some 300 drug syndicates with about 3,000 active members catering to about 600,000 drug users. The NPAJ group, which is here on a drug-related police coordinating mission is composed of Chief Superintendent Yukata Takahena, director of the drug control division and leader of the team, and Superintendents Osamu Murashita, Kenichi Tadokoro and Hiroshi Sawanobon. Senior Superintendent Ocampo described as "disturbing" the drug trafficking situation in the country, primarily because it has also become the major source and exporter of marijuana to many parts of the world. He admitted that the drug menace has remained despite the relentless and aggressive campaign waged by the PNP and other law-enforcement agencies as well as the active involvement of religious and civic groups which has achieved modest success in 1993. Ocampo told the NPAJ officers that his command shifted its drive from street operations to a more vigorous campaign against the druglords and pushers, resulting in the arrest of 60 big time drug traffickers through "Operation Thunderbolt" last year. International drug trafficking is dominated by drug syndicates operating from Taiwan and Hong Kong which supply the popular "shabu" [methaphetamine hydrochloride] to the Philippine drug market. Takahena and his group were accorded honors upon their arrival at the PNP general headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City. A parade was held by a special police battalion and Senior Superintendent Benjamin Advincula, PNP chief of protocol and foreign liaison escorted the visitors.
