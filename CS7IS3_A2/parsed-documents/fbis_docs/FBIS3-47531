General Doan Khue, member of the party Central Committee Political Bureau and minister of National Defense attended the seminar. The TAF commander delivered a report on the activities of the force during the past few years. He pointed to its great efforts in improving its organization and personnel to meet the requirements of localities, military regions, and key strategic areas. Despite numerous difficulties in equipment, budget, and facilities, the TAF has closely coordinated with the army corps, military regions, and localities to build and strengthen its units, improve training, and maintain combat readiness. The force has also striven to recruit and train new cadres, specialized personnel, and workers. Various units of the force have consistently improved training and fulfilled all their assigned tasks. They have closely combined the task of building firm and comprehensively strong units with that of modernizing and standardizing the army. The seminar provided ample time for delegates of the army corps, military regions, and military units to discuss and exchange experiences on training and maintaining the spirit of combat readiness, military and joint operations, and other tasks related to national defense. Speaking at the seminar, the minister stressed: In building and training, the TAF should implement the motto: firmly maintain basic principles and effectively apply past combat experiences. Cadres of the force must carefully study the enemy's capabilities while formulating concrete plans and projects to enhance the quality of training at various units. They must also strive to fulfill their tasks in order to attain standardization, build comprehensively strong units, set up firm and strong defense zones, and step by step advance toward modernizing the army. These are essential tasks for making the TAF units strong and firm so that they can fulfill new tasks and meet the requirements under all circumstances for the cause of national defense and construction.
