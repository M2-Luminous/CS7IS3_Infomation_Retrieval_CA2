FR940505-1-00442 FR940505-1-00012 ( 1 ) In testing diurnal emissions, the following sequence of temperatures shall be repeated three times and substituted for those specified in table 1 of appendix II to 40 CFR part 86: ␣ 1Minute 1Temperature ( ○F) 1Minute 1Temperature ( ○F) 0 65.0 780 101.1 60 66.6 840 95.3 120 72.6 900 88.8 180 80.3 960 84.4 240 86.1 1020 80.8 300 90.6 1080 77.8 360 94.6 1140 75.3 420 98.1 1200 72.0 480 101.2 1260 70.0 540 103.4 1320 68.2 600 104.9 1380 66.5 660 105.0 1440 65.0 720 104.2 l l ( 2 ) In testing hot soak emissions, 105 ○F shall be substituted for 95 ○F in 40 CFR 86.138&hyph;96(e). ( 3 ) In testing running loss emissions, 105 ○F shall be substituted for 95 ○F in 40 CFR 86.134&hyph;96(g)(1) (xii) and (xiv) of this chapter. (v) NO X emissions are determined in g/mi using the test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart B and as calculated at 40 CFR 86.144&hyph;94(1), with the fuel specifications contained in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. (vi) The exhaust HC and NO X emissions standards for 1999 and later model year light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and light-duty trucks (LDTs) as measured over the IM240 transient mass emissions test specified in §52.2963(i)(5) are as follows: ␣ 1Class 1Loaded vehicle weight (pounds) 1Category 1Full life total hydrocarbons (grams/mile) 1Oxides of nitrogen (grams/mile) 2Half life 2Full life LDV All Enhanced 0.20 0.30 0.45 LDV All Transitional .34 .60 .90 LDT 0&hyph;3750 Enhanced .20 .30 .45 LDT 0&hyph;3750 Transitional .34 .60 .90 LDT 3751&hyph;5750 Enhanced .29 .60 .75 LDT 3751&hyph;5750 Transitional .44 1.05 1.35 (vii) For the 1999 model year only, the transitional standards specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) of this section apply to those sales of LDVs and LDTs to which the transitional standards specified in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section apply. The enhanced in-use standards apply to all other 2000 and later model year sales of LDVs and LDTs. (2) Emission standards: medium-duty vehicles. (i) The emissions standards for 1999 and later model year medium-duty vehicles (MDVs) (excluding those MDVs powered by engines certified under the heavy-duty engine emissions standards contained in §52.2966) as measured under 40 CFR part 86, subpart B are as follows:
