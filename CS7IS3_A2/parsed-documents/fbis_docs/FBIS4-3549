Opening a meeting with the heads of local republics and regions in Moscow, the Russian president also stressed that the balance between the executive and legislative branches of power is taking shape. "Much has changed in the country in the past few months, political stabilization is gaining strength, the disastrous state of dual-power has been overcome," Yeltsin pointed out. "The system of meetings with the republic heads is being renewed," the president said, adding that approximately five to seven such meetings should be held a year. Today's meeting is the first of its kind since the adoption of a new constitution and the elections for the federal parliament. On the recent local elections in the country, Yeltsin said: "The elections are valid in 61 federal regions. In only 17 is voter turnout too low." He expressed the hope that all the local elections would be concluded by the end of this year.
