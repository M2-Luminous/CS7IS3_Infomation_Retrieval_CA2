Diplomatic circles consider his having chosen Brazil for his first visit to Latin America to be a significant political gesture. McCaffrey yesterday said his objective is to "improve the strong professional relationship" between the servicemen of the two countries. In truth, this is the beginning of a relaxation in the relationship between the Brazilian and U.S. Armed Forces, which have recently experienced difficulties due to the training of U.S. troops on the Brazilian border, without the participation of the Brazilian Armed Forces. During a recent visit to Washington, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said that "the relationship deteriorated recently because there was the feeling that the United States was granting other Latin American countries more cooperation. The fact that the United States considered that the Brazilian military should fight drug trafficking also caused unrest in our barracks. We need to reverse that climate." Since then, Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima has been in frequent contact with the Pentagon, seeking to smooth the creases. He, for example, was the only Latin American ambassador to attend General McCaffrey's swearing-in as commander of the Southern Command on 17 February. Flecha de Lima revealed that one of the main obstacles in the relationship between the Brazilian Armed Forces and the Pentagon began to be removed a few days ago. The ambassador explained that the problem was caused by a curious technical problem: No Brazilian military representative in Washington had ever been invited to Pentagon briefings (meeting during which the Pentagon's official reports are distributed) because Brazil, instead of having a defense minister as in other countries, has three military ministers. There are therefore three military attaches in the Brazilian Embassy in Washington. As the United States only invites one military representative from each country, it did not know which of the three Brazilian military representatives to invite -- because to privilege one branch could give the impression that the other two were being ignored. This has been diplomatically settled using the seniority criteria: the most senior military representative will represent Brazil. General McCaffrey will be welcomed in Brasilia by General Geise Ferrari, commander of the Army's land operations.
