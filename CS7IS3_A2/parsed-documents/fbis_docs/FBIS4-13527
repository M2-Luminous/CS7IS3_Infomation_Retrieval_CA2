Warning Israel against mounting an act of aggression against Jordan in view of Rabin's inability to stop the intifadah, Qaddumi said that Rabin has been trying to hold Jordan responsible for his failure and added that if Israel does not withdraw very soon the struggle with the Palestinian forces will continue. In a statement to the Qatari newspaper AL-SHARQ published yesterday, Qaddumi said that a new reality is now emerging in the arena of the Palestinian-Israeli struggle making all the Zionist dreams vanish and the greater Israel concept something of the past.
