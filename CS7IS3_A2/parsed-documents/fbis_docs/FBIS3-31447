Journalists were addressed by party president Mirsad Ceman and Fuad Didic, member of the Main Committee. Edin Nuhic reports: [Nuhic] We are a bit skeptical about what is going to happen after NATO's ultimatum expires. This was stated by SDA President Mirsad Ceman at a news conference today. Considering our experience so far, it is not realistic to expect the ultimatum to be fully complied with. What is also characteristic is that the aggressor is not behaving in line with the threat that was addressed to it. On the other hand, the visit by numerous world politicians to Sarajevo and the busy diplomatic activities in the world indicate that there is a certain change in the international community's attitudes toward the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. The withdrawal of the weapons could, however, have some negative effects, Mirsad Ceman said. [Begin Ceman recording] Regarding the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo, we would particularly like to express our fear that even if a more significant removal of heavy weapons deployed around Sarajevo took place, these weapons could still be deployed on other fronts, above all, as this is becoming evident, to the Bihac region, and other regions where the aggressor is carrying out attacks. Thus, NATO's decision, whose purpose is to protect the (?unprotected) zones, would in fact be brutally dodged, in another area. [end recording] [Nuhic] The message of the SDA to the political leadership of the country and the international community is to block the roads that lead from Sarajevo to other regions and in this way prevent the aggressor from deploying heavy weapons in other regions. The ultimate aim of the SDA is not to provoke NATO air strikes, Fuad Didic, member of the party's Main Committee, said. [Begin Didic recording] Our ultimate aim is to have the arms embargo lifted. Our ultimate aim is arms in our own hands. This means that our ultimate aim is to secure our survival. We have not survived as a nation so far because of agreements. We Bosnian Muslims have survived because of our armed resistance. [end recording] [passage omitted] [Nuhic] At the end of today's news conference, the SDA representatives briefed the journalists on some details concerning the visit by [Presidency Member] Nijaz Durakovic to Australia. They said that they were told by the party members in the Australian branch of the SDA that, speaking at some rallies, Durakovic compared the SDA with the terrorist Serbian Democratic Party, saying, we quote, Adilbeg is saving Bosnia with his own means [not further specified]. It is unacceptable, Ceman said, that some members of opposition parties should be entering the preelection campaign in this way while SDA members are bleeding in defending Bosnia.
