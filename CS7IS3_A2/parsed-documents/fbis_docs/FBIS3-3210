The letter, which will be sent by express mail today, is signed only by Mr Bao after other activist groups declined to support a signature campaign for fear of police action. Beijing has imposed a news blackout on the reparation movement. In his letter, Mr Bao urged Mr Hosokawa to "use his influence" on Chinese leaders to accelerate the pace of democracy in China. He also said that it would be "hypocritical and unfounded" for Japan to pledge its friendship with China unless Tokyo first apologised and paid compensation for the damage it inflicted on China during the Sino-Japanese war. The medical researcher accused the Chinese Government of violating its own constitution and acting "against the wishes of its people" when it renounced its rights to seek reparation from Japan in 1972. He said the renunciation was made without the consensus of the National People's Congress--the highest authority in the Chinese Government--and was therefore unconstitutional. "I have to make the statement public now because I understand they will stop me from speaking out when Mr Hosokawa comes," said Mr Bao yesterday. Meanwhile, Beijing student activist Wang Dan and two other dissidents returned to Beijing yesterday after having left the Chinese capital for the duration of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit. Mr Wang said he and dissidents Zhou Duo and Min Qi had spent the past few days in the southeastern coastal city of Xiamen. They had gone of their own volition to prevent the tension surrounding Mr Christopher's visit from becoming even greater after several dissidents were detained to keep them away from the current session of the National People's Congress and the Secretary of State. Mr Wang, one of the main leaders of the 1989 student movement, said he decided to leave Beijing after"the repeated persuasion of some friends." He also said he had been advised that "the conflicts would become more acute" if he stayed but refused to say who had told him this. "If the authorities had demanded that I go, I would not have gone," said Mr Wang. The three men stayed at a hotel in Xiamen and spent the time touring the city. Three or four plain-clothes policemen followed them wherever they went. When Mr Wang arrived back in Beijing, uniformed police were still in the reception room at the apartment block where he lives. Nevertheless, Mr Wang said: "I'm completely free." Mr Wang said he was heartened by the concern Mr Christopher expressed about human rights in China but said he did not pin much hope on pressure from outsiders. Sources said that dissident Wei Jingsheng, who served more than 14 years in prison before being released last September, was unlikely to return to the capital from Tianjin over the next few days. Mr Wei left Beijing on March 6.
