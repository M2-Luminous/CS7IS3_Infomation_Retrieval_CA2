(KOTRA) said Thursday. The Russian Government has decided in principle to give Korea 5 hectares (15,000 pyong) of land currently reserved for the use of Moscow University for the trade center in exchange for some of its outstanding liabilities, and is discussing details with the Moscow city hall. City officials and university authorities are said to strongly oppose the plan, but the government favors the idea and is likely to look for other sites if it cannot get the land, KOTRA officials said. If Seoul accepts Moscow's proposal at a joint economic committee meeting slated for May 19-23 here, repayment of some of Russia's liabilities with Korea will be resolved. KOTRA, however, has its heart set on the land owned by the university campus and may seek to locate the trade center there without linking it with Korea's loans to Russia, officials said. "We exchanged a memorandum of understanding with Moscow city and the university last month to set up a trade center within the university," an official said. The memorandum was signed without any linkage to the loan so the Seoul Government can decide whether to attach the matter to the loan repayment, he said. KOTRA, regardless of the outcome of the project's linkage to the loan, is sounding out local companies to determine their interest in the center. Such firms as Dongbu, Daelim and Byoksan have shown an affirmative response. The center will be comprised of four sectors -- exhibition, department store, hotel and apartments -- and is expected to cost 300 million U.S. dollars. Seoul had failed to settle some of the loan repayment with rent for the Korean industrial complex in Nakhodka due to opposition from Moscow. Korea loaned 1.27 billion dollars in economic aid to the former Soviet Union and interest on the outstanding liabilites had reached 387 million dollars as of the end of last year.
