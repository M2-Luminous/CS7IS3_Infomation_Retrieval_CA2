The demarche, which is very unusual in light of the good relations currently prevailing between the Clinton administration and the Israeli Government, was submitted by U.S. Ambassador William Brown to Eytan Bentzur, the deputy director general of the Foreign Ministry. The protest came after U.S. officials were amazed by a map given to Samuel Lewis, head of policy planning at the State Department, by Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer several weeks ago. On the map, a circle was drawn around Jerusalem that greatly exceeded the city's municipal area in size. The map also pictured plans for construction between Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem, Ma'ale Adumim and Giv'at Ze'ev, and also between Giv'at Ze'ev and Jerusalem. In reaction to the demarche submitted by Amb. Brown, government sources yesterday promised to look into the matter and convey a response to the U.S. Government.
