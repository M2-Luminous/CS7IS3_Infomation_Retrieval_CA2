Mr. Aidid said the United Nations Operation in Somalia had not delivered required goods, and said that it had only assisted a limited number of people. On the formation of a police force, the chairman suggested it was important to speed up the creation of the police force, so that security was maintained throughout the country.

Mr. Aidid told the UN envoy that reparations should be paid for the damages caused by the five months of war, in which 13,000 people were killed and 45,000 injured, and a lot of property destroyed. He said the injured and orphans should be cared for and rehabilitated. Mr. Aidid appealed to the international community to continue their humanitarian assistance to support the Somali people. He made it clear that foreign interference in Somalia was detrimental to the establishment of peace in the country, adding that Somalia should be left alone.
