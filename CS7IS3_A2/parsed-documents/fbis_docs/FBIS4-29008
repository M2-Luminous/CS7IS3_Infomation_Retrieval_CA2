Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said it is patently unfair to expect the littoral states to use national funds to underwrite what is, by and large, an international responsibility. He adds, however, that the littoral states, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand do not wish to adopt any unilateral decision regarding the management of the strait, one of the busiest waterways in the world. He was delivering a keynote address at an international conference on the Straits of Malacca organized by the Malaysian Institute of Maritime Affairs in Kuala Lumpur. The two-day inaugural conference attended by about 180 participants will discuss matters pertaining to the (?risk) management, navigational, and environmental problems of the strait. Datuk Abdullah said there was a need for cooperation to secure a safer navigation and a cleaner strait regime because many of the potential risks and problems associated with the strait were the results of externalities. The problems are created by ships in transit as well as multiple use of the waterway. He pointed out that the three states are facing the situation where the international shipping community use the strait on a free of charge basis while the littoral states have to bear the financial burden to keep the strait clean and safe.
