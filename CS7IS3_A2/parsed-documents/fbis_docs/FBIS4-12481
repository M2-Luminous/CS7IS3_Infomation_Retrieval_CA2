During the New Year holidays some programs were broadcast and you watched them. A number of newspapers wrote about those programs and some of the papers, to be fair, were quite honest, God bless them. They wrote about the weaknesses of those programs in detail. The Vision [television] should think of ways to perform its duty. What is that duty? I have to only refer to it, as time is short and I have no other choice. The duty of that organization and other publicity organizations is to attract people, particularly the young generation, to sense right, justice, human qualities, and moral and spiritual issues. That is their duty. They should also stop people turning to indecent and inhuman acts -- wrong, oppression, treachery, and other filthy qualities. What can be done about that? People should sit down and think about that, and that is not easy. The nature of any person, particularly people who have not been properly educated, is toward pleasure. That is very clear. Those people follow anyone who better provides that pleasure. That is the initial nature of human beings. The duty of those publicity organs is to see which of those pleasures are harmful and which are useful. They should sweeten the things that, in the first instance, appear to be bitter but are, in fact, useful -- just like a mother or a doctor does who covers a bitter medicine with sugar so that the child takes it. If it is not covered, then the child does not take the medicine. When it is covered, the child takes the medicine and gets better. That is the way programs should be presented -- sugar-coated -- so that what people initially reject, but is useful to them, seems appetizing. The same way, they should make the things that are harmful to the people taste bitter. [passage omitted] It is easy to say these things, but their implementation brings a great deal of problems. Now, the dear people who have accepted the new responsibilities at the Voice and Vision should work on those issues. Spiritual leaders, seminaries, believers, university lecturers, and everyone who can help them should offer their help so that that valuable service is rendered properly. Another topic of discussion concerns the anniversary of the martyrdom of the Martyr Ayatollah Musa Sadr and his esteemed sister on 19 Farvardin [8 April]. These two dear ones were martyred after enduring torture in the prisons of Baathist Iraq. [passage omitted]. Another issue concerns our problems in the political realm. A great deal of effort is being taken to force the Islamic Republic of Iran to surrender, and there is a plan by the United States, which is being clearly displayed in practice, to impoverish us financially. This is to say that the United States is trying to limit our oil income, which constitutes one of our country's sources of income, and, obviously, the more we earn from this source, the more developed our country will become, and the less we earn the greater the number of problems we will face. They are exerting pressures to reduce this income. Their scheme is a dastardly one. In an OPEC meeting, everyone, except one member, agrees that oil production should be reduced so as to increase the prices. That certain member says: No, the production levels should stay unchanged for a while. This is despite the fact that the said member country, which itself earns its revenues from producing and exporting oil, fully understands that it will be harmed by such a policy. It also understands that losses will be incurred by other Arab countries and in fact all OPEC members. But they still say: Let everyone burn with us. This is what the situation is like. The said country is prepared to suffer losses, and also let the others -- which are after all its allies -- to lose as well. This is how it is. They [not further identified] have played, wherever possible, a role similar to the one described above. However, we want to tell them something, which we want them to hear carefully, with all earplugs removed. We want to say that no matter what happens to us, we will never -- never -- surrender to America and Israel. This, in effect, means that we will never surrender to oppression, injustice, and coercion. [crowd chants in support] We have Imam 'Ali in our history; we have Fatimah Zahra in our history; we have Ja'far Sadeq in our history; we have the martyrs of Karbala in our history. When we have these models, surrender does not mean anything to us. What are you going to do about it? Okay, you will exert more pressure on us; the implementation of our development plans might be delayed for a few years, but so what? Our people might be under a bit of pressure, that is right; but our people are ready to accept this. If you see once in a while someone saying something, this is not the reason--a certain amount of discrimination does take place; some injustices take place; a certain amount of desire for the high life exists; people see a certain amount of wrong-doing from certain people. When the people see these, they complain, and they have a right to complain, and their complaints should be investigated. However, the fundamental issue remains the same. If the Islamic Republic and the revolution were to be destroyed under pressure who would accept this? Our models in our history have shown us the way. We shall eat hunger! We shall protect our faith!
