Cardoso is followed by former Governor Orestes Quercia (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes (PFL) [Liberal Front Party], and Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola. The Gallup poll, conducted at O ESTADO's request in February -- and thus before the creation of the URV [real value unit] was announced -- which interviewed 2,566 people in 21 states, reveals that Lula enjoys 30.9 percent of the electoral preference, Maluf 12.6 percent, and Fernando Henrique 10.3 percent. Gallup interviewed electors from 220 municipal districts, and found out that Quercia is the fourth most favored candidate, with 7.4 percent of the electoral preference, Magalhaes fifth with 6.9 percent, while Brizola obtained 5.9 percent of the votes, if the first round of elections were to be held between 1 and 18 February, which is when the poll was conducted. Gallup Director Carlos Matheus commented that "the probe was carried out before the economic plan was announced, and therefore before Fernando Henrique Cardoso received repeated media exposure." The figures reveal that Lula is the favorite candidate for all social classes, all age groups, and for electors of various educational levels. But Cardoso closely follows Lula in the electoral preference of class A electors with 25.4 percent of the electoral preference, while Lula has 28.3 percent. He also follows his possible adversary closely in the choice of electors with higher educational levels, who give Cardoso 25.3 percent of the votes and Lula 30.2 percent. As is the case for the PT candidate, Maluf supporters are also evenly divided between social classes, age groups, and educational levels. Out of the 21 polled states, the PT candidate enjoys most support in the northwestern region, where he would obtain 36 percent of the votes, and less in the south and the north-center-eastern region, with 28 percent. Maluf has more support in the south (15 percent) and less in the northeastern region (7 percent). Cardoso enjoys most support in the southwestern region, with 14 percent, and less in the south with 5 percent, which is where Leonel Brizola -- who was born in Porto Alegre 0nd was former governor of this state -- has his best performance with 13 percent of the votes. Magalhaes enjoys most support in the northwest (23 percent) and less support in the south and the north-center-eastern region (2 percent). Quercia enjoys 9 percent of the northeastern votes and 7 percent of the southwestern and southern region votes.
