Zimbabwe Defence Minister Moven Mahachi said the men were now ready for integration into South Africa's new national army, ZIANA news agency reported. Mr Mahachi told the men to prepare to work alongside their former foes. "You are obviously aware that you will be integrated into a new defence force where you will work with people who were your enemies for a long time. "It will not be an easy transition but one that will demand your determination, patience and goodwill in a spirit of reconciliation," the minister said in a speech read for him by Deputy Defence Secretary Alexio Guruwo. This, he said, was the only way to ensure that democracy in South Africa would succeed and be sustained. "We in Zimbabwe went through a transition period quite similar to what you will experience in South Africa in the next few months. We are more than willing to share our experiences with you to the best of our ability as we have demonstrated by accepting to train in our military institutions cadres from MK and APLA."
