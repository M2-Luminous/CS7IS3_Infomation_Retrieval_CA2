Dubko, Kebich, Novikov and Lukashenko represent the left centrist bloc. Their programs focused on further integration with Russia, gradual non-shock implementation of the reforms, the continuing state management of the basic economic industries, simultaneous existence of different forms of property and the basic social guarantees for the population. These four candidates are backed by the bloc of parties and public movements making a part of the Belarussian People's Movement. The Belarusian People's Movement includes the Communist Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Republican Organization of Veterans, the Union of Officers, the Slav Council Party and others which have a wide net of local structures. Shushkevich and Poznyak represent the bloc of the right forces. Their programs concentrated on "unconditional neutrality," active economic reforms and introduction of Belarus' own national currency units. All candidates except Poznyak see Russia as the main economic partner of Belarus. Representatives of the left bloc regard establishment of an economic union with Russia as the beginning of a closer, not only economic but, later, also political integration. Both the left and the right candidates tried to put forward single candidates from their blocs. However, no agreement has been reached. IF Note: In accordance with the Belarusian legislation, the president is elected if more than a half of those voting during the elections vote for him. In Belarus 7.349713 million people enjoy the suffrage. About 2,000 Belarusian citizens will be voting abroad. Observers in Minsk said they believed that there would be two rounds of the elections since there was quite a number of respected candidates each of who could win a significant part of votes. Moreover, according to the rating of the six candidates established during sociological polls, none of them had the guaranteed support of the majority of voters. This made the council of monitors under the Central Election Commission recommend that media publish no results of different sociological polls. According to the Institute of Sociology under the Belarusian academy of Sciences, Kebich (with 31 pct of respondents supporting him) and Lukashenko (25 pct) have the best chances. They are followed by Shushkevich, Poznyak, Novikov and Dubko. The Belarusian Interior Ministry told Interfax that the investigating bodies had practically completed the investigation into the false assassination attempt on Lukashenko and would soon announce the name of a person close to Lukashenko, who had shot the Mercedes of the candidates in the Belarussian presidency. IF Note: In the evening on June 16 Interfax learned from the initiative group of Lukashenko's supporters that his car had been shot by unidentified persons during his campaigning trip across the Vitebsk Region. The press services of the Interior Ministry and the KGB officially announced that the assassination attempt had been planned and carried out by Lukashenko's group itself. In an interview with Interfax leader of the initiative group Dmitriy Bulakhov disagreed with the conclusion made by the law enforcement bodies. He said that except this version the investigating bodies had not cared to work on any other versions. Bulakhov added that the investigation had been carried out without respecting the secret of preliminary investigation which made think that there were attempts to use the incident with Lukashenko against him pursuing some political goals. Bulakhov did not rule out that at the last moment the candidacy of Lukashenko could be withdrawn from the presidential race since feeling that Lukashenko's rating was growing, the team of Kebich was ready to do anything in order to save its posts.
