FBIS3-13467 "drnes050_r_94003" FBIS-NES-94-050 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 SOUTH ASIA India Commentary Condemns Pakistani Diplomacy on Kashmir BK1403155694 Delhi All India Radio General Overseas Service in English 1010 GMT 14 Mar 94 BK1403155694 Delhi All India Radio General Overseas Service in English 1010 GMT 14 Mar 94 Language: English Article Type:BFN [Commentary by Dev Prakash] [Text] In violation of the spirit of bilateralism, good-neighborliness and the Simla Agreement, Pakistan has been mounting an assault on India at the international forums on the so-called violation of human rights in J and K [Jammu and Kashmir] and Punjab. Pakistan has been pampered by the uncalled-for statements based on half-truth by President Clinton and other officials of the USA. Suffering from innate sense of political insecurity pretending to rule with the help of ISI [Inter Service Intelligence], Ms. Bhutto seems to have lost all [word indistinct] bearing and composure. [sentence as heard] She is suffering from the illusion that she can annex Kashmir, it being a Muslim-majority border state, or by championing the cause of Muslims in Kashmir she can seek leadership of the Islamic world. She has not only forgotten that millions of people in her own country are deprived of fundamental freedom and basic human rights, but also that she is losing support all over the world by deporting terrorism to India and other neighboring countries. To expose Pakistan's false propaganda against India on human rights violation, India as of late allowed nongovernmental organizations, individuals, and envoys of various countries to see for themselves the condition in J and K. This has helped India in enhancing its credibility at the international forums. Innocent people are being butchered by Pakistan-trained extremists in the valley. Thousands of foreign mercenaries, especially Afghans, are attacking Indian security forces before mingling with masses at crowded places to avoid retaliation. And if in retaliation any civilian is killed in cross-fire, Indian forces are blamed for violating human rights. Delhi-based ambassadors and high commissioners of 10 Western and Islamic countries visited J and K last week and met leaders of Hurriet Conference at the residence of their leader, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who was there with their leaders like Maulvi Ansari, Qazi Abdullah, Professor Ghani and Javed Ahmad. The envoy's team also met among others acting president of the JKLF [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]; human rights commission officials; and [Kashmir] Governor, General, retired, K.V. Krishna Rao. These diplomats from Bulgaria, Hungary, Nigeria, Senegal, Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Canada have met people holding all shades of opinion and have realized the role played by Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. The reaction proves the success of the center's federal government's new policy to open up Kashmir and invite the envoys to visit it. The separatists would not have to adjust [as heard] to the fact that the other side of the story would also get international exposure. Only last month, ambassadors of Belgium, Greece and Germany had visited Kashmir to assess the situation for themselves. India has also invited the member countries of the ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] to send their envoys to the state. It has permitted the International Committee of the Red Cross to send a team to the state and is currently negotiating with Amnesty International too which is keen in visiting the valley. Earlier, U.S. secretary of state [title as heard], Ms. Robin [Raphel], had paid a visit on her own to the valley. The misunderstanding and falsehood spread by the Pakistani lobby is gradually being cleared up and there is now a greater appreciation of the Indian position that it is the victim of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. On the basis of Vienna Declaration, the UN Human Rights Commission on 4 March adopted a resolution condemning terrorism and calling upon the international community to fight the menace at the national, regional, and international levels. It also expressed concern at the gross violation of human rights by terrorist groups by saying that it cannot be justified under any circumstances. It is a big blow to Pakistan which is spreading fundamentalism in various countries. In Kashmir, Pakistan has tried to create religious cleavages and divide. It has resulted in the ethnic cleansing and large-scale displacement of people. Efforts are being made to change the demographic profile of the Kashmir Valley. Coming to Pakistan's own record of human rights, the latest reports of Asia Watch and Human Rights Commission of Pakistan are eye-openers as they have accused the Pakistani Government of severe abuse of human rights of minorities and women in particular.
