In 1992, the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted into the atmosphere surpassed 17 million tons, and surveys indicate that a quarter of the cities in northern China have atmospheric sulfur dioxide concentrations above the permissible level of 0.15 mg/m[.sup]3[/]. In southern China, the acidity of precipitation is increasing perceptibly, and the area subject to acid rain, which originally was confined to the Chongqing-Guiyang and Nanchang-Changsha regions, now includes the Fuzhou-Xiamen, Changzhou-Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Qingdao-Jinan areas. The harmful effects of acid rain are now among the ten major environmental problems facing China's modernization. 1. Destruction of Forests. Before acid rain reaches the ground, it damages the leaves of trees, causing them to become yellow, gradually lessening their photosynthetic ability, leaching out nutrients, and causing the leaves to wither and fall. When acid rain enters the soil, it dissolves inorganic nutrients, leaches them away, and also decreases the amounts of organic matter in the soil, thus decreasing soil fertility. Acid rain also hinders root development, retards the growth of trees, and decreases their resistance to disease and insect pests, with the result that large areas of forest are killed. In the mid-1980's, precipitation in Sichuan had become significantly acid (in 1989 the pH of rain in Chongqing had fallen to 4.21), and acid rain was abundant in the Chengdu and Chongqing regions; as a result, the huashan pines at Fengjie, the firs of Mount Emei, and the masson pines in the hills south of Chongqing have been damaged over an area of more than 100,000 mu. 2. Corrosion of Buildings and Structures. Acid rain can react chemically with limestone, sandstone, concrete, and metals. The resulting corrosion damages or defaces buildings, statues, and cultural relics. It has been reported in the press that owing to the effects of acid rain the Leshan Buddha, the largest statue of the Buddha in the world, is already seriously affected: its face is pitted, its nose is blackened, its body is wasting away, material has been lost from the hands, feet and shoulders, and the outer garment is being worn away, making urgent measures necessary. High-voltage electric transmission lines, railways, metal bridges, motor vehicles and skyscrapers are being corroded by acid rain, which decreases their service life and necessitates more frequent repair. Surveys in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces found that the cost of rustproofing metal equipment such as that described above exceeds 100 million yuan. In addition, acid rain causes corrosion or fading of paints and organic coatings, weakens fabrics and causes them to fade, ages rubber and plastic, and degrades and destroys paper products, thus decreasing or eliminating their utility value. 3. Dying Lakes. Although no acidification of lakes has yet been found in China, bicarbonate levels in some reservoirs of the Jiajiang, Danleng and Mingshan regions (covering about 5,000 square kilometers) have fallen to 0.5 meq/liter [milliequivalents per liter]; in the Zigong, Rongxian, Wanxian, Liangping, and Zhijiang regions (about 8,000 square kilometers), bicarbonate levels in some reservoirs are between 0.5 and 1.0 meq/liter. Under the international Gallway standard, water bodies with bicarbonate levels below 0.5 meq/liter are classified as sensitive to acidification; those with bicarbonate levels above 0.5 meq/liter are classified as not sensitive to acidification. Thus, the first group of reservoirs mentioned above is sensitive to acidification: owing to their low bicarbonate levels, they have a weak buffer capacity for resisting acidification and a latent proneness to acidification. The latter group of reservoirs is potentially sensitive. Thus, the problem of acidification of lakes must not be ignored. 4. Decreased Crop Yields. When acid rain falls, the leaves of crops are the first to be damaged. Rusty spots appear on them and they turn yellow. Their absorptive ability and photosynthetic ability are weakened, and the internal organization of the leaves is damaged, resulted in the leaching out of sugars, amino acids, and pectin and retarding their growth. Acid rain also decreases the sprouting rate of seeds and the root development of plants; and because the absorptive ability of soils is decreased, seedling growth is slow and crop yields fall. On 15 March 1979, a fall of acid rain that occurred in a zone including the Fenghuang, Changsha and Xiangtan areas of Hunan Province and the Songtao region of Guizhou Province caused a major decline in crop yields over an area of 350 square kilometers. Acid rain leaches such inorganic components as potassium, calcium and magnesium from the soil and can decompose rock, alter soil components, accelerate the leaching of potassium and magnesium and promote wind erosion of the soil; it can depress the vital activity of microorganisms, slow the degradation of organic matter, and cause a decline in soil fertility, which also decreases crop yields. According to Ministry of Agriculture statistics, 5.3 million hectares of agricultural land in China is affected by acid rain and fluorine pollution, and the annual loss of grain output exceeds 6.3 billion kilograms. As the acidity of precipitation increases, toxic metals such as aluminum, mercury, cadmium and lead can be leached from rocks or the soil and can be absorbed by plants. Elevated cadmium levels have been found in plants of the lettuce family. Toxic metals in vegetables and fruits may not affect yields, but they do lower the food value of produce and may make it inedible.
