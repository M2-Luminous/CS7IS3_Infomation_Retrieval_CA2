FBIS3-19180 "drweu049_i_94005" FBIS-WEU-94-049 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 FRANCE Owen Report on Sarajevo Massacre Reviewed LD1203151094 Paris TF-1 Television Network in French 1900 GMT 11 Mar 94 LD1203151094 Paris TF-1 Television Network Language: French Article Type:BFN [Interview with correspondent Bernard Volker by announcer Claire Chazal--recorded] [Text] [Chazal] On 18 February, we told you that the Sarajevo market massacre, in which 68 people were killed on 5 January, had been provoked by a shell fired from Bosnian Government lines. Correspondent Bernard Volker at the time gave us details of an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] report, and said that Lord Owen, co-chairman of the peace conference on former Yugoslavia, had sent letters informing European foreign ministers of the results of this enquiry. We can now show you this confidential letter. This text confirms what we told you on 18 February. At the time, our report had been denied by the United Nations. [Volker] Let us first look at the text that I saw and which we have filmed for you: Lord Owen, former British foreign minister, represents Europe at the conference on former Yugoslavia, which he chairs together with Mr. Stoltenberg, the UN representative. On the evening of 12 February, Lord Owen sent European foreign ministers copies of the confidential report. We have obtained access to the report. Here is paragraph 7, which addresses the question of the 5 February Sarajevo attack. Lord Owen says, I quote: 7. The Serbs, it appears, will not give up their claim to part of Sarajevo. I fear the Serbs are ready to sit tight and wait to see what happens in Sarajevo. The Serbs expect the UN ballistic experts to confirm the story about leaked UNPROFOR documents carried in TANJUG (datelined Sarajevo, 8 February) about the shell that provoked the tragedy in Sarajevo's open market. The spot from where it was fired is some 1 to 1.5 kilometers inside the territory under Muslim control, measured from the demarcation line with the RS [Republika Srpska] army positions. This fact was confirmed tonight for TANJUG by highly reliable and confidential sources within UNPROFOR's HQ who wished to remain anonymous, and it was also stated in the report by UNPROFOR's commission of experts that conducted an investigation. The report was sent this morning to the UN HQ in New York. [Chazal] This confirms the information we had earlier given, even though it had not at the time been confirmed by the United Nations. [Volker] According to this text sent by Lord Owen, which you have just seen, the report outlining the conclusions of UNPROFOR's inquiry was sent on the morning of 12 February to UN headquarters, therefore to Mr. Butrus-Ghali. That was two days after NATO had issued its ultimatum to the Serbs to force them to lift the siege of Sarajevo. It was a truth that was rather inconvenient at the time. The international community, Europe, had for the first time managed to come to a real, firm decision in Yugoslavia, and lifting the siege of Sarajevo was a priority. That meant that our report had to be denied. The official UN version was that it was impossible to say with certainty where the shell had been fired from. [Chazal] Can we be sure of the authenticity of this document? [Volker] I am certain of it. I had it in my hands just now. I myself photocopied paragraph 7, which you saw a moment ago. I noted the identification codes, which show with certainty that this is a confidential document reserved for foreign ministers. [Chazal] Can you tell us who gave you this document? [Volker] You know, since 18 February, this report was confirmed to us, to you Claire, to me, to other journalists from TF1, both in France and abroad, by several leading figures who are in a position to be very well-informed. They asked to remain anonymous. We will therefore not reveal their identities. The truth is in fact often neither pleasant nor convenient. I think that we nevertheless have a duty to say what we know, having thoroughly checked the reliability of our sources, and while maintaining professional confidentiality.
