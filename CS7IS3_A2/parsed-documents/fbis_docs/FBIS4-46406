Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Gen. Sagi made the remarks at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that he had obtained information from the defense establishment according to which the government intends to free 400 Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists, and inquired as to the impact this move would have on the security situation. Gen. Sagi said he cannot deny this information, adding that it is obvious that if those prisoners are released, some of them will engage in terror activity.
