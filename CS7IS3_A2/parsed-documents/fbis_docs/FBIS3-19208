The secret report by the U.S. Justice Department, which was the basis for putting the then Austrian president on the Watch List and isolating him internationally, has now been published (because of a court ruling). The world, which by this time is only moderately interested, and Austria itself now can examine what excited us seven years ago, what caused a rift right through the country, but also forced us for the first time to deal with the Nazi past that had been pushed away. A first examination of the essence of the 204-page report provides certainty: The differing assessment that had to be reached seven years ago by any serious observer, including the author of these lines, remains correct. As an intelligence officer in the Balkans, Kurt Waldheim dealt with war crimes in a clerical manner, so to speak; he collected, summarized, and signed reports about them. Thus, he knew about them. He was not involved in them in the sense of having any authority to give orders. However, the report by the U.S. Justice Department interprets this work massively to Waldheim's disadvantage. Waldheim was certainly a small cog, but he was located in an important place in the German military machine, contributing to the functioning of this machine. But he did not commit any crimes. For the U.S. Watch List decision, however, it was unimportant whether Waldheim had only collected reports about atrocities or had provided the "logistical conditions" for them. The corresponding law is so flexible that he had to be covered by it. The political assessment is something quite different. Today, as in the past, one can say: Waldheim suffered an injustice because his work in the Balkans was assessed too harshly, too ignorantly, and probably also too maliciously by the U.S. authorities and the U.S. public. It is also a fact, however, that he kept silent about this work and covered it up -- and this made him untenable as Austrian president.
