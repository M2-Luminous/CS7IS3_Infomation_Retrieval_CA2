Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today said that if Kliridhis is asked to go to New York, he will go with pleasure if he is told that Denktas has accepted the 21 March UN document. Kasoulidhis said there is no other reason for Kliridhis to go to New York. Asked whether the government is informed about the meetings that Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, is holding in New York on the Cyprus issue, the government spokesman described the situation as a waiting period. He stressed that the government is not sitting back doing nothing. Asked to comment on press reports today on Butrus-Ghali's upcoming report, Kasoulidhis said the Cypriot Government expects that in his report to the UN Security Council, the UN secretary general will attribute blame objectively for the lack of progress in the procedure for the confidence-building measures. Kasoulidhis said that any effort not to apportion blame, justifying such a thing by saying that it would discourage the Turkish side, threatens to discourage the Greek Cypriot side tremendously. The spokesman said that the UN secretary general's report will be submitted as soon as Butrus-Ghali returns to New York on 14 May.
