ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On July 13, 1993, the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service adopted a revision to its bylaws. This final rule incorporates those changes, which update and to some extent streamline the Board's bylaws. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 13, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stanley F. Mires, (202) 268&hyph;2958. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The bylaws of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service, 39 CFR parts 1 through 10, were initially adopted after the passage of the Postal Reorganization Act in 1971, and have been amended several times. On July 13, 1993, the Board of Governors adopted a revision of these bylaws. Parts 1 through 8 of the bylaws were changed, and a new part 11 was added. (Parts 9 and 10 of the bylaws were not changed and are not republished here.) In addition, 39 CFR part 221 was amended. An explanation follows. Part 1_Postal Policy (Article I) Several changes were made to part 1 for conciseness. The former language of §1.1 (a general description of the Postal Service) is replaced by similar language taken from former §2.1, Establishment of the U.S. Postal Service. Language formerly contained in §1.2, The Board of Governors, also is transferred to the new §1.1. Former §1.3, Delegation of authority, is renumbered as §1.2. Finally, former §1.4, Open meetings, is moved to part 7, Public Observation, and appears as paragraph 7.2(a). Part 2_General and Technical Provisions (Article II) Section 2.1 now describes the physical location and function of the Office of the Board of Governors, and is derived from former §3.9.
