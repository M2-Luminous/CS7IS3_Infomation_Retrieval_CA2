He also said that with excellent infrastructure, trainable human resources and a congenial business atmosphere, Malaysia offered an outstanding profit centre for high technology business. Dr. Mahathir said the country already has the Patent Act which encouraged Malaysians to be innovative and inventive. The sustained high investment in education over many years in Malaysia was paying off, where a vast pool of well-educated men and women was available, he said. Our workers are highly motivated, trainable and eager to learn while their positive work culture, ethics and attitudes have resulted in the industries being cost-effective and efficient. Even though wages have been rising steadily, increases in quality and productivity continue to position Malaysia as a very competitive location for many kinds of industries, he said. Malaysia's political stability was also a positive attraction for investment in the country, he said. Dr. Mahathir said Malaysia continued to pursue an open philosophy, open to joint ventures and open to contributing Malaysia's share to the technologies brought in and transferred to the country. In the increasingly competitive global economy, it is imperative that we tap the best available resources, both human intelligence and material, irrespective of where they come from, he said.
