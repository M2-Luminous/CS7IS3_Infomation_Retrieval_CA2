Yilmaz, who is currently in the United States for the World Forum meetings, began his contacts in Washington. TRT correspondent Yavuz Yorulmaz reports from Washington: [Begin Yorulmaz recording] Yilmaz first met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. In a statement after the 20-minute meeting, Yilmaz said that bilateral relations and the developments in Turkey's region were assessed with Christopher. Yilmaz reported that during the meeting he emphasized that it is unacceptable to Turkey to link the military aid to conditions. Yilmaz said: Relating this subject to matters other than security -- such as terrorism, against which Turkey is struggling in a very legitimate way; or the Cyprus problem, a national issue which Turkey has been following for 20 years -- is an unacceptable situation for Turkey. Yilmaz said that Christopher, in turn, remarked that the U.S. Administration does not find it appropriate to link the military aid to Turkey to conditions and that it will intervene with Congress on this matter. Yilmaz noted that he also informed the U.S. secretary of state that the Turkish public has serious concerns regarding Poised Hammer and that this concern is related to Iraq's territorial integrity. Pointing out that during the meeting he also briefed Christopher on the work conducted in Turkey with regard to constitutional amendments, Yilmaz added: I conveyed to Christopher that it would be extremely wrong to confuse terrorism with the human rights issue, that the Turkish state will in no way renounce its legitimate struggle against terrorism, but that this struggle should not distract us from certain steps we must take in the area of human rights. Yilmaz said that during the meeting, he expressed the view that the U.S. Congress decision to impose an embargo on Azerbaijan is very unjust and that the U.S. Administration should adopt a more balanced attitude with regard to the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. The ANAP leader later met with some members of the U.S. Congress at a luncheon hosted in his honor by Turkish Ambassador Nuzhet Kandemir. In a speech at the dinner, Yilmaz stated that Turkey's importance increased further in the wake of the Cold War and that Turkey is playing a constructive role in its region. [end recording]
