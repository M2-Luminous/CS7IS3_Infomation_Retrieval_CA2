FR940922-1-00006 FR940922-1-00003 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 17 CFR Part 240 [Release Nos. 34&hyph;34681; 35&hyph;26127; IC&hyph;20557; File No. S7&hyph;21&hyph;94] RIN 3235&hyph;AF66 Ownership Reports and Trading by Officers, Directors and Principal Security Holders AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission. ACTION: Proposed Rule; Extension of Comment Period and Further Request for Comment. SUMMARY: In connection with proposals issued on August 10, 1994, Release No. 34&hyph;34514 [59 FR 42449] (the ``Proposing Release''), the Commission today is requesting further comment on the treatment of compensatory cash-only instruments under its rules regarding the filing of ownership reports by officers, directors, and principal security holders, and the exemption of certain transactions by those persons from the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). The comment period for the Proposing Release also is extended until November 1, 1994. DATES: Comments should be received on or before November 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Comment letters should refer to File No. S7&hyph;21&hyph;94. All comments received will be available for public inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20549. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anne M. Krauskopf or Mark W. Green, Office of Chief Counsel, at (202) 942&hyph;2900, or Elizabeth M. Murphy, Office of Disclosure Policy, at (202) 942&hyph;2910, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 10, 1994, the Commission released for public comment proposals to amend certain of its rules under Section 16 1 of the Exchange Act. 2 The Commission now seeks to clarify and amplify certain comment requests made in the Proposing Release. Specifically, the Commission is soliciting additional comment with respect to Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3), 3 which excludes cash-only instruments from the definition of ``derivative securities'' if they meet certain conditions. 1 15 U.S.C. 78p (1988). 2 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. (1988). 3 17 CFR 240.16a&hyph;1(c)(3). The current Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3) definitional exclusion covers any compensatory instrument issued in an employment context that can be redeemed or exercised solely for cash, provided that the instrument either: (1) Is awarded under an employee benefit plan that satisfies certain conditions prescribed by Rule 16b&hyph;3; 4 or (2) can be redeemed or exercised only upon a fixed date or dates at least six months from the date of the award, or incident to death, retirement, disability or termination of employment. 5 Both prongs of this exclusion are based on the principle that removal of the insider-recipient's discretion with respect to the timing of grant and/or realization of a cash-only instrument would minimize the opportunity for speculative abuse that Section 16 was designed to prevent. 4 Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(i) [17 CFR 240.16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(i)]. 5 Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(ii) [17 CFR 240.16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(ii)]. As proposed to be amended in the Proposing Release, the Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3) exclusion would extend to all compensatory cash-only instruments issued pursuant to an employer-employee relationship, even if the insider-recipient could control or influence the timing of such an instrument's grant or payout. In soliciting public comment, the Commission urged commenters to address whether There [is] any basis for according disparate treatment, for reporting and/or short-swing profit purposes, to equity-based securities depending on whether they are settled exclusively in cash or stock (or in either stock or cash), where both types of derivative securities provide identical opportunities for profit predicated on the underlying stock price movement []. 6 6 Proposing Release, Section II.C. As reflected in the above-quoted request for comment, the Commission is interested in comments on whether the current definitional exclusion for compensatory cash-only instruments codified in Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3) is appropriate. The Commission is interested in determining whether, for example, stock appreciation rights (``SARs'') that have a multi-year term and may be exercised at the volition of the insider-recipient may provide opportunities for speculative profit that are identical, regardless of whether the SARs are payable exclusively in cash, stock, or some combination of the two and, from the perspective of shareholders and analysts, have the same Section 16(a) 7 informational value. 7 15 U.S.C. 78p(a). Accordingly, in addition to considering the proposals and alternatives addressed in the Proposing Release, the Commission invites commenters to express their views on whether the current exclusions for cash-only instruments set forth in Rules 16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(i) and (ii), respectively, are overly broad in light of the purposes of Section 16, and thus should be limited to a smaller class of such instruments. In responding to this question, commenters should discuss whether any continued exclusion for cash-only compensatory instruments should be limited to those for which the timing of settlement is not subject to the insider's volition. For example, should Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(i) be rescinded, so the exemption would be available only if the instrument met the fixed-date conditions of Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(ii)? If an exemption for cash-only instruments is appropriate, should it be made available only under the short-swing profit recovery provision of Section 16(b), 8 rather than also providing an exemption from the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)? If a separate Section 16(a) exclusion is retained for certain compensatory cash-only instruments, comment is sought on whether it should be recast as an exemptive rule, rather than the current rule, which excludes these instruments from the definition of ``derivative securities'' and therefore from the class of ``equity securities'' covered by Section 16. 8 15 U.S.C. 78p(b). Were the Commission to eliminate the definitional exclusion for volitional compensatory cash-only instruments, transactions involving these instruments would be reportable under Section 16(a) but still could qualify for Section 16(b) exemptive treatment. Specifically, Rule 16b&hyph;3 coverage would be available for these instruments if all applicable conditions were satisfied, including non-transferability (if retained as a condition 9 ), six-month holding period, shareholder approval, disinterested administration (or formula), and window-period settlement. Comment is requested as to whether fewer or additional conditions should be imposed as a prerequisite to Rule 16b&hyph;3 qualification of cash-only instruments. Or should a separate exemption from Section 16(b) be created for the grant and/or settlement of these instruments? If so, what exemptive conditions would be necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purpose of Section 16(b)? 9 See Proposing Release, Section II.J. In order to give commenters sufficient time to consider this request for further comment, the comment period on the Proposing Release is extended to November 1, 1994. Dated: September 16, 1994. By the Commission. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23480 Filed 9&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;P
