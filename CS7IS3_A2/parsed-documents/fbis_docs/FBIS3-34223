This new FIS position comes after news of differences between its political leadership and those responsible for armed action over contacts with the government. The same sources expect the FIS' "serious" military escalation to be carried out soon by the FIS supporters who have joined the so-called "Islamic Salvation Army." They stressed that "information they received from inside [Algeria] indicates that the fighters are now in a strong position, having managed to close their ranks and secure large quantities of arms and continuous sources of supply." The sources believe that any "suspension of armed action would lead to a loss of the current zeal and drive and could lead to sharp differences in the ranks of the gunmen whom FIS' leading ulema had managed to unite." An FIS member who left Algeria recently and wishes to remain anonymous for security reasons has stated that "the most important recent achievement was the containment of the dispute which occurred between Sa'id Makhloufi (one of the Armed Islamic Movement's leaders) and the FIS political leadership because Makhloufi had thought that the leadership was willing to make concessions unacceptable to him." He also said that "another achievement" was that "most members of the Armed Islamic Group [as published] have joined the Islamic Army, and those who have not officially done so are coordinating with the command of that army." He noted in this connection that the group no longer issues statements in its name, and he cast doubt on statements issued in its name abroad such as the statement claiming responsibility for the assassination of Cheik Mohamed Busulaymani, who was close to the Hamas Movement. FIS leaders abroad (Rabeh Kebir and Anwar Haddam) strongly condemned the assassination. The appearance of a taped statement with the voice of Sa'id Makhloufi, a former officer in the Algerian Army and one of the FIS founders who leads an important part of the operations against the Algerian regime, criticizing the "Provisional National Council" headed currently by Cheik Abdelrazzaq Rejam, had raised fears of a possible serious split within the FIS. It is now certain that by moving to escalate, the FIS is saying that it has no intention of offering President Zeroual a "gratis" initiative calling for the suspension of armed action, particularly as "the mujahidin have become a difficult factor that cannot be ignored in any future negotiations." It is estimated that the armed Islamic movements have as members about 8,000 youths who have joined the military operations and are distributed over the countryside where they control areas not within the regime's grasp. They form large groups each in some cases exceeding 100 people controlled sometimes by military people who have deserted from military service. They have medium weapons such as antiaircraft guns and shoulder missiles. They mount operations against army camps, the police, and military convoys. A large number of them could take part in a single operation. A second group consists of those who are involved in underground operations inside the cities. They go in small groups not exceeding 10 members each and they operate in absolute secrecy with some of them leading normal lives as a cover. Some of them only operate at night. Joining these groups is more difficult than joining the groups in the mountains. Desert detention camps are an important source of those who join this category. Anwar Haddam, head of the FIS parliamentary mission, who lives in the United States and is a member of the FIS Executive Committee abroad, was the first to speak of the need for "the mujahidin to be taken into consideration in any serious negotiations between the regime and the FIS." He told AL-HAYAH the day before yesterday that "the leaders of the mujahidin are now an important part that cannot be ignored in the decisionmaking process within the FIS." One of the most prominent of these leaders is Abdelqadir Shabouti, known as "Major General Shabouti," a veteran who worked with the late Mustafi Bouway'li, the first man to declare armed mutiny in Algeria. FIS sources have stated that the military operations have not at all been affected by the national dialogue conference or the appointment of Zeroual as head of state. They added that the Islamic Salvation Army had claimed responsibility for a number of operations last week, the most important of which was the ambushing of an army patrol in Boumerdas east of the capital, in which 12 soldiers were killed and the attackers seized the patrol's weapons. The Islamic Army also claimed responsibility for a number of operations carried out on 26 January, the day of the opening of the national dialogue conference. Among the most important of these operations were "the assassination of three policemen in Baraki, the assassination of an officer near the Constantine bridge," the assassination of four inspectors and an officer in el-Aghouat [as transliterated], an ambush for Major General Bakhouti in Warqala [as transliterated] (which he survived), the assassination of Farhat Sheybout, member of the Algerian Communist Party's Political Bureau in Jijel, and the "execution" of six people in the Taher area accused of collaboration with the police. FIS sources said that "these were killed to put an end to the informer phenomenon." The sources said that the Armed Islamic Movement also claimed responsibility for the al-Sawma'ah operation in which 15 members of the "special forces" were killed in the area of Blida last Sunday and also for the assassination of Rashid Nefrirt, secretary general of "the Group for Culture and Democracy," last Monday.
