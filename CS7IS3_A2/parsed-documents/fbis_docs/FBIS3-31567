The howitzers, tanks, [words indistinct] multiple-rocket launchers, antiaircraft machine guns on the nearby hills allow themselves no respite. Throughout the day fierce battles have raged on the Grmusa and Grabez plains. This afternoon the chetniks launched one of their heaviest tank and infantry attacks. In the course of this hand-to-hand battle lasting several hours fighters of the 5th Corps have managed to repel the chetnik vampires. The Serbs have been reinforced with special units from Banja Luka and Prnjavor, who among their ranks have notorious criminals whose hands are heavily stained with blood. Some 30 of them will never leave the plain while dozens have been taken out of action. A number of our fighters have been wounded in the furious fighting and shelling. Today's chetnik defeat was yet another reason behind the intensified artillery destruction of Bihac and Cazin and their outlying districts. Also targeted were mosques, particularly in the Cazin municipality. As if this was not enough, the chetniks from the territory of the so-called Republic of Serb Krajina also joined in the action. They, moreover, did so from [word indistinct] in full view of the UN force stationed on the state border of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the course of the day helicopters, delivering more combat equipment, have also been sighted. This shows that the chetniks are still taking advantage of world opinion being focused on the lifting of siege of Sarajevo as they pursue their goals in other areas. This is why the civilian and military authorities have demanded once again from the government and state presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina that it make further efforts leading to compliance with the UN resolution under which the Bihac region is designated as a protected area. Along the demarcation lines with the so-called autonomous province of Velika Kladusa some provocations and actions by the most extremist groups have taken place during the day.
