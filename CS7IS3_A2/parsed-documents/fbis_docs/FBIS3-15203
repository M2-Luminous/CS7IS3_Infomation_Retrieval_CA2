Quoting the press service of the NKR defense army, it said that during the 24-hour period, in spite of the cease-fire agreement which came into force on 1 March, Azerbaijani artillery repeatedly shelled Karabakh defensive positions in the north of Mardakertskiy Rayon. Last night, the same source says, Azerbaijani infantry attacked Karabakh positions at the village of Berdashen in Martuninskiy Rayon. The attack was beaten off. This morning positions along the line between the villages of Dastakert and Tonashen in Mardakertskiy rayon were also shelled. In view of this Stepanakert fears that the other side may use the armistice to prepare for a new, large-scale offensive. The command of the NKR defense army has instructed its forces not to retaliate, if possible.
