The parliamentarians make a resolute protest against intensifying imperialist trends in Russia's foreign policy, according to which the Baltic states are included in Russia's sphere of influence. Statements made by Russian Government members directed against the Estonian state contravene the provisions of the UN Charter and the CSCE Final Act.... The parliamentary statement was preceded by an Estonian Foreign Ministry statement assessing as slanderous utterances by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev about serious violations of human rights in Estonia and Latvia and ethnic cleansing in these countries.... A sentence spoken by Russian Foreign Ministry Information and Press Department spokesman Mikhail Demurin, to the effect that diplomatic resources alone are not enough to support Russians in CIS and Baltic countries, has provoked indignation among both politicians and diplomats. President Lennart Meri summoned Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Trofimov and demanded an explanation for the latest statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry leaders. President Meri's press service made the following statement: Estonian reality has nothing to do with the picture that radical-chauvinist politicians in Moscow are trying to paint. The "Russian threat" has rallied the parliament, the president, and the prime minister, who were in sharp conflict with each other until recently. Such anti-Russian tension is perhaps unprecedented in Estonia. It is as though a detonator has been activated to explode a charge of passions that had been stored up for a long time. The Russian Embassy press service circulated the full text of Mikhail Demurin's statement: On the Foreign Ministry's initiative, a program to protect the interests of ethnic Russians abroad and give them support is being prepared. This envisages special television and radio broadcasting, humanitarian aid, support for Russian business and enterprises in which the Russian-speaking population is employed, collaboration in banking, and customs and economic privileges. That is why, Demurin says, diplomatic efforts and resources are insufficient -- decisions and active support from the Russian Government are needed. Why is the story of the planned program perceived as a threat in Estonia? Surely it is not just because the Russian Government intends to help Russians to settle down more firmly in the countries where they have found themselves at the whim of fate, and does not intend to remove them back to their ethnic homeland?
