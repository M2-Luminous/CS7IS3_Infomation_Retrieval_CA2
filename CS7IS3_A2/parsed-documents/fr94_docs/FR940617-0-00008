FR940617-0-00008 FR940617-0-00003 D. Amendment to Change Definition of ``Prime Farmland Committed to Urban Development of Water Storage'' The FPPA does not include all farmland under its protection. In section 1540(c), 7 U.S.C. 4201(c), the specific farmland covered by the FPPA is defined. This is farmland that is either ``prime farmland,'' ``unique farmland,'' or ``farmland, other than prime or unique farmland, that is of statewide or local importance.'' Each one of these terms is further defined and qualified in the FPPA and, in the definition of ``prime farmland, there is an exclusion of ``land already in or committed to urban development or water storage.'' Federal agencies are not required to consider the impact of their projects on prime farmland that is ``already in or committed to urban development or water storage,'' even if this land would otherwise fall within the definition of ``prime farmland.'' In developing the existing regulations, the Department adopted standards for determining if prime farmland is ``already in urban development'' and whether land, although not ``in urban development,'' was nevertheless ``committed to urban development.'' Under §658.2(a) of the current regulation, prime farmland which had been zoned for nonagricultural use by a state or local government with jurisdiction over the land, or which was designated in a current state or local land use plan for nonagricultural use, is regarded as ``committed to urban development.'' This would mean that projects on prime farmland in those areas would not have to be analyzed by agencies for their effect on prime farmland. The Department noted in the preamble to the 1984 final rule, at 49 FR 27720, that land use planning and zoning ``are prerogatives of state and local government, not the Federal Government,'' and supplied the following rationale for the conclusion that prime farmland under nonagricultural zoning or planning was excluded from the FPPA: If a federal agency were required by the Act to assess the impacts of a project on prime farmland not yet in urban development but already designated by the state or local government for urban development through planning or zoning, the only purpose of the requirement would be for that agency to weigh alternative sites that would lessen the impact of the project on farmland. If the agency, based on its assessment pursuant to the Act, should then decide to refrain from building its project on the proposed site, it would be declining itself to use the proposed site for urban development when local or state planning or zoning had already declared urban uses to be acceptable on the site. This would be an intrusion by the Federal Government in the function of land use planning of state and local governments. In the proposed rule, the Department offered for public comment a proposal that would abrogate the Department's previous interpretation of this question. In the definition of ``prime farmland,'' there would no longer be an exclusion based solely on the designation of the land in a land use plan or zoning code or ordinance for nonagricultural uses. The proposed rule amendment would provide that once a project site had been analyzed and given a combined score of 160 points or less, it would be considered ``committed to urban development'' and thus no longer covered by the FPPA. The preamble to the 1987 proposed rule, at 52 FR 1466&hyph;1467, cited three reasons for introducing these changes. First, it stated that the existing definition ``is inconsistent with the definitions of prime farmland used in almost all other State and Federal programs which use the definition.'' Second, it noted that the existing definition requires the SCS district conservationists to review local plans and land use regulations and that many of them do not have the background in land use planning to make the proper determinations as to whether a given project site is truly ``committed to urban development.'' Third, because land ``committed to urban development'' is excluded in the FPPA's definition of ``prime farmland'' but not from the FPPA's definitions of farmland that is ``unique'' or ``of statewide or local importance,'' it is an anomaly that this type of ``prime farmland'' can be so easily and categorically put outside the reach of the FPPA while farmland that is ``unique'' or ``of statewide or local importance'' is covered by the FPPA despite the existence of zoning designations or land use plans that would allow urban development of such lands. The comments on the proposed rule were sharply divided on whether the Department should change the identification of farmland ``committed to urban development.'' The American Farmland Trust ``strongly'' supported the proposed change, calling the existing rule ``confusing and inconsistent with the intent of the legislation.'' The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) also supported the proposed change since it did not approve of farmland being excluded from the FPPA's coverage just because local land-use plans or zoning ordinances would allow urban development on it. This, the NRDC stated, would be an ``arbitrary `grandfather' exclusion *␣*␣* even where there is no current nonagricultural development and the prospect of future nonagricultural development is highly speculative.'' The American Land Resource Association agreed with the proposed change, claiming that the existing rule worked ``inadequately'' for protection of prime farmland and caused ``unnecessary confusion among Federal agencies implementing the FPPA.'' The Farmers Home Administration and the Rhode Island Statewide Planning Program supported the change. Other commenting parties agreed with the change as part of their general support of all the amendments being proposed.
