FBIS4-36017 "drnes107_s_94002" FBIS-NES-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 Iran Disputes Continue to Hinder Ties With Britain Disputes Continue to Hinder Ties With Britain Hogg Urged To Apologize for Remarks LD0206131894 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran in English 1130 GMT 2 Jun 94 LD0206131894 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran English BFN [Text] One of the senior diplomats at the British Embassy in Tehran has been given one month to leave Iran. The action has been taken by the Iranian Foreign Ministry after it was discovered that the British diplomat was involved in activities incompatible with the diplomatic norms. The said diplomat was under surveillance for quite some time, but his expulsion orders came in what can be termed as a retaliatory measure. The British foreign office minister, Mr. Douglas Hogg, who still thinks he is living in the British Empire era, has become angry over Tehran's retaliatory measure and has made certain remarks that reflect his wrath. The irresponsible remarks made by Mr. Hogg on Wednesday indicate the fact that London still wants to live with its past dreams. Mr. Hogg does not accept the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran is an independent country whose foreign policy is based on the principle of protecting the interests of the Muslim world as well as the national interests of Islamic Iran. However, the expression of such illogical remarks by British officials is not something new, and once again the straining of the Tehran-London ties is also not something that has happened recently. Mr. Hogg is well aware of the fact that, contrary to all diplomatic norms, the intelligence agents of his government had planted bugging devices inside the embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in London. But, instead of tendering an apology to the Iranian Government, Mr. Hogg has made controversial remarks. The British, who always practice the policy of divide and rule, and ruled the world for centuries on the basis of the same policy, know how much the Muslim world hates the policies of the British Governments. The installing of the aggressive Israeli regime has been carried out directly by Britain. Its policies and activities in Bosnia-Herzegovina today are wholly anti-Islamic and the British forces in Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia are inflicting blows on Islam and the Muslims. The London government is sinking in the quagmire of domestic problems these days and Mr. John Major's government is witnessing the gradual demise of the British Government. Rampant unemployment has turned the country into a big house of the beggars. We advise Mr. Douglas Hogg that, instead of creating such a negative climate and making such irresponsible remarks, he should officially tender an apology to the Islamic Republic of Iran's Government for the illegal activities of the British diplomat in Tehran and for the illegal act of his government in bugging the Iranian embassy, which is against all diplomatic norms. Mr. Hogg should also accept the reality that the golden era of London's domination in the Middle East is long over.
