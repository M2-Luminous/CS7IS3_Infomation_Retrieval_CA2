No other foreign body has given such solid and consistent support to Pakistan in setting the Kashmir valley virtually ablaze in the last four years as the lCO. What has suddenly made its Saudi-funded secretariat change its tune and posit itself as a peace-maker? The ICO Secretary-General, Dr Al Gabid, has a long record of indulging in anti-Indian propaganda at Pakistan's behest. It is he more than anyone else who has helped Pakistan manipulate the ICO to get anti-Indian resolutions passed at its meetings. He is again being true to his commitment to the cause of Pakistan in accusing India of grave human rights violations in Kashmir on the eve of the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva. Yet, the ICO has the temerity to offer mediation. This is akin to Pakistan's own terrorist trainers posing as a detached party solely concerned with bringing peace and harmony to Kashmir. It is possible that a few balanced members of the ICO are secretly not quite happy with the way Pakistan has misused the organisation for its own anti-Indian designs. Indeed some of them have individually sought to allay New Delhi's suspicions about their bonafides by claiming to have worked behind the scenes to moderate the anti-Indian resolutions introduced by Pakistan in the past. But even if this were true, the more important issue is that the ICO just has no locus standi in the Kashmir dispute. Its concern for alleged human rights violations is only a pretence. Apart from the fact that this is simply a ruse to play the Pakistani game, would it not be more relevant for ICO to confine its attention to large-scale human rights violations in the very Islamic countries it represents? After all, even Pakistan has been indicted by both its own human rights activists and foreign organisations. The ICO's avowed interest in protecting human rights may have been a little more credible if it had routinely raised its voice against shocking cases of barbarism in the Islamic world. These include the use of poison gas against the Kurdish rebels in Iraq, air-raids on the Kurdish minorities in both Iraq, and Iran and the unending agony of the Shia minority in the marshes of southern Iraq. At present, Afghanistan is easily the worst case of an entire country having become a virtual hell for its population. The ICO has done precious little to rectify matters. Has it bothered at least to mount a humanitarian effort on the requisite scale to send succour to the Afghans? Dr Al Gabid and his friends in the ICO secretariat are apparently far too busy in political intrigues in Geneva on behalf of Pakistan to devote time and energy to all trivial pursuits. *
