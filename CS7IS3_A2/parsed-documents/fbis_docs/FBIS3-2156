Duchateau made the comment at a meeting reviewing the progress of the three-year project, which began in 1988, and making arrangements to strive for a similar second-phase aid project. The E.C.-sponsored dairy products operation is the largest aid project that China has ever accepted in the agricultural field. As a result, the supply of dairy products in 20 major Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou, has shown marked improvement. Ambassador Duchateau described the project as having made the ties of E.C.-China cooperation closer and having laid a sound foundation for a second-phase aid project in the same field, which he believed will continue.
