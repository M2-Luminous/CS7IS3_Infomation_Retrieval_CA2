FR940603-2-00020 FR940603-2-00017 DEFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD [Recommendation 94&hyph;1] Improved Schedule for Remediation in the Defense Nuclear Facilities Complex agency: Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. action: Notice; recommendation. summary: The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board has made a recommendation to the Secretary of Energy pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2286a concerning improved schedule for remediation in the defense nuclear facilities complex. The Board requests public comments on this recommendation. dates: Comments, data, views, or arguments concerning this recommendation are due on or before July 5, 1994. addresses: Send comments, data, views, or arguments concerning this recommendation to: Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, 625 Indiana Avenue, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC 20004. for further information contact: Kenneth M. Pusateri or Carole C. Morgan, at the address above or telephone (202) 208&hyph;6400. Dated: May 31, 1994. John T. Conway, Chairman. Improved Schedule for Remediation in the Defense Nuclear Facilities Complex The halt in production of nuclear weapons and materials to be used in nuclear weapons froze the manufacturing pipeline in a state that, for safety reasons, should not be allowed to persist unremediated. The Board has concluded from observations and discussions with others that imminent hazards could arise within two to three years unless certain problems are corrected. We are especially concerned about specific liquids and solids containing fissile materials and other radioactive substances in spent fuel storage pools, reactor basins, reprocessing canyons, processing lines, and various buildings once used for processing and weapons manufacture. It is not clear at this juncture how fissile materials produced for defense purposes will eventually be dealt with long term. What is clear is that the extant fissile materials and related materials require treatment on an accelerated basis to convert them to forms more suitable for safe interim storage. The Board is especially concerned about the following situations: •Several large tanks in the F-Canyon at the Savannah River Site contain tens of thousands of gallons of solutions of plutonium and trans-plutonium isotopes. The trans-plutonium solutions remain from californium-252 products; they include highly radioactive isotopes of americium and curium. These tanks, their appendages, and vital support systems are old, subject to deterioration, prone to leakage, and are not seismically qualified. If an earthquake or other accident were to breach the tanks, F-Canyon would become so contaminated that cleanup would be practically impossible. Containment of the radioactive material under such circumstances would be highly uncertain. •The K-East Basin at the Hanford Site contains hundreds of tons of deteriorating irradiated nuclear fuel from the N-Reactor. This fuel has been heavily corroded during its long period of storage under water, and the bottom of the basin is now covered by a thick deposit of sludge containing antinide compounds and fission products. The basin is near the Columbia River. It has leaked on several occasions, is likely to leak again, and has design and construction defects that make it seismically unsafe.
