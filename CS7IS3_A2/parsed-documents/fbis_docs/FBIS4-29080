He is 75-year-old Choe Kwang, chief of the general staff of the People's Army and a member of the party Politburo. During World War II, he was said to have engaged in partisan resistance activities with President Kim Il-song and at present he ranks ninth in the hierarchy. Choe immediately went into talks with his Chinese counterpart and extolled "friendship between China and the DPRK." In the evening of 7 June, the following day, ROK President Kim Yong-sam deplaned at a military air base in Seoul after an official visit of Russia and read a statement: "Russia pledged resolute measures to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear arms." Only in the Korean peninsula does serious confrontation continue after the end of the Cold War. As suspicion over the nuclear arms development program is getting more serious, brisk activities are going on in the four neighboring [word as published] countries -- the United States, China, Russia, and Japan. Both South and North Korea are all out to work on China and Russia and heated behind-the-scenes negotiations are going on at such organizations as the UN Security Council. On 8 June, ROK Foreign Minister Han Song-ju will arrive in Beijing and Japanese Foreign Minister Kakizawa will visit Seoul and Beijing over the weekend. "The Korea peninsula has once more become an arena of rivalry among the peripheral four powers. South and North Korea joined the United Nations simultaneously three years ago, pledging coexistence in their basic agreement, but the nuclear problem has completely changed the picture." So said with a sigh North Korean affairs specialist Kim Nam-shik, fellow at the Peace Study Institute in Seoul, comparing the present situation with that of the Yi Dynasty. In the later 19th century, the Korea peninsula, China, Czarist Russia, and Japan were rivals for rights and interests and Japan colonized Korea after the Sino-Japanese and the Russo-Japanese wars. It is needless to say the present situation is different from that of those days when imperialism was rampant. But fellow Kim pointed out: "Although what matters today is nuclear, not the territory, the resembling situation is that the peripheral powers are stepping up their influence over the Korean peninsula for their own security and interests." As the forefront of East-West confrontation during the Cold War days, the Korean peninsula maintained a confrontational but stabilized situation in two distinct camps -- North Korea supported by China and the Soviet Union and South Korea with the backing of the United States and Japan. Following the Cold War's end, the ROK normalized relations with the former Soviet Union and China, tipping the power balance over the Korean peninsula in one breath. At one time, the South and North sought to construct a unique order of coexistence but the DPRK finally chose a way to use the suspected nuclear arms development program as the means to get a U.S. guarantee indispensable "for the maintenance of the present order on equal terms." As a result, the United States was compelled to further its involvement in the Korean peninsula and China, Russia, and Japan became strongly concerned due to further complication of the nuclear matters. From this viewpoint, the situation in the Korean peninsula can be described as a grandiose diplomatic war between the South and North and the Big Four to build a new order of stability in the peninsula with the nuclear problem as their keyword. The United States is steadily making preparations for when sanctions may be imposed with the cooperation of Japan and the ROK with a proposition of "nuclear nonproliferation." But the positive fact that must not be overlooked is that none of the parties, South and North Korea, the United States, China, Russia, or Japan, want sanctions imposed. It is their true intention to evade the situation that goes against building a new order. According to diplomatic sources, the present position of the United States, the ROK, and Japan that they would "impose sanctions if necessary" is a policy to apply pressure on the DPRK to become more flexible and it is thought to be a considerably long time before actual sanctions would take place. How are South and North Korea and the four other nations going to deal with the dangerous factor of nuclear problems and of building a new stability? The DPRK will not easily abandon the nuclear card unless it is confident of its survival. Well-informed sources in North Korean affairs predicted the future development this way: "DPRK President Kim Il-song is not embarrassed at all. Rather, he is indignant with the United States for the `nonfulfillment of promises.' There is a good reason to believe that the Pyongyang leadership will look for a new logic to make compromises on the nuclear inspection and shift its position for dialogue, while consolidating readiness to undergo preliminary sanctions. On the other hand, it is conceivable that it may seek a new solution through the octonary negotiation [as proposed by Russia]." They added, "The current situation is different from ideological confrontation during the Cold War. It poses another problem that crisis may be amplified by complex interests of the countries involved."
