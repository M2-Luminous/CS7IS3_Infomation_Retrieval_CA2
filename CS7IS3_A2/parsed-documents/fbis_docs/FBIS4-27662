Thai banks have resorted to overseas loans to fund domestic credit which reached Bt200 billion in the same period, as the outstanding deposits fell by about Bt20 billion compared to the end of last year. The Bangkok Bank saw its deposit fall by Bt23.4 billion during this period, with the First Bangkok City Bank witnessing a drop of Bt4.9 billion, the Bangkok Metropolitan Bank a Bt4.6 billion drop, Bangkok Bank of Commerce Bt4.4 billion, Siam Commercial Bank Bt2.5 billion, Union Bank Bt900 million, and Thai Thanu Bank Bt35 million. It is the first time that half of the banks saw their deposits eroded as finances were largely diverted to mutual funds and equity investment. According to Phisit Li-atham, the central bank spokesman, the banks showed outstanding deposits of Bt2.37 billion at the end of April, an increase of 14.4 per cent compared to the same period last year, and Bt23 billion compared with the end of last year. Deposits usually grow at an annual rate of 19-20 per cent. The general picture, though, is not to bad. The 91 local finance companies in the first quarter chalked up outstanding deposits of Bt595.69 billion, an increase of 37.73 per cent compared with the same period last year and Bt54 billion higher then the end of 1993. The finance companies market share, of the financial sector, rose from 18.4 percent at the end of 1993 to 20.2 percent at the end of this year's first quarter. The banks' market share fell from 81.6 percent to 79.8 percent and is expected to decrease further when the half-year figures are announced. [passage omitted]
