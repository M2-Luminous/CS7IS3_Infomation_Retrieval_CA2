We would like far more involvement." Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the new minister for privatization in Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's Cabinet, considers the Polish market of 38 million potential consumers an "enormous opportunity" for foreign investors. Compared with the total direct investment of some $3.5 billion, Germany, at some $280 million, ranks only fourth behind the United States, Italy, and the Netherlands. "The Czech market has long been depleted. Now it is Poland's turn," the minister said in an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG. He was referring to a 4-percent growth last year, which boosted Poland to the top of the East European states. This year's growth is expected to reach at least that figure. The leftist government does not feel committed to any ideological concepts, Kaczmarek pointed out. "Privatization can no longer be stopped. We are long past the crucial point. Poland will stick to its market economy course," the minister said. He himself is a member of the Social Democratic Party, the party that is generally considered to be the successor to the communist cadre organization. Today, young technocrats who are committed to the market economy are in control. Kaczmarek pointed out that he wants to step up the speed of privatization. "We have to take more risks," the minister said. Especially medium-sized companies that are still state-owned and employ up to 500 people shall be sold "quickly and cheaply." The German Trust Agency is to serve as a model. Kaczmarek: "We may very well sell the companies at one-fifth of their actual value. What is more important is that the investors create new jobs." The bold minister candidly admits that further privatization meets with massive reservations by the population and the trade unions. The fear of losing jobs is just one side of the coin. At the same time, the fear of selling off Poland to foreign combines is increasing. "We can only counteract this by presenting good solutions for privatization," Kaczmarek emphasized. The government is taking a more cautious line with big companies, such as the Ursus truck company, where there have repeatedly been conflicts with the Solidarnosc trade union. Ursus is to be restructured and reorganized. "Privatizing it is impossible at the moment," the minister said. Ten largely independent joint-stock companies are to operate within a holding company in the future. There will be some foreign capital involved, but the trade union insists on employees holding at least 50 percent of the shares. Despite efforts by the Ursus management to step up marketing activities, capacity utilization is only 50 percent. The 9,500 employees--in 1989, the group still employed 15,000 people--produce everything themselves, starting from bolts and going to diesel oil filters. This wide production range prevents the urgently needed rise in productivity. Privatization Minister Kaczmarek thinks that a total of 1,500 to 2,000 big companies still have a difficult restructuring phase ahead of them. The first step is changing these firms into joint-stock companies. The government is also hoping for foreign financial and management aid. "The only realistic solution is the long-term privatization of big companies, which must, however, fetch a good price," the minister said. The private sector already accounts for 50 percent of the GNP. Together with the Czech Republic and Hungary, Poland holds a top position in East Europe. Some 60 percent of all people in gainful employment, including agriculture, work for private enterprises. But there is still a long way to go until privatization is completed. So far, some 2,300 of the 8,450 former state-owned companies have found a new owner. In a so-called mass privatization, 470 firms are to be divided up into 16 or 17 investment funds, of which the population can obtain shares. Kaczmarek wants to complete the reprivatization of companies by the end of 1995. A law on returning possessions expropriated under the communist government is being worked out. According to Kaczmarek, 400,000 applications have been received--from a water mill to a textile factory. Claims amount to 30 billion German marks, Kaczmarek said.
