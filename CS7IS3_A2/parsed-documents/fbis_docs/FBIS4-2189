In recent years, the grain output in Guangdong has seen a decline due to a decrease of crop-growing area. As a result, the imbalance between grain supply and demand is worsening. Guangdong Provincial People's Congress promulgated a set of regulations on a minimum size for a protection zone of farmland, which stipulated that the total area of the farmland protection zone should be more than 2 million hectares. The provincial government also set a target of increasing the area of the farmland protection zone to more than 2.5 million hectares by the end of 1997. It stressed that the crop growing area, including the double cropping area, should be about 3.3 million hectares in the province and the annual grain output should be maintained at 17.5 million tons. Meanwhile, Guangdong Provincial Government and the government in some cities and counties will jointly invest in a grain development program for constructing 50 commodity grain bases in three years. Jiangmen city has increased more than 20 percent of investment in farming production and it has decided from this year on to allocate 2 million yuan annually to aid farm production.
