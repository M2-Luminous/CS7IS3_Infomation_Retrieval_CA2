FR941103-0-00147 FR941103-0-00018 Since hunting has been prohibited on Rock Lake NWR, deer from the surrounding area are drawn to the refuge during the State firearms deer season. Unfortunately, following the close of the deer season they do not return to the areas from which they came until the following spring. Heightened winter deer concentrations are destructive to refuge habitat and lead to serious depredation problems on neighboring private lands, particularly during severe winters. This refuge is the only large closed-to-hunting area for many miles. The primary objective of this hunt is to reduce the degradation of habitat used by nesting waterfowl and other wildlife, migratory wildlife, rare and endangered wildlife, and native (resident) wildlife. The hunt will also reduce depredation problems on privately owned land, redistribute deer, improve the health of the herd, reduce the risk of deer/vehicle collisions, and provide recreational opportunities. A designated area of the refuge will be opened to deer hunting only during the State firearms deer season and archery hunting will be open from the opening of the firearms season until the close of the State archery season. All state regulations pertaining to archery and firearms deer hunting will apply. Deer hunting will be monitored by refuge officers and State game wardens. Hunter numbers, number of deer taken, and refuge deer populations will be monitored. The refuge will be open to all holders of a North Dakota 2E deer hunting permit and all those with a valid North Dakota deer archery permit. The Service projects that 100&hyph;150 deer hunting visits will occur each year. If excessive harvest or winter mortality problems are evident, alternative management would be proposed. Opening the refuge to the hunting of deer has been found to be compatible in a separate compatibility determination. This determination noted also that most migratory birds will have migrated south prior to the opening of the State deer hunting season. A Section 7 evaluation pursuant to the Endangered Species Act was conducted and it was determined that the hunt is not likely to adversely affect any Federally listed or proposed for listing threatened or endangered species or their critical habitats. Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), an environmental assessment was made and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was made regarding the hunt. All neighbors and farm operators in the local area were contacted about the hunt and they concurred with the proposed hunt. The environmental assessment was prepared by the Devils Lake Wetland Management district and Wetland Habitat Office, Bismarck, North Dakota, and with the assistance of the North Dakota Game and Fish Department. As the deer hunt will be monitored cooperatively by refuge personnel and State game wardens, no special funding will be required to monitor and control the hunt. Refuge monitoring would be a collateral duty of certain refuge personnel. No special refuge permits will be required. Therefore, the Service has determined that there would be sufficient funds to administer the proposed hunt pursuant to the requirements of the Refuge Recreation Act. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements for part 32 are found in 50 CFR part 25 and have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1018&hyph;0014. The information is being collected to assist the Service in administering these programs in accordance with statutory authorities which require that recreational uses be compatible with the primary purposes for which the areas were established. The information requested in the application form is required to obtain a benefit. The public reporting burden for the application form is estimated to average six (6) minutes per response, including time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing the form. Direct comments on the burden estimate or any other aspect of this form to the Service Information Collection Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street, NW, MS 224 ARLSQ, Washington, DC 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1018&hyph;0014), Washington, DC 20503. Economic Effect This rulemaking was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. In addition, a review under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) has revealed that the rulemaking would not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities, which include businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. This rule would have minimal effect on such entities. Federalism This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
