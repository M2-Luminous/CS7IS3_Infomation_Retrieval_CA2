Yaroslavl Oblast, for example, has concluded treaties (mainly economic in nature) with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, individual regions of Turkey and Germany, and certain other foreign partners. Yaroslavl Oblast has signed a total of more than 20 such treaties. Tatarstan and Bashkiria have equally extensive international ties. Yakutia's trade and economic agreement with Ukraine, signed at the end of 1993, extends over five years and embraces a broad range of items. Yakutia reportedly plans to conclude an agreement with Japan and open a trade mission there. What is the significance of such large-scale treaty activity on the part of Federation members? Primarily it meets the needs of regions "neglected" by the federal authorities in their relations with other states. Some rules have gradually been elaborated governing the international activity of Federation components. For all their disparateness, they have quite a lot in common. First and foremost, Federation components should be guided by the principles and standards of international law and the international commitments of the Federation, they should operate within their constitutional authority and in agreement with federal executive authority, and they should refrain from encroaching on the sphere of diplomatic and consular rights. For us, however, international ties are a new venture both for republics and oblasts -- indeed for all 89 components of the Russian Federation. We are only just beginning to get familiar with this new kind of activity. The Russian Federation's components still have to learn the rules accepted throughout the world and make them tally with their own interests. The task is clearly no easy one: The overwhelming majority of components have neither the experience nor the trained cadres. Moreover, they do not have the legal guidelines to follow when embarking on a largely unknown path. But the problem is that the Russian Federation's components are unable to rely sufficiently on the existing Constitution when structuring their foreign activity, as the Constitution fails to mention the components' actual right to pursue international ties. This right is obliquely referred to in Article 72, where "the coordination of the international and foreign economic ties of Russian Federation components " falls within areas of joint jurisdiction. If we are talking about coordinating international ties, then the right to establish and develop them also exists. However, this sole provision cannot, naturally, regulate the entire large and complex system of international ties involving Russia's components. Consulting the Federation Treaty is of little avail in this regard either. The only additional information to be gleaned from it is that the components of the Russian Fedeartion are "autonomous parties in international and foreign economic ties." "Autonomous party in international ties".... The wording looks very impressive, but on closer scrutiny its content is completely unclear. What specifically can a Federation component to develop its international ties? How does its autonomy square with the extensive powers enjoyed by the Federation in the sphere of international relations? Are these powers retained by Federation components? Since all this is vaguely worded, it is not at all easy to identify the specific areas where Russian Federation components can operate as "autonomous participants in international ties." It is, of course, possible to cite the existing practice of certain republics and oblasts, but the question is whether this practice is congruous with the Constitution and existing legislation. In other words, there is a large legal vacuum today which offers scope for the most arbitrary interpretations and thereby generates conflicts, as it were, both inside and outside the Federation. The fact that the development of Russian Federation components' international ties seems to be allowed to go its own sweet way could have the most adverse consequences for both the durability of the Federation and the integrity of its external relations.
