In Spain, Oleg Davydov was a member of the delegation accompanying Boris Yeltsin during his official visit, and in Morocco he took part as an Russian observer in the concluding meeting of the Uruguay round of the negotiations within the framework of GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]. In Great Britain he conducted talks with his English colleagues and business circles, reports POSTFAKTUM. During his numerous meetings with foreign colleagues from Spain, Israel, Brazil, Uruguay, Great Britain and other countries, and with the business circles of Spain and Great Britain, Oleg Davydov called upon them to actively cooperate with Russia in trade as well as in economic investment. Recognizing the difficulties of work by foreign investors in Russia under conditions of a most difficult crisis, high inflation and, mainly, the absence of legislation to guarantee the effectiveness and ensure protection of foreign capital investments, Oleg Davydov noted that at the present time Russia is taking definite steps to stabilize the economy. Inflation has been reduced, although it has been impossible to overcome the inertia of economic decline. To support the continued movement of reforms, the government is developing proposals for creating beneficial conditions for foreign investors, specifically in the sphere of the light and food industry. To expand its foreign trade, Russia, according to Oleg Davydov, intends to bring its foreign trade legislation in line with the conditions of GATT, which it intends to join in the near future. For this purpose, there will be a gradual liberalization of foreign economic ties in accordance with the conditions of the transitional period. On the road to GATT, a reduction in export duties is envisioned, with their subsequent total repeal in the future. The list of goods subject to quotas and licensing is being reduced, certification of import goods has been undertaken and a system of certification of export products is being created, and the preferential financing of import is being repealed. Oleg Davydov stressed that Russia intends to adhere to the right to intellectual property in accordance with the principles of the Uruguay agreement. While speaking out in favor of a free and open Russian market, Russia will nevertheless implement a policy of rational protectionism, without violating GATT principles. Noting that British enterprises are most prepared for cooperation with Russia, Oleg Davydov called upon them to consider the fact that "in the next century Russia and China will define world economic development," reports POSTFAKTUM. Upon his return to Moscow, the minister will meet with harsh criticism, as expressed in the recommendations of the Duma, "On Foreign Economic Activity." Specifically, the Committee on Economic Policy headed by Davydov's former chief, Glazyev, is recommending to the president that the 12 presidential edicts on customs benefits be "brought into line with the legislation" (in essence, repealed). To the government it is recommending that it submit to the State Duma a draft of a federal program for the development of export; step up work on repayment of debts of foreign states to Russia; develop measures for preventing economic crimes in the sphere of foreign economic activity; introduce openness into the registration of exporters of strategically important raw material goods, and improve the system of management of foreign economic activity in the interests of national industry. For this purpose, it should examine the question of uniting the functions of the state administration in the sphere of foreign economic and industrial policy within the framework of a single department (ministry) on the basis of the MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations], Goskomprom [RF State Committee on Industrial Policy] and subdivisions of the Ministry of Economics.
