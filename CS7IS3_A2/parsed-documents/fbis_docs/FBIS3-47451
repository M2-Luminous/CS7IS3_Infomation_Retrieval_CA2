The request has been made by Charlene Barshevsky, deputy U.S. trade representative, to Masahito Tani, deputy minister of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry. "The United States is said to have not indicated the specific number of ground stations for the U.S.-made cellular phones" (says a source at the ministry), but there is a possibility that the United Stats will ask Japan to set numerical targets in the future. The Japanese Government is refusing the request, saying, "This is not an issue to be handled between the governments of the two countries but rather is one to be handled between the private sector companies of the two countries." The issue has existed since last December when the U.S. Trade Representative launched an investigation last December, claiming that "there is a possibility that Japan has not complied with an agreement on cellular phones which was concluded between Japan and the United States in December 1989" and dropping hints about sanctions against Japan in accordance with the Omnibus Trade Act. The results of the investigation will be released on 15 February. The main point of the Japan-U.S. agreement on cellular phones is that Japan will permit Motorola-style cellular phones to operate in the Tokyo area and in Japan's centers of population by allotting new frequencies to the phones. In complying with the agreement, the JMCC has begun a Motorola-style cellular phone service in addition to the conventional-style cellular phone service provided by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). The Motorola-style cellular phone service covers smaller areas than the NTT-style cellular phone service because of the difference in the number of ground stations for the two cellular phone services. For this reason, about 300,000 cars subscribe to the NTT-style cellular phone service, whereas about 10,000 cars subscribe to the Motorola-style cellular phone service. This unequal arrangement has triggered complaints by the United States. According to the JMCC, the number of ground stations for the Motorola-style cellular phone service will be increased to 190 by April, but this figure is less than half of 430 ground stations serving the NTT-style cellular phone service. The JMCC has announced plans to increase the number of ground stations for the Motorola-style cellular phone service after April by 100 over the next two years. According to the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, the U.S. Government has yet to express its satisfaction with the figure. Motorola said, "At the moment, we decline to make any comment, but we intend to observe how the governments of the two countries will negotiate on the issue."
