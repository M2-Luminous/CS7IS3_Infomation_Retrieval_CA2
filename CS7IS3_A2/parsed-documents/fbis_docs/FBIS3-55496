It is already known that the U.S. President's visit to Russia and his talks with Boris Yeltsin are scheduled for January 12-15. The meeting between the three presidents is expected to take place in Moscow on January 14th. As a senior official from Russia's Foreign Ministry told INTERFAX, Leonid Kravchuk's arrival in Moscow became possible thanks to the progress reached at trilateral Russian-American-Ukrainian consultations in Washington, where the problem of nuclear arms deployed on Ukrainian soil was under discussion. "In the Russian capital, Kravchuk will evidently reaffirm all commitments concerning nuclear weapons made by Ukraine earlier," the Russian diplomat said. This involves the START-I treaty and the Lisbon Protocol to it, he explained. As it is known, last November Ukraine's parliament ratified the treaty with numerous reservations. As for the Lisbon Protocol, it was ratified with the exception of Article 5, which guarantees Ukraine's joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a denuclearized state. "The extremely negative reaction" displayed by the world community, above all by Russia and the U.S., was understood by Leonid Kravchuk, who announced his intention to submit the START-I treaty for ratification to Ukraine's new parliament, which is to be elected on March 27th, the diplomat said. INTERFAX's source described the allegations that the U.S. President might make changes in the plans for his European tour in order to visit Kiev as "unfounded." "The meeting to be held by the three presidents in Moscow makes Bill Clinton's trip to Kiev pointless," he said. According to him, the three presidents' meeting in Moscow will evidently result in some document, possibly a declaration, in which the stands taken by the three sides and Ukraine's commitments will be clearly stated. As the diplomat said, one more declaration -- on the outcome of the Russian-American summit -- is expected to be adopted in Moscow. "This will be a general document reflecting the present state of bilateral relations," he said. "In addition, the head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher will sign on behalf of their countries a number of `routine' agreements, in particular on air transportation." According to INTERFAX's source, the Russian-American talks, both bilateral and otherwise, will be held in the Kremlin. However, some meetings might take place at one of President Yeltsin's out-of-town residences, he conceded. At the request of the American side, a meeting with the Russian public has been included in the already coordinated program for President Clinton's visit to Moscow, the diplomat noted. "On January 14, the American president will address Russian journalists and the public in one of Ostankino's television studios. Evidently, this event will be presented live," he said.
