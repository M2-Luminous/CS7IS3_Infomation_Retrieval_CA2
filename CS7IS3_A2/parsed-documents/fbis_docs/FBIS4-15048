Many problems caused by the armed confrontation will have no solution without these conditions, he added. Bearing in mind some unclear mass media reports, Karasin specified the Russian concept of Karabakh settlement and said the second stage of the settlement shall include troops pullback from the territories occupied in combat operations, resumption of the functioning of communications and the return of refugee to places of their permanent residence. Political negotiations on the legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh will be expedient only at the third stage and under more favourable conditions, stressed Karasin. He said this idea is supported by all the conflicting sides, who "think that the Karabakh future status should be established on a compromise basis through negotiations".
