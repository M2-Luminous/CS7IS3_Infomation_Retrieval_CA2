With a wild mixture of fiscal programs and promises, the SPD is writing the population "a wealth of unsecured blank checks." Enforcing the 20 expenditure measures contained in the SPD program would increase public debts to a record high. Tax increases would be accordingly large. Under the SPD's monetary guidelines, people earning over 4,000 German marks [DM] net per month -- this includes qualified workers -- would have to expect a higher tax burden. Waigel called the tax increases on higher assets a "job creation program for Monaco, Liechtenstein, and certain parts of Switzerland." The figures published imply that the levy on property would increase six-fold, which would cause a large amount of mobile capital to flow abroad. The minister also criticized the SPD's plan to introduce an "ecological tax reform," which should levy the incurred costs on the given means of transport. In Waigel's view this would increase gasoline prices to DM4 to DM5. The SPD's overall concept leads to "a fiscal and economic fumble." According to AFP, the Free Democratic Party of Germany's [FDP] economic expert, Otto Graf Lambsdorff, speaking on RTL television, accused the SPD of a "high degree of negligence." "This is an incredible policy, thoughtless and unprofessional." The Social Democrats "cannot handle money, nor can Mr. Scharping." The chairman of the German Employees' Union, Roland Issen, demanded that the SPD increase the income level for the supplementary tax to DM80,000 for single people and DM160,000 for married couples. A ceiling of DM60,000/120,000, "still hits the majority of average income earners in the country." According to Issen, "these are net incomes in the DM3,200 to DM3,500 range." In addition to a supplementary tax, labor and employment policy must be financed "through a general labor market levy" to be paid for by everyone. The German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) estimates that the government's tax plans -- a 7.5-percent solidarity surcharge as of 1 January 1995, payable by everyone -- would be a heavier burden on the economy than the 10-percent supplementary tax on gross incomes over DM60,000/120,000 envisaged by the SPD. According to ASSOCIATED PRESS, Dieter Teichmann, the DIW's fiscal policy expert, told the NEUE PRESSE in Hannover: "If the lower incomes are exempted from the levy, as suggested by the SPD, this will have a positive effect, because those earning lower incomes consume comparatively much and save little." This means that the loss in private consumption would be lower with the SPD model than with the government's solidarity surcharge, even if the SPD wanted to achieve the same revenue of DM23 billion to DM25 billion. Only people liable to taxes on salaries and wages, would keep DM14 billion more than under the government's model. Ruediger Pohl, president of the Institute for Economic Research in Halle, however, warned against introducing a supplementary tax and demanded a cut in expenditure instead of an increase in tax progression. Pohl told the Cologne EXPRESS: "If a supplementary tax is levied on those earning higher incomes, this will primarily have a negative effect on the economy. The new debate on taxes does not only make the citizens feel insecure, but it also unnerves businessmen." With tax progression increasing to such an extent, investors will consider investing in financial assets abroad instead of buying machinery in Germany. This will get worse if the income limit for the supplementary tax on single people is increased to DM60,000 or more. The former member of the "Wise Men of Economics" is basically opposed to a tax increase, but he thinks that if taxes must be used to finance public deficits, the burden should be widely spread, also including lower incomes -- as the solidarity surcharge model suggests.
