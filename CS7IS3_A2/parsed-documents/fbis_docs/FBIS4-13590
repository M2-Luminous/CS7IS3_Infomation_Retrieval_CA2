FBIS4-13590 "drnes077_o_94005" FBIS-NES-94-077 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 SYRIA `Game' of Israeli Working Papers Called `New Pretext' `Game' of Israeli Working Papers Called `New Pretext' JN1804073194 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0450 GMT 18 Apr 94 JN1804073194 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] TISHRIN comments on the peace process and Israel's unserious approach toward this process. The paper emphasizes that Syria is serious about the peace process and adds: Syria presented a document of principles during the sixth round of the Washington talks, which was hailed by the international community as a balanced, objective paper that lays the foundations of firm peace in the region. The paper speaks about Israel's refusal to discuss the sixth item of the paper of principles on the exchange of land for peace and the return of the Golan. Israel inundated the Washington talks with an endless series of security conditions and pretexts, as if the Washington talks were held to provide security for Israel alone. TISHRIN notes the settlement paper reported by Israel radio, stressing that the paper does not refer to Israel's willingness to withdraw fully from the Golan. The Israeli paper revolves around the achievement of great gains, such as relations, normalization and security arrangements. This confirms that there is no change in the Israeli position and that the approach of procrastination and maneuvering is still the same. TISHRIN adds: Obviously, the game of the Israeli working papers -- one for the Army and another for the Foreign Ministry -- is only a new pretext to escape the obligations of the peace process, primarily withdrawal from the Golan and the rest of the occupied territories. The Washington talks have extensively addressed all items related to peace, particularly security arrangements. However, the Israeli side has repeatedly refused to discuss the question of withdrawal. Had Israel truly wanted peace, the question would not have taken all these discussions, deliberations, and working papers. Security Council resolutions, the Madrid conference foundations, and the U.S. initiative all stem from the exchange of land for peace. TISHRIN concludes by reasserting that Syria is not willing to relinquish an inch of its territory or any Arab right. Syria is also not willing to exchange facts for illusions and to replace the Washington talks and the Madrid conference foundations by secret talks whose only aim is to circumvent the Security Council resolutions. Under the headline "Rejected Call," AL-BA'TH says: News reports speak once again about an upcoming tour to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher late this month. Israel is also talking about what it called two papers on a settlement with Syria. The head of its government, Rabin, stressed the need for secret talks that would pave the way for the settlement. AL-BA'TH adds: We can draw several conclusions in this regard, primarily the return of the U.S. Administration to the Middle East arena in a fresh bid to advance peace efforts by fixing a date for resuming bilateral talks. Before moving on to the Israeli position, we must wonder how far Christopher will go in his upcoming tour. Will he view Rabin's statements as something new? AL-BA'TH concludes: It is too early to pass judgment in this regard, since this depends on the way the U.S. secretary will deal with the Israeli government.
