[passage omitted] Many nonaligned and African nations have criticized this decision. The Rwandan ambassador to the United Nations wondered why the United Nations was cutting back on its presence in Rwanda while in other difficult situations, like Bosnia, it was bolstering its forces up to 30,000 men. We spoke earlier to Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, Burundi's interim president, who deplored the departure of the UN peacekeepers from Rwanda and reminded the United Nations that human rights knows no race. [passage omitted] Many people feel that the international community is abandoning the Rwandans to their fate. A moment ago, we asked French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe if the West, and France in particular, had decided to abandon Rwanda: [Begin Juppe recording] Not at all. You know that diplomatic efforts are under way, particularly in Uganda, to restart the Arusha process; in other words, to work toward reconciliation between the various parties and toward setting up a government that can share power. A project has been drawn up with this in mind. It was necessary to adjust the strength of the UN force in Rwanda, UNAMIR, in order to take account of the situation on the ground. France was insistent that UN activity should not be interrupted, but it has been suspended. It will be able to resume once we have moved forward in talks about a cease-fire and a return to the Arusha accords. [end recording]
