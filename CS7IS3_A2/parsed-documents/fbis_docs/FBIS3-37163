It is likely to take place in late February or early March, depending on the president's working schedule. This was one of the main upshots of the conversation that Kostikov had today with editors in chief of leading publications. In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the president's press secretary clarified that the meeting was called for by the growing concern of the media over "the abnormal situation in the press market". "Newspapers are going bankrupt, and complex contradictions have emerged between the striving of newspapers to be independent and the understanding of the fact that the press will not survive without assistance from the state", he said. According to Kostikov, "it is necessary to find a precise combination of state aid to the press without infringing upon glasnost". The head of state's press secretary added that the purpose of the meeting is to obtain first-hand, critical information that should be made known to the Russian Federation president.
