The reasons for their 30-nation agression against Iraq are no longer concealed from anyone. Indeed, they themselves have taken to bragging about it after having enslaved some Arab rulers and exploited Arab resources against Arab interests. No honest Arab can have the slightest doubts that America, Britain, and Ziionism are implementing a plan to humiliate the Arabs and deprive them of their rights and resources, transforming them into a conduit for American, British, and Zionist interests. As a start, America has succeeded in silencing some Arab rulers and in exploiting others to destroy the bulwark and hope of the Arabs: Iraq. They have left Iraq and the people of Iraq to pay the price alone, to the accompaniment of traitorous Arab instigation, an indifferent Arab stance, and a hateful international one. This, while Iraq was placing and continues to place Arab interests above all its own interests. The leader, Saddam Husayn, had previously warned the Arabs against dangerous blunders toward which they were being pushed by the American and British leaderships. America is injecting them with a fatal cancer in order to kill their national ambitions and expectations in the interests of "Israel," its ambitions and greed for Arab wealth and lands. Iraq pointed this out a long time ago, before the 30-nation aggression against it. The British station (BBC) broadcast a discussion between two political personalities, American and French. The first, Graham Fuller is one of the chief political analysts at the RAND Corporation in Washington. He had previously worked in the same capacity in the Middle East section of the Central Intelligence Agency. The second, Paul Balta [name as transliterated], is the director of the Center for the Study of the Contemporary Middle East at the New University of the Sorbonne. They admit in their discussion that the main purpose for the continuation of the embargo is to serve American, British, and Zionist strategic interests in the region. This, in spite of their admission that Iraq has implemented the resolutions of the United Nations. Fuller, the American expert, says: "From an official point of view, we want the implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations. From an unofficial point of view, we want to overturn the government in Iraq." Balta, the French expert, interjects to introduce additional American aims: "America also wants to keep up the pressure on Iraq as long as there is no fundamental progress in the "Arab-Israeli peace talks," as Iraq represents the greatest threat to "Israel" in the region. There are also the current economic and financial difficulties of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, America's most important ally in the region. If Iraq were to enter the oil market, the Saudi economy would collapse." The French expert adds: "When they speak of human rights in Iraq, they do so for local consumption. I am in complete agreement that the international community itself is violating the rights of Iraqi human beings." Explaining the reasons for France's participation in the aggression against Iraq, the French expert said: "Frankly, President Mitterrand was expecting political and economic benefits like the possibility of our participation in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations for peace and the increase in the share of French companies in the petroleum and arms industries. However, it now seems to me that France has met with frustration. My country has been determined for some weeks to serve its own interests first." The American and French experts admit that double standards and positions are being applied to Iraq in the West, especially in America. This is what Iraq had exposed before their 30-fold aggression.
