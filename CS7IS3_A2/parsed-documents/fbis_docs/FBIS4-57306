FBIS4-57306 "drlat096_t_94010" FBIS-LAT-94-096 Daily Report 16 May 1994 Venezuela Businessmen Pleased With G-3 Trade Agreement Businessmen Pleased With G-3 Trade Agreement PA1705024994 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0102 GMT 16 May 94 PA1705024994 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Caracas, 15 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Fedecamaras) said today it is pleased with the conclusion of the negotiations that will lead to the signing of a free trade agreement by the Group of Three (G-3). Edgar Romero Navas, president of Fedecamaras, the country's top business organization, told NOTIMEX that the G-3 will contribute to the creation of a single vigorous integration axis in Latin America. The G-3, which comprises Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia, concluded last Thursday negotiations over a broad trade agreement, which will potentially benefit a population of nearly 140 million people. Nava added that the implementation of the G-3 agreement will allow other countries to make trade connections with the Andean Pact and tighten relations with countries such as Chile, which has reached agreements with Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico. The trade relations, which will be in full gear after the agreement is signed by the presidents of the three countries and ratified by their respective congresses, represent one third of the economies of Latin America and the Caribbean. Industrialists from the chemical and textile sectors, who were opposed to the original draft of the agreement and who in fact prolonged the technical negotiations, were also pleased with the terms of the final agreement reached by the ministers of the three countries. Luis Brizuela from the textile sector and Pedro Carmona from the chemical industry sector said during telephone interviews that new opportunities are opening up which should be explored by all Venezuelan industrialists. Carmona said the agreements reached were well programmed because even though rigid norms were accepted for the chemical industry sector, the agreement to supervise the supply situation by means of the Regional Supply Committee, was the most viable. The G-3 will generate a GDP that will be nearly 35 percent of the region's total and its exports of goods and services represent more than 40 percent of the region's total exports. The G-3 imports represent nearly 45 percent of the total, a demand that will bring opportunities for each of the three countries that will sign the agreement on 15 June in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. Carmona said the chemical industry sector came up with a formula to deal with the fundamental aspects of supply. In the textile industry sector, the problem will be prolonged for only two more years. Brizuela indicated that the decision to exclude textile products from the deregulation program was the least of the evils that could be chosen in view of the danger of the negotiations falling apart.
