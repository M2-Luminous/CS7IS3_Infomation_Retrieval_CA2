FR941020-0-00026 FR941020-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 30 CFR Part 914 Indiana Regulatory Program AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior. ACTION: Final rule; approval of amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is approving, with an exception, a proposed amendment to the Indiana permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the Indiana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment is a continuation of program amendment # 93&hyph;2 and consists of revisions to Indiana's Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Rules concerning show cause orders and adjudicative proceedings for the suspension and revocation of permits. The amendment is intended to revise the Indiana program to be consistent with SMCRA and the corresponding Federal regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Roger W. Calhoun, Director, Indianapolis Field Office, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Minton-Capehart Federal Building, 575 North Pennsylvania Street, Room 301, Indianapolis, IN 46204, Telephone (317) 226&hyph;6166. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background on the Indiana Program. II. Submission of the Amendment. III. Director's Findings. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments. V. Director's Decision. VI. Procedural Determinations. I. Background on the Indiana Program On July 29, 1982, the Indiana program was made effective by the conditional approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Information pertinent to the general background on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval of the Indiana program can be found in the July 26, 1982 Federal Register (47 FR 32107). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at 30 CFR 914.10, 914.15, and 914.16. II. Submission of the Amendment By letter dated June 15, 1994 (Administrative Record No. IND&hyph;1374), Indiana submitted the final-adopted language of program amendment # 93&hyph;2 concerning show cause orders and adjudicative proceedings for the suspension or revocation of permits. OSM published a final rule notice approving, with an exception, Indiana's program amendment # 93&hyph;2 on November 18, 1993 (58 FR 60783). In that notice, OSM found that a previously imposed required amendment, cited at 30 CFR 914.16(d), could not be removed. Indiana's submittal of the final-adopted language of amendment # 93&hyph;2 contains Indiana's response to the required program amendment at 30 CFR 914.16(d) and other changes made by Indiana. Since Indiana's final adoption of amendment # 93&hyph;2 occurred after OSM published its approval of # 93&hyph;2, any changes Indiana made to the language approved by OSM on November 18, 1993, must be considered by OSM to be the subject of a new proposed amendment. OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the July 15, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 36114), and, in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The comment period closed on August 15, 1994.
