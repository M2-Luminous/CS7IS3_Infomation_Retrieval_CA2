[passage omitted] The Government has so far awarded 34 contracts worth a total of $31.4 billion. This represents 78 percent of the value of government airport core project contracts. It is understood all works under the 34 contracts will be completed before the 1997 changeover, saving them from the impact from the declaration. The immediate victims are expected to be the franchises crucial to running the Chek Lap Kok facility, such as baggage and cargo handling, catering, air fuel supply and aircraft maintenance. The Airport Corporation Bill, which is yet to be approved by the Legislative Council, would be invalidated in 1997. Even if the management corporation was approved and set up it could be dissolved. Legislators last night accused the Chinese Government of reacting irrationally and dealing a blow to Hong Kong people's confidence. They warned that due consideration should be given to the possible impact on the community. The Government reacted more cautiously, saying only that it was still studying the XINHUA statement. A spokesman said: "But meanwhile we must stress again that we have complied fully with the Memorandum of Understanding on the Airport Core Programme. "The position is that we are awaiting a response from the Chinese side to our formal request for an early meeting of the Airport Committee, which we hope will resolve outstanding issues on the financing of the airport and the airport railway."
