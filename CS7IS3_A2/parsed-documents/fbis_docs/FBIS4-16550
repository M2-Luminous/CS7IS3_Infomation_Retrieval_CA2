Churkin said that this would involve the withdrawal of heavy artillery from the 20-kilometer security zone around the city and deployment of U.N. peace-keeping troops in the region. "This is the only way out of the current chaos," he said. Bosnia-Herzegovina's leaders Alija Izetbegovic and Haris Silajdzic demanded at a meeting with U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi guarantees of immediate cease-fire around Gorazde. Otherwise Akashi should guarantee that Serb positions will be subjected to "energetic air strikes," Izetbegovic said.
