The inscriptions and names of places in the Albanian language are disappearing with each passing day. Albanian toponymy is in the objective of destruction and with thus eliminating the traces of civilization and the presence of the Albanians as well. Wherever you are in Ulqin, you could hardly understand where you are. Everywhere you can read ULCINJ, according to a report in RILINDJA. The Albanian names of the places have been changed in order to eliminate the Albanian identity of the toponymy. Changes of the pure Albanian names have been also made in the official administration and they are now being applied in the schools and even in the diplomas of the Albanian students who have attended classes in Albanian schools.
