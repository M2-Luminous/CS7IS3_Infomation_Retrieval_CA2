Jason Hu, the director-general of the Government Information Office, said that because many questions regarding the case remain unresolved, it is "an unsettled case with the truth behind it having no chance of being uncovered." After a brief hearing on Sunday affirming the sentence of the three men convicted for the murders, the men were executed. "The government is extremely disappointed at the result," Hu said while meeting a group of journalists from Hong Kong. He said that Beijing cannot call an end to the case because two important issues remain unresolved -- compensation for the relatives of the victims and how the mainland will ensure the future safety of Taiwan tourists in the mainland. He accused Beijing of trying to cover up the truth behind the killings not long after the crime occurred, thus destroying the credibility of its later explanation. Hu advised Beijing that honesty is the best policy. Hu said that exchanges between the two sides should be continued even though the incident has inflicted grave damage to cross-strait relations.
