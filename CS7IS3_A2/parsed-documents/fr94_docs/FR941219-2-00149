FR941219-2-00149 FR941219-2-00079 15. Because state premium taxes are deductible when computing federal income taxes, Providentmutual does not incur incremental income tax when it passes on state premium taxes to contract owners. In contrast, federal income taxes are not tax-deductible when computing Providentmutual's federal income taxes. Therefore, to offset fully the impact of Section 848, Providentmutual must impose an additional charge that would make it whole not only for the $90.87 additional tax burden attributable to Section 848, but also for the tax on the additional $90.87 itself. This additional charge can be computed by dividing $90.87 by the complement of the 35 percent federal corporate income taxe rate ( i.e., 65 percent), resulting in an additional charge of $139.80 for each $10,000 of net premiums, or 1.40 percent of net premiums. 16. Tax deductions are of value to Providentmutual only to the extent that it has sufficient gross income to fully utilize the deductions. Based on its prior experience, Providentmutual submits that it can reasonably expect to have sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize all deferred acquisition cost deductions. 17. Providentmutual submits that a charge of 1.25 percent of premium payments would reimburse it for the impact of Section 848 (as currently written) on its federal tax liabilities. Providentmutual represents that a 1.25 percent charge is reasonably related to its increased tax burden under Section 848, taking into account the benefit to Providentmutual of the amortization permitted by Section 848, and the use by Providentmutual of a 9.3 percent discount rate in computing the future deductions resulting from such amortization, such rate being the equivalent of Providentmutual's cost of capital. 18. Providentmutual asserts that it would have to increase the 1.25 percent charge if future changes in, or interpretations of, Section 848 or any successor provision result in a further increased tax burden resulting from the receipt of premiums. Such an increase could result from a change in the corporate tax rate, a change in the 7.7 percent figure, or a change in the amortization period. The Contract and any future contracts issued by Providentmutual will reserve the right to increase or decrease the 1.25 percent charge in response to future changes in, or interpretations of, Section 848 or any successor provision that increase or decrease Providentmutual's tax burden. Applicant's Legal Analysis 1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in relevant part, that the Commission, by order upon application, may exempt any person, security or transaction (or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions) from provisions of the 1940 Act or any rules thereunder, if and to the extent that the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 2. Applicants request an order of the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, exempting them from the provisions of Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act and Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4)(v) thereunder to the extent necessary to permit Applicants to deduct from premium payments received in connection with the Contracts and any future contracts an amount that is reasonable in relation to Providentmutual's increased federal tax burden created by its receipt of such premium payments. The deduction would not be treated as sales load. A. Relief From Provisions of Section 27(c)(2) and Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4)(v) 1. Section 2(a)(35) of the 1940 Act defines ``sales load'' as the difference between the price of a security offered to the public and that portion of the proceeds from its sale which is received and invested or held for investment by the issuer (or in the case of a unit investment trust, by the depositor or trustee), less any portion of such difference deducted for trustees's or custodian's fees, insurance premiums, issue taxes, or administrative expenses or fees which are not properly chargeable to sales or promotional activities. 2. Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits a registered investment company or a depositor or underwriter for such company from making any deduction from purchase payments made under periodic payment plan certificates other than a deduction for sales load. Sections 27(a) (1) and 27(h)(1) of the 1940 Act, in effect, limit sales loads on periodic payment plan certificates to 9 percent of total payments. 3. Paragraph (a) of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) requires that a separate account (such as the Account or any future accounts) that issues flexible premium variable life insurance contracts, its principal underwriter and its depositor, comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act and rules thereunder applicable to a registered investment company issuing periodic payment plan certificates. 4. Paragraph (b) of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) provides numerous limited conditional exemptions from most such provisions and rules in connection with the offer, sale and administration of flexible premium variable life insurance contracts. For example, among other things, Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(iii)(E) provides relief from Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of certain charges other than sales load, including ``[t]he deduction of premium or other taxes imposed by any state or other governmental entity.'' Applicants request the relief from Section 27(c)(2) sought in this application only to preclude the possibility that a charge related to the increased burden resulting from Section 848 of the Code is not covered by the exemption provided by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(iii)(E). Applicants submit that the public policy reasons underlying Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(iii)(E) provide support for the exemption from Section 27(c)(2) requested herein. In this regard, Applicants note that the Commission previously has issued orders granting substantially similar relief to that requested by Applicants, including an order to Providentmutual's corporate parent under nearly identical circumstances. 2 2 Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company, Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19552 (July 1, 1993) and 19519 (June 4, 1993). 5. Applicants represent that the requested exemption is necessary if they are to rely on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(i) under the 1940 Act, which provides critical exemptions from Sections 27(a)(1) and 27(h)(1) thereof. Applicants note that issuers and their affiliates may rely on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(i) only if they meet its alternative limits that apply to ``sales load,'' as defined in rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4). Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4) defines ``sales load'' during a contract period as the excess of any payments made during that period over certain specified charges and adjustments, including a deduction for and approximately equal to state premium taxes. Applicants represent that a ``tax burden charge'' such as the one Providentmutual proposes to deduct does not fall squarely into any of the itemized categories of charges or adjustments. Applicants note that a literal reading of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4) arguably does not exclude such a ``tax burden charge'' from sales load.
