Domozhirov: "The Inspectors' Landing Party"] [Text] In the last 10 days of March, A. Koryachkin, chief of the Kemerovo Railroad, signed an order in accordance with the results of a traffic safety inspection. It was conducted by a group of specialists headed by Russian Deputy Minister of Railways Yu. Gerasimov I will stipulate right away that the inspection had been planned, and at first glance, nothing had foreshadowed any particular trouble. After all, according to results of work in the preceding quarter, the ministry collegium and the trade union central committee had awarded the Kemerovo Railroad first place in the system, providing it with a monetary bonus as incentive. But overall evaluation of economic activity in a specific period is one thing and meticulous analysis of one aspect of the production process is a completely different matter. But the point is not in the method of inspection, of course. Serious miscalculations in safety matters were actually made on the Kemerovo Railroad. The commission checking implementation of Order No. 1Ts of 8 January 1994 issued by the minister of railways "On measures to provide for traffic safety in railroad transport" came to the conclusion: this important work has deteriorated on the Kemerovo Railroad in recent years, resulting in a number of wrecks and accidents and an increase in the number of cases involving defective items. The managers of certain subunits began to embellish their reporting instead of increasing their demands on subordinates and themselves. In particular, more than 10 (!) cases of rolling stock derailment and collisions during switching were not taken into account in a 2-month period this year at the Kemerovo-Sortirovochnoye station. In the 37-page formal document on the 3-week inspection compiled by B. Bogomolov, S. Nikishin, and A. Svetozarskiy, the chief inspectors of the TsRB [possibly: Central Inspection Bureau], the main cause of all the violations was a decline in labor and performance discipline, as well as the reduced demand for it. For example, 269 persons were absent from work in the Kemerovo Subdivision last year, but only 66 were fired for absenteeism. In the Topki Subdivision, the number of absentees during the same period increased by 1.5 times as many, but fewer persons were dismissed than in the previous year, 1992. The commission revealed numerous cases in which disciplinary misdemeanors were not investigated expeditiously. After this, we should not be surprised by the irresponsibility of ordinary production workers. There is no reason to list the negative facts which appeared in the inspection document, for they have already been given a principled and quite strict assessment. I will dwell on the analysis conducted by Deputy Minister Yu. Gerasimov. The impartial discussion which took up an entire work day proved to be instructive and certainly will be of value to production commanders. Regardless of the persuasiveness of the commission's criticism, not all the railroad's subdivision managers were imbued with personal responsibility for the safety conditions. Some attempted to turn the discussion into a calm channel, as if nothing serious had taken place. Others were inclined to place the blame on miscalculations by someone else, but not on themselves. As an example, this position was taken by V. Avdonin, chief of the Kemerovo-Sortirovochnoye station, who "substituted" employees of the railroad's inspection service who allegedly interpret individual violations arbitrarily. They hold a similar point of view in the Novokuznetsk Division, where they sometimes describe the escape of railcars during switching in milder terms than they should. What can be said in this regard? In fact, there are certain contradictions between the normative documents and directives from sector headquarters. But they are not sufficiently important to be covered up. The striving to escape personal responsibility at any price to smooth over the contradictions in this situation was so inappropriate that the deputy minister removed A. Avdonin as station manager on the spot. It seemed to me that this was the culminating moment of the analysis, which was typical of the tense situation. Though several days afterward, through the railroad management's intercession, the dismissed employee was given the chance to put his place of work in order and to correct the procedure in working with categorized and hazardous freight from chemical enterprises in Kemerovo, for which Avdonin had been criticized. All services without exception were sharply criticized. I will name one of the most important ones--the lines service. Last year, passenger train No. 178 from Kislovodsk to Novokuznetsk was wrecked, railcars were derailed six times while they were in trains and 54 times during switching, all the fault of employees. Safety conditions were especially poor in the Topki, Kemerovo, and Polosukhinsk line subdivisions, which accounted for nearly half of the defective equipment in the 12 subdivisions of the lines service. During the course of comments by the main administration commission, a question was raised repeatedly about the unsatisfactory view held by the lines service and its subdivisions toward the directive of 18 March 1993 "On the introduction of permanent alternate lines and engineering structures." In conformity with the directive, it was planned to add 240 line inspectors promoted from the ranks of the best trained linemen. However, even now, a year later, the ministry's directive has not been fully implmented, which has substantially reduced the gain that had been planned. Of course, it is more complicated to resolve the problem of line personnel under conditions in Siberia than in regions with a favorable climate. The fact that workers in the industrial Kuzbass have a wide choice of work in their locations has a negative effect as well. However, all this should not relax the lines suprvisors, but make it incumbent on them to work more diligently on personnel training. The railcars service was the only one where the number of equipment breakdowns increased at an alarming rate in 1993; they included the following major defects: fractures in axle journals, wheels, and truck side-frames. Preparation of trains for a run shows practically no improvement, and flagrant violations of the rules were permitted in repairing automatic brakes and automatic coupling equipment. In the wheel and roller bearing shops, repair procedure is not being followed, and assembly and inspection of bearing boxes is performed manually. These shortcomings have not been corrected for a long period of time, and the commission proposed that the chief of the railroad reinforce the service's management with personnel for this reason. But take the signals and communications service. Commission members devoted their attention to the fact that equipment is being updated very slowly here. Obsolete systems of electrical centralization are being operated at 11 stations. Work to separate the power cables and the signal and blocking cables has not been performed at many ETs [electrical switch and signal centralization] stations. I would err against the truth if I limited a report on the analysis to only the critical observations. At the inspectors' recommendation, the chief of the railroad (more visible from the side, as they say!) expressed gratitude and awarded a bonus to leading employees who have been successful in resolving traffic safety problems. They include V. Sinitsyn, chief engineer of the Novokuznetsk Locomotive Depot, and L. Gulyakin, that depot's deputy chief; and T. Khadarin, inspector in the Novokuznetk Division, who was given particularly high praise by the deputy minister. Monetary incentives were awarded to A. Rossoshanskaya and R. Bauer, psychologists at the Novokuznetsk and Belovo locomotive depots; their work, which was inconspicuous at first glance, was put on an equal footing with the work of leading production employees. In the opinion of the main administration commission, the experience of the Kemerovo Railroad psychologists who distinguished themselves deserves every possible support and dissemination in the system, and as a correspondent, I will tell our newspaper's readers about this soon.
