The Foreign Ministry said that it should be clarified whether or not the spectrum analyzers claimed to have been exported by Japanese companies are items regulated by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls [Cocom], and that it could be possible that North Korea imported them as simple electronic products and used them as missile parts and ordered the embassy in Japan to investigate the truth.
