It is, therefore, expected that the IAEA's nuclear inspection team will visit North Korea to conduct inspections of the seven declared North Korean nuclear sites. However, the IAEA said that it has not yet been contacted by North Korea or the United States in connection with the inspection of the North Korean nuclear sites.
