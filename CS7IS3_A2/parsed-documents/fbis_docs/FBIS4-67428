Last Tuesday, the Indian Express frontpaged a major PTI [Press Trust of India] story from Washington reporting how CBS 60 Minutes (one of American TV's most viewed shows) had alleged that India runs the world's most unsafe nuclear plants without inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency while The Independent frontpaged, on the same day, a PTI report from Calcutta that Dr. P.K. Iyengar, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and Secretary, Department of Atomic Energy in the Government of India had won this year's Jawaharlah Nehru Birth Centenary Award for his contribution in the field of atomic energy! This is typical of India. Even as one of the world's most respected news programmes on television accuses us of the most shocking crime possible, of running the world's most contaminated and dangerous nuclear power plants, with radioactive leakages and inadequate safeguards to protect those who work there, we are busy handing over one of the country's most prestigious awards to the very person who must be held responsible for the crime. It is no use blaming CBS. The buyers for the `Foreign Hand' theory are a vanishing breed today. We are welcoming foreigners into India with open arms and we should know that this eventually means a more open society in which wrongdoing can no longer be brushed under the carpet. Not even when the Government does the house-cleaning. Dollars and the free information society come together and you cannot have one without the other. You cannot earn millions of dollars selling your carpets and, at the same time, hide the fact that your carpet industry criminally deploys child labour. You cannot welcome foreign tourists to your beach resorts and, at the same time, expect them to be blind to the fact that you are allowing hotel owners and rapacious commercial interests to encroach upon your beaches and destroy them. You cannot expect visitors to come to India and, at the same time, hide from them the fact that you run the cruelest and most filthy abattoirs in the world, which produce meat that only the most insensitive and barbaric people would eat without protest. More and more horror stories about our nuclear installations and environmental savagery are bound to hit the headlines worldwide and let us, instead of trying to brazenly lie our way through, confess to our crimes and set things right. There is enough time and opportunity. Let us change our attitudes towards crimes committed against nature and people. Let us force our government bodies to become more accountable. Research by some of India's finest journalists have revealed, for instance, the simple and inescapable fact that India's atomic energy programme has been a dismal failure. What is worse, it has spawned serious and long-term environmental problems and it is time to order an open audit of the money that has vanished into the programme and the enormous damage it has done to our environment and public health. Last month, The Sunday Observer (which has pursued the nuclear establishment over the past three years with single-minded zeal) revealed how contamination of soil, water, flora and marine organisms around our nuclear power plants have crossed emergency levels since a decade. Findings based on internal documents and public statements issued by the atomic energy authorities themselves reveal that hundreds of curies of the lethal, long-lived radio-active isotope Caesium-137 (along with many other radio-active species) are lying in public areas, just outside the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre [BARC]. This poisons underground water. It endangers the milk we get from cattle grazing in there. It contaminates marine life in the Thane creek and the fish and the crabs you eat have reached emergency radio-active levels as defined by bodies like the International Atomic Energy Agency and the International Commission for Radiation Protection, among others. It is not just the press that knows this. The officials know this. The government know this. And yet everyone digs his head into the sand, ostrich-like and pretends that the crimes will go away if we ignore them long enough. Meanwhile, workers in these unsafe nuclear plants, visitors and people living in the contaminated zones around them are risking fatal cancers and genetic disorders. All because a few people at the top are unconcerned about international safety standards and are busy wooing the political establishment to win awards and accolades at the cost of the nation. CBS 60 Minutes, reportedly, showed workers with burn marks and interviewed an American-trained Indian doctor who confirmed that due largely to radio-active contamination children are born in areas nearby without ears, with two thumbs and so on. At an international meet some time back, a "responsible scientist" from BARC had, in fact, revealed data to show that our nuclear power plants were discharging about a hundred times the expected safe levels of radio-activity in the environment. International experts were aghast and the organisation concerned wrote to the Government of India about the disastrous long-term consequences of this steady poisoning of the environment by our nuclear power stations. But more strange than this are some of the other games that BARC plays. Its senior most scientists, for instance, once connived to irradiate cheap diamonds to dangerous levels of radio-activity in the APSARA [expansion not given] reactor and peddled them at home and abroad as costly, natural "black" diamonds. While doing this, they were deliberately violating all safety procedures for tagging and shielding of radio-active sources leaving BARC. These irradiated stones were released for uncontrolled transactions in the diamond trade and the public would have never known, were it not for the vigilance of the press. When caught, senior BARC officials tried to pass the buck to each other. Finally, S.D. Soman confessed to The Sunday Observer correspondent that using radio-active materials for cosmetic purposes was proscribed under international standards. When called to Delhi to explain, Soman checked into Sion Hospital and did not emerge till the day of his retirement, after which he vanished overseas. Huge investments have been made in these power plants -- yielding puny returns. Our nukes, starting with the first two indigenous reactors at Narora, cost the nation a staggering Rs 800 crore. That is, Rs 2 crore per installed megawatt. As against this, a conventional thermal power station costs Rs 1 crore a megawatt! The nukes at Karakpur are estimated to cost even more -- Rs 2.5 crore per installed megawatt, at the last estimate. Newer nukes will cost around Rs 3 crore. This means, at a conservative estimate, our nukes at Narora, Karakpur, Kaiga and Rawatbhata will make us sink in over Rs 4000 crore into nuclear power, whereas we could have achieved the same capacity at much less than half the price (and, in fact, much faster) had we had gone the thermal way. The operating history of our plants is worse. The break even point for viability is 62 per cent capacity factor. Our new nukes do between 35 per cent to 40 per cent. So, by the Nuclear Power Corporation's own yardstick, their power production is a grossly losing venture. However, by sheer legerdemain, its manifest losses are shown as profits by treating government equity as an interest-free grant and by assigning subsidised costs to fuel, heavy water and other components made in DAE's [Department of Atomic Energy] establishments. Despite such creative accounting, NPC [Nuclear Power Corporation] manages to show a profit of only Rs 100 crore per year on an investment running into so many thousand crore! Were it not run on public money, it would have been forced to roll down its shutters a long time back. Even these creative profits come from the older reactors obtained from the USA (the Tarapur units) and Canada (the Rajasthan reactors) which, despite their vintage, continue to deliver cheaper and more reliable power than our indigenous white elephants. When these old units are phased out by the end of this decade, the financial picture will become even gloomier since we may have less effective capacity at that time than we have -- and this faltering uncertain output will account for less than 1 per cent of the national power generation! Compare this to the enormous damage done to public health and the environment and you will get a correct picture of what our nuclear power programme is all about! The Government has woken up by limiting resources for current projects and deferring funds for future ones. So the NPC is borrowing money from the market through bonds which have to be repaid soon -- and for which no sources of money are apparent. Even the debt burden of these bonds exceeds the yearly so-called profit of the Corporation. This is the typical picture of a bankrupt organisation, where liabilities exceed assets and the cost of debt servicing exceeds income. Isn't it time that someone called an end to this preposterous charade instead of allowing awards and accolades to be piled on to people who are earning India a bad name all over the world and running a dangerous and losing proposition under the pretence of leading India into a brave new hi-tech century? The only man who can dare to take on the mighty atomic energy establishment, which is a law unto itself, is Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. The question is: Will he do it?
