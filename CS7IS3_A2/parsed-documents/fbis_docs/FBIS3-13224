Mr. Purqorbani, Mr. Kiani, Mr. Zare' and Mr. Rasulnezhad, deputies from the cities of Kalibar, Falavarjan, Shiraz and Damavand and Firuzkuh gave pre-agenda speeches. Then the Majles took up its agenda, and we present the detailed proceedings below for our esteemed readers. Deputy Speaker's Remarks Dr. Hasan Rowhani, deputy speaker of the Majles, gave a short speech in honor of the joyous birth anniversary of the promoter of justice in the world and the savior of all the world's deprived and oppressed people, His Holiness the promised Mehdi (may God hasten his joyful advent). He said: There is no doubt that belief in Mehdi and expectation in its general sense is not only limited to Shi'ites, but may not even be limited to Muslims. In all those religions based on celestial truth, this belief has always been a very important factor for hope and action in important social affairs, and many important liberation movements have arisen from this excellent source. He also said: There is no doubt that the greatest problem facing human society today is oppression and the lack of or shortage of justice, the same thing that will bring about that holy man's righteous government. The deputy speaker added: In the traditions that have reached us from the exalted prophets and the imams (peace be upon them), one of the greatest goals in that holy man's uprising was justice and fairness. Unfortunately, in the course of history in past centuries through today, humanity is still suffering from the lack of justice and from oppression and extortion, even in new forms. The greatest celestial gift for all oppressed people is justice. There is no doubt that anticipation of that day has been and is our greatest asset, and all basic movements that have taken place in our society have always been affected by expectation. Khan'ali Purqorbani, Deputy From Kalibar The basic focus and the Muslim vice-regent's emphasis has been attention to the vulnerable classes in society and the nation's deprived areas. The first pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Purqorbani, deputy from Kalibar. He offered congratulations and felicitations on the birth anniversary of His Holiness Mehdi (may God hasten his joyful advent) and on the 15th anniversary of the triumph of the Islamic revolution. He discussed the fact that we are seeing the appearance and manifestation of Islamic movements and uprisings all over the world. During his talk he said: Based on Article 84 of the Constitution, you deputies have sworn before God and the nation that you are representatives of the entire nation and are responsible to the nation of Iran. Since you have been informed of the exalted leader's views concerning the Five-Year Plan and you know that the basic focus and main emphasis in the words of the vice-regent of the Muslims is securing social justice and attention to the vulnerable class of society and the nation's deprived areas, it is therefore just, before thinking about districts and provinces and working to insert budget rows and obtain credits for projects in your electoral districts, to consider God and earnestly avoid price increases, which have cast a shadow like a terrifying nightmare over the lives of the deprived and society's vulnerable classes, because the nation can never be summarized in the framework of a few cities or provinces. Continuing, he said: Although we are fully aware of the investments in all economic, cultural, development, defense, and welfare sectors in the framework of the First Five-Year Plan and in this regard outstanding successes have truly been gained by the people and the nation of Iran, we can never forget the great sector of people and regions in the rural areas and in the nation's border territories. The speaker also said: Of course, we have the confident hope that you respected deputies, with your God-pleasing work and your conscience as deputies, will fill these gaps of deprivation here and there in the budget and that in this regard my own electoral district will not be forgotten. The municipality of Kalibar is suffering increasing deprivation. It does not have even one prosperous area. Unfortunately, in the First Five-Year Plan it has not tasted prosperity. With a rural and urban population of 140,000, it does not have a single asphalt connective road or a single emergency hospital bed. Even the center of the municipality lacks potable water. Just as our forefathers left this world waiting for promises to be fulfilled, we also wait. He then discussed rural emigration, the abandonment of rural areas for prosperous cities and working in false jobs. Continuing, he asked the deputies and the respected government for help and called for special attention to the following: Expedited establishment and construction of the 96-bed Kalibar hospital, expedited road construction for Urdeh and Kalibar, water service for the municipality of Kalibar and its affiliated villages, commencement of work on the Khoda Afarin dam, the allocation of sufficient credit, and comprehensive support from the president of the republic's deprived areas office, which is the only supporter of the deprived areas. In conclusion, Purqorbani praised and thanked the minister of the reconstruction crusade, the governor-general of East Azarbaijan and other area officials for their attention to this deprived area. Hoseyn Kiani, Deputy From Falavarjan We Majles deputies must not allow something to become expensive at our hands. The next speaker was Kiani, deputy from Falavarjan. He offered congratulations and felicitations on the arrival of 15 Sha'ban [28 January] and the birth anniversary of the only savior of the world of humanity His Holiness the vice-regent and Imam of the age (may God hasten his joyful advent). He said: Throughout the implementation of the reconstruction, economic adjustment, social justice, unification of the foreign exchange rate and major investments for self-sufficiency, there were also shortcomings and mistakes, and it can be said that these are the cause of most of our current problems. We must not ignore this. Insufficient work, wasteful spending, disorganization, abuses, especially in contracts and domestic and foreign purchases, with direct selections and sales sometimes replacing competitive bidding, have caused delays in all projects, at rates several times higher than designated international prices. Therefore, what should be done about market stagnation, high prices, inflation, bankruptcy, poverty, homeless, unemployment, false employment, illicit incomes, usury, swindling, corruption, theft, addiction, pessimism about officials, disgust with the revolution and the government, suicide, family quarrels, increased divorce, murder and crowded prisons? Continuing, the speaker said: The Glorious Koran was revealed over a period of 23 years and its commands were gradually explained to the people. There is no reason for social justice and the government's programs to be implemented under pressure over a period of eight years, creating problems for the government itself, the people and the revolution. He also said: The president of the republic said: "I would like to do all the work during my presidency so the next president of the republic will have nothing to do." Dear brother Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, I say that if others endure this pressure and hardship, that is better than having all the people anxious and unhappy, with all this nation's work being done in the short period of eight years. It is better if we do some of it in later years, so we do not make the people so unhappy, anxious, and under pressure to survive. Kiani then said to the Majles deputies: Last year it was approved in this very Majles that the government would not make any thing expensive in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], and we saw that in violation of the law everything became expensive. Our people are truly suffering. We cannot tell that poor old man, the worker, the staff employee or the crippled and disabled old woman why a small amount of electrical power costs them 27,000 tomans, 15,000 tomans, and 30,000 tomans, or why other services are rendered to the people at high prices. Continuing, Kiani added: Dear brothers, last year we voted that prices should not be high, and they made them high. Woe be unto us this year if the Majles votes for high prices. I hope the brothers and sisters will note carefully that the government has now sent Note 25 to the Majles in order to be able to solve its own problems in this way. We must not do anything to cause all the discomfort and anxiety to be blamed on the Majles. Continuing his speech, he asked the deputies all to vote to eliminate Note 25. In conclusion he said: We must not allow the Majles to make anything expensive. Even if we do this, like it or not, the government will raise prices, but it will not be done by the Majles. Karim Zare', Deputy From Shiraz Human beings armed with the weapon of science and technology are the main agents in support of development. The third pre-agenda speaker was Zare', deputy from Shiraz. He offered congratulations and felicitations on the esteemed birth anniversary of His Holiness the Imam of the Age (peace be upon him). During his speech he condemned the crimes of the aggressor Serbs and he called upon all free people to criticize the United Nations and to awaken sleeping consciences for the defense of the oppressed Muslims of Bosnia and Hercegovina. He called on the Indian Government to end its oppression and aggression in Kashmir. Continuing, he then added: Human beings armed with the weapon of science and technology are the main agents in support of development. The speaker then asked that we find a way of continued education for all those who want to be equipped with the weapon of knowledge, education and technology, and who want to participate in the world of the 21st century, which is the century of the movement of minds. Continuing, he said: Today we see about 1.2 million people lining up for higher education. The first step is to reform higher education, meaning to expand the journeyman programs, which I have discussed previously in a project that received abundant approval from the deputies. In view of the limitations in the government budget for the expansion of higher education at this time and in view of the existing realities and shortages, provisions have been made for meeting the expenses of applicants to government and nongovernment institutions of higher education. Fortunately this motion is aimed at completing the motion approved by the Supreme Cultural Revolutionary Council and solving its main problem, which is securing a budget. Continuing, Zare' said: Another issue is the necessity to expand the expert guidance and doctoral programs, as well as the post-doctoral or post-specialist programs at the universities, or research centers must be established that have high academic ability and potential resources. He discussed the fact that the doctoral and post-doctoral programs cannot only make young researchers more practiced and experienced, but they can also procure employable research manpower for basic and applied research. Continuing his talk, Mr. Zare' issued the following memo concerning the problems in his electoral district: I ask all members of the society of deputies, Friday imams and governors to show more concern for the cultural, sports, development and civil backwardness in the province of Fars. He thanked the government for expediting the Shiraz-Esfahan railroad and for studying the Shiraz-Bushehr railroad, and he asked that measures be taken to deal with the deprivation in his electoral district. He also asked the minister of roads and transportation for help building the Shiraz-Esfahan freeway. He also called for the encouragement of cities, villages and bridges that make the production of strategic goods their first priority. He thanked the respected president of the Supreme Cultural Revolution Council and its members for confirming the part-time teaching system at the Free Islamic University. At the end of his speech he also asked the minister of culture and higher education and the minister of health care, treatment and medical education to give more spiritual support to nongovernment and nonprofit universities. Seyyed Ahmad Rasulinezhad, Deputy From Damavand And Firuzkuh The reason some of the things we say are not heard and the people do not accept and believe them is that they do not see anything in practice. The final pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Rasulinezhad, deputy from Damavand and Firuzkuh. He discussed the dangers of influence by foreigners and agents who have sold out through those dependent on personalities and officials. He said: The enemies of the Islamic revolution, who have given up gaining influence with top officials and government officials, are trying, with the help of their agents, to find their way into the gentlemen's homes. Our late Imam said: "Keep watch over your homes." This remark was not addressed just to one person. This was addressed to everyone, to us deputies, to the executive power, to the judiciary and in two words, to the army and the nation. He added: The question is, with whom do our children, those close to us and our relatives spend their time, where do they go and for what? Who plans the domestic and foreign trips, and who goes with them? It is very important to know who the consultants are and with whom they consult. How often in the future someone will commit a crime, make a mistake and commit an abuse, but due to his friends and colleagues and sometimes because he is presented as an insider, he will be freed from the clutches of justice and the trial. He also discussed the tendency towards ostentation. He said: Among the dangers of the tendency towards ostentation is taking fancy and leisurely trips with people who live in comfort, are without religion and do not live simply. While some people are living in poverty and indigence, we are seeking to create a fancy and comfortable life. We know that those who have professed faith in the mission of the Prophet of God and who have become Muslims did so through the work of the Prophet of Islam. What they heard from him they also saw in his work and behavior. The reason some of the things we say are not heard and the people do not accept and believe them is that they do not see anything in practice. The fact that the remarks by the leader go so deeply into the public soul is because of the work and behavior of the vice-regent of the Muslims. Let us learn simple living from the exalted leader of the revolution and apply it. In conclusion he said: We are in full agreement with sports facilities for women provided that religious law is fully observed. It is necessary in trips by women's teams and in planning athletic competition for women that religious criteria be carefully observed so that the problems surrounding women's sporting events last year in the Islamic nations will not be repeated. I remind some of the newspapers to reconsider their unacceptable policies and dealings. Although during the Fourth Majles there have been several questions from the Majles and the relevant ministers, it is surprising and regrettable that one or two newspapers insulted in various ways the minister of the interior, this tormented figure who was imprisoned under the Pahlavi regime, on the pretext of a question that was asked by one of the deputies. He also asked for help from the nation's banking system for the Ministry of Cooperatives. Legislation Bill Amending the Law on Procedures for Giving Medical Examinations to Those Subject to Obligatory Public Service The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report on the first consultation of the Councils Commission on the Bill Amending the Law on Procedures for Giving Medical Examinations to Those Subject to Obligatory Public Service, enacted in the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990], the general form of which was approved by the Majles. In discussing this bill, the expert from the Councils Commission said: In Note 2, for those covered who are in need of diagnostic examinations, the expected cost must first be deposited in the government's account. In this note also, those in need who are covered by the Imam's aid committee are exempt. In the bill the government presented, individuals who are covered by the Health Care Organization and do not have the financial resources are also exempt. This bill was also approved by the Councils Commission. The approval of this bill is a gift to these dear ones as Oppressed Persons Week is about to begin (the birth anniversary of His Holiness Mehdi [may God hasten his joyful advent]). Motion To Amend Article 8 of the Law on Independence of Attorney's Society The second item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Councils Commission concerning the Motion To Amend Article 8 of the Law on the Independence of the Judicial Attorney's Society, approved 9/5/1333 [26 November 1954], the general form of which was approved in the first consultation. The Judicial Affairs Commission expert discussed this motion. He said: A requirement for doing judicial work in the judiciary is the existence of people who are strong and insightful in judicial affairs, are able to be aware of these legal formalities and can prosecute a claim along the legal path. Therefore the Attorney's Society took shape under the Law on the Independence of the Judicial Attorney's Society so that official attorneys would be used and it designated qualifications for those who must work as official judicial attorneys. One of these qualifications is having a judicial law license from a reputable domestic or foreign university and also undergoing a one-year apprenticeship. Such a person can work as a first-class attorney. In amending this law, they established privileges for a series of individuals who could not undergo the apprenticeship. One such person is the judicial judge, whether he has a law license or not. What is under discussion right now is in Paragraph 2 of this article, where deputies in the national Majles and the now dissolved senate who worked on the Judicial Affairs Commission and had the legal qualifications or had studied in the universities were allowed to obtain licenses to work as judicial attorneys after completing their Majles terms. The proposal is that those who work on the Majles Judicial Affairs Commission and have a law license, qualifications in legal affairs or have studied in colleges and have been a member of the commission for four years be exempt from the one-year apprenticeship. Motion To Prevent Air Pollution The final item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Agriculture Commission concerning the Motion To Prevent Air Pollution, the general form of which was approved by the deputies. It is worth mentioning that as of Saturday of next week, the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget Bill will be studied by the deputies in three shifts. Under the new Majles Internal Guidelines, first the general form and the question of revenues will be presented, and then in the second consultation the details will be studied. Majles Notes Yesterday's Majles Ethics Lesson A praiseworthy measure in the Fourth Majles is the holding of ethics lessons for the deputies. Yesterday Ayatollah Hoseyn Nuri-Hamadani, a professor at Qom seminary, gave a talk and an interpretation of human responsibilities and the role of worship. Ayatollah Nuri discussed worship and its varieties in Islam. He said one of the great forms of worship is alleviating financial needs and solving the problems of the people. He also said: The prophet said that whoever takes steps to meet the needs of a Muslim is like someone who spends his entire life worshipping God. He advised the deputies to solve the problems of the people, and he invited them to observe piety, order in their work and life, praying all night and doing the evening prayer. Continuing, Ayatollah Nuri enumerated the types of worship and said worship is the best way to get help from the magnificent Almighty. Continuing, he noted: The best worship is to reflect on theology and then to guide humanity, and after that comes meeting the needs and requirements of Muslims. The professor from Qom Seminary said the evening prayer is the best way to come close to God. He mentioned obtaining energy from daily tasks, and for that he mentioned 20 beneficial things and needs of Muslims. Continuing, he said: One must obtain help through worship in order to serve the people and put oneself on the path of humanity. The human being must obtain help from a great power in order to be able to carry out his responsibility. The Koran says this power and source is seeking help through patience and prayer. A human being must get energy from worship in order to be able to serve.
