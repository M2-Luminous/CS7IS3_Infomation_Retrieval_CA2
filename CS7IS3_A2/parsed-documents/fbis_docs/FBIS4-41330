Really three officials of the aforesaid design bureau had arrived in Sanaa on May 3, that is before armed actions began in Yemen, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman noted. Their visit was aimed at holding talks about the repair of Russian made aircraft the Yemeni Army is equipped with. However, not getting any opportunity to complete that programme due to well-known events, they left for home on May 9, Karasin noted. Regarding the tense situation prevailing in Yemen as a result of continued armed confrontation, Karasin emphasised, that Russia favours an earliest possible end to the fratricide, Karasin emphasised. He drew attention towards the necessity of unconditionally implementing the U.N. Security Assembly [as received] Resolution No. 924, which calls on all sides to immediately cease fire and return to the negotiating table to resolve differences for the sake of restoring peace and stability. According to Karasin, any mediation efforts undertaken for the search of a way out of the fratricidal conflict in Yemen are supported in Moscow.
