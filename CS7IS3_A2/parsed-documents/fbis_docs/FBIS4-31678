Fistrovic: "The Croats Are Building on Their Land!"] [Text] Today, the Croatian metropolis and the first among the Croats will receive the President of the Republic of Slovenia Milan Kucan. The Slovene is coming for the sake of bilateral relations and most probably also to discuss Croat-Slovene border-dispute, nuclear power plant, Ljubljanska Banka, and a series of other unsolved problems burdening relations between the two young countries. He stated for Slovene Television he was meeting the Croatian president to personally protest about the border crossing in Istria, the one in Secovlje. The Croats are allegedly building the border crossing on disputed territory that belongs to Slovenia, and the Slovenes have already filed a protest about it and threatened to strain relations and spread the malice in the media (the Slovene foreign minister had managed to halt the construction of that border crossing once but not for good). The Slovene president will most probably bring up the question of some allegedly Slovene villages on the left bank of the Dragonja (Skodelin, Buzin) which did not participate in the last elections in Slovenia and which raised an incredible amount of dust in Slovensko Primorje. The inhabitants of those villages were not on the election lists and a part of the Slovene press considered this to be a betrayal of national interests. Croatian Istria, keenly interested in the controversial border crossing and the said villages, calmly stood by watching the euphoria on the other side of the Dragonja, expecting Kucan's visit to Croatia, hoping that the Croatian president would tell him how the Istrians feel. On what grounds and with how much right will Kucan cite some facts from Istria directly to his host? It is more likely that the Slovene will spend more time talking about his (i.e. Slovene) delusions than about actual rights at the delta of the Dragonja and villages like Skodelin and Buzin. Those villages and the Dragonja River are undoubtedly on Croatian territory. The Istrians have known that from time immemorial and it was also recently proved by Ljubo Boban, who has been researching the history and the circumstances of the Croat-Slovene border in Istria after World War II. What, then, do those new documents say about the land on which Croatia is building one of its most beautiful entrances to Istria and about villages that did not go to latest elections in Slovenia? Some 20 documents that Boban presented to the Croatian State Commission for Borders give Mr. Tudjman the right to reject all the territorial demands of his guest and ask several very unpleasant questions (about returning land registers which are presently in Piran, moving the Dragonja River, or about the arrogation of the river's delta). The Croat can tell his Slovene counterpart with a clear conscience that, by requesting that Croatia stop working on the border crossing in the Plovanija-Skrile (Secovlje in Slovenian) sector, Slovenia is making direct territorial pretensions toward Croatian territory. And he would be telling the truth. Skudelin and Buzin -- Belong to Croatia President Tudjman should first study the map from 1945 that his guest will refer to and on the basis of which he claims the disputed area of the Dragonja, saying that Croatia is building a border crossing on the plot of land that belongs to the cadastral municipality of Piran III. The map is a supplement of publication "Cadastre National d'Istrie" [National Land Registry of Istria] that was made in Susak in 1945 to be used at the Paris peace conference. The publication contains all relevant information about the population, the land registry and administrative division in Istria of 1945. The controversial map (drawn by the Adriatic Institute of the Yugoslav Academy of Arts and Sciences) clearly shows that, in 1945, the land registry borders of the municipalities of Piran (today in Slovenia) and Kastel (today in Croatia) overlapped with the administrative and political border. Already on pages 525-526 of the document the map is attached to, one can see that the map does not correspond to the actual situation. Those pages show that the administrative and political division at the estuary of the Dragonja was different after all: the villages of Buzin, Kaneda, Skudelin, and Veli Malin were registered as belonging to the municipality of Kastel, the district of Buje. President Tudjman should present some other documents from that period to Kucan, for example the "Administrative and Territorial Division of the District of Buje in 1945," which says that the villages of Skudelin, Veli Malin, Kaneda, and Buzin -- on Victory Day on 9 May 1945 -- belonged to the territory of the Kastel People's Committee. From "Administrative and Territorial Division of the District of Buje of 15 March, 1946," it is obvious that the villages of Skudelin and Buzin belonged to the Local People's Committee Kaldanija, the district of Buje. Furthermore, Kucan should also see "Submission of the District of Buje" of 1946, which says that "the district of Buje stretches between the rivers Mirna and Dragonja and that its eastern border are the villages of Kucibreg and Zavrsje." The document proves that Skudelin, Veli Malin, Kaneda, and Buzin belong to the territory of the People's Committee of Kastel. Never in Slovenia In the year 1947, when the peace agreement with Italy was signed and the territory of Free Territory of Trieste (STT) was established, as well as the so called Istrian District composed of two sub-districts Buje and Kopar, the controversial building site also belonged to Croatia. The decision about the establishment of the Istrian District clearly mentions Skudelin and Buzin. The "Administrative and Territorial Division of the District of Buje" for 1947 puts the villages of Molini Scrile (Molini, Skrile), Scodelin (Skudelin), and Canedo (Kaneda) under the People's Committee of Kaldanija; the same document for 1948 again mentions Skudelin (Scodelin) and Buzin (Busin) as parts of the People's Committee of Kastel. The "Background for the Regional Index of the Istrian County of 21 April, 1949" shows that Buzin and Skudelin fall within the territory of the People's Committee of Kastel. Those villages also belong to Croatia in accordance with the decision by the Istrian Regional People's Committee of 12 April, 1952. The decision assigns them to the district of Buje and to the cadastral municipality of Kastel I. Even when the order by Yugoslav Army Military Administration of 1952 abolished the Istrian County and when, on 7 October, 1954, the area of what used to be known as the STT Zone A was assigned to the civilian administration of the FNRJ [Federal National Republic of Yugoslavia], those villages were in Croatian municipality of Buje. Areas south of the present course of the Dragonja (the so called cadastral municipality of Piran III) were transferred to Croatia. This territory became and integral part of it and it was so noted in all municipal, republic, and former federal regulations. As we can see from all those documents, the territory has never been a part of Slovenia, it has never belonged to the administrative and political unit of Piran, nor to the district of Kopar, and therefore not to Slovenia either. Groundless Claims If, in conclusion, we wonder what the dispute is about -- as does Ljubo Boban -- on what grounds does Slovenia claim the area of the so called cadastral municipality of Piran III, it must be said that those claims are groundless. Croat-Slovene demarcation in that area, from the outset, was not made according to land registry criteria, but on an ethnic basis, always in relation to the Dragonja River. In the world it is normal that such border be also "covered" in the land registry. There is nothing unclear about that. Furthermore, President Tudjman could ask his eminent visitor when Slovenia intends to return court (land registry) books for the area of the cadastral municipality Piran III? Land registry documentation for that municipality was semi-officially given to the Land Regristy of the Municipality of Buje in 1963, but not the court land registry. It was kept by the court in Piran and those who are not well-versed in the matter use it as an argument claiming that area as Slovene. And when his guest starts telling him to his face everything regarding the Plovanija border crossing and accuses him of sabotaging the agreement on borders in Istria, President Tudjman will, hopefully, have the courage to say: "But Mr. Kucan, those problems have not been solved because of Slovene institutions' blackmail with documentation." That documentation, according to Boban, must be unconditionally and immediately returned to Croatia. Moreover, President Tudjman should ask his guest the following question: where is the Dragonja River? For decades this Croatian river has been moved from its bed by Slovenia, which pushes it deeper and deeper into Croatia and then refers to it as the border. The Croats could substantiate that by Italian military maps which clearly show that the bed of the Dragonja was once to the north of the St. Odorika channel in which the Dragonja flows into the sea. Mr. Tudjman could also show Mr. Kucan the map published by the Statistic Office of the Regional People's Committee for Slovensko Primorje and Trieste in 1947. That map also shows the Dragonja in its northern bed. Planned Moving of the Dragonja From the landing of the allied forces in Normandy until the present, the course of the Dragonja has always belonged to the municipality of Buje, i.e. to the area that was included in Croatia after 1945. Therefore, the area should not and must not be a matter of agreement, especially as it was an integral part of Croatia at the time it declared its independence in 1991. The history of the area to the north of the St. Odorika channel and the earlier bed of the Dragonja shows that its ownership has become a matter of dispute only recently. In February 1944, according to the agreement between Croat and Slovene partisans, the Dragonja River was marked as a borderline of administrative and territorial demarcation. Some 10 years later, Slovenia started to move the river and create conditions for conquering Croatian territory. Today, it is blindingly obvious that the moving of the course of the Dragonja was planned and that it was moved from its original bed to the bed of the St. Onorika channel in order to get as much of Croatian territory as possible. Such a perfidious moving of borders is not tolerated by any court in the world. By moving the river, the Republic of Slovenia gained control over the area between the two river beds. Researcher Ljubo Boban, however, could not find a single act according to which that very sector would be specially regulated. Therefore, the area should be discussed in a separate agreement between Croatia and Slovenia and it should be viewed separately from the question of the present course of the Dragonja (the so called Piran III). The northern course of the Dragonja itself is not and cannot be disputed. Convinced that historian Tudjman knows all this, the Istrians calmly await the results of Slovene-Croat talks in Zagreb, firmly believing that the ominous prediction "Kucan in Zagreb -- Zagreb in trouble" will not come true. After this round of negotiations, the Bay of Piran will remain the biggest bone of contention in relations between Croatia and Slovenia. The border in that bay has not hitherto been regulated by any bilateral act and this is where one will be forced to apply international law on so called flank demarcation. All in all, it will not be Kucan and Tudjman who will pull the chestnuts out of the fire, but some other group of politicians.
