FR941104-0-00022 FR941104-0-00009 State corrective action orders will be issued to facilities subject to the Washington State Dangerous Waste Regulations, codified in the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) in Chapter 173-303, but these orders will rely in part on the State of Washington's Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA) statutory and regulatory provisions and will require current owners and operators of SWMUs to conduct corrective action at those units in accordance with the Dangerous Waste Regulations. EPA is not delegating RCRA section 3008(h) authority [42 U.S.C. 6928(h)] as part of this authorization. No Federal enforcement authorities are delegated when EPA authorizes state programs under section 3006 of RCRA. Any orders issued to a facility under MTCA will not be considered to be part of the EPA-authorized corrective action program unless and until they are incorporated into a RCRA permit. Terms of the orders which go beyond the scope of the authorized Dangerous Waste regulations will be considered broader in scope, and thus not Federally enforceable. Federal enforceability does not affect the ability of the State to impose requirements pursuant to their legitimate State statutory authorities or to enforce those requirements in lawfully-issued orders or permits. Some portions of Washington's revised program are broader in scope than the Federal program, and thus are not Federally enforceable. Due to Washington's statutory mandate to address all releases of hazardous substances, Washington has developed corrective action requirements which are, in part, broader in scope than the Federal corrective action requirements in RCRA Section 3004(u), in that dangerous waste management facilities in Washington will be required to conduct corrective action as necessary to protect human health and the environment for all releases of dangerous waste and dangerous constituents at or from the facility, regardless of the source of the release. Some portions of Washington's revised program are more stringent than the Federal program. The requirement to implement corrective action for releases which have migrated beyond the facility boundary is more stringent than the Federal requirement, in that it is not limited by the ``best efforts'' language in the Federal requirement. To clarify, Washington will be authorized for the following provisions as part of this authorization (see State Authorization Checklists 17L, 38, 44A, 44B, 121): ␣ 1Federal requirement 1State authority RCRA Corrective Action Program Corrective Action (50 FR 28702, 7/15/85): Applicability: SWMU, 40 CFR §264.90(a) WAC 173-303-645(1)(a)(ii).

In order to approve the State of Washington to use orders issued under MTCA to compel RCRA corrective action, it was necessary to identify the essential elements of a RCRA corrective action program and to determine that the State had the necessary authorities to meet these substantive RCRA requirements. The following table identifies those substantive RCRA corrective action requirements and demonstrates that the corresponding State authorities exist which allow the State to meet these requirements. Whereas certain of the state authorities listed are already authorized or are being authorized in today's action, this table only serves to demonstrate that orders issued under MTCA can compel corrective action which would meet all substantive RCRA corrective action requirements and is provided here for information only. As stated above, orders issued by the state are not part of the RCRA authorized program until such order is incorporated into a RCRA permit.
