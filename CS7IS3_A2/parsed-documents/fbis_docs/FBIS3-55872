There are four items on the agenda: the election of working bodies, the rules of the first session, the election of chairman of the Federation Council, and the election of vice chairmen. The majority of the deputies demanded that the government present a report because they believe that it does not know the economic and social situation in the country. Following debates, the decision was taken to ask Prime Minister Chernomyrdin or some other leading Cabinet member to address the Federation Council. The rules of the session consist of 14 articles. If the session is attended by two-thirds of the elected deputies (114), the session shall be considered legitimate. One of the articles defines the duties of the chairperson. During sessions he shall have no right to comment on the deputies' speeches. Another article says that the Federation Council's chairman and vice chairmen shall be elected during a secret ballot. Each candidacy to the post of vice chairman shall be discussed and a separate vote shall be held on it. After a break, at about 16:00, the working bodies of the Federation Council's session will be elected, and debates will be held on the election of the Federation Council's chairman and vice chairmen.
