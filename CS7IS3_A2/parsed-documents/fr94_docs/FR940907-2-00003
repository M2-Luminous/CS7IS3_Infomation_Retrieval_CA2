FR940907-2-00003 FR940907-2-00002 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [Docket No. 940844&hyph;4244; I.D. 082394C] RIN 0648&hyph;AG75 West Coast Salmon Fisheries; Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of proposed program for financial assistance. SUMMARY: NMFS proposes a program, the Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan (NEAP), that would provide $12 million of assistance to salmon fishermen in the Pacific Northwest who have been affected by a fishery resource disaster during 1992 through 1994, while providing conservation benefits to salmon resources. NMFS proposes that these disaster relief funds, which were made available under the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act (IFA), be applied toward the following three programs, administered by the following intermediaries: A vessel permit buyout program_Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; and a habitat restoration program_Soil Conservation Service (SCS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and a data collection program_Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC), both of which would provide jobs to commercial salmon fishermen. The intent is to provide assistance to those fishermen who have recently participated in the salmon fisheries, who were substantially reliant on West Coast salmon resources for their income, and who suffered an uninsured loss as a result of a significant reduction in income because of the resource disaster. DATES: Written comments must be received by September 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Stephen P. Freese, Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan, Trade and Industry Services Division, Northwest Regional Office, National Marine Fisheries Service, BIN C15700, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bruce Morehead, (301) 713&hyph;2358, or Stephen Freese, (206) 526&hyph;6113. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On May 26, 1994, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) declared a fishery disaster and, with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), announced a $15.7 million emergency aid package for Oregon, Washington, and northern California. This aid is intended to alleviate the economic hardship imposed on individuals and communities by the collapse of salmon stocks in fishing areas along the Northwest coast. Included in this package is $12 million of aid that was made available, under the Secretary's declaration that a fishery resource disaster exists under section 308(d) of the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986, 16 U.S.C. 4107(d), to undertake the NEAP program as described in this notice. In addition, $3 million is being administered by the Rural Development Administration (RDA) of USDA. Grants by RDA will be made to public bodies and private nonprofit corporations to finance development of small business enterprises in cities under 50,000 in population. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) of the Department of Commerce is making $882,000 available, instead of the $700,000 originally announced as part of the $15.7 million aid package. Grants by EDA have been earmarked to communities for tourism development and to tribes for stream reclamation. In addition to the $15.7 million package, aid to salmon fishermen is also being provided by the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Farmers Home Administration, in the form of loans and debt restructuring programs, and by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Labor (DOL) in the form of unemployment assistance, up to $14 million, to dislocated Washington and Oregon fishermen who are unemployed as a direct result of the continuing effects of El Ni√±o on salmon fishing. A request for such aid for California fishermen is under review. On behalf of the Secretary, NMFS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28838), to solicit public comment on issues to be considered in development and implementation of the $12 million NEAP program. The comment period, as modified on July 13, 1994 (59 FR 35674), closed July 15, 1994; comments received are responded to in this notice. At the time the ANPR was prepared, NMFS anticipated implementing the assistance program through rulemaking. However, because codification of the program is unnecessary to comply with statutory requirements, implementation will be achieved through procedures proposed in this notice. Following consideration of all comments received, NMFS will publish a notice of the final NEAP program in the Federal Register . In addition to the ANPR, NOAA's Office of Sustainable Development and Intergovernmental Affairs (SDI) arranged a series of eight town meetings designed to gather information about the effects of the decline in the salmon resources on local communities and fishermen. Meetings were held between June 1 and June 10, 1994, in Fort Bragg and Crescent City, CA; Coos Bay, Newport, Portland, and Astoria, OR; and Port Angeles and Westport, WA. More than 700 people attended the meetings and provided more than 37 hours of testimony. The purpose of this notice is to solicit public comment on the limitations, terms, and conditions that the Secretary has determined are necessary to administer the program, within the conditions in section 308(d) of the IFA.
