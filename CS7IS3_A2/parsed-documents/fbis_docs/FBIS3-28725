Speaking about the U.S. demands at the Japan-U.S. Government talks on setting numerical targets with respect to procurement of auto parts, Itagaki noted, "business volume is bound to change depending on economic conditions." He cast doubts on the rationale for the U.S. Government's rigid position, saying "the government should not interfere in purely private business dealings." He also said "not-externally-forced, voluntary cooperative relations should be established between Japan and the United States."
