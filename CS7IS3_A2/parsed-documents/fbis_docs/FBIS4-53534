At this meeting, the puppets took measures to strengthen the Air Force's combat-ready posture while talking about the need to make every preparation for regular war, mentioning threats by someone else. Crying over the fictitious nuclear issue of the North, the U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are frenzied in war provocation maneuvers for a northward invasion by using the issue as a pretext. The recent conspiracy plainly shows the true nature of the puppet clique that seeks to provoke a war, playing into U.S. hands [mijeui changdane chumul chumyonso chonjaeng tobarui killo naedannun].
