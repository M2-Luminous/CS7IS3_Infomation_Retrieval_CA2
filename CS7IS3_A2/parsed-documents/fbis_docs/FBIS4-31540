"Not only has this not happened in the past three months, but last week we gained access to a ministry paper about the ministry's structure, which does not foresee such a department even in the future," Vojtech Bugar stressed. As transpired from Bugar's words, Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik was not aware of this matter. The Hungarian parties will receive the coalition's explanation on 8 June.
