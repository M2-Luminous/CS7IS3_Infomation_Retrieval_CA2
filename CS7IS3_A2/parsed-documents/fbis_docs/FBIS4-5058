The JNP reached the decision at a meeting of its Diet members earlier in the day. Many members voiced opposition to the party leadership's plan to suspend the proposed merger with Sakigake, which is led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, party officials said. Hosokawa said Monday the proposed merger between the JNP and Sakigake is "not a commitment." The JNP, however, decided at Thursday's meeting to maintain a loose parliamentary group with Sakigake in the House of Representatives. Hosokawa and Takemura floated the idea of a merger last summer while they were campaigning in the July 18 general election for the House of Representatives. The close ties of the two parties became a driving force in creating the coalition government last August by uniting with five other parties to oust the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from its 38-year-old grip on power. But the relationship between Hosokawa and Takemura has soured, making remote the likelihood of a merger of the two parties, political sources said. The two leaders have differed over handling of tax system reform. Moreover, in moves to form new political forces among the ruling parties, it appears likely that Hosokawa and Takemura will join rival groups, according to the sources. The coalition government may separate into two groups -- one formed by the JNP, Komeito and Shinseito, and the other mainly by Sakigake and the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], they said. Takemura, meanwhile, indicated Thursday that his party may scrap the merger plan with the JNP if the soured relations between the two parties continue. In a meeting with reporters, Takemura expressed dissatisfaction with the JNP's attitude toward the idea, saying "if the JNP has changed its stance, I want (the party) to respond a bit more fairly." Takemura also said Sakigake will go back to the starting point to reconsider the matter.
