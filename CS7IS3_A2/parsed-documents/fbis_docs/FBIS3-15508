To State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin: I am sending you a list of draft laws that I intend to submit for approval to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly in 1994, in accordance with Article 104 of the Russian Constitution. In the first half of the year, I will introduce draft laws regulating the procedure for setting up and organizing the activity of bodies of state power of the Russian Federation, and primarily aimed at creating a normal, civilized judicial system in Russia (on the judicial system in the Russian Federation, on the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, on the procuracy in the Russian Federation, on the Government of the Russian Federation, on federal bodies of the executive power, on the federal state apparatus and others). In addition to this, in the first half of 1994, I will also prepare draft laws on general principles of state administration in Russia's constituent parts, as well as on general principles of local government. At the same time, I am planning to submit to the State Duma draft laws on the Civil, Criminal, and Land Codes, as well as some economic laws. During the second half of 1994, I am planning to submit draft laws aimed at ensuring citizens' economic and political rights (on forced migrants and refugees from areas of interethnic conflicts, on ethnic minorities, on protection of rights of the unemployed, on public events, on political parties, on the elections of the president of the Russian Federation and of the State Duma deputies, on the procedure for setting up the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly, on public associations and others). The attached list is not a final one, and some draft laws presently being worked on may be added to it. [Signed] Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation [passage omitted]
