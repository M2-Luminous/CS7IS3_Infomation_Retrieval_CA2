FBIS4-23100 "cr00000031694001" 10 June 1994 FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-075 PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS: FIRST TV TEST RUN PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS: FIRST TV TEST RUN The Palestinian Television Network aired its first test broadcast from Jericho on 6 June and reportedly intends to televise Yasir 'Arafat's arrival later this month. The trial broadcast, which featured the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) logo accompanied by its name and a Palestinian flag, was reported by Sanaa Voice of Palestine as well as Jordanian and Israeli radio on 7 June. An AFP report from the same day said that transmission of the broadcast, which covered only Jericho, was weak, and attributed this in part to Jericho's location well below sea level. The head of PBC, Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, told Radio Jordan that he hopes that the television transmissions will soon cover the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip. He added that Palestinian radio will begin broadcasting four to eight hours per day to Jericho and Gaza by late June. The Palestinian test broadcast was made from a Jericho hotel which has been turned into a press center in preparation for 'Arafat's visit, and which will continue to operate as a permanent broadcasting center, according to the AFP report. PBC head Abu- 'Ayyash stated: "Our plan was to have a main studio in Ramallah, connected with one in Gaza and one in Jericho. Because we have no other choice, we will transmit from Jericho, although it is terrible from such a low area. " He said that two French-made boosting towers will be placed on a nearby mountain and highway. Technicians have promised that transmissions to the rest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip will be ready within a week. AFP quotes Abu-'Ayyash as saying that the primary obstacle to Palestinian broadcasting is a lack of funds. He said that $55 million is needed to establish a permanent radio and TV broadcasting center. Most of this has been promised by the European Union, he noted, but "the money is locked up in Brussels" and has yet to arrive. The test broadcast was made from a temporary mobile transmission station, according to Abu-'Ayyash, because the Palestinian authority has not yet received equipment promised by donors. A dispute with Israel over the location of the broadcasting center has also caused delays. On 5 June, Abu-'Ayyash told AFP that Israel had informed the Palestinian authority that they must set up their broadcasting facilities in Jericho. The PBC had intended to set up their studios in Ramallah, where a pre-1967 transmitter and radio masts are being renovated. "Now we cannot have the studios in Ramallah," said Abu-Ayyash. "The town is not part of the autonomous areas." (QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF, AFRICA/LEVANT BRANCH AT (703) 733-6408) ENEAG/09 Jun/POLCHF/TTPF/NEASA Division/SDJ 09/2042Z JUN
