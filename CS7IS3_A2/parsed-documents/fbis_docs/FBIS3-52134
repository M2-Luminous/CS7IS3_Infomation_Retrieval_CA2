In an exclusive statement to MENA, the Kuwaiti information minister added that the countries that broke ranks, departed from pan-Arab unanimity, and backed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait must first reconsider their position and recognize the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, particularly those dealing with border demarcation and the liberation of Kuwait. He said that this demand is not negotiable and that the countries that backed Iraq must take the first step on this matter. He pointed out that Kuwait regards its borders, its existence, and its POW's as nonnegotiable, fundamental, and fateful issues. Shaykh Sa'ud Nasir al-Sabah regretted the current lack of inter-Arab solidarity and hoped that the Arab countries will succeed in surmounting this ordeal so that matters can return to normal and those in error can rectify their stances. It should be noted that Kuwait refers to the countries that supported the Iraqi invasion as the adversary countries. They include Jordan, the PLO, Yemen, Sudan, Mauritania, and Algeria.
