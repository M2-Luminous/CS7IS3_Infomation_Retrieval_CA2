The conference was held by the provincial people's government to study and formulate a general train of thought aimed at deepening scientific and technological structural reform and integrating science, technology, and the economy under the new circumstances as well as arranging for the province's present and future science and technology work. Vice Governor Fan Xiaomei stated in her report that Shaanxi's present and future scientific and technological tasks were as follows: 1. To build and perfect a simple but highly efficient scientific research and development system which integrates science, technology, and economy; 2. To build and develop a technology market, an information market, and a qualified personnel market; 3. To organize and train a backbone contingent of young and competent academic and technological personnel capable of working into the next century, a strong contingent of entrepreneurs proficient in modern science and technology, and a strong contingent of managerial personnel engaged in scientific and technological work; 4. To strive to make major breakthroughs in developing nongovernmental scientific and technological undertakings, building a technology market, and building principal and backbone projects, to raise the scientific and technological achievements transformation rate and scientific and technological utilization rate up to and above 50 percent, thereby giving full scope to the role played by science and technology as the primary productive forces. During the next few years, vice Governor Fan Xiaomei noted, the province's scientific and technological structural reform is expected to focus on lifting the controls on more aspects to enable more scientific research institutions to participate in economic operations and operate like enterprises, turning more scientific research institutions into nongovernmental institutions engaged in socialized operation. In his speech Governor Bai Qingcai stated: Science and technology are the primary productive forces. We have yet to acquire an in-depth understanding of the importance of science and technology in practice and make greater efforts to turn scientific and technological achievements into productive forces. The province's scientific, technological, and economic structural reforms are aimed mainly at turning scientific and technological achievements, more expeditiously, from intellectual products into commodities and from potential productive forces into real productive forces by dint of the market. Governor Bai Qingcai called on people's governments and scientific and technological workers at all levels across the province to: Be more conscious of transforming scientific and technological achievements into productive forces; employ the necessary economic, legislative, and administrative measures in this regard; successfully tackle a number of long-standing problems hindering the transformation, such as setting excessive store by scientific research while making little effort to transform scientific and technological achievements into productive forces, a poor sense of intellectual property rights, not paying attention to economic efficiency, and so on; take steps to strengthen each and every intermediate link regarding scientific and technological achievements transformation; transform scientific and technological achievements through more channels and at more levels; and strive to really integrate science, technology, and the economy. Governor Bai Qingcai pointed out: We should strive to transform Shaanxi's scientific and technological superiority into economic superiority at a swifter tempo. To this end, we should press ahead with large-scale, high-efficiency, and high-quality technological exploitation and transformation of each and every pillar industry that is capable of generating more revenue, utilizing more local resources, and boosting the development of other industries. We should strive to build more industrial and agricultural projects capable of increasing peasant income by a large margin and raise the efficiency and scale and upgrade each and every pillar industry across the province. Regarding agriculture, Governor Bai Qingcai maintained that the province should strive to vigorously develop a high-quality, high-yield, and high-efficiency agriculture with an eye on building a socialist market economic structure and increasing peasant incomes; build a batch of exemplary agricultural zones with local characteristics and influence; build more industrial development zones and resources exploitation zones; tackle each and every major scientific and technological problem; build industrial groups which integrate trade, industry, and agriculture; and try to sell more farm products on foreign and domestic markets. Speaking of industry, Governor Bai Qingcai asserted that the province should make redoubled efforts to push ahead with structural readjustment; reduce energy consumption; raise efficiency; promote scientific and technological progress; sell locally manufactured products on more markets; invite more foreign funds to help merge and transform more large and medium enterprises; and turn more traditional industries into high-efficiency, export-oriented, and technology-intensive industries. Yesterday's conference was presided over by Guan Wuxue, provincial people's government deputy secretary general, and attended by a number of provincial leaders, including Ren Guoyi, Liang Qi, Zhang Heling, Lin Jizhou, and others.
