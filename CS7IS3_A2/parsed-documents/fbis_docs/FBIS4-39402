Staff at the headquarters of the department that provides the country with its grub are playing a guessing game: Who will be next to go? A conversation with one Minselkhozprod staffer on the topic of current morals at the ministry yielded information which sheds light on a number of things. According to this specialist (he asked us not to reveal his name), Ivan Romakh merely "allocated" concessionary credits from the state budget on self-interested terms; the credits were actually released, that is to say approved, by Deputy Minister N. Averyanov, who handles finances. It might be a coincidence, but a fact remains a fact: Following Romakh's arrest, Deputy Minister Averyanov was urgently admitted to hospital. In light of this, the interest displayed by I. Gridasov, chief of the Agriculture Main Administration, in the affairs of the "Rostok" private firm is becoming increasingly apparent. He knows, of course, that in the spring of 1992 R. Kozhenkova, the firm's general director, signed a contract with Finland's state grain storage organization to supply her firm (which at that time was called "Russian-Serbian Seeds") with 20,000 tonnes of Finnish selected oat and barley seed worth $5 million. The firm received the seeds from the Finns but has still not paid for them. Even with this knowledge, Gridasov still respects the "Rostok" firm. Last summer, as a member of a delegation from this firm, he even visited the former Yugoslavia. And then, needless to say, he sowed Yugoslav seeds on Russian fields, having secured a state subsidy to do so. "Rostok's" interests are also championed by Ye. Zozimovich, chief of the Seed Production Administration. In addition to the interests of another firm -- the "Roskukuruza" firm. Meanwhile we have reliably been informed that there are documents at Petrovka Militia Station which prove that A. Taratushka, "Roskukuruza's" deputy director, took cash bribes worth thousands of dollars from a specialist in the Kalmyk Ministry of Agriculture in order to "encourage" Ministry of Agriculture staff. "Roskukuruza," incidentally, has obtained Ministry of Agriculture apartments in Dayev Lane, and now the firm's directors spend whole days in Gridasov's or Zosimovich's office. The source of our information is convinced that Minselkhozprod staff are feeding state loans to private firms, only the scale of the corruption is more extensive that appears at first glance.
