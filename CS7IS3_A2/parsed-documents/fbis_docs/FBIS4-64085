Addressing the session, First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets stressed that real life in Russia "overtakes the processes of law-making," and that the "package of presidential economic decrees" is designed to "resolve problems that piled up largely in the area of finances and material production skillfully and gradually." According to Soskovets, the "essence and the content" of Boris Yeltsin's decrees connected with reforming state-owned enterprises, taxation policy, quotas and other issues "pursue only one goal -- to put the country's economy in order." "Many provisions in the package of the president's decrees conflict with the present legislation, and some of them give rise to amazement," countered the chairman of Russia's Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko. He called for convening a special government session to analyse and discuss the decrees. However Gerashchenko's call failed to find support, and participants in the government session approved the draft resolution which contains a system of concrete measures designed to monitor the implementation of presidential decrees.
