The Public Order Ministry spokesman reports that at about 1335 today another flagrant incident happened in Pogaj village in Has District, near border marker D/7. A Yugoslav border unit, accompanied by dogs, opened fire toward two Albanian children who were guarding their cow, without going beyond the border line, but close to it. As soon as the shots were heard, the commander of our border post, together with a soldier, left immediately. But with no warning at all, the Yugoslav post of Goruzhup, in former Yugoslavia, opened fire against our border guards, who were 100 meters away from the border line and approximately 350 meters away from their post. Soldier Saimir Pal Zefi from Mirdite District was wounded from these very sudden shots. This is a very flagrant event because there was not even the slightest provocation or pretext from our part. Our member of the joint local commission for solving border incidents and representatives of EC observers mission went immediately to the scene of the incident. The Public Order Ministry strongly protests these criminal and unjustifiable acts that are increasing day by day.
