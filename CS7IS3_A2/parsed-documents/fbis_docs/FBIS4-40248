He also stands for sharing power between the president and parliament, which, in his view, excludes the possibility of monopolizing authority by one of the branches of power. This is stated in Kravchuk's election program, which became available to INTERFAX. The program is called "To strengthen the state and speed up reforms through civic concord." Kravchuk views himself as a supporter of unitarian state with well-developed self-government and broad economic independence for the regions. He stands for settling relations with the Republic of the Crimea legislatively. Kravchuk calls for developing the CIS, for promoting economic integration in its framework, for having equitable relations with the neighbors, including Russia. He finds it necessary to radically improve the climate for investment and enable the domestic and foreign entrepreneurs to be equally interested in making investments in Ukraine's industries. Kravchuk is planning to speed up the implementation of a full-scale monetary reform and the introduction of the grivna. He thinks it necessary to lower interest rates, separate the funds belonging to enterprises from national revenues and step up privatization under government control. Kravchuk also finds it possible to have two official languages in the country -- Ukrainian and Russian. According to observers, Kravchuk's stand in favor of giving Russian the status of another official language is designed to ensure for him additional votes in elections in Ukraine's east and south-east, where the Russian speaking population is predominant. Addressing students at the university in Zaporozhye on Monday, another presidential candidate, Leonid Kuchma, strongly criticized the present head of state. The people are capable of comparing their 1990 and 1994 living standards. If they want to continue destroying their economy for another four years, let them reelect Kravchuk, he said. He stands only for an economic union with Russia, Kuchma pointed out. He never called for forming a Slav union. In this connection he dismissed the relevant statement by Kravchuk and added that it must be embarrassing for a president to tell open lies and attribute such ideas to him. With reference to the Black Sea Fleet problem Kuchma stressed that today "we would not have spoken about the fact that Ukraine was defeated politically and economically in that area, had the Ukrainian leadership heeded his call for leasing the fleet to Russia a year ago." IF Note: As regards the popularity of presidential candidates, Leonid Kuchma is in the lead. Witness the poll conducted by Socis- Gallap among 1200 voters in all areas of Ukraine. The poll shows that 19 pct of respondents give preference to Kuchma, 18 pct to Kravchuk, 6 pct to Ivan Plusch and 5 pct to Vladimir Lanovoy. The other contenders are trusted by less than 1 pct of those questioned.
