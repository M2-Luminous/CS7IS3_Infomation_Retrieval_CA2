"L. Berov Hasn't Got Hepatitis But Was Isolated Deliberately" runs a front-page headline in DUMA, the BSP daily. It quotes a knowledgeable source of the hospital in which the prime minister is being treated as saying that "since last Thursday [14 April] there have been no medical reasons whatsoever to keep him in quarantine". He definitely has not got hepatitis, the whole affair was either deliberately provoked or resulted from doctors' incompetence, the source said. On March 11 Prime Minister Lyuben Berov had a quadruple bypass operation following heart failure and on April 13 the government Press Office announced Berov had been hospitalized with hepatitis symptoms. According to DUMA, in the middle of last week blood tests ruled out hepatitis, while the tests that are being done in Germany are part of the stalling and suspense tactics. Government sources commented that Berov is well aware of the political intrigues over his condition as well as of the imprudent and foolish steps taken by some cabinet ministers in his absence. The prime minister intends to resume his duties later this week. His hepatitis is "political", according to a signed article in DUMA. It also says that the Socialists strongly insist that "the reform and the new composition of the cabinet should reflect the political weight of the parties as judged by the electorate". DEMOKRATSIYA calls Berov's illness "diplomatic jaundice". Quoting reliable sources, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) says "the motive behind the whole affair was to allow Berov to trifle with his patrons and stall the cabinet overhaul". In an interview on national radio this morning Health Minister Tancho Gugalov denied these allegations by saying that to his knowledge the prime minister's illness had not been contrived for some purpose.
