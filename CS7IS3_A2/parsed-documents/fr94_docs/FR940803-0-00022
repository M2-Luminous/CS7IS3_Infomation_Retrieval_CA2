FR940803-0-00022 FR940803-0-00008 12 CFR Part 707 Truth in Savings AGENCY: National Credit Union Administration. ACTION: Final rule; extension of compliance date. SUMMARY: The NCUA Board is publishing a change to the compliance date to part 707 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations (Truth in Savings). This document extends the compliance date for nonautomated credit unions that have assets of $2 million or less as of December 31, 1993. The extension gives the smaller, nonautomated credit unions more time to come into compliance with part 707. DATES: Effective Date: This document is effective January 1, 1995. Compliance Date: The compliance date of part 707 is extended to January 1, 1996, for credit unions of an asset size of $2 million or less as of December 31, 1993, that are not automated. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Richard Schulman, Associate General Counsel, or Martin Conrey, Staff Attorney, Office of General Counsel, telephone (703) 518&hyph;6540. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: (1) Background. Prior Extensions NCUA previously extended the compliance date for part 707, Truth in Savings, for certain small, nonautomated credit unions. (Final rule, 59 FR 13435, March 22, 1994). At that time, the compliance date of part 707 was extended to March 31, 1995, for credit unions of an asset size between $500,000 and $1 million as of December 31, 1993, that are not automated. Similarly, the compliance date of part 707 was extended to June 30, 1995, for credit unions of an asset size of less than $500,000 as of December 31, 1993, that are not automated. The compliance date remained January 1, 1995, for all other credit unions. Importance of Small Credit Unions The NCUA Board is very concerned with the continued viability of small credit unions. As Norman E. D'Amours, NCUA Chairman, explained recently: Small credit unions are very important to the continuing growth of the movement. Like the tender shoots on a large tree, they represent the promise of continuing life and health. They serve people who badly need their services, and they know their members very well. Such a credit union is more likely to take a risk on the reputation and character of a member unable to find credit elsewhere. NCUA Letter to Credit Unions No. 153 (April 1994) Ten years ago, credit unions under $2 million in size made up about two-thirds (10,564) of all federally insured credit unions. Today, such credit unions number only 4,132, about one-third of federally insured credit unions. In addition, the assets of today's 4,132 smallest credit unions are 1.2 percent of total assets in all credit unions, while credit unions of $2 million or less accounted for 7.7 percent of total assets ten years ago. The average credit union today has $22.5 million in assets, compared to $5 million ten years ago. However, over two-thirds of these small credit unions are already automated or have data processing capabilities. Since these credit unions are in a position to begin Truth in Savings compliance on January 1, 1995, the Board believes that to grant these credit unions a further compliance extension would be contrary to the intent of Congress in enacting TISA, and contrary to the interests of their credit union members.
