The presidential office at Chongwadae said it has also managed to revitalize the nation's economy through eradication of corruption and irregularities and adoption of the real-name financial transaction system. If the overriding goal of President Kim's five-year term is to build a "new Korea" by boosting international competitiveness, the first year was spent in firming up the foundation, said Chongwadae in a report issued Saturday on the first year of the Kim administration. The nation's first democratically elected president, Kim marks the first anniversary of his administration on Feb. 25. The report, however, acknowledged that there had been criticism of "the president's solo performance" evidenced by his strong leadership. It admitted that the Kim administration has been charged with sapping the country's economy and social activities by enforcing an anti-corruption campaign aimed at settling old scores. It also acknowledged that confusion among government agencies has arose concerning follow-up measures to the real-name sysytem, the uruguay round of trade negotiations and the North Korean nuclear issue. But the Kim administration has courageously excised rotten parts of society and wiped out corruption and social injustice accumulated under the authoritarian governments of former army generals over three decades, it said. The administration's efforts to clean up the country were made possible through investigation that does not allow sanctuary and by strengthening the government's investigative functions, the report said. The civilian government has undertaken a series of lightning reshuffles and purges of military officers, who had long enjoyed special status under previous administrations, it said. The Kim administration has also disbanded the once powerful private political organization in the military, known as "Hana-hoe." The daring military reform was carried out despite concerns that it could harm the morale of officers and soldiers alike, it said. With regard to political reform, the report noted that the Kim administration managed to clean up corruption through public disclosure of the personal assets of lawmakers as well as other public servants. A revision of the ethics law for public servants and political reform bills to be taken up by the National Assembly are other significant achievements, it said. On the nation's economy, the report said the growth rate perked up to 5 percent in 1993, up from 3 percent in the second half of 1992. The country has also registered a trade surplus for the first time in four years. The administration, however, recognizes the criticism leveled against excessive economic stimulus measures and its alleged failure at the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations, which forced the opening of the rice market to imports, it said. As for future tasks facing the administration, the report cited the need to strenghten the country's competitiveness by expanding social infrastructure and comprehensive relaxation of administrative regulations. Early adoption of political reform bills, education reform, stablization of consumer prices, and improvement in inter-Korean relations are other issues the administration will have to tackle in the near future, it said.
