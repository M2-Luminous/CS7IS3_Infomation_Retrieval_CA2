On 8 September 1993, the European Commission approved a proposal requesting authorization from the Council and the Member States to negotiate the review of certain provisions of the Lome IV Convention signed on 15 december 1989 by the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states. The proposal, together with draft negotiating directives, was presented by Mr Manuel Marin, Commission vice-president for development cooperation and humanitarian aid. On 7 February 1994, the European Union Council of Ministers approved, by unanimity, the negotiating directives for the partial revision of the convention. The Lome IV signatories provided for the possibility of a review midway through the convention's ten-year term, to coincide with the renewal of the financial protocol, which must in any event take place after five years. The Commission believes that there is an urgent need to adapt the convention to present-day development cooperation requirements. Thus, the Commission proposed that the European Union confirm to the ACP states its commitment to the system of cooperation introduced by the first Lome Convention, underlining the special nature of a relationship based on the equality of the partners and on mutual interest. In the light of recent developments on the international political stage and of the lessons learned in implementing the present convention up to now, the European Union proposals, adopted at the initiative of the European Commission, are primarily designed to make European Union support for ACP development more effective. Accordingly, the main objectives are: - To ensure that the convention asserts the principles of democracy, the rule of law and good governance, alongside existing references in the convention (Art.5) to respect for and enjoyment of human rights; - To adapt the instruments of dialogue between the ACP and the European Union to take better account of the basic principles and priorities of the European Union cooperation policy and implement them more effectively; - To achieve more coherent and effective use of ACP-EU cooperation instruments and procedures. Furthermore, the Commission proposed that, as in the case with other European Union partners, the scope of the ACP-EU Council of Ministers be extended in order to create, preferably on a regional basis, a political dialogue. A memorandum based on these proposals and on the subsequent discussions in the Council was sent to the ACP states in accordance with the procedure and timetable laid down in Article 366 of the Fourth Lome Convention. Negotiations will be formally opened at the ACP/EU Council of Ministers, on 20 May 1994 in Mbabane (Swaziland). Background: the Lome Convention The European Union and its member states together constitute the principal source of official development assistance (ODA) for the benefit of all developing countries. Today they account for almost half of all aid received by developing countries. The ECU2.5 billion made available every year to the countries of the southern hemisphere thus gives the European Union, considerable weight in its development action. European Union financial aid managed by the European Commission represents around 5 percent of the total world oda and 15 percent of that of the twelve member states. From Lome I to Lome IV The Lome Convention is the best known and most complete example of the European Union's development cooperation policy. It expresses at European Union level the interdependence woven by history, trade, economics and culture between Europe and the south. In 1975 Lome I took over from the two Yaounde conventions, marking the beginning of what was soon to be known as Lome policy. A second convention, signed in 1980, assured continuity. Lome III, concluded in 1985, enshrined new ambitions centred on the objectives of rural development and food security. Lome Policy Rests on Four Pillars: - Cooperation between two regional groups, based on respect for the political and economic choices of each partner; - Stable, sustainable and predictable cooperation based on legally binding arrangements set out in a freely negotiated contract; - Comprehensive cooperation combining a whole range of aid and trade development instruments; - On-going dialogue in the framework of three joint institutions: the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers, the ACP-EEC Committee of Ambassadors and the ACP-EEC Joint Assembly. Lome IV -- a Ten-Year Convention for 70 ACP Countries The European Union and 66 ACP states signed on 15 December 1989 the Fourth Lome Convention. Two new Caribbean states, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, joined the convention. Namibia and Eritrea also became members immediately after their independence; the Lome Convention thus comprises all the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa except South Africa. For the first time, after a series of five-year conventions, the Fourth Convention will last for ten years (with a renewable five-year financial protocol expiring on 28 February 1995). It will be in force from 1 March 1990 until the end of February of the year 2000. The financial resources made available for ACP/EU cooperation went from ECU8.5 billion under Lome III to ECU12 billion (approx. $15 billion) for the first five years of Lome IV (up to the end of february 1995). These resources are as follows: - ECU10.8 billion to the European Development Fund, i.e. an increase of 45 percent in nominal terms and of 25 percent in real terms with respect to Lome III. This amount includes individual allocations for the 70 ACP states (the "indicative programmes": ECU6.215 billion) as well as other sectoral areas: structural adjustment (ECU1.15 billion), stabilisation of agricultural revenues (the "stabex" system: ECU1.5 billion) and of mining resources ("sysmin": ECU480 million), emergency aid (ECU250 million), aid to refugees (ECU100 million), interest rate subsidies (ECU280 million) and risk capital (ECU825 million). - ECU1.2 billion on own resources from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Together with this increase in aid, an important effort has been made in order to improve the quality of European Union aid: with the exception of risk capital managed by the EIB, all of the European Development Fund is now made of grants.
