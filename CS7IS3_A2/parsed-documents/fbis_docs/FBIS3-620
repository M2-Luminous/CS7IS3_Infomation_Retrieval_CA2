The purpose of the mission is to verify the Cameroonian assertion that the inhabitants of this 1,000 square km peninsula, rich in fish and oil, have freely expressed their desire in 1961 to be Cameroonians. According to the Nigerian Government, over 90 percent of the inhabitants of this area are Nigerians of the Efik and Idibo ethnic groups in Cross River and Akwa-Ibom states. The traditional chiefs of these two states, contingous to the disputed area, are expected to be part of the delegation. This visit comes a few days after the visit paid by the head of the Nigerian Army, General Chris Alli. Cameroonian Communication Minister Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni spole to us on the phone. [Begin recording] [Announcer] Mr. Minister, we have already spoken to you this morning. Nigeria accuses Cameroon of receiving French military support on the ground. What is your response to this accusation? [Kouomegni] There has always been a permanent Cameroonian Army presence on the Bakassi Peninsula. This has always been the situation. There is a Cameroon Navy base at Idabato, not far from where the first contingent of Nigerian troops landed. At any rate it cannot be said that Cameroonian troops have intervened in the peninsula, they have always been there. In the wake of the arrival of the Nigerian troops, we simply reinforced the Cameroonian military presence on the Cameroonian territory of the Bakassi Peninsula. That is clear. There are not only Cameroonian troops there, but there is also a Cameroonian administration because the area is part of the Ndian Division, which has seven subdivisions headed by subprefects. Three of these subdivisions cover the Bakassi Peninsula. [Announcer] Mr. Minister, nonetheless, it would appear that the French military presence has a dissuasive function. [Kouomegni] That is totally false. So far, the Cameroonian troops have not needed French help in the Cameroonian peninsula. Nonetheless, I wish to state that we have a military alliance with France and we have the right -- and it is our full right-- to call on the French when the need arises. This has, however, not been the case and I do not understand why there is talk of French presence in the peninsula. If the French wanted to get there, it takes only 30 minutes from Yaounde. I think this discussion on the French presence shows a lack of military knowlegde about defense of that area. [Announcer] Some indiscretions reveal that despite official declarations, Cameroon has the intention of preparing for war with its neighbor. What is your definite position on this affair? [Kouomegni] Our position is a dissuasive one, but it is also a preparation for any possible action if that becomes necessary since the French are our defense ally. However, I repeat, and I am keen to point out, that on the ground so far there are only Cameroonian forces. [end recording]
