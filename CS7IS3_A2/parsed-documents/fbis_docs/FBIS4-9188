FBIS4-9188 "dreeu078_i_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Continued Fighting Reported in Gorazde Continued Fighting Reported in Gorazde UNHCR Doctors on Situation AU2204122194 Paris AFP in English 1153 GMT 22 Apr 94 AU2204122194 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Geneva, April 22 (AFP) -- Herewith is the latest radio message received Friday [22 April] morning from two women doctors working for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] in the besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde, in eastern Bosnia, and released by the organisation here. "The last two days here are a living hell. I'm sure you have all the casualty figures and do not need them again. I want instead to give a picture of the daily lives of the people here. Both residents and refugees are crowded into crumbling buildings waiting for the next shell. When it hits, many are killed as there are such crowds in each building. It is usually many from the one family. The wounded lie for hours in the debris as it is suicidal to try and bring them to the hospital. One UNHCR local worker said he could hear the cries of the wounded in the houses, on his journey to our cellar yesterday. All 3 UNMO (UN military observers) cars are now engaged in ambulance service. There is no safety of effective treatment in the hospital. ``Shells batter down the walls there and machinegun fire rakes the wards. Twenty people were confirmed killed in one of the hospital apartment yesterday. The Serb excuse for targetting it, is that it is a military institution. I've been in all parts of the hospital a hundred times in the last month and can assure the outside world that this is a lie. The theatres and all sterilizing equipment were destroyed by a shell yesterday morning, so no further operations can be carried out. Now the hospital has little more to offer the patients who get there alive, than sympathy. The dead are hastily buried at night by covering them with a thin layer of sand. If it ever gets hot here, there would be epidemics of disease. Our refugees have increased in numbers to approximately 100 now, mostly women and children. As yet, we are lucky in that only one child was wounded and is still alive. They pack the stairs to our cellar and when the shelling gets particularly heavy, we bring them into our living quarters. They are so quiet and leave again for the upper floors when things get quieter. It was some of these children we asked to send their plea to Geneva last night and gave us these messages from their hearts. ``They have little food and we cannot help them as our rations would be gone in one hour if we tried. At least we can give this little band water when ours is running but God knows how long they will last. They all have terrible stories to tell, but I cannot speak to them or look them in the face as I am too ashamed at how little we can do for them. Only occasionaly, as when dressing some of their wounds, do we hear these stories. One old lady cried for her relative, an eight- month's pregnant lady who was killed together with her three children by a direct hit on their apartment on April 19. Another man with burned hands was the only survivor of the fire that burned the UNMO's worker and three others to death the same night. ``Presidents (Bill) Clinton and (Boris) Yeltsin want to hold talks about the future of Bosnia next month. There will be little left in Gorazde by then, but corpses and rubble". ``With best regards"... xxx and xxx (names retained by UNHCR for reason of safety)
