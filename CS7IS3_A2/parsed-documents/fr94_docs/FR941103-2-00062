Response: Western has been unable to duplicate the analysis in this comment. Some of the figures in the commentor's table are incorrect. This gives the impression of a problem where Western believes none exists. Most significantly, Western's actual FY 1993 CRSP O&M expense of $17.964 million shown in the commentor's tables is incorrect. The proper amount, from the Results of Operations (financial statements) as shown below, is $21.418 million. This should be the basis for the commentor's percentage calculations.
