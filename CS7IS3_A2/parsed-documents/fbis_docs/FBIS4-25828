The vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, Zhou Zhengqing, revealed that plans to save the industries were being discussed by various central ministries. The departments included the State Economic and Trade Commission and the People's Bank of China, the two power bases of Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji. According to Mr Zhou, industries which will benefit from the new credit facilities are coal, metallurgy and electricity. It was not clear how much money would be available and when the operation would begin. But the vice-governor said the extra credit did not mean Beijing would relax its grip on fixed assets investment by industries which he described as a "root cause" of the cash flow problem. According to original estimates, the Government's ceiling for fixed assets investment for the country this year was set at 1,300 billion yuan (HK$1,154 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) -- an amount bound to be exceeded. Mr Zhou said the triangular debts problem had arisen, because industries were unable to obtain a smooth cash flow by selling their products on the market. Despite poor sales, many of the industries aggravated problems by diverting their working capital into fixed assets investment, Mr Zhou said. The bank chief said industries must therefore strive to improve sales of their products and stop investment in fixed assets while triangular debts remained a problem. In addition, the state would provide financial assistance to individual industries, he said. Informed sources in Beijing said the top leadership was worried that, despite years of effort, the triangular debts problem continued to hang over enterprises, especially those heavy industries in the northeast provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning. They said senior leaders were worried that many of these factories belonged to key national industries and their financial situations had apparently not improved while the economy boomed. Nevertheless, decisionmakers in Beijing were unable to come up with any "breakthrough" measures to rescue these enterprises and had to relax credit. Chinese analysts said the Communist Party would hoid a plenum this year where the viability of state industries would be a top priority. The analysts claimed Mr Zhu, highly unpopular for his economic retrenchment measures introduced last year, was eager to befriend regional governors by promising to relax credit for selected industries although the extra money could fuel the inflation crisis. "They [the credits] are more a temporary measure than a long-term cure," an analyst said.
