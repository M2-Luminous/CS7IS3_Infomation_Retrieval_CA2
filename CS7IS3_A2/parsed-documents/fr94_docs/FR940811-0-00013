Compliance: Required within 50 hours' time-in-service after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of a main rotor blade and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Conduct a one-time inspection for cracks in each blade's inboard trim tab and trailing edge in accordance with steps 1, 2, and 3 of Part I of the Accomplishment Instructions of applicable Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) 206&hyph;93&hyph;77 or ASB 206L&hyph;93&hyph;92, both dated November 17, 1993. (1) If the blade skin is cracked, remove the blade and replace it with an airworthy blade before further flight. (2) If only the trim tab is cracked, remove the affected blade from the helicopter. Remove the trim tab and adhesive from the blade and inspect the upper and lower blade skins with a 10-power or higher magnifying glass in accordance with Part II of the Accomplishment Instructions of the applicable ASB, dated November 17, 1993. (i) If the blade skin under the trim tab is cracked, remove the blade and replace it with an airworthy blade before further flight. (ii) If no crack is detected in the blade skin, polish out all marks on the blade in accordance with Part II, step 4 of the Accomplishment Instructions of the applicable ASB, dated November 17, 1993, and inspect and install a new trim tab in accordance with Part II, steps 5&hyph;9 of the Accomplishment Instructions of the applicable ASB, dated November 17, 1993. (3) If no crack is found in the inboard trim tab or the blade trailing edge by the inspections required by paragraphs (1) and (2), before further flight, inspect the plan-form radii of the trim tab where the trim tab intersects the trailing edge in accordance with Part I, steps 4&hyph;6, of the Accomplishment Instructions of the applicable ASB, dated November 17, 1993. (i) If a crack is found in the plan-form radii of the inboard trim tab, before further flight, remove the blade and replace it with an airworthy blade. (ii) If no crack is found in the plan-form radii of the trim tab, polish and refinish the blade in accordance with Part I, steps 8&hyph;11, of the Accomplishment Instructions of the applicable ASB, dated November 17, 1993. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Rotorcraft Certification Office. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) The inspection, rework, and replacement, if necessary, shall be done in accordance with BHTI Alert Service Bulletin 206&hyph;93&hyph;77 or Alert Service Bulletin 206L&hyph;93&hyph;92 as applicable, both dated November 17, 1993.
