On behalf of the State Council, Li Tieying, state councilor and CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member, attended the tea party and congratulated the skillful Chinese winter sports athletes who achieved good results at the games. [passage omitted] Speaking at the meeting, Comrade Li Tieying pointed out: China's winter sports started relatively late. It only developed and made great progress during the 15 years since reform and opening up. Reluctant to be left behind, coaches and athletes have continued to forward new goals as well as strived to achieve them. These are exactly the characteristics in New China's sports: work hard, keep forging ahead, and vie for the nation's glory. [passage omitted] He pointed out: It was not easy for the Chinese delegation to obtain such results from a field of strong competitors at the Winter Olympic Games. The spirit of unity and arduous struggle they demonstrated was even more valuable. The unfair practice [bu gong zheng zuo fa 0008 0361 2973 0254 3127] of obvious and intentional shielding [ming xian di you yi tan hu 2494 7359 4104 2589 1942 5917 6233] of one side while accusing [ze nan 6307 7181] the other occurred in the short-track speed skating competition. It aroused the righteous indignation [yi fen 5030 2001] of all fair-minded people while toughened and tested the Chinese team. Zhang Yanmei overcame difficulty, triumphed over disturbances, did well from start to finish to complete her competition, and won a silver medal, winning praises from public opinion. Finally, Li Tieying expressed hope that China's winter sports athletes would earnestly sum up their experiences and lessons to find out where they lag behind others, and address existing problems. They should emancipate their minds; deepen reform; boldly explore and innovate; draw on the experiences of nations strong in winter sports and combine them with China's own characteristics; seize opportunities; determine their directions; implement outlined measures; and strive for progress so as to achieve "zero" breakthrough in their quest for gold medals in the next Winter Olympic Games. Wu Shaozu, minister of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, as well as He Zhenliang, Yuan Weimin, Xu Yinsheng, and Liu Ji, vice ministers of the commission, also attended the tea party and affirmed the Chinese delegation's achievements. They pointed out the athletes' inadequacies and encouraged them to strive for greater improvement and for the country's glory in the future.
