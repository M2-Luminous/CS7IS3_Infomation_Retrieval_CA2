The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, rebels have been blamed for that attack. This latest operation by the UNITA forces occurs at a time when military clashes are intensifying in Cuanza Norte Province. The government forces appear to be determined to wrest the city of N'dalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte Province, back from UNITA's hands. Reginaldo Silva, our correspondent in Luanda, provides the details: [Silva] The Angolan capital has again been deprived of the power supplied by Cambambe Dam, which lies slightly more than 180 km southeast of Luanda. The UNITA rebels have been accused of carrying out a major sabotage operation involving the Luanda-Cambambe powerlines on 2 April. The exact extent of the damage is not known yet. Official sources have said that at least four pylons near the actual dam were blown up. However, damage appears to have been far more extensive and pervasive than that and the results of the attack have already become visible: Luanda is partially in the dark and its residents are facing added and serious problems that will likely not be resolved in the short term. Alternative power supply sources include two gas turbines and a number of generators around Luanda, but they will probably be good for little more than 50 percent of the city's needs in a rotating system. The power supply company has already made its usual calls for consumers to use available power as sparingly as possible. That sabotage operation occurs at a time when various sources have reported fierce clashes to be under way in Cuanza Norte Province. Cambambe Dam is in that province and N'dalatando, the UNITA-held provincial capital, is seen as the major target for the government forces. The UNITA radio station has quoted UNITA sources as saying that the government forces have embarked on an offensive to recapture N'dalatando. The first such offensive failed recently, but new operations are under way aimed at that target. Though Cuanza Norte Province has always been beset by considerable tension, it is curious to note that the powerlines linking Luanda and Cambambe Dam had so far not been one of UNITA's military targets. The Angolan capital had in fact enjoyed a stable power supply for many months now. Observers feel that such power supply stability can be explained by a tacit accord between the two warring factions, because Cambambe Dam also provides power to the city of N'dalatando. Thus, Luanda's power supply would have been assured as long as the capital for Cuanza Norte Province also received it. Indications are that the tacit accord has been terminated and the next few days do not seem likely to bring any positive developments concerning peace for Angola. The intensification of military clashes in Angola precedes a UN Security Council meeting on that country scheduled to be held within the next two days. It is expected that the UN Security Council will issue a new resolution at a time when the Lusaka peace talks have ground down to a complete deadlock. This afternoon, we interviewed Afonso van Dunem Mbinda, the Angolan ambassador to the United Nations. We asked him what the Angolan Government would have liked to see the UN Security Council resolution include. [Mbinda] Our government would like to see that resolution include the following passage: That the UN Security Council has already decreed sanctions against UNITA. The second package of sanctions has not come into force yet because the UN Security Council has deemed that this is not the right time yet for imposing additional sanctions. I believe that was an opinion voiced by the UN Security Council some months ago. However, in view of UNITA's inflexibility and its failure to abide by the resolutions and recommendations of the UN Security Council, it is our belief that conditions are in place for new measures to be taken against UNITA. The additional measures alluded to by Angolan Ambassador to UN Afonso van Dunem Mbinda include, notably, the freezing of UNITA funds abroad and the imposition of restrictions on the movement of its representatives outside Angola. Seeing that the imposition of such sanctions has been put off on several occasions, we asked the Angolan ambassador to the United Nations why he thought such measures might be approved now. [Mbinda] This is a problem we have had with the UN Security Council. In all its meetings so far, the UN Security Council has been lenient about the introduction of additional sanctions against UNITA. Thus, everything hinges on the UN Security Council itself. We believe, however, that the UN Security Council has become so disappointed that it will take the necessary measures this time.
