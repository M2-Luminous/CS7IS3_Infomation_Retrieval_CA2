Niehaus, who in fact congratulated Gaviria, who defeated him 20-14 in a secret vote, delivered one of the most resentful speeches heard at the OAS within the past few years. According to what EFE could confirm in the hallways, although the speech did not diminish the organization's satisfaction over Gaviria's election, it took everyone by surprise, given the harshness of its vocabulary and the severity of its criticism, which at times teetered on being incredulously undiplomatic. Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin termed Niehaus' speech "an emotional reaction," while, for instance, her Ecuadoran colleague, Diego Paredes, considered it "unfair and hardly elegant" and "a bad end to a good campaign." Meanwhile, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella disputed many of Niehaus remarks, recalling that "in a democracy, one must learn how to lose." Di Tella said he believed that Niehaus' criticism about being discriminated against "was extremely harsh and cannot be accepted." Even so, Di Tella stressed, "one must not place great importance on statements made in the din of defeat." According to one South American diplomat who asked to remain anonymous, Niehaus "did not keep anything to himself, and, in his attempt to shake the structures, no one escaped his admonishment unscathed." According to Niehaus, what occurred today "creates deep doubts over the alleged right every state has to aspire to posts within the inter-American system." In his opinion, small countries "are denied access to the post of secretary general." He affirmed that in the OAS "large countries are first-class members, and, although they are fewer, they feel they should impose their will and criteria on countries they deem second-class members." This "hurts the system," Niehaus continued. Later, Niehaus accused some OAS member-nations of showing "little respect" for the "commitments made" and, despite having promised to support Costa Rica, "they did not honor their word and integrity, without even having the consideration to advise the Costa Rican Government they would withdraw their support." Within this context, the Costa Rican foreign minister assured that within the OAS "it will be difficult to ever again believe in a vote commitment." He added, "It is ironic that the OAS dispatches electoral observers to every corner of the hemisphere, and yet, within its own internal elections, it cannot guarantee that ethics and respect for prior commitments are observed." Moreover, Niehaus went beyond simply criticizing OAS member-states in general, and, while referring to the United States without naming it, he contended it was "inadmissible and regrettable" that there are countries that "disregard the most basic respect for foreign decisions, devoting themselves to exerting pressure and resorting to all kinds of mechanisms and nuances to force others to swing their votes." [passage omitted] Niehaus walked out of the room before the special assembly presided over by Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa concluded. [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2219 GMT on 27 March carries a 350-word report on the reaction of Costa Rican officials to Cesar Gaviria's 27 March election as OAS general secretary. Niehaus is quoted as saying in his speech that he wants to "ask OAS member-nations to reflect seriously on some of the issues that have come up in this election and what they might signify for the future of the Inter-American system." He says that the large member-nations of the OAS feel "it is their duty to impose their will and criteria on those nations they regard as second-class." NOTIMEX also says Niehaus "deplored the fact that some countries `cast their votes overboard,' alluding to those nations that initially voiced support for him but later withdrew this support when it came time to vote."]
