A Passion for...Energy"] [Text] [Valentik] Vitaliy Mikhaylovich, the subject of our discussion is the present and probable future of Moldovan energy engineering. But first--about the conflict between you and the institute's scientific council, which has been given unjustifiably broad publicity. You are accused of abuse of power, protectionism, incorrect use of funds allotted to the institute, and other sins. With the exception of the one article in MOLODEZH MOLDOVY, from the other publications the readers received essentially one-sided information about the essence of the conflict. And your silence in this situation seems somewhat strange. [Postolatiy] I admit that among the accusations that have been hurled at me there are some that are fair. But in the flow of fabrications, squabbles, and fact juggling they make up too small a part to cause us to believe that my opponents are really concerned about affairs of the institute and the development of energy engineering in Moldova. I have nothing against sweeping the garbage out of the hut and placing it in the garbage can. But my colleagues and subordinates have spread it out in the street for everyone to see, brought in garbage from the outside, and they shout: "Look at how neat and clean we are!" It seemed to me that my differences with that part of them, namely the part of the scholarly council, was a matter for within the institute. Therefore, if you will, out of delicacy I did not make a statement in response. Then, when the mass attack against me was turned into a witch hunt it was not easy to find a publication that would publish the arguments of the other side in spite of the relatively well-developed public opinion. [Valentik] Well, you have found such a publication. So what is the essence of the conflict? [Postolatiy] Last year the Ministry of the National Economy allotted us less money than was anticipated. I raised the question of its distribution at the scholarly council of the institute, which on 5 May adopted a decision regarding this issue. In particular, it decided to freeze certain work under the state order. And the job of dealing with the workers discharged in this was magnanimously assigned to the director. There was only one solution: to reduce the number of workers by 25-30 percent. But for our recently created institute it would be a great mistake to lose skilled personnel even in such an extreme situation. The general meeting of institute workers convened on my initiative arrived at the same opinion. Moreover, note, there was not a single objection. They started pouring down when on 31 May I issued an order for redistribution of budget funds taking the real situation into account. Certain members of the scholarly council regarded this as the director's disrespect for the decision they had adopted previously and they declared war on me. [Valentik] So first the scholarly council decided to reveal the truth by a majority of votes and then they decided to clarify it by an even larger majority. [Postolatiy] I set a more modest task for myself--to preserve the collective and fulfill the plan for scientific research work as completely as possible. [Valentik] As I understand it, the council is created in order to advise the director, and not to make decisions for him. You are the leader but, excuse me, not God's dandelion blown by the breath of others' opinions. Were you not motivated by a desire to share with the council the responsibility for the institute's affairs. [Postolatiy] Whatever the advice from the scholarly council may be, the responsibility is placed squarely on the shoulders of the director. In this case I did not want to make a decision that was not in keeping with the interests of the matter. After that it went like this...the Ministry of Economics granted us the right to change the volume of work. As a result of adjustments that were made the financial situation in the institute improved somewhat. Moreover, in conjunction with the scholarly council, we managed to decide the fate of the workers who had been left without wages. Now it was possible to adopt the council's previous recommendations of 5 May. I made this compromise for the sake of the cause. But not all the members of the scholarly council were satisfied with this outcome of the matter. As they say, give them an inch and they will take a mile. And they began an even more vicious attack on the director. August and September were a time when the institute was overwhelmed with full inspections. Defamatory statements, anonymous letters, and other charming things like this came pouring in. But not a single proposal about improving the institute's work was received from our opponents. There followed a resolution according to which the laboratory headed by the director was left essentially without funds. [Valentik] In that case you could sooner be accused of inability to wield power than abuse of it. As far as I know, even your irreconcilable enemies are not accusing you of incompetence or of violating the law either. The presidium of the Academy of Sciences considered you worthy of heading the institute in the future. And you probably cannot be held to blame for the thoughtlessness of members of the presidium. Why are your opponents still unable to make peace? What are they trying to achieve? [Postolatiy] Some of them want anyone at all to be the director as long as it is not me. [Valentik] But since you are the director, let us get down to business. In my view, something strange is happening with Moldova's energy potential now. The republic ships in almost all its fuel (98 percent) from other countries. It ships in less each year: in 1991--13 million tonnes of conventional fuel, in 1992--11.6 million. The output of electric energy is dropping correspondingly: from 13.2 billion kilowatt-hours in 1991 to 11.1 billion in 1992. In 1990 we produced 16 billion kilowatt-hours of electric energy. It was sufficient, but no more than that. Now the deficit is being felt in all spheres of the republic's life. The population has been deprived of hot water. The heating batteries are not heated to their full capacity. In order to avoid paying outrageous prices for electric energy, pensioners use stearine candles. Yet Moldova exports electric energy abroad. Particularly to Romania and Bulgaria. [Postolatiy] Our institute has nothing to do with the redistribution of fuel and electric energy. But do not forget that commercial structures now have the right to purchase energy sources and produce energy from them. They use some of it at their own discretion. As for the state sector, here the situation is different: Because of the sharp decline in production a kind of reserve of energy capacity has been created. [Valentik] So perhaps my colleague from the newspaper TSARA is right when, referring to the opinion of experts, he writes that "If we had an energy system with high-voltage lines in the countries of Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Turkey) we could export electric energy at advantageous prices and at the same time obtain a profit of approximately $50-70 million. [Postolatiy] In the first place, as one can see from his article, your colleague is confusing kilowatts with kilovolts; in the second place, apparently, he met his match in the experts. If you build a high-voltage transmission line, the immediate reason for doing so lies not in Turkey or Bulgaria, but in Moldova--with the prospect of entering the unified European energy system. As for the reserves of electric energy that have now been formed, this is a temporary, ephemeral phenomenon. The predictions of real specialists tell us that the consumption of fuel and energy resources by 1995 in our country will reach the 1990 level and will grow in accordance with the increase in production volumes. Here it is necessary to take into account that the proportional expenditure of energy resources on the manufacture of a unit of output in our country exceeds world indicators by 1.5-2 times. And our industry can hardly count on utilizing advanced energy-saving technologies--at least in the next decade. The situation now is such that our energy sector is being finished off as they try to skim of the good parts. And this is at a time when 44 percent of the republic's energy equipment has outlived its service life and needs to be replaced. We are "burning" our fixed capital, which is in need of modernization and development, for the sake of momentary advantage. We have an immense deficit in the financing of energy deliveries. The handling capacity of the republic's external electrical communications with our neighbors, especially Romania, is clearly inadequate. The schedule for loading in the energy system is not uniform--the fluctuations reach 30-40 percent of the maximum. In the next few years the situation could develop in such a way that energy engineering in Moldova will not be in a condition to provide the economy with electricity and heat in a balanced way. And they are talking to us about tens of millions in profit for exported electric energy! The basis of the strategic development of energy engineering is the provision of a self-balance of electric and thermal capacities. Calculations show that it will always be more advantageous to buy fuel resources than to import pure energy. This means that the development of generating capacities must become one of the most important areas in the development of energy engineering. [Valentik] In such an alarming situation, why are the funds received from the sale of electric energy abroad by the state sector not invested in the development of the republic's energy engineering? That would be only fair. [Postolatiy] That is necessary. But that question is not for me but for the republic government. [Valentik] Let us say that I asked it of the government. Vitaliy Mikhaylovich, the demand: "Give us what we need--today!" is the curse of all basic sciences. Your science, perhaps more than others, can be regarded as an applied science. What can your Institute do for Moldovan energy engineering today? [Postolatiy] Practical return is very important. But without basic research we would have nothing to give. The work of all 11 of the institute's laboratories encompasses problems of energy engineering almost to a maximum. They include modelling the development of energy systems and conditions for their operation; reliability of energy supply; controlled electricity distribution; microprocessor control systems; diagnostics of energy equipment; electro-physics and high voltage technology; controlled electric energy accumulators; economics, energy saving, automation, the application of computer equipment, etc. Along with other organizations we have drawn up a draft program for the development of energy engineering of Moldova up to the year 2010 and submitted it to the republic government. Speaking on the whole, the main direction of the institute's activity is to increase the effectiveness of energy systems and energy supply systems. [Valentik] It is known that you assign a significant role in the development of Moldovan energy engineering to extensive introduction of USVL (controlled self-compensating high voltage electric power transmission lines) and varieties of them--SVL [self-compensating high voltage power transmission lines] and VLSF [expansion not identified]. But some members of your institute's scholarly council have their doubts about the effectiveness of these lines and certain specialists from similar departments think that their introduction into practice is unpromising. Essentially the same conclusion was reached by the commission of the republic's Academy of Sciences. [Postolatiy] At the beginning of our discussion you correctly noted that it is impossible to establish the truth by a majority of votes. So I am convinced that the USVL and varieties of it are the immediate future for Moldovan energy engineering, and not just Moldovan. This is also shown by experience with their practical utilization. It would take us 10 years to convince specialists that, particularly with respect to power transmission lines with a voltage of 10 kilovolts, it would be possible to place high-voltage supports every 90-100 meters instead of 60-70. Now we will probably have to--God forbid that this will take 10 years too--convince many of my colleagues of the need to use USVL. And yet these lines provide for considerably greater reliability of electric power supply. Their application reduces the number of power failures by 30 percent, it reduces expenditures on servicing, transmission, and distribution of electric energy, it reduces losses of it by 2-4 percent, it increases the handling capacity by 15-40 percent, and it significantly reduces the impact on the environment. Among the opponents of the USVL are specialists--true, not many of them--who simply cannot understand that the future lies with these lines. That is, because of certain considerations they do not want to understand. I am prepared to discuss all issues with them under the condition that they not be guided by a desire to prove that they are right by any means but exclusively by the interests of the matter. [Valentik] Apparently the World Bank will grant Moldova credit in the amount of $30 million for the development of energy engineering with a rate of 7.5 percent. How, in your view, should this money be used? [Postolatiy] For transportation for the delivery of fuel and for storage facilities. This will be recouped 100-fold. For increasing the effectiveness of the processing and utilization of fuel. To do this it is necessary to update and reconstruct equipment. For reinforcement of energy ties with our neighbors, that is, the construction of high-voltage power transmission lines that link us to energy systems of Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, etc. For reinforcement of connections among energy systems inside the republic. Russia is proposing a joint project for the assimilation of the Yamal gas deposit and the deposits of Western Siberia. I think that it is simply necessary for Moldova to participate in them. Along with this it is necessary to study the possibility of obtaining fuel resources from other countries. [Valentik] We shall hope that we will not spread out the American credit among the various ministries and departments and...well, I wish success to your institute and to you, its leader.
