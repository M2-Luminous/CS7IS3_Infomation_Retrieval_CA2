It also condemned the current form of government in Haiti and announced its support for any measure that could guarantee the restoration of democracy in that Caribbean nation. The technical commissions preparing the Ibero-American Presidential Summit in Cartagena ended their first day of work with a firm rejection of any form of commercial restrictions, including economic blockades, and a call to Latin American governments to be more flexible toward foreign investments. For more than 12 hours, the representatives of Brazil, Colombia, Spain, Argentina, and Mexico worked on the final draft of a 15-page document to be signed by the 22 presidents who will meet in Cartagena starting tomorrow. In the document, the presidents openly condemn the current form of government in Haiti and give a green light to the implementation of exceptional measures to restore democracy on that island.

[end recording] [Begin Brazilian Deputy Foreign Minister Eduardo Farias recording] I believe this topic surely will be discussed by the presidents, but it is not included in the document we have prepared. [end recording] The document also recommends that the countries adopt specific plans to encourage social investment, reduce illiteracy, and extend coverage of public services to 70 percent of the inhabitants of the hemisphere. [Begin Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Luis Guillermo Grillo recording] The document calls for strengthening free trade. I would say it is a document with positive signs in all areas. [end recording] Tomorrow, the 22 foreign ministers and presidents of the countries participating in this Ibero-American Summit will make a final revision of the document, which without clearly referring to Haiti or Cuba, condemns commercial blockades and restrictive practices to restore democracies in some countries.
