This was said in a note sent by the Russian Foreign Ministry to the Turkish Embassy on April 29 in connection with the adoption of a navigation regulation in the Black Sea gulfs by the Turkish government, an official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Mikhail Demurin said at a news briefing in Moscow on Thursday. In his words, "a number of articles of the regulation adopted by Turkey envisages the procedure of passage through the gulfs and considerable restrictions up to the complete ban on such passage for certain categories of vessels depending on their length, draft, cargo, etc." Demurin said that these articles of the regulation go beyond issues of navigational safety and contradict international convention. In Demurin's opinion "the steps taken by the Turkish side regarding the gulfs can create unnecessary complications in this region. They should be perceived as an attempt to replace international regulation on this issue by domestic legislation."
