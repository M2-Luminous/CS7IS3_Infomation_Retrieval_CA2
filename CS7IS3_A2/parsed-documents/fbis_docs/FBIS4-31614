Radio Velkaton in Velika Kladusa, the APWB administrative centre, reported that apwb military and civilian targets along the entire fromtline were continuously attacked by moslem forces loyal to the Sarajevo-based central Moslem authorities headed by fundamentalist leader Alija Izetbegovic. The radio reported losses on both sides, but did not specify whether the frontline was moved. Izetbegovic's Radio Cazin and Radio Sarajevo reported fiercest clashes at Pecigrad and Todorov where Izetbegovic's forces strongly attack the APWB forces which were trying hard to defend themselves. Izetbegovic's media added that an APWB brigade changed sides and took hold of several hamlets around Todorovo in the past 24 hours, moving considerably the frontline. World news agencies, however, quoted Eric Chaperon, UNPROFOR (U.N. Protection Force) spokesman in Sarajevo, as stating that the APWB forces made an advance in the attack they began on Friday. Chaperon said that the Izetbegovic forces were suppressed from the line of contact in acute attacks which used heavy artillery and mortars, with losses indicated to have been suffered by both sides. Major Yvon Desjardins, UNPROFOR spokesman in Zagreb, specified that heavy fighting continued on Sunday morning in the central and western sections of the Bihac pocket in the APWB territory, whence reports came about APWB leader Fikret Abdic forces' opening artillery and tank-gun fire. Maj. Desjardins, however, could not immediately confirm the reports that Izetbegovic's forces had lost some of their territories. Fikret Abdic, the opponent of the war option backed by Alija Izetbegovic, last autumn proclaimed the APWB (Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia) and immediately agreed a truce with Bosnian Serbs and Croats.
