According to our sources, intensive preparations and talks on a new organization of the Slovene Intelligence-Security Agency SOVA and the Security Organ of the Defense Ministry VOMO are underway. A working draft of the Law on SOVA, which will appear as strictly confidential on the agenda of a close session of Bucar's commission for the supervision of intelligence agencies this month, has stirred sentiments in the secret services. At one of many meetings of acting directors of intelligence services Drago Fers and Dusan Mikus, and Defense and Interior Ministers Janez Jansa and Ivan Bizjak, they have supposedly agreed on a new division of interest and working spheres. According to this information, the Interior Ministry will take over entirely the counterintelligence activities in March this year, while SOVA will primarily retain the intelligence work abroad. Dr. Drago Fers, who, following the resignation of Silvan Jakin, is acting director until the appointment of a SOVA director, has confirmed the expert meetings at the "highest level," but adamantly denied any sort of tripartite agreement, that is to say, any division according to which one service would cede some or all activity to another service. It is all about covering gray areas, Fers assures and stresses the functional division, according to which SOVA will deal with intelligence activities exclusively, that is to say, gathering information abroad, while the protection, that it so say, counterintelligence activities will be taken over by the criminal department of the Interior Ministry, which has already performed these activities since the change of the regime. Namely, SOVA is not authorized for possible court investigation in proving criminal activities aimed against the state, that is to say, undermining the constitutional order at home, but can merely confirm the connection of the accused with foreign intelligence services. As Fers assures, they have been coordinating spheres of action at these meetings and exchanged views on the formation of the entire security-intelligence system. According to Drago Fers, SOVA has completely broken off with the former political police, which chiefly used to monitor and prove enemy activities, that is to say, the existence of the internal enemy, as over two-thirds of the information in the past was counterintelligence information. It will, of course, not completely abandon its protective role. It is supposed to share with VOMO some intelligence tasks abroad for which there is, understandably, no legal basis. Namely, both services are active abroad and could resolve certain tasks more efficiently together, Fers says. Hints about the final dismantling of SOVA have also trickled into the public because of fear that, due to the specialization of SOVA's work, more old agents, who were supposedly linked to the old generation of politicians, would lose their jobs. The fact that the methods of ruling are actually the same and that intelligence services are at their core on the basis of events in the secret services spurred numerous speculations and criticism of possible political misuse, that is to say, a political background to the above-mentioned reorganization within these services. SOVA, which has gone through numerous reorganizations already, was allegedly not reliable enough for the political right wing, and for this reason the police, that is to say, Interior Minister Bizjak would take over the counterintelligence segment, which is, of course, the most interesting for the politicians. Jansa's service, which concentrates primarily on military problems, will stay divided into intelligence and counterintelligence sections. As Drago Fers assures, SOVA and VOMO would primarily divide duties in the realm of intelligence work, which amounts to approximately one-third of all data. The skeptics believe that the entire debate is all about political games and less about concern for national security, because it allegedly involves a controlled disintegration of the Slovene intelligence system, that is to say, the dismantling of the former State Security Service. Leaving aside the rumors that a restructuring of the political scene is in the background, our sources claim that a positive scenario of the reconstruction of the security system, which will primarily have to assume the responsibility for protection of the Slovene strategic economic interests abroad, is nevertheless underway. Despite the formal position of the intelligence service, Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek has supposedly remained without strategic information and analyses. As we have learned, the experts from the United States, that is to say, Clinton's state security adviser personally, have also been drawn into expert assistance in the organization of the Slovene intelligence system. Regarding all this, it would be worth mentioning the announcement of Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek that he will activate a special service within his cabinet on 15 February. This service will, despite a rather unambitious task of overcoming bureaucratic obstacles and helping the citizens, that is to say, dealing with the problems of a little man, not be able to completely avoid a sort of intelligence activities, primarily because of the avalanche of anonymous letters that supposedly report cases of unlawful privatization, theft, illicit activities in the economic domain, and, above all, corruption and other matters in the pasts of several ministers, for which they should say goodbye to public life. According to some information, changes in the leaderships of both intelligence services should also take place in March, which would conclude the experimental phase in the appointment of directors of the intelligence services. State security systems all over the world consist of intelligence and counterintelligence segments, while the services protecting the constitutional order are, naturally, also a part of the repertoire, regardless of how conservative this sounds. The division of SOVA into intelligence and counterintelligence parts can only be confirmation of the normalization in the Slovene secret services. The most dangerous thing is a concentration of great power within the intelligence system.
