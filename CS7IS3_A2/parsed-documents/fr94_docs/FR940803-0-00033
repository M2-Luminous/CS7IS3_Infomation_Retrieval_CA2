FR940803-0-00033 FR940803-0-00013 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;106&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8990; AD 94&hyph;16&hyph;01] Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Industrie Model A340&hyph;211 and &hyph;311 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A340&hyph;211 and &hyph;311 series airplanes. This action requires modifying the bonding leads on the fuel quantity indicating (FQI) probes or the temperature sensor, on the fuel low pressure inlet pipe next to the compensator, and on the jet pump. This amendment is prompted by results of a quality survey, which revealed that there may be insufficient clearance between several bonding leads and certain FQI system probes or the temperature sensor, and between the bonding leads and the FQI probes and the compensator. The actions specified in this AD are intended to eliminate such insufficient clearance, which could lead to electrical arcing and a resultant fire in the event of a lightning strike. DATES: Effective August 18, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 18, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before October 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;106&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Airbus Industrie, 1 Rond Point Maurice Bellonte, 31707 Blagnac Cedex, France. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register , 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Slotte, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2797; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Industrie Model A340&hyph;211 and &hyph;311 series airplanes. The DGAC advises that results of a quality survey conducted by Airbus Industrie have revealed that there may be insufficient clearance between several bonding leads and certain fuel quantity indicating (FQI) system probes or the temperature sensor. Further, insufficient clearance also may exist between the bonding leads and the FQI probes in the inner collector cell and the compensator. Such insufficient clearance, if not corrected, could result in electrical arcing and a resultant fire in the event of a lightning strike. Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A340&hyph;28&hyph;4008, dated July 9, 1993, which describes procedures for modifying the bonding leads on the FQI probes or the temperature sensor. This modification involves installing shorter bonding leads and/or rerouting certain bonding leads on the water drain pipe, the engine fuel feed pipe, the fuel recirculation pipe, the vent pipe, and the surge tank drain pipe. Accomplishment of this modification will maintain the correct clearance between the bonding leads and the FQI probes or the temperature sensor. The DGAC classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 93&hyph;120&hyph;002(B), dated August 4, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. Airbus Industrie also has issued Service Bulletin A340&hyph;28&hyph;4012, dated November 8, 1993, which describes procedures for modifying the bonding leads on the fuel low pressure inlet pipe (next to the compensator) and on the jet pump. This action involves installing a sleeve on the bonding lead on the fuel pipe at certain FQI probes in the inner collector cell and installing shorter bonding leads on the fuel pipe at the compensator. Accomplishment of this modification will maintain the correct clearance between the bonding leads and the FQI probes and compensator. The DGAC classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 93&hyph;206&hyph;003(B), dated December 8, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of §21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.19) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent electrical arcing and a resultant fire in the event of a lightning strike. This AD requires modifying the bonding leads on the FQI probes or the temperature sensor, on the fuel low pressure inlet pipe next to the compensator, and on the jet pump. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.
