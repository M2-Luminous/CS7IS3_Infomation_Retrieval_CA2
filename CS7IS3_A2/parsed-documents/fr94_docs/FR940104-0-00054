FR940104-0-00054 FR940104-0-00015 Along with this option, various testing and recordkeeping requirements were proposed. For an owner/operator to demonstrate that he/she is not generating F033 wastes, EPA proposed formulation testing requirements for all surface protection plants. All owner/operators of wood surface protection plants would be required to test their formulation to determine the concentration of pentachlorophenate if the owner/operators wanted to avoid generating F033 wastes. If the analysis showed a concentration at or below 0.1 ppm, the owner/operator would be required to sign a certification to that effect and maintain records on site related to the testing procedure. This testing proposed an analysis using a method listed within the EPA's Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods (SW&hyph;846). The Agency proposed to add Method 4010 to SW&hyph;846. Method 4010 is an immunoassay test for the presence of pentachlorophenol, which determines whether a sample is above or below a set limit (such as the 0.1 ppm concentration level proposed). Under the proposal, if analysis showed that a facility's formulation contains pentachlorophenate at levels exceeding 0.1 ppm, then the wastes generated from surface protection at that facility would be F033 wastes and the owner/operator would be subject to additional operating requirements proposed as subpart T of parts 264 and 265. For details on the specific operating requirements, the reader should refer to the proposed notice (58 FR 25706). A number of the constituents of concern that are present in wastes generated from wood surface protection processes which use chlorophenolic formulations do not appear on the list of hazardous constituents at 40 CFR part 261, appendix VIII. The Agency proposed to add six hazardous constituents to appendix VIII: sodium pentachlorophenate, potassium pentachlorophenate, the sodium salt of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol, the potassium salt of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol, octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) and octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF). Sodium and potassium pentachlorophenate are the sodium and potassium salts of pentachlorophenol. These salts were proposed for addition to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261 since, as a result of gastric secretions following ingestion, the sodium and potassium salts of pentachlorophenol and 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol are readily converted to the corresponding phenols by acidification. Therefore, the sodium and potassium salts are reasonably expected to elicit the same health effects as the corresponding phenols. For this reason, the Agency proposed to add these four compounds to the list of hazardous constituents in appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. The Agency also requested comment on an option not to list as hazardous wastes generated from surface protection processes. The Agency included the so-called ``no-list'' option in the proposal because the future generation of chlorophenolic wastes is expected to diminish rapidly to zero and because the results of risk analyses show that the risks from the dominant exposure pathways are relatively modest, assuming the widespread use of chlorophenolic formulations does not resume. The Agency believed at the time of the proposal that reintroduction of chlorophenolic formulations into the market place in the future was not likely to occur. EPA also noted that the Agency would always have the option of reconsidering the listing determination should chlorophenolic surface protection formulations be reintroduced in the future.
