Historic changes have taken place in China's economy since its opening to the outside world. The country now ranks 11th in the world, making up two percent of the world's total trade volume. But 15 year ago it followed 31 other countries, accounting for no more than one percent of the world's total trade volume. China's imports and exports hit 195.8 billion U.S. Dollars last year, five times over the 1978 figure. They now occupy about one-third of the country's gross national product (GNP) and one-fifth of the country's GNP comes from its exports. To standardize its trade regulations in line with international practice, China has sped up foreign trade reforms. Now licence is required on only 138 varieties of commodities before they can be exported, 52 percent less than the figure for 1978. At present all but 16 varieties of special exports can be freely exported. As for imports, China has lowered its import tariffs twice following its elimination of the import adjustment tax. The tariff rate is now 7.3 percent lower than that of 1978. China is also learning from foreign countries' experience in economic, financial and business management. A shareholding system is being established in its state-run enterprises. A financial system in the framework of the central bank, specialized banks and commercial banks is also being built in the country. Price reforms are continued for the establishment of a unified and open market system. The unified exchange rate system China has adopted since January this year is helping the country to achieve even more in its opening-up to the outside world. China has made itself an ideal place for foreign investment through opening up its huge potential market and implementing international practices. China has so far drawn foreign investment from more than 100 countries and regions. Six percent of the country's total industrial output value comes from its foreign-venture enterprises, and their imports and exports make up more than one-quarter of the country's total imports and exports. By the end of 1993, 167,500 foreign investment enterprises had registered for operation in China. Moreover, foreign investment now ranges from finance, real estate and insurance to retail sales, foreign trade and business information services. China has encouraged its enterprises to compete with foreign enterprises overseas. Some Chinese enterprises have set up branch ventures in foreign countries, bought foreign enterprises, partaken of shareholding in foreign enterprises and issued stocks abroad. By June 1993, China had set up 4,453 enterprises with a total investment of more than five billion U.S. dollars in other countries and regions. Meanwhile, contract labor service cooperation has been expanded to more than 160 countries and regions. So far, China has opened to the outside world a total of 500,000 square kilometers of its area, including 339 cities and counties with a total population of 320 million.
