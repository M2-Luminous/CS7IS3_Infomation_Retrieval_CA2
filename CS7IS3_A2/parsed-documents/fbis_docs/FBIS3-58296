[Prime Minister] Cavaco Silva told RTP in Brussels that Portugal advocates a new accord [with the United States] oriented more toward cooperation and less toward defense. It is possible that the quid pro quos for the use of the base might materialize in the shape of development programs for the archipelago. Antonio Esteves Martins reports: [Martins] A strengthening of transatlantic ties, reaffirmed at this [NATO] summit, is in line with the Portuguese position. Because of its geographical and strategical position, Portugal warmly welcomes the U.S. stance. [Begin recording] [Cavaco] We are very happy with President Clinton's declaration. It is a strong stake in cooperation with Europe, clearly stating that the security of the United States is not separate from that of Europe. It is also a commitment to keeping a strong U.S. presence in Europe. [Martins] Strong but reduced. This means that the U.S. position in the old continent will henceforth be less important. In practice, will this strengthen the Azores' negotiating position on the eve on the conclusion of the accord on the Lajes base? [Cavaco] Of course, the importance of the Azores for the defense of the Western world has been made clearer. But I said it is our contribution. The Azores are not a bargaining chip for us to obtain something specific for Portugal. It represents our clear involvement in a more secure Europe, and a more stable Europe. [Martins] In this light, the future accord which might be concluded before Easter will be a cooperation and not a defense accord? [Cavaco] A cooperation which includes defense and security aspects, but not exclusively. It will be more extensive. [Martins] In addition, will any money emerging from this accord be directly invested in the development of the region? [Cavaco] There is military cooperation and there are other forms of cooperation, such as scientific and in the education sector. We have entered a new phase of the transatlantic relationship, because do not forget that at the moment the European security identity is also being implemented. Thank you. [end recording]
