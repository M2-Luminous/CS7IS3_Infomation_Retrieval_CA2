The agency has summed up the results of its work for a year. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA publishes fragments from the report on Wednesday. The economic reform is in the focus of the Control Agency's attention. It follows the implementation of the president's decree on urgent measures for land reform. Radical restructuring of agricultural production has been carried out as a result of implementing provisions of the decree. Measures to privatise considerable part of land used by collective and state farms have been implemented. As many as 23,798 economies, or 93 per cent of their total number, have been reorganised and reregistered as of October 1, 1993. As many as 14,540 joint-stock companies, peasant economies associations, partnerships and farming cooperatives have been formed on the basis of reregistered economies. 267 thousand peasant (farmer) economies having a total of 11.2 million hectares of land have also been set up. At the same time surveys indicated that the pace of the land reform is not quite rapid in a number of regions. Sometimes new forms of farming economies are not backed by heads of local administrations. There were delays about providing plots of land to citizens in the Altay and Krasnodar territories, Omsk and Vladimir regions. Executive authorities and heads of collective and state farms are to blame for this. Sometimes they even put oblstacles to the distribution of plots of land. Sanctions envisaged for law violations have not been appllied. Gross violations of the land legislation were made during the privatisation of land. The pace of the setting up of peasant economies in the country has slackened. As many as 47 thousand peasant economies were formed in the first quarter of 1993, 28,300 in the second quarter, 7,200 in the third quarter and only 3,400 in October and November. What is more, 15,700 peasant economies gave up their plots of land by late 1993. Farmers are not given the necessary material and technical support, are unsatisfactorily supplied with funds and other resources. Quite often they are given plots unsuitable for farming. As many as 117 peasant economies, or 6.2 per cent, were liquidated for this reason in the Ryazan region by early October in 1993. More than 500 peasant economies, or 16 per cent, were liquidated in the Sverglovsk region. Funds allocated by the state to aid farmer economies are quite often spent for other purposes. The enhancing of the efficiency of farmers is checked by delayed payment for the produced and marketed output. The state owes more than 800 billion roubles to grain growers. Efforts of officials of the control agency were also aimed at veryfying the implementation of the Russian president's decrees "On the Speedy Privatisation of State and Municipal Entreprises", "On Organisational measures To Transform State-Run Entreprises and Voluntary Associations of State Entreprises into Joint-Stock Companies", "On the Regulation of Lease and Privatisation of Property of Leased State and Municipal Entreprises". During checks special attention was given to enhancing the effectiveness of privatised facilities. Checks indicated that committees for the management of the state property of territories and regions in many cases failed duly to organise privatisation of state property and veryfication of the procedure. Questions of turning entreprises into joint-stock companies are resolved with delay. State funds resulting from privatisation are sometimes used for other purposes. The Russian president's decree envisaging that the transformation of state-run entreprises and their voluntary associations into joint-stock companies be completed in 1992 has not been fullfield completely in all of the surveyed regions. According to the information of the Russian State Property Committee, out of the 4,859 entreprises that were to be turned into joint-stock companies, only 2,545 joint-stock companies, or just over half the expected number, were registered as of December 1, 1993.
