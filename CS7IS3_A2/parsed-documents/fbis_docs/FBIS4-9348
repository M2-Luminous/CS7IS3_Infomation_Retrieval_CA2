I was surprised to learn that the trade exchange between Bulgaria and Slovakia is shamefully small, and we agreed to encourage contacts between businessmen from the two countries, our foreign minister said. He said that it is necessary to review the contractual-legal basis between Bulgaria and Slovakia and sign a trade agreement in May.
