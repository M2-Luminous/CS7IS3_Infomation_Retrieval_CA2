Nonetheless, he recently delivered a speech at a closed session of the Free Russia People's Party [FRPP], of which he is the chairman. He introduced a number of comments and suggestions to the drafts of the party's policy statement and statute, which are to be adopted at the second FRPP congress in late May this year: "We must determine more precisely our party's aims and ways of achieving them in order to attract as many supporters as possible to our side -- for victory at the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary elections. Our party must be mass-based. Achieving this will be hard but feasible: After all, in all corners of Russia there are people in sympathy with us...." A. Rutskoy announced that he is now working on the books Collapse of Power [Krusheniye derzhavy] and Acquiring Faith [Obreteniye very] which he began writing in his cell in Lefortovo prison. In the next few months the book Collapse of Power will be completed.
