Our station commentator (Krichevskiy) writes: Pyongyang has taken a new, very dangerous measure to beef up its confrontation with the international community. By so doing, Pyongyang tries to free itself from the IAEA's intervention with regard to the nuclear issue. However, this measure does not mean that the DPRK can ignore the IAEA's right to continue the inspections. This is because the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] stipulates such a right. The DPRK is still a signatory of this treaty. Pyongyang's decision immediately has caused a greater worry worldwide. A problem facing governments of many countries and the United Nations is what they should do. The United States more strongly demands that sanctions be imposed immediately. Russia has begun to refer to sanctions more often. Russia does not like to see a country -- that violates the NPT and possesses nuclear weapons -- appear in its neighborhood. Russia does not like to see the situation along its border aggravated, either. However, sanctions will inevitably bring such results. Therefore, Moscow has tenaciously pursued the possibility of imposing sanctions step by step and a proposal for convening an international conference attended by representatives of Russia, China, the United States, the DPRK, the ROK, the IAEA, and the United Nations. There have been some results. After talking to U.S. President Clinton over telephone on 14 June, President Yeltsin said that they agreed to convene an international conference on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. They assigned the Russian Foreign Ministry and the U.S. Secretary of State to the task of linking the issue of holding of the international conference to the issue of imposing sanctions on the DPRK step by step. China still plays an important role in coping with the crisis. China expresses a grave worry over the DPRK's decision and the future development of the situation on the Korean peninsula. Observers say that as it did before, Beijing opposes sanctions on the DPRK, demands the resumption of direct talks between Korea [choson] and the United States, and keeps silent on Russia's proposal for convening an international conference with China in attendance. In short, a complicated situation is prevailing. However, there is still hope. This will be especially true if Pyongyang signals aspirations for resolving the complex knot, instead of bringing the issue to a deadlock.
