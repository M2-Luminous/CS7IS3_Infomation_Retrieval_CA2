This was where foreign delegations and teams of journalists were taken to be vividly shown the "locomotive of privatization" with all its tenders, check auctions for pistons, and investment trading sessions for boilers. However, a year later the American nonprofit organization Heritage Foundation published the results of its independent expert review of the operation of this "locomotive." The authors met with a number of entrepreneurs engaging in production and commercial operations and familiarized themselves directly with the operation of privatized enterprises and shops in the city. The fact that large state enterprises try in every way possible to avoid the sale of their shares on the open market in the course of privatization was the first discovery the Americans made. The enterprises resort to reserving a considerable proportion of the stock for the management of the enterprise and distributing shares among the workers at symbolic prices, as well as transforming the most profitable state enterprises into privately held joint-stock companies. A note of surprise can be felt in another observation: Large investors are buying state enterprises out of...state credit, although in civilized countries, the seed capital for such purchases is generated by the investors themselves through issuing their stock, before the credit is extended. Moreover, Russian officials extend credit in a somewhat suspect manner, "without appropriate security," being guided in the process by "motives far removed from those of a market economy" (what a cultured way to put it!). Following a discourse about a shortage of capital for privatization, vouchers were faulted too. So far, this "measure has failed to produce real results and was a political rather than economic measure" called upon to mitigate social tensions, which is what some of us guessed long ago. Of course, a profitable and effective enterprise can be sold to its employees in the expectation that it will keep working just as smoothly. However, as the experience of the Americans indicated, the expectation that workers would work better on becoming owners has not been confirmed in reality. The management is not capable of managing the enterprise effectively, knowing that it may be fired at any moment by employees who are unhappy with the high requirements imposed on them. The Americans encountered one eye-opener after another: Model samples of contracts between the management of enterprises and the former organ of property management as represented by the state or municipality are foisted on enterprises. The system of issuing licenses to operate becomes an additional source of pressure on privatized enterprises brought to bear by state structures. The authors of the analytical review plunged into the thick of the entrepreneurial masses, unlike the small groups of Western experts who, it is noted with a measure of sarcasm, pay sporadic visits to Nizhniy Novgorod, where they spend a few days in consultation with representatives of the power structure. Glaring facts are stated with alarm: Producers pay value-added tax, although the goods may not have been purchased by consumers. Retroactive amendments to tax legislation compel the payment of taxes on operations which at the moment of their performance were not taxed. Any reporting by state officials on the disbursement of funds collected for a certain "highway fund" is absent. Although everyone to a man pays this strange tax, the condition of the roads in Nizhniy Novgorod remains poor. There have been no changes in the tax system conducive to privatization in Nizhniy Novgorod; on the contrary, a new tax for maintenance of the housing stock (1.5 percent) has been introduced. The discovery of the last "eye-opener" caused the altogether divine horror: The total of all taxes comes to 75-85 percent, world practice pointing to no more than 35 percent. The fact remains, the authors themselves stress, that privatization of state property is proceeding at a high rate, but "genuine" results have not been registered so far. Why? I also visited a demonstration check auction together with one of the teams of journalists. At a cocktail party given by Western consultants I tormented several directors with this question--will "their" privatized enterprises operate "capitalist-style," i.e., in an effective and competitive manner? The captains of industry kept their enigmatic silence and smiled politely in response to the naive question. Their smiles betrayed the wisdom of life and the knowledge of something that was obvious to them but beyond me. The answer to this question also remains a mystery to the authors of the analytical review, although they did share their thinking on this account. First, privatization is not carried out to find additional sources for replenishing the budget. Second (the hint is not as heavy but likewise understandable), with our type of privatization, some officials are getting an opportunity to pressure private investors (apparently, the Russian word "extortion" is meant), while other officials "who are privy to privatization" are getting a chance to "keep their positions in the economic sphere." At this point we would like to add that the "former" and the "latter" may be one and the same. Third, it turns out that state structures that are burdened by debt strive to sell enterprises placed under their control at the highest possible prices to--oh horror!--foreigners. In turn, the foreigners have to pay not only the state but also directly the officials responsible for privatization. Easy credit is necessary for the buyout of small trade, public catering, and consumer-service enterprises (oh holy simplicity!) instead of the endless discussion by the state authorities of the dilemma as to whether leased enterprises (for which leasing rights were purchased at auctions, to boot) are to be transferred to lessees as their property or not. The authors observed that the model of providing Western assistance should be revised. The funds are used mainly to enrich the individuals engaging in their distribution; technical assistance boils down to organizing seminars abroad for the officials of state establishments. In an elegant bow, the authors hope that the issues raised in their analytical review will generate a discussion. We hope so too.
