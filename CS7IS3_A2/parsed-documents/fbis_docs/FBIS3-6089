In the interview, he stressed: "France-Japan cooperation in settling the issue concerning the reconstruction of Cambodia is a good example of cooperation between the two countries. On the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, it is possible for the two countries to make joint efforts to settle the ethnic strife there." In addition, he said: "In the tripolar structure among European nations, Japan, and the United States, strengthening relations between European nations and Japan is urgently needed." Regarding the United States' reinstatement of the Super 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade Act (sanctions measures against unfair trade partners), he expressed concern over the U.S. move, saying: "The United States' attitude is very much like someone sitting at a negotiating table on trade issues with a gun at their side." The Japan-France Commission plans to submit to Prime Ministers Hosokawa and Balladur in the near future a report discussing relations between Japan and France in the long-term. He said the report will include a statement saying "it is important to improve bilateral economic relations."
