Despite a smaller crop acreage for 1993, the total output value that year still exceeded 1992, a bumper harvest year, by 291,000 tonnes. The peasants' per-capita net income for last year rose for the first time to 860 yuan, the national level of peasant income. Closely related to peasant income, township and town enterprises also achieved major breakthroughs and a 115.39 percent increase in total output value last year. Government officials in charge of agricultural affairs here characterized last year's agricultural economy as "simultaneous growth on three fronts:" Simultaneous growth in total agricultural output value and peasants' per-capita income; in grain and cash crops; and in farming and breeding industries. The rural economy has been developing steadily every year in this ethnic autonomous region, which previously lagged behind in economic development. Zhao Fulin, secretary of the Guangxi Regional CPC Committee, pointed out in analyzing the recent increasing momentum of growth of the region's rural economy: Guangxi has done much in recent years to strengthen rural work, improve and adjust rural economic structures, and develop township and town enterprises and has achieved much in developing sub-tropical forestry and orchard cultivation and concentrating on its strong points. From this, Zhao Fulin felt that, as long as the road is right and the measures implemented are effective, the provinces and regions which got a late start can also eliminate poverty and become comparatively well-off, and the prospect of tens of thousands of peasants getting rich is not so remote.
