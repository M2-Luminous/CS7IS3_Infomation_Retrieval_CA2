Visiting Argentina within the framework of a Latin American tour that also includes Chile, Brazil, Venezuela, and Ecuador, Shumeyko ruled out the possibility of any armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine despite last week's crisis in Crimea. Asked during a news conference in Buenos Aires about the Kremlin's possible reaction to an armed effort by Kiev to quench Crimea's efforts to achieve independence, Shumeyko responded: "I do not believe Ukraine will use force." [CLARIN] Why? [Shumeyko] Because it is impossible. It is simply impossible, the senator emphasized. He made it clear he is making this tour as a representative of the Russian state and not as a representative of the Senate alone. [CLARIN] Should Crimea be Russian? [Shumeyko] Neither Russian nor Ukrainian. I believe it is necessary to focus on the basics of the problem. Nowadays, Russia is economically better off than Ukraine. For Crimea to become Russian territory is tantamount to becoming subordinate to a stronger currency, earning higher wages, and enjoying other benefits. We respect Ukraine's sovereignty and the Ukrainian people's desire to organize their own lives. Nowadays, Russian support for Crimean authorities is economic. The rest depends on Ukraine's stance. [CLARIN] The true issue under discussion involves the Sebastopol base and the Black Sea fleet, but the negotiations on splitting are bogged down. What is likely to happen? [Shumeyko] Russia does not want the fleet to be split. The politicians now are playing this card, but they are aware of the fact that the problem does not involve the fleet's command but its existence. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is able to separately maintain such a powerful fleet. [CLARIN] Concerning Russian domestic politics, the unending disputes between groups struggling for and against the reforms frequently jeopardize Russia's frail democratic stability. What is the current situation? [Shumeyko] I would say now there are no sharp disputes at the domestic political level. I believe rather that both the conservatives and the reformists have changed to such an extent that now it is difficult to clearly distinguish who is who. For example, the communists accept private property and religion. In today's Russia, we might say there is not a single true communist, but there is not a single true democrat either. Except for the extremists, everyone agrees that the reforms must be carried out. [CLARIN] And Zhirinovskiy? [Shumeyko] Zhirinovskiy too. Of course, with his own interpretation. We require stability in order to implement the reforms. Therefore, President Boris Yeltsin proposed signing a national consensus agreement to strengthen the Russian state.
