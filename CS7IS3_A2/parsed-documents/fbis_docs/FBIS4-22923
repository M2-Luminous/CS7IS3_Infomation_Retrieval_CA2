To this end, 28 male Vistar rats exposed to an external background radiation of 4 mR/h in Khoynik rayon of Gomel oblast for one month and 28 animals exposed to an external background radiation of 0.4 mR/h in Rechitsy rayon of Gomel oblast for five months are examined. The rats received an equivalent internal and external doses of 0.0141 and 2.52 rem, respectively, in the first group and 0.0021 and 1.44 rem in the second. The control group was exposed to an external background of 0.011-0.014 mR/h at the Minsk Medical School. The enzymatic antioxidant protection system indicators and the concentration of the lipid peroxidation products were compared to those of the control group. The experimental procedure is outlined. The reduced glutathion concentration and the glutathion peroxidase concentration in the liver and erythrocytes in group 2 rats are summarized. The study shows a marked increase in the lipid peroxidation product content in the irradiated animals; the superoxide dismutase activity in the animals exposed to a lower irradiation dose was much higher than that in the control group, attesting to stressed compensatory mechanisms which usually neutralize free oxygen radicals forming under the effect of ionizing radiation.
