Today it is only 53 percent who think that the country's economic situation reduces security, while just six months ago this figure was 78 percent. Concerning a Finnish membership in the European Union [EU], currently 48 percent of Finns are in favor, compared with 41 percent six months year ago. These results appear in an opinion poll that the Finnish Gallup organization has conducted for the Planning Commission for Defense Information. To find out views of Finns regarding security policy issues, Gallup conducted personal interviews with around 1,000 individuals during April and May. Unemployment was considered by 50 percent to be a factor diminishing national security, compared with 80 percent with this view six months ago. Thirty percent of Finns would raise defense expenditures, whereas six months ago, 27 percent would have liked to see them raised, and a year ago 14 percent. Half of those interviewed would like to maintain defense appropriations at the present level, and 17 percent would reduce them. A half year ago the figures were 51 and 19 percent, respectively. The attitude toward defense spending is now the same as it was before the Great Depression. Men continued to be more amenable to raising defense expenditures than women. Thirty-four percent of men favored raised appropriations, contrasted with 25 percent for women. The opinion barometer also indicated that the proportion of EU proponents has also increased. Currently, 48 percent of voters are positive toward it, compared with 41 percent six months ago. Thirty-one percent oppose membership today, while 36 percent opposed this six months ago. Twenty percent were undecided, compared with 22 percent in the previous poll. The figure regarding the national security situation has not changed. Over half of Finns, or 57 percent, see the future as uncertain over the next five years. Six months earlier, this figure was 55 percent. A fifth of those surveyed do not think the situation is going to change, and another fifth think the future will be more secure than formerly. When those interviewed were given clear alternatives to factors or phenomena affecting national security, 87 percent replied that nuclear power facilities in Russia is the thing that is most responsible for reducing security in Finland.
