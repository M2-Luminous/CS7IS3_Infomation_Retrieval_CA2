Answering questions about the Ames' affair and also about the events linked to the visit of Former U.S. President Richard Nixon to Moscow, the Russian foreign minister expressed an opinion that there were certain circles both in the United States and Russia that did not like the idea of cooperation between Russia and the United States, especially strategic cooperation. A. Kozyrev added that Russian-U.S. relations will continue to be based on the principles stated in the Moscow Declaration. This partnership is strategic and mature and its main features are community of interests and close contacts. Commenting on the situation in former Yugoslavia at the request of journalists, the Russian foreign minister noted that the decisions of the Security Council envisaged the use of force in extreme cases. He explained that this refers, for example, to attacks on peacekeeping formations. We adhere to this principle, Kozyrev said. The Russian peacekeepers, he stressed, should not be hostages to the tension in the region. Analyzing the prospects for a settlement in the Near East following his trip to the region, the leader of Russian diplomacy pointed out that at present one of the main aims is to complete the talks on the Gaza sector and Jericho. Only after that will it be possible, in his opinion, to convene a new Madrid Conference in one form or another. Speaking of his planned short visit to Tajikistan after his Vladivostok meeting, Kozyrev pointed out that such a trip presents a good opportunity to hold talks both with the government and the opposition. He said he would try to visit the Tajik-Afghan frontier in order to support Russian border guards. The minister said in the extreme case we are prepared for a rebuff, but our choice is dialogue, which should begin shortly. Commenting upon the reports on the possible use of Western countries' peacekeeping forces in Georgia, the minister said that he did not yet see a real opportunity for that. He said that this question might be one of the topics discussed in Vladivostok.
