Kim Chong-u, North Korea's vice chairman of External Economy Commission, met in January with the East European source who was working in Pyongyang at the time and said that military expenditures are a heavy burden to North Korea's economic development, the source said. Kim's remarks show a change in North Korea's economic policy, KYODO said. Kim was quoted as saying that Asia is achieving the most rapid economic growth in the world and emphasizing that North Korea should strengthen its cooperative relations with Asian countries in the economic field. According to KYODO, Kim said that North Korea wants economic cooperation with any Asian countries including capitalist nations if they are not opposed to North Korean political system and that North Korea wants to join the APEC in the end. If the military expenditure is reduced, North Korea's economy can be revitalized quickly and the North Koreans' living standard will be improved, Kim added.
