Haitian Ambassador to the United Nations Fritz Longchamp confirmed on 18 January that the international community is considering increasing the sanctions. This decision was made after the failure of the talks with the military for relaunching the application of the Governors Island accord. Rothschild Francois, Junior reports: [Begin Francois recording] We are perhaps moving toward the reinforcement of the sanctions against Haiti, most likely this week. Haitian UN Ambassador Fritz Longchamp has this information to us here in Miami. Fritz Longchamp was not able to specify for us the nature of those sanctions. However some UN sources, which prefer to remain anonymous, indicate that an air embargo could be ordered against Haiti. Other UN sources indicate that nothing has yet been decided on the question. A meeting of the Security Council should be held this week, as the 15 January deadline for the Haitian military to apply the Governor Island accord has passed. [passage omitted]. It should be pointed out that President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide is due to travel to Canada on 23 January. On 24 January, he is due to meet with the new head of the Canadian government, Mr. Jean Chretien. This has been Rothschild Francois, Junior, in Miami for Radio Metropole. [end recording]
