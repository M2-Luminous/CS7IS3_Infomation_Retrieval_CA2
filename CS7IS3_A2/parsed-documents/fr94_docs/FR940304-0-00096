FR940304-0-00096 FR940304-0-00020 Finally, the regulations in 31 CFR part 321, also referred to as Department of the Treasury Circular No. 750, Fourth Revision, are being further amended to reflect the fact that submission of redeemed savings securities via EZ CLEAR has become the only means of transmitting and receiving settlement for such paid securities. The EZ CLEAR method of paid bond processing permits savings bond paying agents to transmit and receive settlement for redeemed securities in the same manner as for checks and other cash items. The reduction in separate processing has increased efficiency and reduced costs for the savings bond program. Procedural Requirements This Final Rule does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866. The regulatory review procedures, therefore, do not apply. Because this Final Rule relates to public contracts and procedures for United States securities, the notice, public comment, and delayed effective date provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act are inapplicable, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2). As no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. ) do not apply. There are no collections of information required by this Final Rule, and, therefore, the Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply.
