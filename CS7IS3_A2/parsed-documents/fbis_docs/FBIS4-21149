The bureau said that it has seized a total of 1,300 kilograms of heroin last year, which was sufficient to supply 32,000 drug addicts for one whole year. But the seizure only reflected about one-tenth of the overall drugs smuggled into Taiwan, indicating that about 400,000 people here are addicted to drugs. The bureau also flatly denied the report by the United States State Department that Taiwan is Asia's largest way station for drug shipment. Citing a record 336-kilogram heroin seizure last May, the Bureau of Investigation said that Taiwan will not allow drug barons to turn the island into a transfer port for drug trafficking.
