(Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 19 Mar 94 p 7A) Upon analyzing the results of the Liberal Party, PL, presidential primary election, opposition presidential candidate Andres Pastrana said on 14 March that one of his campaign's main objectives will be to lure 52 percent of PL members who did not vote for Samper. He said Samper was unable to garner 50 percent of the vote, because his program is incoherent. Pastrana concluded he will also concentrate on seeking the support of youths, who appear indifferent regarding the election. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 15 Mar 94 p 11A) Pastrana highlighted the differences on 20 March between his proposal and that of PL candidate Ernesto Samper to build a subway in Santa Fe de Bogota. On touring the capital, Pastrana said while he will build the subway by granting a concession to private companies, Samper will fund construction via new taxes and the privatization of public companies.

Speaking at a rally in Florencia, capital of Caqueta Department, Pastrana said if guerrillas do not show their determination to attain peace, "the Armed Forces will be forced to enforce the state's obligation of guaranteeing Colombians' lives and property, as established by the Constitution." Pastrana pledged to offer credits to peasants to make them private entrepreneurs.
