FR940418-2-00106 FR940418-2-00059 Occupational Safety and Health Administration Utah State Standards; Approval Background: Part 1953 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations prescribes procedures under section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 667), (hereinafter called, the Act) by which the Regional Administrator for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter called the Regional Administrator) under delegation of authority from the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter called the Assistant Secretary), (29 CFR 1953.4) will review and approve standards promulgated pursuant to a State Plan which has been approved in accordance with section 18(c) of the Act and 29 CFR part 1202. On January 10, 1973, notice was published in the Federal Register (38 FR 1178) of the approval of the Utah State Plan and the adoption of subpart E to part 1952 containing the decision. Utah was granted final approval on section 18(e) of the Act on July 16, 1985. By law (section 63&hyph;46a&hyph;16 Utah Code,) the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Procedure is the authorized compilation of the administrative law of Utah and ``shall be received in all the courts, and by all the judges, public officers, commissioners, and departments of the State government as evidence of the administrative law of the State of Utah *␣*␣*.'' The Utah Occupational Safety and Health Division revised its Administrative Rulemaking Act (chapter 46a, title 63, Utah annotated, 1953) which became effective on April 29, 1985. On May 6, 1985, a State Plan Supplement was submitted to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for approval and publication in the Federal Register . The plan supplement was published in the Federal Register (53 FR 43688) on October 28, 1988. The supplement provides for adoption of Federal standards by reference through the publication of standards in the Utah State Digest. Utah now adopts Federal OSHA standards by reference using the OSHA numbering system. Following the publication date, the agency shall allow at least 30 days for public comment on the rule. During the public comment period the agency may hold a hearing on the rule. Except as provided in statutes 63&hyph;46a&hyph;6 and 63&hyph;46a&hyph;7, a proposed rule becomes effective on any date specified by the agency which is no fewer than 30 nor more than 90 days after the publication date. The agency shall provide written notification of the rule's effective date to the office. Notice of the effective date shall be published in the next issue of the bulletin. OSHA regulations (29 CFR 1953.22 and 1953.23) require that States respond to the adoption of new or revised permenent Federal Standards by State promulgation of comparable standards within six months of OSHA publication in the Federal Register , and within 30 days for emergency temporary standards. Although adopted State Standards or revisions to standards must be submitted for OSHA review and approval under procedures set forth in part 1953, they are enforceable by the State prior to Federal review and approval. The State submitted statements along with copies of the Utah State Digest, to verify the adoption by reference of a standard for the Code of Federal Regulations. The adoption by reference standards actions occurred as follows: The Industrial Commission of Utah, Occupational Safety and Health Division, adopted by reference on December 1, 1993, the Federal Standard, Lead Exposure in Construction; Interim Final Rule of 29 CFR part 1910 as published in 58 FR 26590. The effective data of the State Rule was January 3, 1994. Decision: The statement of incorporation of the aforementioned Federal Standard by reference has been printed in the Utah Administrative Code. The code contains the statement of the incorporation of Federal Standards by reference as compiled by the Occupational Safety and Health Division of the Industrial Commission of Utah. Copies of the Utah Administrative Code have been reviewed and verified at the Regional Office. OSHA has determined that the Federal Standards incorporated by reference from 29 CFR part 1910 are identical to Federal Standards with no differences and therefore approves the Utah Standards. Location of Supplement For Inspection and Copying. A copy of the standards along with the approved plan may be inspected and copied during normal business hours at the following location: Office of the Regional Administrator, room 1576 Federal Office Building, 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado 80294; Utah State Industrial Commission, UOSH Offices at 160 East 300 South, Salt Lake City, Utah 84151; and the Director, Federal-State Operations, room N3700, 200 Constitution Ave, NW., Washington, DC 20210. Public Participation. Under 29 CFR 1953.2 (c), the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures, or show any other good cause consistent with applicable laws, to expedite the review process. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause exists for not publishing the supplements to the Utah State Plan as a proposed change and makes the Regional Administrator's approval effective upon publication for the following reason(s): The Standards were adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of State law which include public comment, and further public participation would be repetitious. This decision is effective February 23, 1994. (Sec. 18, Pub. L. 91&hyph;596, 84 Stat. 1608 [29 U.S.C. 667]). Signed at Denver, Colorado this 23rd day of February 1994. Gregory J. Baxter, Deputy Regional Administrator, VIII. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9251 Filed 4&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;26&hyph;M
