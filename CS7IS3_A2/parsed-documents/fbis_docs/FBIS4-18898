"The one madness of the new government would be eliminating the three-way table with unions and employers. Only with joint bargaining would it be possible to plan a further drop in inflation and guarantee real wages via exchange-rate policy," Modigliani said on the sidelines of a conference here. After noting that the pledge of media magnate turned politician Silvio Berlusconi to create a million jobs in the next two years is "conceivable, but extremely unlikely," Modigliani said that a separate Italian policy aimed at boosting employment was "unthinkable unless the whole of Europe moves to bring down interest rates." "One of the causes of Italy's present crisis," he explained, "is the 1970's incomes policy, with its logic of wages as an independent variable compared to prices. This drove wages above the country's productivity levels, spelling an increase in inflation and the net result that Italy's international competitiveness fell. "But now even the trade unions have realised there is nothing to be gained from hiking wages. The three-way table allows the `internationalisation' of problems, so that the overall effects of demands are seen. This must be pursued." Modigliani said he was not in a position to judge the economic programme of Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, shaped by monetarist Antonio Martino, "until they say what spending cuts they are going to make after they've cut taxes." But he stressed that "it will be fundamental to generate an increase in domestic demand, while waiting for Europe to wake up." He "did not know" why the government's economic report (released yesterday) revised growth down from 1.6 to 1.3 percent this year. "I am more optimistic, and am hoping for 2 percent, because all the conditions for a small recovery are there. But I don't think a real growth dynamic will start up if the continent as a whole does not move." Modigliani put pension reform high on the next government's priority list. "You need to change the concept of welfare state: you shouldn't promise a pension proportionate to what was received during one's working years, but instead guarantee a vital minimum for all. The rest should be left to voluntary fund payments by the individual." On privatisations, he expressed full confidence that "the entire process was followed with the selfsame care." "I know the Treasury experts who dealed with the procedures: there was nothing murky going on. Of course, it was impossible to sell at a higher price than the one set, otherwise you wouldn't have had any buyers."
