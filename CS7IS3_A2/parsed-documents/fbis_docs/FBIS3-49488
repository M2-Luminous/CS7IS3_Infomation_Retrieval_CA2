"We do not want to declare territorial autonomy, but to economically develop southern Slovakia," said Istvan Pasztor, chairman of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny Island and mayor of Komarno, on the demands of the Hungarian minority. Ethnic Hungarians do not want "anything but to have the same rights as are extended to other, purely Slovak regions," said Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH), on the proposal to create new territorial-administrative units in southern Slovakia, where ethnic Hungarians make up a majority of the population. Duray expressed the conviction that after yesterday's meeting, the Slovak Government and Parliament would not act against the principles of the European Charter of the Rights of Minorities and the Charter of Self-Government. He also said that he would strive for the revision of the Benes Decrees, under which ethnic Hungarians (as well as the Sudeten Germans) were expelled after World War II. Regarding police inspections on the roads to Komarno before the meeting, which prevented several participants from attending, Bugar said that the Hungarian deputies in the Slovak parliament would make an interpellation with the interior minister. If it is determined that the minister gave the order to the police, or if he refuses to give an answer, Bugar said the deputies from Egyutteles and the MKDH would call for his removal.
