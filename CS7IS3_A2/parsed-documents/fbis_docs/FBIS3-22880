It is a statement with the following content: Recently Russia's mass media, in particular Interfax and the SEGODNYA newspaper have been circulating information about the dispatch from Ukraine's territory of special trains carrying nuclear warheads which are to be handed over to the Russian side in accordance with Ukraine's international obligations. At the same time, with reference to informed sources in the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense, data of a strictly confidential nature is being broadcast. The ease with which some journalists, referring to the Russian military, disseminate information throughout the world on the times, dates, and destinations of the trains carrying nuclear warheads evokes surprise, especially as Russian specialists cannot but acknowledge the fact that such actions create a real threat to the safety of the transportation of nuclear warheads. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense Press Service states that such actions are provocative and inadmissible because they are directed at creating a new spiral of tension around Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. Because of the lack of discipline among Russian information sources, Ukraine is now forced to make additional adjustments to the schedule and routes for the transportation of nuclear warheads.
