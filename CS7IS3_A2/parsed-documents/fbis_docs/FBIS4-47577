Lyapustin, `Ripping Off Patients: Hundreds of Millions of Rubles Embezzled by ... Public Health Officials in Chelyabinsk'] [Text] All theft is amoral, but I have never seen a theft more amoral than the one that occurred in Chelyabinsk: the needy were ripped off--patients at Chelyabinsk clinics. The budget (federal, regional, and city-wide) is bursting at the seams--money is short for everything: subsidies to the poor, welfare... Salaries to scientists and teachers, library workers, and other persons on the budget have been delayed. No one knows how to cover the shortfall of funds for new remuneration and deferred pensions and wages. Yet the situation in which our public health has found itself is an outright failure. We still have a long way to go to support medicine while budget allocations are being cut, drug prices are going through the roof, drug purchases from abroad are declining, and the health of the population is becoming increasingly dependent on the favor of the ``sponsors.'' Sometimes the hospitals are short of bandaging materials, and the physicians are sometimes walking the picket lines and sometimes--almost striking due to low wages. The answer is still the same: no money! Yet at the same time... the staff of the Department of Prevention of Economic Crimes apprehended a group of embezzlers who put their hand in the till which holds the meager Chelyabinsk public health resources. No, it was not the professional robbers who cracked the safe--it was the staff of the medical affairs committee who ``helped themselves'' to the alms of mercy... Those whose job description called for pinching every penny. The first among the apprehended were the bookkeeper of the city public health committee, a procurement official from the same committee, and an employee of the disinfection station. They appropriated the budget allocations for medical development and drug purchases while the chief accountant and his team were pampering themselves rather than meeting hospital demands. Resources from the City Public Health Department account were transferred to commercial structures. But not for drugs. The criminal team acquired... gold jewelry and valuables! How much? The investigation will eventually find the final figures but an astronomical amount is already becoming clear--400 million rubles. The money also went to the stores where the clearing accounts were turned into sets of furniture, TV and video equipment, refrigerators, and fur coats. And to write off the funds and appropriate everything was simply a matter of skill. No sooner than the citizens of Chelyabinsk recovered from the shock caused by the publication of a report about this crime in Vecherniy Chelyabinsk, a new report appeared in the press: the chief accountant of the Chelyabinsk city sanitary epidemiologist station was detained at the Sheremetyevo Airport. She was trying to flee after pocketing, in the words of the newspaper, 70 million rubles. When arrested at the airport, she also was found to have foreign currency. Yet the city police are not yet confirming the amount but they are not denying it either--the investigation will reveal the ``bottom line.'' Yet sensations did not end here. The procurement official from the medical committee turned himself in to the police without awaiting arrest. The chauffeur of the medical committee chairman was also detained. Valuables, cars, and ``luxury items'' were confiscated. Thus far, they are talking about a theft of half a billion rubles. Thus far... This is because the chief physician of the Student Clinic No. 2 at the Technical University has also been detained. Who is next? Such are the figures and facts, but they are not final. The total amounts stolen will be clarified, someone will be released, and someone, on the contrary, will have the jail cell door slammed. The investigation continues, and the final conclusions still lie ahead. Why did the usually reticent investigators have the preliminary information made so promptly available to the local press? Is it because that they are afraid that someone is ``behind'' all this? Especially since Chelyabinsk residents have more than just suspicions about it--the husband of one of the suspects (defendant) turned out to be the chief of the tax police. Here is another confirmation--the investigator, Lieutenant Colonel R. Podvigina, was ``warned.'' After coming back home, Raisa Mikhaylovna found the apartment door open and things out of order in the rooms, yet nothing was taken. Just a hint... Publications on the case of the budget millions appeared during the finishing line of the recent elections. We know that the oblast administration has committed a number of gaffes. Once they gave a ``present'' of several million to a dealer for buying American clothes but found the merchant in the Krasnoyarsk interrogation lockup and, of course, without the money. Another time, they ``allocated'' 200 million for sugar, and as far as we know, have not received the goods yet. The scandal at the ``curtain call'' of the election campaign helped the opponents of the democrats to secure such a high%age of votes in Southern Urals. Yet it is not up to me to decide whether it was necessary to catch up to the chief accountant of the sanitary and epidemiological station at Sheremetyevo due to the premature publication of the case. And why did the warehouse with the scarcest drugs costing tens of millions of rubles burned during the same period? The interrogation will see it more clearly and sort things out. We will wait until its end and will promise to tell the Trud readers about its outcome.
