The resolution replaces the earlier order that allowed to waive import duties on certain categories of goods. The duty will vary from 15 percent to 20 percent depending on whether the exporter country has a free trade agreement with Latvia, Osis said. The lowest tariff is levied on raw materials, which are being brought in to supply the local industry. Imported products that can be made on the spot will be taxed 45 percent, Osis said. The tariffs are tailored to protect the domestic market, the minister noted. Simultaneously, Osis conceded, the tariffs increase alone is unable to protect the Latvian market. Latvia should also improve the tax collection mechanism and customs control, he said. The new tariffs take effect 30 days after their publication in the LATVIJAS VESTNESIS newspaper. In other actions, the Cabinet gave the go-ahead for the liquidation of a series of profitless state-run enterprises and adopted the order for repayment of excise taxes on diesel fuel, which were earlier paid by Latvian farmers in accordance with an erroneous government resolution.
