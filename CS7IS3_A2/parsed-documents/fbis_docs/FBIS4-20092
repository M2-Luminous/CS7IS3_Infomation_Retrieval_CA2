FBIS4-20092 "drweu080_q_94011" FBIS-WEU-94-080 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 TURKEY Organization of Prosperity Party Detailed Organization of Prosperity Party Detailed TA2104114594 Istanbul MILLIYET in Turkish 10, 11, 12, 13 Apr 94 TA2104114594 Istanbul MILLIYET Turkish BFN [Article in four installments by Rusen Cakir: "Understanding the Prosperity Party"] [10 Apr p 23] [Text] The organization of the Prosperity Party [PP] is described as the "worry beads model." The PP appoints an official to every neighborhood. That official finds and appoints other officials to every avenue, every street, and even every apartment building. Inspectors check on the work of the neighborhood officials, who are directly attached to the party's district chairman. In each province, there are party councils composed of 50 members and 50 reserve members. Similar councils function in the districts, too. In all its units, in parallel with its main organization, the PP has mobilized the women in "ladies committees." After every election, the PP gets ready for another election as if it is going to be held the next day. The organization model is also implemented in the ballot boxes. In other words, the neighborhood officials appoint committees made up of at least three people for every ballot box in their area. The duties of this committee are to collect information about all the voters registered to that ballot box, to brief the party propagandists on these voters when necessary, and especially to do whatever it can to ensure that the voter expected to vote for the PP goes to the ballot box. Currently, PP members fall into three basic groups. First, there are the "founding big brothers" who advocate the "National View," which is an extension of the National Order Party and the National Salvation Party [NSP]. They are followed by the young NSP members of the seventies. Those who joined the movement after 1980 make up the third category. The "founding big brothers" enjoy uncontested authority and respect within the party. They lose their status only as a result of certain high-level conflicts or because of health reasons. The general headquarters and the Turkish Grand National Assembly group of the PP are composed mainly of these members. The second group is composed mainly of members in their thirties and forties who are usually administrators in provincial organizations and in local authorities. Those who followed the 1968 events with envy from afar as religious students are now formulating and implementing the new PP policies with social democratic, civilian populist, and, at times, liberal tendencies. Those who were students during the seventies or in the early eighties, on the other hand, are closer to radical Islamic trends. Prominent in the third category are those who have broken away from different ideologies, women of all ages, students who were politicized during the Islamic wave of the eighties, young workers, and young unemployed citizens. The abundant middle cadres of the PP (mostly middle-aged) provide the equilibrium between the enthusiasm and dynamism of the grass roots and the caution and meticulousness of the top cadres. The high-level administrators -- no doubt Necmettin Erbakan in particular -- appear inaccessible and legendary in the eyes of the grass roots, who continuously come into contact with the middle cadres. Maybe this is why Erbakan conducts more tours in the country than other leaders, allows party members to kiss his hand, and wins their hearts by turning the inaccessible into accessible. The PP, which does not appear to have any factional conflicts, is actually a very complex coalition. For example, PP members in central Anatolia are more provincial and closer to Turkish nationalism, and their religion is widely mixed with Alawite contradictions. Those in the Black Sea region display more urban qualities and incorporate the religious element into politics more. The Kurdish identity in southeast Anatolia, where religious schools have always been predominant, is becoming increasingly prominent. The big cities, in turn, incorporate all of these characteristics. Undoubtedly, the way to advance such a complex organization and prevent power squabbles is to limit the democratic channels within the party as much as possible and replace them with centralism. At this juncture, Erbakan's personality becomes important. Erbakan, who has been operating the National View movement with practically the same top cadres for the past quarter of a century (Oguzhan Asilturk, Sevket Kazan, Recai Kutan, Fehim Adak, and Ali Oguz), is the embodiment of the party center. All the important decisions in the PP are made by Erbakan (or so it seems). Erbakan has the final say (sometimes also the first) in determining election candidates, party central decisionmaking and executive council members at congresses, and assembly group leaders. Prosperity's Identity The fact that decisions within the PP, which in essence is a coalition, are reached unanimously or to be more accurate the fact that decisions of the party oligarchy dictated by Erbakan are endorsed unanimously cannot be explained through Erbakan's personality. The PP's main magic is that it has, above all, managed to convert its members to Prosperity. The PP, which can be viewed as a religious organization from the outside, actually has an organizational concept which can be termed secular. The PP possesses the mechanism for transforming the individual joining its ranks, irrespective of his motives for joining, his past or future, into a Prosperity member. These mechanisms begin functioning as soon as the individual establishes contact with the party. Erbakan has never claimed to be the sheikh and his attitude has rendered things easier. Since the death of Mehmed Zahid Kotku on 13 November, 1980, however, Erbakan has claimed that political authority should precede religious authority, which has led to serious problems. PP members refer to their leader as "Mujahid Erbakan." In other words, the PP is an organization for "jihad." Although being versed in religious issues may carry prestige within the party it does not bring along status. The way to status is through having good organizational skills, eloquence, and expertise in certain issues. No doubt, it is desirable that a party member with some of these characteristics also be an authority on religion, but this is not required. No one within the PP interferes with anyone else's adherence to religious obligations. It is taken for granted that everyone is fulfilling the requirements of Islam. Theoretically, however, each PP member has the right to interfere in the daily life of any other member. One of the secrets for the success of the National View movement, which has been in Turkish politics for over 25 years through the legality and power attained from the argument that "Islam does not separate between religion and state affairs as is the case in Christianity," is that it has gradually made a distinction between religion and state affairs and it has, at the same time, put state affairs above those of religion. The embarrassed NSP administrator of the past who could not answer a question relating to the interpretation of an Islamic scripture has now been replaced by PP administrators who proudly reply "address your questions on scriptures to the pertinent authorities." The Goal Is Political Power Today's PP members have dedicated themselves to "formulating projects on Turkey's concrete problems" rather than religious issues. The National View can thus be viewed as a movement that modernizes and secularizes the religious, which is the case with all Islamic political groups in the world. Since the National View is at the same time a communicational organization and since this strategy of communications has, since the eighties, been directed to those who are not religious, it has aimed at training cadres expert in economics and politics. This stand further strengthens the process of secularization which the movement has entered. The role of theologians and clergy is gradually diminishing within the PP. The Prosperity identity every member adopts in the beginning is actually a secular one that has been given the patina of Islam. The Islamic dimension of this identity is very shallow, static, and confused since it has frequently been deformed due to legal reasons. As a result, PP members, who agree in general on Islamic goals (for example to attain sharia), when asked to go into the details of these goals (for example the sharia) will come up with thousands of opposing interpretations. When, however, asked to go into the details of the political dimensions of the Prosperity identity the members will agree in general irrespective of their region or ethnic origin. The political dimension is also very dynamic, constantly developing and changing, but it keeps on coming to the very same point: That of gaining political power. [11 Apr p 21] [Text] According to unofficial final results of the 27 March 1994 local elections, the Prosperity Party [PP] received a total of 5,340,969 votes. It increased its share of the vote to 19 percent, and got a total of 327 mayoral positions of which six were in cities, 22 in provinces, 92 in districts, and 207 in townships. These elections show that once again, the PP was very successful in the southeast. It got the mayoral positions in the provinces of Mus, Agri, Bingol, Bitlis, Batman, Siirt, Diyarbakir, Van, Sanliurfa, and Adiyaman. As in the past, the PP received the highest rate of votes in the southeast. Even though the official figures have not been released yet, it is believed that the election boycott by the Democracy Party [DEP] helped raise the number of PP's votes. It is being alleged that some of the voters abided by the DEP's instructions and either did not vote or cast invalid votes deliberately. It is being said that close to 50 percent of the voters boycotted the elections in certain parts of the southeast. For example, the PP received 40,000 votes or 26.6 percent in Siirt in 1989. According to figures given by the TRT [Turkish Radio and Television], the PP received 21,000 votes in Siirt in the 1994 local elections. However, the rate was 31.5 percent. The PP received 52,000 votes or 19.6 percent of the vote in Diyarbakir in 1989. This time, it received 25,000 more votes but managed to almost double its percentage of votes to 33 percent. Similarly, after five years, the PP got only 1,000 more votes in Mardin but its percentage went up by 6 percent. The Effect of Kurdish Votes Another allegation that is being made is that in the southeast, the PP got a significant number of civil servants' votes, like policemen, special team members, officers and so on. DEP officials deny that DEP voters voted for the PP. However, it is conceivable that part of the DEP supporters gave up the boycott and voted for the centrist parties and the PP in order to prevent the election of the candidates of the Nationalist Action Party [NAP] and the Great Unity Party [GUP] -- parties which took part in the elections through state support. Regardless of these facts, the 1994 local elections show that the PP took important steps in rehabilitating its relations with the southeast -- the PP's traditional vote depot. A much more important conclusion we can draw from the 1994 elections, is that the PP clearly showed that it is a movement that is centered in the big cities. It won the mayoral positions in five metropolises [as published] and 28 provinces [as published]. However, it lagged even behind the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] by winning only a total of 338 mayoral positions in districts and townships [as published]. The PP won mayoral positions in the five provinces it had won in 1989 -- including in Van and Sanliurfa which it had lost in the by- elections. The other mayoral positions in 23 provinces it won this time used to belong to the following parties: 11 to the SDPP, six to the True Path Party [TPP], four to the Motherland Party [ANAP], one each to the Nationalist Labor Party [NLP] and the Republican People's Party [RPP]. As you can see, the PP got mayoral positions and consequently the votes from all the parties, but particularly from the SDPP which had emerged as the victorious party in the 1989 local elections. By getting the mayoral positions in the metropolises of Istanbul and Ankara, the PP confirmed that. The March 1994 elections also confirmed that the PP's engine power is its organization in Istanbul. In earlier elections, the PP's average percentage for all of Turkey and for Istanbul were almost the same, while this time the average for Istanbul was 5 to 6 points higher. As a result, the PP got 17 mayoral positions in Istanbul. The Success in the Metropolitan Areas The PP, which entered the political scene in the 1984 local elections with a 4.4 percent vote, increased its number of votes in every subsequent election, finally reaching 19.0 percent in the 1994 local elections. A comparative study of the number of votes received by the PP in all the elections demonstrate that contrary to common belief, this party is not a "peasant" party, but an urban party which is developing in the cities. The PP, which proved it is an urban party by winning the mayoral posts in 28 provinces in the latest elections, has actually been an urban party since the first elections it participated in. When we study the number of PP votes in the 26 largest provinces, we see that the PP received more votes than its nationwide average in 11 of these provinces in 1984, in seven of them in 1987, in nine of them in 1989, in 10 of them in 1991, and in 11 of them in 1994. The list of these 11 provinces in the latest elections presents an interesting picture: Ankara, Diyarbakir, Erzurum, Gaziantep, Istanbul, Kayseri, Kocaeli, Konya, Kahramanmaras, Sakarya, and Trabzon. Given the fact that, except the last three provinces, eight provinces have metropolitan area status from a local authority viewpoint and that the total number of metropolitan areas in Turkey is 15, we can conclude that the PP is the choice of approximately one out of four voters in more than half of the country's leading industrial, commercial, educational, tourism, cultural, and administrative centers. The PP, which lost the mayoral elections in Gaziantep and Kocaeli to SDPP by only a slight margin, won the mayoral posts in all the metropolitan areas in central and eastern Anatolia. The Areas Where the PP is Weak The four provinces where the PP is weakest consist of Edirne, Kirklareli, Mugla, an Tunceli. In Antalya, Aydin, Canakkale, Denizli, Izmir, Icel, Kastamonu, Tekirdag, Bartin, and Ardahan, the PP received between 5 and 10 percent of the votes. In other words, with the exceptions of Tunceli and Ardahan, the PP is unable to rise to prominence in the coastal strips of the Aegean, the Mediterranean, and the western Black Sea. The PP, which increased its votes by 14.6 points in 10 years, owes this increase largely to central, eastern, and southeast Anatolia, and the industrial regions in the eastern Black Sea and Marmara. To understand the extent of the success attained by the PP in the recent elections, it will be more meaningful to compare the results of the 27 March 1994 elections to the results of the 1989 local elections. The 1991 general elections could lead to misleading comparisons because of the alliances. The PP increased its votes by nine points in five years and did not regress in any of the regions. The lowest increases were noted in Mugla at 0.8 percent, in Edirne at 1.2 percent, in Kirklareli at 1.6 percent, and in Kastamonu at 2.3 percent. The biggest leap forward of 21.5 percent was registered in Malatya. This was followed by 19.3 percent in Bingol, 15.9 in Sakarya, 15.2 in Erzincan, 14.5 in Adiyaman, 14.4 in Ankara, 14.1 in Istanbul, Kayseri, and Kocaeli, and 14.04 in Corum. The PP-NAP Rivalry It became clear in the 1994 elections that the nationalist-conservative votes, which were concentrated in ANAP and the TPP in the wake of the 12 September 1980 military intervention, moved away from the center in the past 10 years. In the 1991 elections, the PP-NLP-Democratic Reform Party [DRP] alliance received 16.9 percent of the votes. In 1994, the PP won 19.0 percent, the NLP, which now goes under the name of NAP, won 8.0 percent, the GUP, which broke off from the NAP, won 1.2 percent, and the DRP, which changed its name to Nation Party [NP], received 0.4 percent of the votes. In other words, the total percent of the votes received by the alliance exceeded 28. The total number of votes received by the PP, the NAP, the GUP, and the NP ranged between 40 and 50 percent in the following provinces: Bayburt, Yozgat, Sivas, Erzurum, Bingol, Konya, Kayseri, Gumushane, Karaman, Cankiri, Elazig, Corum, Aksaray, Erzincan, Kahramanmaras. In most of these provinces, there was a fierce race between the PP and the NAP. While scoring points by "not recognizing the Kurdish reality," the NAP used the democratic line advocated by some of the "civilian" members of the rival party for the solution of the Kurdish problem as an excuse to accuse these persons of belonging to the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Democratic Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit's "pro-Kurdish" accusation leveled at the PP served the interests of the NAP in these areas. While both parties tried to steal votes from the Sunni- conservative grassroots, the PP developed policies for the benefit of low-income Alawite citizens, who live in shantytowns in urban centers, who have been alienated from the social democrats, and who are afraid of the NAP. Although it is difficult to prove, it appears that the PP received votes from this sector as well. [12 Apr p 21] [Text] Following the Prosperity Party [PP] victory in the local elections, there is new tension. This is felt among citizens who engage in largely prejudicial predictions regarding the possible measures PP municipalities may adopt. These individuals are apprehensive about these possible changes. For others the election victory symbolizes that "the time for revenge has finally come." This tension is felt in our daily life. The tension stems from the fact that PP opponents and supporters do not consider themselves equal. The opponents of the PP consider themselves above the supporters of the party. These opponents attempt to prove their superiority through arguments such as "they are 18 percent, as opposed to our 82 percent." The opponents are especially unable to accept the fact that the PP will run the municipalities of Ankara and Istanbul. The supporters of the party, on the other hand, believe that the election results accord them superiority. We observe that this sector of the population -- scorned since the republic's establishment and treated as second-class citizens to be ignored rather than accorded the proportional interest it deserved prior to the recent elections -- is afflicted with a wounded sense of citizenship accompanied by a wounded awareness of Islam. These mutual claims of superiority become claims of the real ownership over Turkey. The "Istanbul is ours and will remain ours" slogans heard during PP demonstrations merely epitomize the "us and them" discrimination. Is the Prosperity Victory Lasting? Even though the PP failed to attain Necmettin Erbakan's goal of "30-35 percent of the votes and 1,000 municipal posts," it is clear that the party emerged victorious from the 1994 elections. Also clear is that the fragmentation of the centrist parties contributed to this election victory. This victory, however, brings the PP to the brink of a test for which it may be unprepared. The PP, gained strength far from public view. Developing away from the political limelight resulted in certain advantages as well as disadvantages for the party. There is no need to dwell on the advantages, but the degree to which the PP will brave the disadvantages will determine the future of this party. The mayoral posts it has won could make or break the PP, because it must satisfy many categories with different expectations. The traditional grassroots of the National View movement occupies the top of this list. To please this sector, which for better or for worse has Islamic aspirations, the municipalities of the PP must adopt some Islamization measures. This is required to dismiss criticism from Islamic circles which accuse the PP of not being pro-Islam. These municipalities are also obliged to engage in Islamization moves to distinguish them from other parties. Moreover, this will enable them to win over the conservative masses which lean towards the rightist parties outside the PP. If the promises to build a mosque in Taksim Square; close down the public brothels; allocate different buses for female students; and refuse licenses for alcoholic drinks are fulfilled, these will inevitably be followed by other measures. Given the fact that the biggest wish of the PP grassroots consists of not allowing women with uncovered heads to work in PP municipalities and, if possible, not allowing women to work in these places altogether, we can say that this is the limit of the Islamization measures. Work, Food, and Service The PP municipalities, however, will feel the shadow of the state, especially the army, over them in all their moves, particularly in the big cities. It is therefore very likely that the PP administration will follow previous mayors and not allow the state to interfere, in matters such as closing down brothels and tell its grassroots, who are demanding further Islamization measures, to "wait until the party takes over the government and establishes a just order." The sector that will push the PP furthest consists of the needy and destitute masses who sympathized with the party for socioeconomic reasons. These masses, who are difficult to please with Islamization measures, are expecting employment, food, and service. The PP approached these masses with populist statements and extended assistance in cash or in kind, thus giving the message that "what we are doing is the guarantee of what we will do in the future." The PP must now develop concrete projects and realize them successfully. The claim that there will be no bribery or corruption in PP municipalities will be put to the test during this period. The PP will try at all costs not to allow any black marks to tarnish its municipalities until the first elections. To this end, PP mayors, who are obliged to continue to work to a large extent with the old cadres, will try to control the old personnel through trusted persons they will place in key positions. It is evident that during this coming period, allegations against the PP will focus on nepotism rather than bribery and corruption. Imitating the Motherland Party [ANAP] PP mayors can also be expected to launch several "mega" projects. Conservative business circles will be the first ones to come to mind for new resources. Many businessmen will inevitably discover conservatism in the wake of the PP municipal election victory. It is known that MUSIAD [?Muslim Businessmen Association] gained many new members after the elections. For example, Ankara Mayor Melih Gokcek referred to "ultra mega" projects and said that these will be submitted to a tender in the private sector. The PP is showing signs that it will imitate the ANAP municipalities during the years 1984-1989. This may be followed by a recourse to oil-rich Arab countries, using PP leader Erbakan's connections. Even if resources are found, it will be necessary to find the necessary personnel. In actual fact, the conservative sector has sufficient professional administrators to manage all of the country's municipalities. It is not clear, however, to what extent the PP will or will want to benefit from them. The fate of the PP municipalities will be directly affected by whether personnel appointments will be determined according to loyalty or merit. PP mayors may be expected to act rationally, but it is also possible that the party headquarters and Erbakan will appoint "political commissioners" to important municipalities. Moreover, Tayyip Erdogan and Melih Gokcek could each rise towards the position of party leadership. Mega Projects The "better understanding from technology" element of the PP's Islamic grassroots will gain confidence in proportion to the success of "mega" projects. In addition, circles outside the PP will become more tolerant of this party with each success. However, these projects are directed toward the "center" and therefore the poor, who shifted their preference from the social democrats to the PP, will not be that affected by these projects, apart from temporary employment possibilities. The masses looking for "now, instant" solutions to their problems will find no answers from the "mega" projects because they are long-term projects. So, what the PP leaders carry out in this sector -- in addition to distributing food during Ramadan and fuel in winter; conducting collective circumcisions and establishing a "marriage waqf" for the young people -- is very important. In the past, the PP district mayors complained of not getting enough attention and support from the SDPP Metropolitan Mayor Nurettin Sozen [as published]. They no longer have such problems. Will the SDPP or ANAP mayors of Sisli, Bakirkoy, Besiktas, and Kadikoy have similar problems? Tayyip Erdogan is making promises that he will treat everybody equally. Will he be able to keep his promise? Will the en masse layoffs -- postponed by other PP municipalities until after the elections -- be implemented after the reactions in Kagithane? If they are, what guidelines will there be? Will PP supporters be given the jobs of those who were laid off? This type of questioning can be expanded. It will then be obvious that the PP mayors will be subjected to the same questions addressed to other party leaders. The difference is that the PP has not yet been tested in municipalities and its perspective from outside the system due to its Islamic motifs. [13 Apr p 21] [Text] The National View achieved the biggest ascent in its history on 27 March 1994 and has embarked on an unknown future. Undoubtedly, this future will be determined by the steps taken by the Prosperity Party [PP] and its rivals and changes in international and national conjunctures. The rivals must have noticed that it suits the PP to be presented as a force "outside the system." However, instead of admitting the truth, they are developing a new strategy of challenging the PP to prove its sincerity by presenting the PP's claims of being an insider as a new situation. To determine its future, the PP must be successful in the municipalities, or at least give that impression. This is essential, but not sufficient on its own. Whether it wants it or not, the PP, which has become the party of the masses, has to abide by these requirements. Otherwise, efforts to keep the "ideological backbone" in good condition can take it back to the 10 percent margin. PP circles can certainly get rid of the "party of the masses" label which is associated with degeneration, but the first condition for this is the full operation of the democratic channels inside the party. This is the most important handicap facing the PP. The PP's success stems also from the party administration preventing the natural organizational permutations. On account of its centralized structure -- far from democratic -- a great number of sectors which contributed to PP's success are not represented in its leadership. The National Youth Waqf -- the backbone of the party -- is headed by leaders and administrators who are not young anymore and the ladies committees are supervised by certain members of the provincial administrative councils. In short, the PP leadership is approaching its grassroots with affection but with suspicion. Women in the PP A study of the status of PP women, who greatly contributed to the success of the party and who are expected to influence its future, offers important data regarding intraparty democracy. There were no women mayoral candidates, although it is women who constitute the most dynamic groups at all party meetings and who have knocked on every door to conduct party propaganda. In an interview published in the March 1994 issue of NEHIR magazine, Sibel Eraslan, chairman of the PP Istanbul Women's Committee, said: "Currently, we are in the center of active politics. It will be the PP women who will decide whether or not to assume office in local authorities or in the central administration, on the condition that our delegates make such a request and our administrators view it positively. This is a matter of historical process, which will finally be decided upon by PP women. I know that our delegates proposed the names of some of our colleagues for membership in municipal councils. In other words, we have names for candidates, but only God knows what the future holds." After this interview, Eraslan, whom we met at the 25 March Sultanahmet meeting, said that only five PP women in Bakirkoy, Beykoz, and Kadikoy were submitted as municipal council member candidates out of all the districts in Istanbul. Another PP member had earlier reported that serious discussions were conducted at provincial and district administrative councils on the subject of women candidates and that a significant part of the all-male administrators opposed women candidates on the grounds that it constitutes "liberalism." Women in the PP, whose duty to care for children and cook can be overlooked when it is necessary to knock on doors to promote the party, are told that "their place is in the home" when they want to exercise the right to be elected. As stated by Eraslan, however, the PP women who are at the center of active politics, know and are learning that, in addition to the right to elect, which is considered sacred by their administrators, they are the ones who will decide whether they want to exercise their right to be elected. As it happens, Eraslan declares that she will become a deputy, but she must wait three years until she is 30 years old. Intellectuals in the PP The PP's future will also be determined by the nature of its relations with independent Muslim intellectuals. The PP, which has stayed away from intellectuals in the past for fear that they will voice opinions against party discipline, has begun opening up to them in recent years. The PP submitted some Muslim nonparty candidates during the general and local elections based on the belief that they will not pose any problems because of the responsibility they will shoulder; and this proved to be largely justified. The party, which is now at the head of many municipalities, needs educated people at least to conduct cultural activities. It is known, however, that some young Muslim intellectuals, who were employed as press or cultural advisers in district municipalities, did not work in harmony with the mayors. The mayors were not willing to provide a wide autonomous area for these intellectuals who accepted the jobs because they were in financial difficulties. The formula of "how much money do you want?" will probably continue because there are many needy university graduates, educated religious intellectuals, and semi-intellectuals. There will certainly also be PP mayors who will regard the creativity and industriousness of Muslim intellectuals as an advantage and not view the issue as a simple employment procedure. It is these mayors who can seriously contribute to Turkey's cultural life and improve the PP's image. Democracy Is the Solution It is claimed that PP municipalities will restrain themselves and try to appear charming to outsiders for two years because of the upcoming general elections in 1996. According to another claim, the PP will benefit from the further impoverishment of the large masses as a result of the "historic stability package" announced on 5 April 1994. However, the fact that PP leader Necmettin Erbakan warned Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who explained the stability measures to him, about "possible social explosions" could be seen as an indication that this prediction is not necessarily correct. If the economic measures fail and the system collapses, the PP will also be crushed under the wreckage, because it is also part of the system. All the same, as in many other things, the PP is capable of benefiting from the stability package as well, because among the big parties, the socioeconomic opposition argument of "the rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer" has been monopolized by the PP. If the stability package falls short of causing the total collapse of the system and merely results in the people's suffering, then, barring extraordinary circumstances, PP victory in the coming elections appears to be certain. The PP victory is an opportunity for Turkey to return to real politics and shatter the depoliticization of the 12 September period. But, the sectors which do not have the strength or the inclination to compete with the PP in the political arena are consciously rejecting this opportunity and calling each other for help. It is desirable for Turkey as a whole that the PP, which contains fundamentalist, democratic, authoritarian, as well as pro-freedom elements, adopt a democratic line, just like the other parties. Everyone has a duty with regard to the democratization of the PP. Everyone now has a right to speak about the PP, which has become the property of the whole of Turkey for the first time. Those who do not support the PP should seek ways of coexisting and working together in mutual understanding with PP supporters, while maintaining their differences.
