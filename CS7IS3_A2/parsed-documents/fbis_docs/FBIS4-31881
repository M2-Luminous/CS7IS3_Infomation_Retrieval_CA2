Speaking at a press conference today he conceded that Romanian-Czech relations were as yet on a low level. However, Romania, with a population of 23 million and access to the Black Sea, could in future become a significant trade partner for the Czech Republic. Deeper relations can be promoted by Czech President Vaclav Havel's forthcoming visit to Bucharest, he said. Havel will be accompanied by a delegation which includes Czech Privatization Minister Jiri Skalicky. Nastase began a four-day visit to the Czech Republic on June 12. Nastase said he had not discussed the question of Romanian immigrants living here illegally with Czech politicians. He said in this area "serious difficulties that have not already been resolved by our ministries practically do not exist". "A few marginal matters" should not impede tourism between the two countries, Nastase said.
