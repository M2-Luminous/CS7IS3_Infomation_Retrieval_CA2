The Foreign Ministry says that the contacts between the two countries were stopped in the wake of a decision by the prime minister and foreign minister. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports, however, that political sources in Jerusalem confirmed the report that contacts were held between the two countries in a bid to prevent North Korea from supplying Iran with long-range Nodong missiles.
