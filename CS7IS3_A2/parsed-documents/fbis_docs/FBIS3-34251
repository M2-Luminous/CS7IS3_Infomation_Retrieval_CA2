[passage omitted] His majesty told the "News at Ten" that his talks with American leaders were characterized with openness and frankness. [Begin recording] [Husayn] I believe it was a very successful one and it came at a good time. It gave me the opportunity to meet not only with the President but with all the top officials there. It was characterized by openness and frankness, and I think a genuine desire, I note, to see our relations develop and grow and to give meaning to the word partnership in terms of the efforts of all to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in this region. [Correspondent Maha al-Sha'ir] During your many meetings in Washington, you reiterated Jordan's commitment to a comprehensive peace settlement. Do you feel that there are pressures on Jordan to go ahead individually to sign a peace agreement? [Husayn] I think I have suggested more than once that in the past,there were suggestions that Jordan should ratify a peace treaty then begin to negotiate the terms of the peace treaty. This has not been accepted by us, and it is not the right approach, in my view, at all. So, right now, I believe, we are engaged in discussing the items on the agenda, which are part of the process leading to the establishment of a final comprehensive peace between us. [Al-Sha'ir] Your majesty, do you want to say anything about Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah's assassination in Beirut? [Husayn] I am more than angered and more than saddened by this kind of vicious crime. We have paid dearly in blood in the past for our principles, our ideals, and our fight for life. And I do not think that there are any in this world who can intimidate this country. It is not an individual or a group of people that may fall. And that is normal, all of us are going to die some time, sooner or later. And it is all in God's hands. But nobody can murder a nation, and I think here we have a nation that stands proud and will continue to stand proud, and will never be intimidated by cowards and cowardly acts. [end recording]
