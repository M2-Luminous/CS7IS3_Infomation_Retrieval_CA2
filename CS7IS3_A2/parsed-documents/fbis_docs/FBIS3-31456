Martic was received in Pale with all state honors, and all aspects of cooperation, particularly military, were discussed in his lengthy talks with Karadzic. "Our talks were very useful and in the interest of our people. We discussed military cooperation in particular," Martic told journalists, pointing out that he would not want this to be understood as a threat, "because we are one people and it is only natural that we cooperate with the aim of defending our territories."
