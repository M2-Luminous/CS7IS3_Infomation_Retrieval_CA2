Arciniega blames President Alberto Fujimori's government advisers for not following through on a single strategy to defeat the drug trafficking that has raged in the northeastern jungle of Peru for several years. "Those (advisers) have done us the greatest harm and are the best collaborators the traffickers could have had because they have not allowed the application of any strategy since taking power," he stressed. Arciniega says that despite the fact that "everything was in place to do so," the advisers had obstructed all efforts and even "kept us from implementing antidrug strategies at a time when the American Government was willing to engage in joint operations." The 52-year-old general has been in political exile in Argentina since last January, having left his country on the heels of a military crisis involving him, one that eventually turned him into an enemy of the current head of the Army, General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza Rios. [passage omitted] General Arciniega, who faces trial in his country for the alleged crime of insulting a superior officer and offenses against the nation, is one of the two Peruvian generals now in exile in Argentina because of the political crisis in Peru. The other is General Rodolfo Robles Espinoza, who left Peru in May in fear for his life after denouncing members of the Army as being behind the disappearance of a university professor and nine students. Having served as an Army officer for 34 years, 9 months, and 21 days, Arciniega has not lost hope of returning to his country one day "in order to cooperate wherever necessary," mainly in his area of expertise: the war on drug trafficking. He says he bears no grudge against President Fujimori even though the latter publicly leveled accusations against him. However, he did criticize the chief of state harshly for the way he has governed and "for the mistakes he is making" in Peru. Arciniega now spends his time with his wife studying English thanks to a scholarship provided by friends. He is also getting ready to apply to Harvard, where his well-known antidrug strategy and experience have been deemed worthy of study and made into a course: C16-91-1044.0, in the John F. Kennedy School of Government's catalogue. Arciniega states that in 1989, while he was commanding officer of the Huallaga Front (the area considered the biggest drug trafficking factory and the strategic bastion of the terrorist group known as the Shining Path [SL]), a strategy was implemented that "enabled us to win the support of coca growers numbering in the thousands and thus deprive the terrorists of their social base." "My antidrug trafficking operations enabled us to destabilize the Shining Path and led to the recovery of the Marginal Highway, while at the same time winning the support of the peasant population," Arciniega recalls. He admits leading his troops into many battles against the terrorist groups, but "my fundamental strategy was basically to consider the coca growers--some 60,000 families--as peasants rather than drug-trafficking criminals." The general also claims that when he encouraged supporting the peasants as they gradually replaced coca crops with other products, the Shining Path began to suffer a resounding political and social defeat. "It was the peasants themselves who threw all the SL's out while my troops and I engaged in simultaneous actions to break up the Shining Path's first People's Guerrilla Army (EGP) between April and December of 1989," he recalls. He emphasizes that it was the Army and people together who waged the fight against the Shining Path "until Abimael Guzman finally lost his will to have another army and immediately changed tactics." He also recalls that in 1989, when a number of intelligence reports stated that the leader of the Shining Path was celebrating his birthday in a place in the jungle known as paradise, "I went in that day to hit him with everything I had, but did not find him...." Arciniega admits that the first steps taken by the Fujimori Government were positive, but only until just before the 5 April 1992 coup. On that date, with the support of the military, the chief of state dissolved Parliament and assumed extraconstitutional powers. The former military official maintains that the drug traffickers are the biggest capitalists in the world and that they are capable of exerting their influence all over the world. When asked whether he knew of the existence of a list of persons presumably connected with drug trafficking, a list which the then American undersecretary of state for Latin American affairs, Bernard Aronson, had brought to Peru the very day of the coup, Arciniega said, "I understand that that story has come out in a book."
