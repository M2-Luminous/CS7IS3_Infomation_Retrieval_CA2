Speaking after a meeting of ambassadors from NATO countries, he said they had expressed "general satisfaction" at two attacks by U.S. warplanes on Serb positions around the Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde on Sunday and Monday. "General satisfaction was expressed at the two missions conducted under the authority of Resolution 836 of the UN Security Council according to permanent procedures fixed with the UN Protection Force in Bosnia last year," he said. Resolution 836 provides for the protection of "safe areas," including Sarajevo, Gorazde and four more towns, which have predominantly Moslem populations. "NATO remains ready to provide close air support in case of new attacks against UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) in the accomplishment of its global mandate," the spokesman said.
