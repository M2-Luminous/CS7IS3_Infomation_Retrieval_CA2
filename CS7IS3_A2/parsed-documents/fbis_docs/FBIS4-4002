Rolland, chairman and chief executive officer of the U.S.-based Lincoln National Corporation, said that developing bilateral economic and trade cooperation is beneficial for both China and the United States. Li said that China is the biggest developing country, the U.S. is the biggest developed one, and the economies of the two countries are mutually complementary. Developing bilateral economic and trade cooperation is conducive to the economic development of the two countries and global economic development as well as to maintaining world peace and stability, said Li. Developing bilateral trade and strengthening exchanges in culture and education between the U.S. and China are good for the two countries and their peoples, said Rolland, adding that he believes that the majority of the businessmen in the U.S. share the same view. "We believe that more and more U.S. politicians will also share the same view," Li said. Rolland said there is no such force that can hold back the momentum of the development of bilateral trade. The Lincoln National Corporation, founded in 1905 and named after late U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, is one of the top ten insurance companies in the U.S. Rolland said that his company is deeply impressed by China's economic development and is interested in its insurance market. He said that his company will set up a Beijing office on April 28, and that they are looking forward to developing the China market. Li expressed his congratulations on the opening of the Beijing office, saying that "a thousand-li journey is started by taking the first step" and that he is convinced that the office will experience good development in the future.
