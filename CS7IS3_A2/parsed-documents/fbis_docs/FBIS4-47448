Polyethylene catheters were inserted into each rat's left ventricle through its right carotid artery. The coronary vessels of seven rats were embolized for a length of 15 �m by radioactive microspheres injected into the cavity of the left ventricle during occlusion of the ascending aorta. The seven control rats were subjected to pseudo-operations, during which they were subjected to the same procedures performed on the rats in the experimental group. During the occlusion procedure, however, they received a physiological solution instead of the microspheres. Twenty-one days later the rats that had been implanted with catheters in their left ventricle, femoral artery, and jugular vein 1 day before the experiment began were selected for testing. Indicators of the rats' general and regional hemodynamics in response to intravenous ouabain infusion (in a dose of 0.4 mg/kg for 1 minute at a constant rate of 26 �m/min for 3 minutes) were studied while the rats were wide awake. At the conclusion of the tests the rats were killed with a large dose of nembutal, their organs removed and tissues weighed, and the amount of microspheres trapped in them and the amount of microspheres in blood samples from each rat determined. When compared with the controls, the rats whose coronary arteries had been embolized manifested higher end-diastolic pressure and peripheral resistance and a decrease in cardiac output and heart rate. These changes were accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in blood flow in the skin, muscles, brain, small intestine, kidneys, adrenal glands, and diaphragm. In the control animals, ouabain infusion induced an increase in aortal pressure, end-diastolic pressure, and general peripheral resistance and a decrease in heart rate but no statistically significant changes in their regional hemodynamics. In the embolized rats, ouabain infusion resulted in an increase in aortal pressure, cardiac output, and myocardial contractility and in a decrease in end-diastolic pressure. Significant increases in blood flow in the embolized rats' skin, brain, small intestine, lungs, liver, kidneys, and diaphragm and a decrease in vascular resistance in their lungs and diaphragm were also observed. The heart rate increased in five of the embolized rats and decreased in the other two. Of the total amount of microspheres injected into the rats, 34 +/- 8 percent (i.e., 106,278 +/- 23,720/g) ended up in the heart as a whole. These findings confirmed that 21 days after embolization, rats with symptoms of cardiac insufficiency (heart failure) induced by embolization of their coronary vessels are more sensitive to the glycoside ouabain than are rats with no symptoms of heart failure and that coronary vessel-embolized rats may therefore serve as suitable models for studying the status of a cardiovascular system with evolving heart failure.
