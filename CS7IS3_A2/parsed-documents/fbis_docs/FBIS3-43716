In a written report to the security council Butrus Ghali says the observers will form the largest contingent of an international observer group of 2,840. The group will also include 50 observers from the Organization of African Unity, 322 from the European Union, 70 from the Commonwealth and about 600 from individual countries and the diplomatic community. They will all be coordinated by the UN. Butrus-Ghali says, however, the total of election monitors is likely to exceed 5,000. This is counting observers likely to be sent by foreign nongovernmental organizations. He did not give the cost of the UN operation, but diplomats say it is estimated at around $40 million.
