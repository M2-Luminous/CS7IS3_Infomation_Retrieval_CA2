In a letter to Khieu Samphan, released by the Royal Palace, the king said that because the May 2 date for the five-day "Round Table of Peace and National Reconciliation" was approaching he would like to know whether he and his Khmer Rouge delegation would attend. Khieu Samphan had earlier expressed his support for the king's proposal to host the talks but then said he was worried about his security in Phnom Penh. The king, however, told Khieu Samphan the government needed a response in order to have sufficient time to arrange his reception and assure his security while travelling from the airport into the city. A palace official said the king was "very upset" that there had been no response from the Khmer Rouge. Co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh, however, said he did not have much optimism for the outcome of the talks. The prince told the diplomatic corps late Wednesday that if the "Round Table" failed the government would resurrect plans to have parliament formally outlaw the Khmer Rouge, a significant move that would signal the end of the government's policy of "keeping the door open" to talks with the guerrillas. Meanwhile, Khmer Rouge guerrillas were reported to be attacking government troop positions near the border town of Poipet for the third consecutive day and, further south, were pushing government troops back along National Route 10 towards Battambang and away from the guerrilla's recently recaptured headquarters at Pailin. "The situation around Poipet and on Route 10 is very serious," a government general in the capital said. A government officer, reached by telephone in Battambang, told AFP that the Khmer Rouge overran Treng and that government soldiers withdrew to 10 kilometers (six miles) away. Aid officials said thousands of people fled the area along with retreating soldiers. Treng was the government's original frontline position before the armed forces launched their offensive and pushed forward some 40 kilometers (30 miles) to capture the resource-rich Pailin region last month. The Khmer Rouge recaptured it last week. The officer, however, said there was no way the guerrillas could advance any further towards Battambang. Another government officer said General Pol Saroeun, the commander of the forces that attacked Pailin, would be replaced. The officer, explaining the battlefield setbacks, said the troops were disillusioned with corrupt leaders and that the rank-and-file felt little incentive to risk their lives. In Banteay Meanchey province to the north, General Hun Sothera of the government's 12th Division said the Khmer Rouge were attacking his positions several kilometers (miles) east of the normally bustling border town of Poipet. "The guerrillas were attacking in waves of 150 backed by artillery," he said. A Thai military source in the Thai town of Aranyaprathet, which is opposite Poipet, told reporters that the government appeared to be holding its ground and gaining the upper hand. The general said that most civilians had already fled Poipet town and those remaining were ready to leave at any moment. Government police said Khmer Rouge guerrillas killed 30 civilians when they attacked two pick-up trucks full of people trying to flee the fighting. The Khmer Rouge raked the trucks with automatic weapon fire and fired rocket-propelled grenades as they were driving along National Route 5 away from Poipet. Government troops monitoring Khmer Rouge radio in nearby Thmar Pouk said one-armed Khmer Rouge General Prum Su ordered his troops to capture the town. "If they failed he said he would cut off his other arm," a government soldier said.
