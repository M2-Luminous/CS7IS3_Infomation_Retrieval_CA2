Mr. Selami pointed out the losses of the Albanian economy caused by the sanctions imposed on former Yugoslavia, which amount to [words indistinct] electric power, bitumen, etc. Also the only railway line which links Albania with Europe has been closed, creating great difficulties in the transport of commodities. In these conditions, Mr. Selami demanded that the international community and the European Community must help Albania to compensate the losses caused by the embargo. Mr. Selami suggested that compensation should cover material assistance for the population mostly affected by the embargo and creation of facilitations for the customs and transport. Although Albania is experiencing the economic consequences of the embargo, Mr. Selami said, it is seriously committed to observe it. We are against the lifting of the embargo against Serbia and Montenegro unless a peaceful solution is found in former Yugoslavia. The lifting of the embargo, Mr. Selami said, would be a favour for the aggressor and another chance for greater difficulties in the efforts to resolve the conflict in Bosnia and prevent its expansion in Kosova and broader. If the international community is willing to prevent the further expansion of the conflict and to learn from the mistakes in Bosnia, it should condition the lifting of the embargo with the correct resolving of the conflict.
