The demonstrators carried placards and banners and chanted slogans in condemnation of Serbian crimes and UN policies towards them during their march towards the UN office. Some of the banners carried by the students read "Serbs are committing crimes, Butrus-Ghali and the West are supporting them". The marchers expressed their hatred of the UN's negligence towards the fate of Bosnian Muslims and of the shameful silence of Western countries on the massacre of defenceless women and children in an area declared by the UN as a safe haven. In a resolution issued at the end of the rally, the students voiced their readiness to be despatched to Bosnia-Herzegovina to fight the aggressor Serbs. Denouncing biased stance of the UN and its Security Council on the issue, the students called for lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnian Muslims. Stressing that a proper response to aggressor Serbs could be given through unity of Muslims, the resolution urged all Muslim countries to mobilize their forces and resources for this purpose. Meanwhile, the ulema of the theological school of Qom staged similar demonstration in the streets of the holy city in protest at the silence of international circles on the crimes being committed by the Serbs in Gorazde. Also today, the Shahid (Martyr) Foundation issued a statement, condemning the silence of the UN and its Security Council on Serbian crimes in Gorazde. The statement described the carnage of Muslims in Gorazde as a proof of the "prejudiced attitudes" of the UN and its Security Council.
