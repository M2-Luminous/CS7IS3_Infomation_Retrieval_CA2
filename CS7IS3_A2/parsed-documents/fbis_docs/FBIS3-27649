Huang, at a Legislative Yuan briefing session, reported that although the protection law, made public at the end of last year by Mainland China's State Council, seems to have upgraded the status of Taiwan businessmen on the mainland, it does not include concrete measures to protect Taiwan investors' business interests and personal rights. The newly issued investment protection law still considers Taiwan investors "special local investors" subject to Mainland China's relevant laws and regulations, Huang said. Huang appealed to local industries to act with utmost caution in the face of any possible policy changes that might cause great losses to them, given that Mainland China is undergoing an economic transformation from a planned economy to a market-oriented one. Mainland China so far lacks a comprehensive law regulating Taiwan industries' investment and normal business practices there, let alone protecting their property rights and lives, Huang said. In other countries, he added, foreign investors are usually given special protection. Taiwan investors can be fully protected in Mainland China only when a formal and wide-ranging investment guarantee agreement is worked out by Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] and Beijing's Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], he said. The SEF and ARATS are the semi-official agents representing Taiwan and Mainland China in cross-strait affairs in the absence of formal contacts between Taipei and Beijing.
