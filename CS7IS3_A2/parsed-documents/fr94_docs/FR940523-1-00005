FR940523-1-00005 FR940523-1-00002 The witness noted that the administrative costs of tracking distribution and sales patterns are greater with the regulatory shifts. Additional administrative effort and time on the part of the market administrator, the proprietary handler, and the cooperative supplier is necessary to obtain information detailing where the milk originates and where the product is sold to consumers. Because of the numerous areas in which the handler markets products, the witness testified, it is more difficult for the handler to properly report its sales of UHT milk on a monthly basis. Payroll information requirements are duplicated in both the originating and the pooling orders and are necessary for all producers' milk that is shipped to the plant during the month. Because the producers whose milk is shipped to the proponent's plant may vary during the month, more administrative work is created. The variation of reports required under different orders also requires additional time each month. The process would be simplified for the market administrator, handler, and cooperative if regulation were maintained under only one order. Moreover, some markets under which the proponent's plant has been pooled have base-excess plans, such as the Carolina order. According to proponent's post-hearing brief, because the group of producers whose milk is supplied to the proponent changes somewhat each month, little or no base would be accumulated, even under continuous regulation, in a market that uses a base-excess plan. Hence, producers supplying the predominantly Class I White Knight plant would be penalized by receiving the excess or Class III price. The brief continues by noting that failure to earn base creates a disincentive for producers to supply a Class I plant, which is not the intent of the base-excess provisions or the Federal Order program. In proponent's view, failure to adopt its lock-in proposal on an expedited basis would cause continuation of disruptive market conditions, operational problems for the UHT plant, administrative problems for the various orders, competitive uncertainty for the proponent, and payment problems for producers. A witness representing Independent Cooperative Milk Producers Association (ICMPA) and Michigan Milk Producers Association (MMPA) also testified in support of proposals 3 and 4. The entire milk supply for the White Knight plant is obtained from ICMPA and MMPA. The witness concurred with the proponent's testimony. He stated that continuing to sell milk to the plant puts producers whose milk is shipped to White Knight in an inequitable situation with other order producers, and that various Class I differentials adjusted for location are disruptive to the order. Some milk destined for White Knight has been reloaded at a plant located within the marketing area to insure that it will be pooled under the order. The witness testified that reloading is not practical and results in increased costs for the supplying cooperative and White Knight. The supplying cooperatives' witness also raised concerns about base-excess possibilities. The witness stated that by shipping the milk to White Knight, the cooperative is accepting the price that will be received for it. ICMPA, he testified, does not want to supply a handler and receive less value for the milk than would have been received if the milk were sold for utilization within the market area. The witness also testified that the potential of being pooled under a base-excess order, in months when milk in excess of an established base is assigned a lower value, could cause the supplying cooperative to deny shipments of milk to the distributing plant. No opposition to the proposal was expressed at the hearing or in briefs. The record evidence indicates that fluid milk products have been processed at the proponent's plant since September 1993; currently, UHT pasteurization and aseptic packaging are used in the manufacturing of all dairy products. Most of the plant's milk utilization is classified as Class I, and a small amount of the milk is classified as Class III. White Knight purchases milk from two cooperatives which represent approximately 80 percent of producer milk in the order. The proponent's distribution channels for UHT fluid milk are substantially different from those used to distribute fluid milk products that require refrigeration. These latter products generally are distributed through frequent deliveries by distributing plants to stores within the marketing area. According to record evidence, the proponent's products are distributed as far away as the Caribbean and in a substantial number of federal order areas each month. Under current provisions, a distributing fluid milk plant that qualifies for pooling under more than one order during the same month is regulated under the order in which such plant's route distribution is the greatest. Such a provision normally assures that all handlers having their principal sales in a market are subject to the same pricing and other regulatory requirements. However, because of its products' distribution patterns, the proponent's UHT plant has yet to be regulated under any one particular order on a regular basis. The problems that have occurred from such pooling uncertainties are severe enough to override the traditional basis for pooling a distributing plant.
