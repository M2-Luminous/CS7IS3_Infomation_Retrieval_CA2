Speaking here after visiting Sarajevo earlier in the day with her Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller, the Islamic head of government said the United Nations should press for an "early negotiated political settlement" and, failing that, opt for air strikes. The United States had already "made it clear that it is prepared to go ahead" with air strikes, but a lot depended on the stance of European countries and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. She added: "If the UN Secretary General feels that he cannot reach a consensus for air strikes, the least that can be done is allow the arms embargo (on Bosnia) to be lifted, so that the people of Bosnia can defend themselves."
