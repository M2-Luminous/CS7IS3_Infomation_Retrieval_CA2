FR940504-1-00033 FR940504-1-00010 4. P040 is also amended to relax the design restrictions of permit imprint indicia. Current standards allow use of only the formats illustrated in the DMM_basically a plain box with plain lettering. While this format was adequate for years, contemporary marketing techniques and competitive pressures among mail users have made the attractiveness of the mailpiece a cornerstone of efforts to interest the addressee in what is inside the mailpiece. As a result, mailers have become more interested in using artistic latitude in designing the permit imprint indicium that appears on the mailpiece. The Postal Service understands the mailer interest in this matter and accepts the validity of proposals for greater design flexibility. However, those must be balanced against the needs of the Postal Service to maintain the clear recognition of the indicium both as evidence of postage payment and as an indicator of the mailer's identity. Therefore, P040 is amended as shown below to allow some greater flexibility in the preparation of permit imprint indicia. Generally, the proposed standard reinforces the distinctiveness of an indicium but allows its incorporation into a design of the mailer's choice. The combined design must be in a prescribed area of the upper right corner of the address side, area, or label on the mailpiece, must not imitate a stamp or meter impression, and must keep the indicia free of words and other printing not specified by the format standards. While some mailers may prefer more latitude, the Postal Service believes the proposed standards grant significant new flexibility to mailpiece designers in a reasonable balance between such flexibility and the Postal Service's legitimate interest in maintaining recognizable permit indicia. 5. P200 is amended to set a sunset date for the use of key rates. Key rates basically represent a simplified method of computing zone-rate postage on issues of second-class publications having a stable distribution pattern. Publishers and others who provided the Postal Service with suggestions for simplifying these regulations noted the diminishing use of key rates in an era of centralized postage, electronic funds transfer, multiple editions, and other industry changes. At the same time, postal personnel, noting how seldom key rates are used and the resulting lessening of understanding and experience in their administration, agreed that their continued availability should be questioned. Therefore, by the revision shown below, the Postal Service proposes to end the use of key rates. No new users would be added after September 30, 1994, or on adoption of a final rule, whichever is later, and, to allow for an orderly transition for remaining key rate users, termination of key rates would be deferred until March 31, 1995, or 6 months after adoption of a final rule, whichever is later. The Postal Service recognizes that there are some publishers that may still use key rates and does not wish to impact them more than necessary. However, the Postal Service, which also recognizes the need to eliminate nonessential regulations if the mailing community is to be better served, feels that key rates exemplify a potential for such action. Although exempt from the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b), (c)) regarding proposed rulemaking by 39 U.S.C. 410(a), the Postal Service invites comments on the following proposed revisions of the DMM, incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations.
