The statement follows a period of irritation with the future course of that world power, the United States. Is there an Asian temptation in Washington? If that was the case, then the President has adjusted the course: Washington wants to remain the leading political and military power in Europe. That is a load off the minds of the Europeans. Following the euphoria that surrounded the changes in Europe and Russia's return to its historical course of power politics, the American presence is necessary to preserve balance. Having learned their lesson from crises, wars, and Moscow conspiracies, the West Europeans have paid their respects once again. NATO has also benefited from the situation. Against a background that has grown darker, the sense and purpose of the alliance seems brighter. One is aware once again that without it, the old continent will go astray. For the United States, Russia is a priority. Influenced by his State Department adviser Talbott, Clinton is counting on the reformers around Yeltsin. There is a risk in that: The reform may fail. Partnership for peace can mean many things. Whether the measures that have been announced are sufficient to offer security to the peoples of "middle Europe" remains open. They have conditional protection. Unconditional confidence cannot develop out of that. America's reaffirmed commitment to Europe is a ray of hope for them -- no more and no less.
