In an interview to AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper, published here today, Mr Hamdun added that the current position of the leadership and the recent visit by deputy premier, Tariq 'Aziz, to New York and his talks with the Security Council members was a solid one and placed Iraq's enemies and advocates of the continuity of the blockade in a difficult and critical corner, because it stripped them of the pretexts. The Iraqi diplomat regarded the increase in number of the states supporting Iraq's cooperation with the Security Council and the progress made in implementing the resolutions and the lifting of the blockade as the best evidence on feasibility of the Iraqi stance and effectiveness of the Iraqi diplomacy. Assessing the position inside the Security Council during the July discussions, Mr Hamdun further said "the continuity of the Iraqi cooperation with the U.N and its specialized bodies drew further hostile pretexts, thus the forthcoming discussions by the Security Council should largely reflect the positive state". He stressed that the July discussions would be a step forward for lifting the blockade. The U.S policy versus Iraq is governed by the complex of its traditional view to the Middle East and in the light of factors of the Arab-Israeli conflict in addition to the substantial issue, namely, the energy and its flow, Mr Hamdun said. He confirmed that Iraq was an important country and its role within the frame of the future view could not be set aside by the decision-makers in the United States, and any arrangements to be discussed or implemented would remain inferior unless Iraq is playing its normal geo-political role in the region.
