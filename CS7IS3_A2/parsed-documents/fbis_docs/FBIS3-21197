The council which is the highest determining body of university management decided on observer participation of foreign professors; this is a very unusual attempt in national universities. Observers have no voting rights when determining important policies, but their proposals are recognized. At the council meeting held on 16 September, the designated Professor of Education Pak Son-u from Korea was the first to participate. Saying ``this is a `splendid deed' and also advances the internationalization of public universities which is lagging behind private universities,'' Professor Pak was frankly happy with his participation. This system is the proposal of the school president Reona Esaki, aiming to actually ``to make a university with an international viewpoint.'' This is an idea much in keeping with Esaki who is well informed of world affairs, but other ideas aimed at developing international exchange without stopping here are concealed. One of those is to extend the term of foreign professors which is currently a five year term. In calling for prominent scholars from foreign countries, the lifelong employment system will become an international custom. In the future, this will be deliberated in the council. It has been one and a half years since Esaki, a Nobel Prize recipient, ended over thirty years living in the United States and took the position of president of Tsukuba University. The policies for ``activation of the university'' set forth since he took that position have taken the form of pledges.
