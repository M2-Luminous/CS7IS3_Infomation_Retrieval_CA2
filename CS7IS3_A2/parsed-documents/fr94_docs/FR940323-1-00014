FR940323-1-00014 FR940323-1-00005 2. Resource Standard The statute allows States, at their option, to apply a resource standard to the low-income eligibility groups of pregnant women, infants, and children under section 1902(1) of the Act. Section 9401 of OBRA '86 establishes a floor for the resource standard that is a specific and objective standard. If a State chooses to apply a resource standard, the standard may be no more restrictive than that applied under SSI for pregnant women, and than that applied under AFDC, for infants and children. (If Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands elect to apply a resource standard, that standard for pregnant women may be no more restrictive than that applied under SSI under section 1613 of the Act. This is because the reference to the resource standard for pregnant women in the statute is to the standard that is applied under title XVI (that is, SSI) and not to the standard that is applied under the State plan program under title XVI.) The amendments regarding the different treatment of income and resources for the mandatory and optional groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children do not require or permit this different treatment to be applied to other Medicaid eligibility groups under the comparability provisions of section 1902(a)(17) of the Act. 3. Applicability for States With Section 1115 Waivers and for Territories Section 302(c) of MCCA struck the original section 1902(1)(4)(A) of the Act and section 302(d) of MCCA added a new section 1902(1)(4)(A). Under the new section 1902(1)(4)(A), as amended by section 6401 of OBRA '89 and section 4601 of OBRA '90, States that are providing Medicaid under a waiver granted under section 1115 of the Act must provide mandatory categorically needy eligibility to pregnant women and infants under age 1 with incomes at or below 133 percent of the poverty level under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), children age 1 but under age 6 with incomes at or below 133 percent of the poverty level under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) and children who have attained age 6 but are under age 19 with incomes at or below 100 percent of the poverty level under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) in the same manner as other States. States operating under a waiver granted under section 1115 of the Act must (as all other States must) cover the mandatory groups at higher levels if they have already chosen to use those higher levels. However, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands retain the option of providing Medicaid to the otherwise mandatory groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children. The Territories may establish separate or identical income standards for pregnant women and infants at any percentage of the poverty level at or below 185 percent. However, if a Territory chooses to cover children from age 1 up to age 6, it must cover all such children with incomes at or below 133 percent of the poverty level. Also, if a Territory chooses to cover children born after September 30, 1983 who have attained age 6 but are under age 19, it must cover all such children with incomes at or below 100 percent of the poverty level. 4. Comparability of Services Section 1902(a)(10) of the Act, as amended by section 9401 of OBRA '86, section 4101 of OBRA '87, and section 302(a)(1)(C) of MCCA, contains an exemption to the comparability of services requirements at section 1902(a)(10)(B) for services furnished to pregnant women described in section 1902(l)(1)(A) of the Act who are eligible as mandatory or optional categorically needy under the provisions of sections 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX). The amended provision (under clause (VII) following what is currently paragraph (F) of section 1902(a)(10)) provides that the services that are available to pregnant women under the section 1902(l) low-income eligibility groups are limited to services relating to pregnancy (including prenatal, delivery, family planning, and postpartum services) and to other conditions that may complicate pregnancy. (Section 4101(e)(1) of OBRA '87 expanded services related to pregnancy to include ``family planning.'') The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), Public Law 99&hyph;272, enacted an earlier comparability of services requirement for all pregnant women covered under the State plan. This requirement appears under clause (V) following what is currently paragraph (F) of section 1902(a)(10). This provision states that if a State makes available ``services relating to pregnancy (including prenatal, delivery, and postpartum services) or to any other condition which may complicate pregnancy,'' the State is not required to provide these services to any other individual, except pregnant women, covered under the plan. The State must provide its pregnancy-related services and services for any other condition that may complicate pregnancy, in the same amount, duration, and scope, to all pregnant women covered under the State plan, including pregnant women whose pregnancy is not the basis for their Medicaid eligibility (e.g., those receiving AFDC or SSI). (See §§440.210 and 440.220).
