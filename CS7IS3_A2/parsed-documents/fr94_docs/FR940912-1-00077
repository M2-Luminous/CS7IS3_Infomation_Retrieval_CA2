Note: The PacFIN data indicate that, in the BSAI, motherships and shore-based processors paid approximately the same price for pollock during the roe season, but that motherships paid 17.4% less than shore-based plants during the non-roe season. If a separate standard exvessel price is used for at-sea processors during the non-roe season, the proposed price is $0.058. If a separate standard exvessel price is used for shore-based processors, the proposed price is $0.072. 2. Total exvessel value. The total exvessel value of Research Plan fisheries is calculated as the sum of the product of the standard exvessel prices established for the calendar year and projected retained catches, by species. For 1995, proposed total exvessel values of species from Research Plan fisheries, based on best available information, are as follows: Projected 1995 Retained Catch, Price, and Exvessel Value by Species 1Species 1Retained catch (x1,000 lbs) 1Price1 ($/lb) 1Exvessel value2 (x$1,000) Halibut 44,000 1.50 66,000 Tanner Crab: C. bairdi 15,200 1.80 27,360 C. opilio 100,000 1.30 130,000 King Crab: Bristol Bay red 13,200 3.70 48,840 Adak red 1,000 4.07 4,070 Pribilof red 2,600 5.00 13,000 Norton Sound red 300 1.75 525 St. Matthew blue 2,900 3.01 8,729 Dutch Harbor brown 1,200 2.22 2,664 Adak brown 4,100 2.31 9,471 n,s Total crab 140,500 3242,559 Groundfish: Arrowtooth flounder 4,224 0.020 84 Atka mackerel 106,175 0.200 21,231 Deepwater flatfish 12,628 0.112 1,416 Demersal rockfish 1,620 0.407 659 Flatfish 19,037 0.072 1,370 Flathead sole 4,067 0.149 606 Greenland turbot 13,798 0.300 4,139 Other flatfish 17,855 0.030 536 Other red rockfish 3,641 0.200 728 Other rockfish 33,092 0.200 6,617 Pacific ocean perch 970 0.200 194 Pacific cod 356,081 0.176 62,842 Pelagic rockfish 5,896 0.116 686 Pollock (A season) 1,061,105 0.081 86,399 Pollock (B season) 1,719,046 0.071 121,497 Rock sole (w/o roe) 18,006 0.072 1,296 Rock sole (with roe) 28,399 0.352 9,995 Sablefish 52,243 0.914 47,747 Shallow water flatfish 13,685 0.150 2,052 Shortraker/rougheye 2,815 0.199 559 Slope rockfish 13,388 0.105 1,406 Thornyhead rockfish 1,803 0.389 701 Yellowfin sole 152,489 0.072 10,977 n,s Total Groundfish 3,642,065 383,737 3 Research Plan Fisheries Total4 $693 million 1Exvessel prices for groundfish are weighted average prices across area and gear. 2The product of retained catch and price does not necessarily equal the exvessel value due to rounding of retained catch and price. 3After $2.1 million of catch in State waters is subtracted. 4Total does not exactly equal sum of total groundfish, halibut, and crab due to rounding. Note: If a BSAI pollock non-roe season price of $0.058 per pound is used for at-sea processors instead of the shore-based processor price of $0.072, total exvessel value is reduced by about $13 million. The use of a shore-based processor rock sole price of $0.072 throughout the year for rock sole deliveries to shore-based processors instead of the at-sea processor price of $0.352 during the roe rock sole fishery reduces total value by less than $0.1 million.
