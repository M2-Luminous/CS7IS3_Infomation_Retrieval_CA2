FR940513-0-00155 FR940513-0-00034 E. Disclosures for General Service Fluorescent Lamps In the NPR, the Commission proposed requiring the disclosure of the same six factors for general service fluorescent lamps as it proposed for the other types of lamps. 203 Similarly, ACEEE's suggestions for disclosures did not distinguish between general service fluorescent lamps and other types of lamps. Instead, ACEEE suggested that the Commission prescribe different requirements based on the type of purchaser_residential or commercial_at which the disclosure was to be targeted. 204 203 58 FR at 60154&hyph;55. These were: (1) Lumens; (2) watts; (3) design voltage (if other than 120); (4) average life (expressed in hours); (5) number of items in the package; and, (6) a supplemental disclosure (lumens per watt or operating cost). 204 58 FR at 60154. In contrast, NEMA suggested that, for the two types of lamps for which Congress established minimum efficiency standards in the EPA 92 amendments to EPCA_general service incandescent reflector lamps and general service fluorescent lamps_the Commission require the disclosure of only an encircled ``E'' on packages, in catalogs and etched on the product itself. 205 The encircled ``E'' would designate that the product meets the established energy conservation standards. In support of this recommendation, NEMA stated that interchangeable general service fluorescent lamps that will remain on the market after the energy conservation standards set by EPA 92 become effective (April 30, 1994, for some lamp products, and October 31, 1995, for other lamp products) will have a range of output of only plus or minus four percent. 206 205 Id . at 60152&hyph;54. The minimum efficiency standards for these products are prescribed in section 325(i) of EPCA. 42 U.S.C. 6295(i) (West Supp. 1993). 206 Id. at 60152. 1. Disclosures for General Service Fluorescent Lamps Generally Fifteen comments addressed the issue of what disclosures the Commission should require for general service fluorescent lamps. Seven recommended prescribing disclosure of the same elements for these lamps as were proposed by the Commission in the NPR. 207 Eight comments supported NEMA's recommendation that the Commission require disclosure only of the encircled ``E.'' 208 ACEEE originally opposed limiting the disclosure of information for any lamps to the encircled ``E,'' favoring instead the ``basic disclosures'' (without lumens-per-watt) for all types. 209 At the Workshop and in its post-Workshop comment, however, ACEEE appeared to have changed its views, and to accept the idea of limiting disclosures to the encircled ``E'' on packaging for general service fluorescent lamps as long as the other elements (or some of them) are disclosed in catalogs offering the lamps for sale. 210 207 LBL, GG&hyph;7, 1; MN DPS, GG&hyph;9, 1&hyph;2; MO DNR, GG&hyph;10, 1; OR DOE, GG&hyph;13, 2&hyph;7, 7&hyph;8; US EPA, GG&hyph;17, 2; WA SEO, GG&hyph;18, 2&hyph;3. 208 Angelo, G&hyph;1, 1; GE, G&hyph;2, 5, (Ans.), 1, 2, (Tr.), 324; NEMA, G&hyph;3, 24, (Tr.), 316&hyph;317, (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 29; Philips, G&hyph;5, 3, (Supp.), G&hyph;12, 2; Osram (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 4; ETL, GG&hyph;2, 1&hyph;2; IES, GG&hyph;6, 2; LRC, GG&hyph;15, 3, (Tr.), 318. 209 ACEEE, GG&hyph;1, 1, 3. 210 ACEEE (Tr.), 328&hyph;29, (Supp.), GG&hyph;21, 2.
