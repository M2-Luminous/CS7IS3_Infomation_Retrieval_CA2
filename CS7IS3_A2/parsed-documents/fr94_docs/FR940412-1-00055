(11) Return on Investment_means the Return element, divided by the Investment Base, and expressed as a percent. Investment base formula. (1) Regulatory Investment (Investment Base) is the recognized capital investment in the useful assets employed by the pilot groups. In general, it is the sum of available cash and the net value of real assets, less the value of land. The investment base is established through the use of the balance sheet accounts, as amended by material supplied in the Notes to the Financial Statement. (2) The Investment Base is calculated using data from the Uniform System of Accounts described in part 403, as audited and approved by the Director. Accounts, listed in the Investment Base formula below, which end in 999 are not separate accounts, but the summation of the accounts listed in each particular grouping. For instance, account no. 10999 is not a separate balance sheet account, it is the summation of all individual balance sheet accounts in the 10000 grouping. The Investment Base would be calculated as follows: ␣ 1Account No. 1Description 1 Recognized Assets: 0 10999 + Total Current Assets 29999 ^ Total Current Liabilities 20100 + Current Notes Payable 13999 + Total Property and Equipment (Net) 12000 ^ Land 15000 + Total Other Assets n,s ␣ = Total Recognized Assets 1 Non-Recognized Assets: 0 11999 + Total Investments and Special Funds n,s ␣ = Total Non-Recognized Assets 1 Total Assets: 0 ␣ + Total Recognized Assets ␣ + Total Non-Recognized Assets n,s ␣ = Total Assets 1 Recognized Sources of Funds: 0 39999 + Total Stockholders' Equity 26000 + Long-Term Debt 20100 + Current Notes Payable 24500 + Advances from Affiliated Companies 26100&hyph;500 + Long-Term Obligations-Capital Leases n,s ␣ = Total Recognized Sources 1 Non-Recognized Sources of Funds: 0 26600 + Pension Liability 26800 + Other Non-Current Liabilities 27000 + Deferred Federal Income Taxes 27200 + Other Deferred Credits n,s ␣ = Total Non-Recognized Sources 1 Total Sources of Funds: 0 ␣ + Total Recognized Sources ␣ + Total Non-Recognized Sources n,s ␣ = Total Sources of Funds (3) Using the figures developed above, the Investment Base is the Recognized Assets times the ratio of Recognized Sources of Funds to Total Sources of Funds.
