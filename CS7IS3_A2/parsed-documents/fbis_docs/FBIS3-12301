Think not of those who are slain in God's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord. [Koranic verse] My presence and that of the brothers here among you, our dear kinsfolk, our men and enduring ones--knowing that we have always been one family--is something natural. [passage omitted] We previously talked about the issue of religious jurisdiction and the need to focus on this dimension. Thus, as far as the Islamic holy places and other places and our sanctities are concerned, jurisdiction should be the responsibility of the Islamic nation as a whole. This talk was a responsible and objective one. I believe that the sad and tragic chain, including setting fire to the al-Aqsa Mosque, repeatedly encroaching on the Christian holy places, and yesterday's tragedy, is clear proof that we can only continue to demand that this religious sovereignty be that of God the almighty alone, and also of his worshippers who are able to protect their holy places and who can vie with one another for the fear and respect of God. O kinsfolk and brothers, be sure that we will work to the best of our ability, so heads will remain raised and will only bow to God the almighty. We will defend justice, and, as always, we will have solid positions in the face of any manifestations by some to disregard our right, the right of our kinsfolk and brothers on their national soil. There was much talk about peace. We sincerely and honestly proceeded toward peace. However, it should be an honorable and just peace which will be accepted by the coming generations. It is not, and will not be, capitulation. God knows the magnitude of the pressures we are facing. You are well aware of the challenges and dangers we faced in the past and which we are facing now with clear vision and cooperation. We are the pioneers of those who call for Arab convergence, cooperation, fraternity, honesty, and good faith, and we will continue to be so. O kinsfolk, brothers, and dear ones, be sure that had I personally been an obstacle to this Arab convergence, I would not have remained one moment in this position. [applause] This speech is not a new one. Many fraternal Arab leaders heard this speech years ago. However, we will renew the call for convergence and cooperation in fulfillment of the duty toward the coming generations. We only seek to satisfy both God the almighty and our conscience. Here, with reason, awareness, and the insistence on controlling our nerves more than before. [sentence as heard] We should also organize our ranks, endure, and be ready to bear more pressures. [We should maintain] the splendid picture which used to be, and which will continue, of this (?one) family in order to face the challenges and fate of this universe. Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, but help ye not one another in sin and rancor. [Koranic verse] God bless you all. May God grant us strength to endure his will. We have not forgotten for a single moment the kinsfolk and brothers, nor will we forget for one moment our duties toward them. We will optimally do what we can, with God's help. May you be safeguarded by God, the protector of the march. God the almighty is the one who grants success. We hope we will constantly meet in better circumstances than these ones. Once again, we all extend to the dear and beloved kinsfolk and brothers in Hebron much love, appreciation, and pride in their steadfastness. We also extend all sentiments of sharing, which we will embody to the best of our ability at present and in the future, and under all circumstances, in terms of bearing what they have endured and facing what they continue to endure. We are with them, with God's help. May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.
