This is the result of an arbitrary behaviour of the host of the conference, Egypt, whose Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa had decided "not to allow Serbia" to participate in the meeting for two reasons: because he does not recognize the right of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to succession and because of what he described as "Belgrade's involvement in Bosnia and Croatia." Instead of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Egypt invited to the conference Moslem officials from the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as those from Croatia and Slovenia. Officials from Greece, Bulgaria and many countries of the former Soviet Union and some West European countries will be present as guests or observers. The agenda of the conference, to be opened by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, will include the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the conflicts in Rwanda, Cambodia and Yemen, the Movement's future in the light of the new world order and economic problems of the member-countries.
