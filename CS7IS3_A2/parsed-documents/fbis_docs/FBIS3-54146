He said: President al-Asad conveyed the Arab demand clearly, rejected separate deals, and regarded every such deal as a failure. He held talks with the U.S. President from a position of strength, if one can say so. He promoted Arab prestige in this meeting. He proved that the Arabs have a legitimate right to wage a struggle and regain their land in Lebanon, Palestine, the Golan, and other areas. He held talks between two equals. The United States will have to act as an unbiased mediator to fulfill the Arab demand regarding the confirmation and implementation of UN resolutions. The ball is now in the court of the Americans and the Israelis. In an interview published by AL-SHIRA' magazine today, Minister Junblatt said that President al-Asad discussed Lebanon's case on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 425, which Lebanon is seeking to implement. President al-Asad emphasized the need for the Lebanese and Syrian tracks to be harmonious. If the Americans are able to give the Golan back to al-Asad or Syria and ensure the implementation of Resolution 425 for Lebanon, the situation will, of course, be better. Minister Junblatt called for a plan to improve the domestic situation to deal with normalization with Israel. He said: If normalization takes place, the Zionist presence will increase. Therefore, what is needed is a plan to strengthen the political and economic situation to prevent the Zionists from infiltrating through companies and cultural affairs. The Zionist presence is subversive and will penetrate into the Arab and Islamic society. It will attempt to cause division and strife. Regarding the faction in Lebanon that will suffer most as a result of normalization with Israel, Junblatt said: There is fear for Lebanon because of fragile national unity, as the Zionists might attempt again to divide Lebanon and use previous agents or some new agents to undermine national unity. Therefore, there is concern about national unity. We want national unity to be based on Arab unity with Syria. Normalization presents a danger to Lebanon. Some may return to wanting sectarian mini states or cantons. Minister Junblatt stressed the need for the government to adopt a clearer social policy. Rafiq al-Hariri still represents the promise for a political, economic, and reconstruction revival. But we call on the government and its head to take into account a very important issue--a clearer social policy. The government cannot remain without a social policy vis-a-vis the labor and farmers' unions, the elderly, and the poorer class in Lebanon, which is getting poorer because of the presence of a wealthy class that is getting wealthier. The government does not yet have a social policy.
