FBIS4-59726 "drnes095_s_94003" FBIS-NES-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 SOUTH ASIA Iran Saudi Stance on `Day of Support' for Bosnia Decried Saudi Stance on `Day of Support' for Bosnia Decried NC1605064094 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran First Program Network in Persian 0230 GMT 16 May 94 NC1605064094 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran First Program Network Persian BFN [Text] In tandem with the declaration of the Iranian pilgrims' day of support for the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the representative of the supreme leader and the head of the Iranian pilgrims to the house of God staged a spectacular ceremony at the mission of the esteemed leadership in holy Mecca last night. During the ceremony, which was attended by many Iranian and non-Iranian pilgrims, Ayatollah Jannati, the supreme leader's representative on Bosnia-Herzegovina affairs, discussed the Serbs' numerous crimes and the oppression of the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Criticizing the silence and indifference by international forums and by heads of Islamic countries, he said: The land of revelation and the house of God are the best venues for defending oppressed Muslim nations, especially the oppressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Why should Hajj officials be satisfied with praying and prevent practical steps from being taken in support of the Bosnian Muslims? Referring to the Islamic Republic's assistance and support for the oppressed Bosnian Muslims, he said: We have always stressed that without the least bit of irreverence for the house of God and by fully observing order, the problems and difficulties of 1 billion Muslims should be propounded and solutions found. The issues that the Islamic Republic of Iran raises are not its own issues; they are the problems of the world of Islam. He added: Today no issue is being attacked as much as Islam. Muslim nations are aggressed and placed under pressure on charges of wanting Islam. Saudi Government officials have officially disagreed with the declaration of the day of support for the oppressed Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina and with the collection of aid for them. Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Mohammadi-Reyshahri, the representative of the supreme leader and head of the Iranian pilgrims to the house of God, stated in reply to a letter from the Saudi minister of pilgrimage: We are surprised that the Saudi Government is raising the issue of helping the Muslim nation in Bosnia and calling on Friday imams to pray for the nation, yet preventing Iranian pilgrims from trying to help the Bosnian Muslims and collect aid for them.
