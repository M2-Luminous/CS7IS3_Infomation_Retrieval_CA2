FR941013-2-00087 FR941013-2-00068 [Docket No. AB&hyph;316 (Sub-No. 1X)] Angelina & Neches River Railroad Company_Discontinuance of Trackage Rights Exemption_Angelina County, TX Angelina & Neches River Railroad Company (ANR) has filed a verified notice under 49 CFR Part 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments and Discontinuance of Trackage Rights to discontinue trackage rights over the 2.79-mile Rockland Branch owned by Southern Pacific Transportation Company (SP) between milepost 129.33, near Buck Creek, and milepost 132.12, near Dunagan, in Angelina County, TX. 1 1 SP has filed a petition for exemption to abandon the Rockland Branch in Docket No. AB&hyph;12 (Sub-No. 153X). ANR has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic on the line can be rerouted; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in complainant's favor within the last 2 years; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.11 and 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to government agencies) and 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication) have been met. 2 2 ANR has not filed environmental or historic reports on the ground that a discontinuance of trackage rights is not subject to environmental and historic reporting requirements, citing 49 CFR 1105.6(c)(6) and .8(a). Instead, it incorporates by reference the environmental report filed by SP in the related abandonment proceeding. As a condition to this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the discontinuance shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen , 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether employees are adequately protected, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. This exemption will be effective November 12, 1994, unless stayed or a statement of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) is filed. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues 3 and statements of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2) 4 must be filed by October 24, 1994. Petitions to reopen must be filed by November 2, 1994. 5 An original and 10 copies of any such filing must be sent to the Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. In addition, one copy must be served on Peter A. Greene, Thompson, Hine and Flory, 1920 N Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20036. 3 The Commission will grant a stay if an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission in its independent investigation) cannot be made before the exemption's effective date. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines , 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any request for a stay should be filed as soon as possible so that the Commission may take appropriate action before the exemption's effective date. 4 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist. , 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 5 Alternative post-abandonment public uses for the right-of-way underlying the line are inapplicable where operations are to be discontinued but the line itself is not being abandoned. Here, trail use/rail banking and other public use alternatives to rail freight service may be pursued in the abandonment proceeding referenced in footnote 1. SEA will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by October 18, 1994. A copy of the EA may be obtained by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser at (202) 9276248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA becomes available to the public. If the verified notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Decided: October 5, 1994. By the Commission, Joseph H. Dettmar, Acting Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25360 Filed 10&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
