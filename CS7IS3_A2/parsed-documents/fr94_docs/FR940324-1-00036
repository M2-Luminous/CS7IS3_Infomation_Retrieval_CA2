FR940324-1-00036 FR940324-1-00009 (2) Racing Exclusion According to 40 CFR 85.1511(e), a racing vehicle may be imported by any person provided the vehicle meets one or more of the exclusion criteria set forth in 40 CFR 85.1703. Presently, EPA policy will allow such a vehicle to be imported only with a prior written EPA determination that the vehicle meets these exclusion criteria. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that vehicles which may be legally operated or are capable of being legally operated on the streets and highways will not be imported as racing vehicles. EPA proposes to incorporate this practice into the regulations. (3) Warranty/Insurance When the current Imports program was initially implemented in 1988, EPA discovered that ICIs were not capable of obtaining the independent insurance coverage as required in 40 CFR 85.1510(b)(2). As a result, EPA proposes to amend the existing regulations to allow an ICI to obtain prepaid independent insurance coverage less than that required by the regulations, with the ICI retaining full responsibility for the remaining warranty coverage. The prepaid insurance policy, underwritten by an independent insurance company, shall at a minimum provide coverage for emission related components installed or modified by the ICI and to the maximum extent possible, the emission related components installed by the OEM. This change does not alter the requirement that the ICI provide an emissions warranty as required by section 207 (a) and (b) of the Act. (4) Minor Clarifications EPA is also proposing the following minor clarifications and changes: (1) Adding a definition of fifteen working day hold period (and five working day hold period) (40 CFR 85.1502), (2) clarifying that the fifteen (or five) working day hold period begins the first working day after the application for final admission is received by the Manufacturers Operations Division (40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509), (3) providing for the transfer of control of a nonconforming motor vehicle between ICIs after conditional admission (40 CFR 85.1504), (4) adding a requirement that vehicles be stored within 50 miles of the test facility during the fifteen working day hold period (importers wishing to use storage facilities not meeting this criterion must obtain EPA's prior written approval) (40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509), (5) providing for the acceptance of alternative dates in lieu of the date of original manufacture, if it is unobtainable (40 CFR 85.1507), (6) clarifying the repair and alteration exemption (40 CFR 85.1511), (7) clarifying the exclusion for methanol-fueled vehicles produced prior to the 1990 model year (40 CFR 85.1511), (8) clarifying the catalyst control programs and other requirements for United States version vehicles driven overseas (40 CFR 85.1512), (9) clarifying that the ICI must retain control of each vehicle until final admission is granted by EPA (40 CFR 85.1513), (10) adding a requirement that to be eligible to modify and test six-year old or older vehicles under 40 CFR 85.1509, an ICI must have a currently valid certificate of conformity for the same vehicle type ( i.e., light-duty gasoline-fueled vehicle/truck, heavy-duty diesel engine, or motorcycle) (40 CFR 85.1509), (11) clarify that unless all requirements of 40 CFR 85.1505 or 85.1509 have been met, final admission status will not be granted (40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509), (12) delete the requirement that a vehicle greater than 20 original production (OP) years old which is ineligible for exclusion, must be imported by an ICI (40 CFR 85.1511), (13) clarify that vehicles returning to the United States may be imported under bond for restoration of any missing, damaged, or disabled emission-related parts (40 CFR 85.1512), (14) modify existing regulatory language to accurately reflect recent changes in the Act regarding useful life and civil penalties (40 CFR 85.1507, 85.1508, 85.1510, and 85.1513), (15) clarify that a conditionally admitted vehicle or engine must comply with EPA requirements at the time that the application for final admission is submitted to EPA (40 CFR ยง85.1513), (16) clarify that the recordkeeping requirements for maintaining a list of vehicle modifications includes all part numbers and calibration changes (40 CFR 85.1507), and (17) clarify that a vehicle that is emission tested in order to obtain final admission must satisfy all of the applicable testing requirements of part 86 (40 CFR 85.1502, 85.1505, 85.1507, 85.1509, 85.1513, 85.1516).
