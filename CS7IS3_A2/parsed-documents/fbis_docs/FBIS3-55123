Haekkerup explained that he has that impression knowing the attitude of NATO member states towards the involvement of new states in the organization. A special program proposed by the United States for states which wish to cooperate with NATO will be discussed at a conference of the heads of NATO member states scheduled to take place in Brussels on 10 January. Participation in this program would be a mandatory condition to become a NATO member state. The program provides that countries will be able to conclude bilateral cooperation agreements with NATO. NATO will provide necessary consultations for such countries in cases when their territorial integrity, security or political sovereignty might be threatened. NATO is also ready to cooperate with the Baltic states and Russia within the framework of such a program. Haekkerup drew journalists' attention to the fact that the conclusion of bilateral agreements would allow NATO to cooperate individually with each state taking into account its peculiarities and wishes.
