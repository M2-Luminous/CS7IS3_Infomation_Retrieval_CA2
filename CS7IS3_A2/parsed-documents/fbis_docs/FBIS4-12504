FBIS4-12504 "drnes069dd_94008" FBIS-NES-94-069 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs PLO's al-Najjab on 'Afula, Israeli `Redeployment' PLO's al-Najjab on 'Afula, Israeli `Redeployment' JN1104101994 Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic 11 Apr 94 p 29 JN1104101994 Amman AL-DUSTUR Arabic BFN [By Tawfiq 'Abid] [Excerpts] PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab has said that he supports political settlement, without one- upmanship, despite his reservations about the Oslo accord. He added that Israel is to blame for the impasse in the Cairo talks, adding that he is against all solutions that confiscate the rights of the Palestinian people. [passage omitted] In a meeting with local journalists on 9 April, al-Najjab said the Rabin government wants Palestinian recognition of the status quo and agreement on arrangements that lead to some sort of civilian administration linked to a military governor, and not a self-rule or Palestinian authority that assumes the powers of the Israeli military authority. Al-Najjab added: What is happening now in Gaza and Jericho is not an Israeli withdrawal, as some people like to call it. It is, in reality, a redeployment of Israeli troops by keeping a distance from populated areas while maintaining control over the land. He added: We see trucks carrying office equipment and cabinets leaving this center or that in Gaza to Qatif settlement and in Jericho to 'Aqabat Jabr. "Is the Israeli occupation an administrative one?" He pointed out that besieging the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including 2 million Palestinians, is meant to further isolate Jerusalem, cause real starvation for the entire population, bring them to their knees, and break their resistance. Afterward, the Israelis will ask for a political price for a partial lifting of the siege. [passage omitted] Assessing the 'Afula operation, al-Najjab said: Striking at civilians does not serve the Palestinian cause. The operation has given the Zionists a chance to say that the conflict is a racist one and not against the occupation of our land and holy places. He said the U.S.-Israeli demand that President 'Arafat condemn the operation is simply "hypocrisy." The political wisdom of President 'Arafat should have told him to be the first to condemn the operation so that they will not use the operation to tighten starvation and escalate killing of the Palestinian people. Answering a question, al-Najjab said: The relationship between the PLO and the United States is characterized by "warnings". Whenever there is an impasse in the negotiations with the Israelis, 'Arafat receives another U.S. warning. Al-Najjab said he had attended several meetings between President 'Arafat and the U.S. ambassador in Tunis, which were meant only to deliver a warning from the U.S. Administration to the Palestinian leadership.
