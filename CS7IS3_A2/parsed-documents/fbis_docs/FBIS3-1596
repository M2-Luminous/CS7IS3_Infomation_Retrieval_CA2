"It is a short-time but a fruitful visit", the Chinese foreign minister said, adding his talks here would immensely help further develop the close bilateral ties between China and Bangladesh. Qian Qichen replied to a volley of questions at a crowded press conference here this morning. Replying to a question on "the South Asia nuclear-free zone", Qian Qichen noted that domestic situations in most South Asian countries are now turning to stable. The relations among countries of the region have been improving and regional cooperations have also been developing, he said. However, the foreign minister said, "there are still some destabilizing factors in South Asia. There are still some differences among the countries of the region". "We don't want arms race in the region. Because, any arms race in South Asia will be no of benefit to peace and stability in the region", he said. Qian Qichen noted under the present international situation, the security of a country will mainly depend on the economic development of the country and that is the conception of "economic security". If the developing countries could not achieve their economic development and fail in improving the living standard of their people, "it will be very difficult for them to have security", Qian said. Replying to a question on the improvement of bilateral ties between China and India, Qian said Sino-Indian relations were developing but made it clear that this should by no means affect China's friendly cooperations with other countries of the region. About Bangladesh's share of the water from India, the foreign minister said it was natural that Bangladesh would ask for its rightful share in the waters of the rivers coming through other countries. "We hope that the issue could be resolved through bilateral discussion and negotiation between India and Bangladesh", he added. As regards the Kashmir issue, Qian Qichen stressed that "China's position on the issue remained unchanged". China hopes that India and Pakistan could settle the dispute left over by history through peaceful negotiation taking into account the United Nation's resolutions and the relevant agreements reached between the two countries.
