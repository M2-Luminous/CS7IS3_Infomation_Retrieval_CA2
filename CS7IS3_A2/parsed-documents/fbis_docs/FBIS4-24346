We shall celebrate the 19th national independence anniversary, thus remembering a period of great euphoria and hope experienced by all Mozambicans on 25 June 1975, when they began to open a new chapter in the country's multicentennial history. 25 June 1975 was a particularly solemn and important period during which we assumed the responsibility of leading our fatherland's destiny. The proclamation of independence was the result of the national liberation struggle, waged by the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo], which is also celebrating 32 years of existence today. In order to obtain success in the struggle for national liberation, it was necessary to unite the entire Mozambican people around a common objective -- to gain national independence. It was our unity that made us Mozambicans, with our own identity as a people and as a state in the context of the international community. By strengthening unity we consolidate our Mozambican identity, our national independence, and we consolidate peace, which is an indispensable condition for our country's progress and our fatherland's prosperity. I would therefore like to call on all Mozambican people, regardless of color, sex, race, tribe, party, or religion, to preserve and defend our unity against all attempts aimed at dividing our people. Mozambican women, Mozambican men: This is the second time that we celebrate our national independence anniversary in peace, following the signing of the General Peace Accord in 4 October 1992. Since then all Mozambicans have been living in peace and stability, devoting all their capabilities and energy toward consolidating democracy, national reconstruction, and the well-being of all Mozambicans. Since the establishment of peace, my government has been successfully implementing a number of programs within the framework of national reconstruction and the normalization of our people's life. The undertakings carried out by my government include the reconstruction of schools, hospitals, the opening and repair of bore holes, wells, renovation, maintenance, and opening of roads, bridges, and runways throughout the country. With the establishment of peace, with the return of refugees and war-displaced people, and following their engagement in productive activity during 1993, we achieved an economic growth rate of 19 percent, against a target of about six percent. On behalf of my government and on my own behalf, I would like to salute the Mozambican people, who responded and continue to respond positively to efforts carried out by my government and civilian society to pacify the country and obtain greater democratic openness and the political participation for all citizens. I would like to convey a message of appreciation to the national business community which, believing in the present political, economic, and social moment brought about by peace, contributed greatly to the growth of the national economy. I would also like to salute the international community for the political and financial assistance it rendered. It is my hope that this assistance will continue to be rendered for our country's economic growth and well-being, which the Mozambican people deserve and so much desire. We are now facing new challenges. We have the responsibility of continuing to develop efforts aimed at increasing production in conformity with this year's economic and social plan. Another natural disaster, cyclone "Nadia", hit our country, particularly the northern provinces, leaving thousands of people homeless, destitute, and without food, in addition to the economic damage it caused. My government conveyed a message of sympathy to the affected people and took the necessary measures to assist them. Actions are under way to minimize the effects of the cyclone as well as to guarantee the implementation of the production targets established for this year. I would like to urge the people, economic agents, and the international community to continue to give their contribution in order to realize these objectives. Mozambican women, Mozambican men, compatriots: The voter registration process is an important moment to prepare for and organize the general multiparty election scheduled for 27 and 28 October this year. The voter registration process is aimed at registering and identifying all voting-age Mozambicans to vote for the president of the Republic and for deputies in the National Assembly. Those who do not register cannot vote. The voter registration process is a major task which requires the participation of all Mozambicans. By participating in the election, the citizens are exercising a constitutional right, a right that is also a compulsory civic duty for all Mozambicans of voting age. It is the duty of all citizens to take part in the election and cooperate with the relevant authorities in all actions aimed at facilitating the process. I would, therefore, like to call on registered political parties, which have great responsibility in the whole process, to do all they can for the success of the process and to ensure that the first general multiparty elections are free and fair. It is only in this way that the elected and the unelected can contribute to the success of national reconstruction, consolidation of peace, and the normalization of life for all our people. Mozambican women, Mozambican men, compatriots: It was with joy that the Mozambican people celebrated the electoral victory of the African National Congress and its President Nelson Mandela. Immediately after the announcement of the electoral results, on behalf of the Mozambican people, the government, and on my own behalf, I congratulated the people of this great country for ending "apartheid" and the coming to power of a majority government democratically elected, led by the ANC. It was with great joy that the Republic of Mozambique, the Frontline States, the southern African and OAU countries welcomed the new South Africa as a member of the Frontline States, the OAU, and the United Nations. The Republic of Mozambique has already begun a useful cooperation in different fields, particularly in the fields of manpower and ports and railroads, with the Republic of South, and it is our hope that this cooperation will continue to increase on the basis of greater trust and mutual benefits. Thus, we are anxiously waiting for South Africa to become a member of the Southern African Development Community. The electoral victory of the ANC and President Nelson Mandela is the result of the struggle carried out by the countries of the region and the international community to completely eradicate "apartheid". For us, the end of destabilizatio is the beginning of an era of peace and security in the region, the establishment of cooperative health relations for regional development. It is our sincere hope that the fraternal people of South Africa will have a prosperous future, and we would like to convey our warm greetings to President Nelson Mandela for his election to the leadership of the new and free Republic of South Africa. We would like to salute President Bakili Muluzi and the United Democratic Front of the Republic of Malawi for their victory in the recent free and democratic elections held in that fraternal country. We would also like to salute the Malawian people for their political maturity and desire to change toward real democracy in their country. We hope to begin a new era of bilateral cooperation, given the historic ties and the major economic and social interests linking the Republic of Mozambique and the Republic of Malawi. Compatriots: While on one hand, we salute positive developments in the Republics of South Africa and Malawi. On the other hand there is a cause for consternation in other republics. We refer to the day-to- day life in the fraternal countries of Angola, Rwanda, Somalia, Burundi, and Liberia. Despite the great expectation surrounding peace negotiations in Lusaka between the Angolan Government and UNITA, we continue to be alarmed by the killing of innocent civilians in Angola. My country appreciates the flexibility and the spirit of compromise demonstrated by the Angolan Government at the negotiating table. We would like to urge UNITA and its leader, Dr. Jonas Savimbi, to adopt a positive posture with a view to ending the suffering of the Angolan people. We would like to call for a speedy conclusion of the negotiations with the subsequent signing of the Lusaka accord and the end of war in Angola. Our region desires a complete, true, and lasting peace. What is happening in Rwanda is a true carnage that the world should neither ignore nor tolerate. We would like to appeal to the parties in the conflict to follow the path of dialogue. We would also like to appeal to the international community to give its material and financial assistance and find appropriate mechanisms to end this disaster at the end of the century. Tensions prevail in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East where armed conflicts are rife. We are concerned with the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the UN efforts to maintain peace and render humanitarian assistance to thousands of victims are rendered fruitless. The problem generated around the Korean Peninsula endangers peace and security in that region, while in Yemen there is a generalized armed conflict which has been killing innocent people and causing the destruction of economic and social infrastructures in that country. We favor dialogue and our desire is to see the leaders and the people of Yemen find the best way of resolving their differences. Compatriots: On this occasion when we celebrate the 19th national independence anniversary, I would like to salute the Mozambique Armed Forces for their commitment to and engagement in the defense of our country's sovereignty during all these 19 years. We want to reiterate that even with the establishment of the new national army -- the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM] -- the government will continue to make efforts to find solutions which will guarantee them a honorable form of life and participation in the country's reconstruction. We want them to view their active participation in national reconstruction and the country's economic and social development as a right and the duty of each and everyone of them. With unity and discipline, without hastiness, we shall be able to transform our desire into reality. I would like to address a message of solidarity and respect to war-displaced people and refugees who have finally returned or continue to return home. It is my hope that their lives will normalize rapidly, as we guarantee them assistance in this direction. To all workers, peasants, intellectuals, public servants, and others in different areas of production, I would like to convey my wishes for greater success in their tasks to contribute to the country's development and the well-being of the Mozambican people. To all national and international nongovernmental organizations, foreign aid workers, religious denominations, and the entire civilian society, I would like to convey my appreciation for the effort they are exerting in the search for solutions to the various problems affecting the country and all our people. I would like to urge you to continue with your positive work in support of the economy and the needy. I would like you all to celebrate 25 June in the happiest manner possible, hoping that the future will bring you prosperity and success in your activities. It is also my desire that peace, unity, reconciliation, and national reconstruction will be the principal concern of all Mozambicans at this time when we celebrate the 19th national independence anniversary and when the holding of legislative and presidential elections, on 27 and 28 October 1994, is approaching. Long live 25 June! Long live national independence! Long live the Mozambican people! For peace, unity, justice, and progress; For democracy, reconciliation, and national reconstruction; For a better future; The struggle continues!
