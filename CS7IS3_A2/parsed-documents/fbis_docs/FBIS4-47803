Here he is speaking to Hassan Nze: [Begin Bongo recording] What is significant is Mandela's message, that he wants to rule with all the political parties. It is this collegial power structure which Africa lacks. Each time there is an election and a gesture is made towards the losers, they say: We do not want to do this, we do want to do that. I believe that in this instance Mandela is giving an example. We must also congratulate de Klerk, who immediately acknowledged Mandela's victory and accepted working with him in the same government. Honestly, I wish that all Africans could behave in the same way, that is to say, as though the country belongs to everybody. We must understand that ruling single-handedly, ruling without the opposition....[pauses] We must understand that those who contest elections and expect alternation must join the government, in order to learn how things work, so that the day they become president things are easier for them. I therefore believe that Mandela and de Klerk have just given us -- both governors and opposition leaders -- a lesson. Mandela chose to leave the past behind him and not exclude whites, he did not seek revenge because he was the oldest prisoner, he did not say that he would only govern with his party and friends, he reached out to everyone.
