FR940304-1-00029 FR940304-1-00008 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Part 146 RIN 1515&hyph;AB20 Petroleum Refineries in Foreign Trade Subzones AGENCY: U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document invites public comment on a proposed revision of the notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register on August 10, 1992 (57 FR 35530), which would add special procedures and requirements to the Customs Regulations governing the operations of crude petroleum refineries approved as foreign trade subzones. The proposed rule is necessary to implement a section of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 which amended the Foreign Trade Zone Act to make specific provision for petroleum refinery subzones. Customs has significantly revised the initial notice of proposed rulemaking as a result of the extensive and varied input received from the oil refinery and foreign trade zone communities, as well as from other interested parties, in response to the initial notice. DATES: Comments must be received on or before May 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments (preferably in triplicate) must be submitted to U.S. Customs Service, ATTN: Regulations Branch, Franklin Court, 1301 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20229, and may be inspected at the Regulations Branch, 1099 14th Street, NW., suite 4000, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Legal aspects: Cari Berdut, Entry Rulings Branch, (202&hyph;482&hyph;7040). Operational aspects: Louis Hryniw, Office of Regulatory Audit, (202&hyph;927&hyph;1100). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 10, 1992 (57 FR 35530), Customs published a document in the Federal Register , proposing to amend the Customs Regulations to add special procedures and requirements governing the operations of crude petroleum refineries approved as foreign trade subzones, in implementation of section 9002 of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, which amended the Foreign Trade Zones Act, 19 U.S.C. 81c(d), to make specific provision for petroleum refinery subzones. Briefly, as stated in the August 10, 1992, notice of proposed rulemaking, the amendment obviates the need to determine exactly when and where in the manufacturing process crude and other feedstocks become other products. In so doing, it permits refiners as well as Customs to assess the relative value of such multiple products at the end of the manufacturing period from which such products were produced, when the actual quantities of these products resulting from the refining process can be measured with certainty. Also, the amendment permits the products refined in a subzone during a manufacturing period to be attributed to given crude or other feedstocks introduced into production during the period, to the extent that such products were producible (could have been produced) therefrom in the quantities removed from the subzone. By a document published in the Federal Register on September 14, 1992 (57 FR 41896), Customs extended the public comment period for the proposed rule until December 8, 1992. Subsequently, by a document published in the Federal Register on November 24, 1992 (57 FR 55198), Customs further extended the public comment period until February 8, 1993, and gave notice of a public meeting which was held on December 15 and 16, 1992, concerning the proposed amendments. As a result of the extensive and varied input received from the oil refinery and foreign trade zone communities, as well as from other interested parties, in response to the initial notice of proposed rulemaking and the public meeting, Customs has decided to significantly revise its initial notice, and is requesting additional public comment on the revised proposed rule. The following discussion includes a summary of the various comments received in response to the August 10, 1992, notice of proposed rulemaking, together with an explanation and analysis regarding the sections proposed to be added, eliminated or further revised. The proposed rule as revised is thereafter set forth.
