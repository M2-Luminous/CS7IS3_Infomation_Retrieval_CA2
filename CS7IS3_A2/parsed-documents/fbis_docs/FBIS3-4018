This year, the Guangxi Government will continue to crack down severely on drug smuggling and trafficking in close cooperation with the Hong Kong police. When talking about the illegal entry into Hong Kong by Vietnamese refugees, Lei Yu said: Based on statements of investigations, at the news conference it held in Hong Kong, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees clarified that, of the refugees who had illegally sneaked into Hong Kong, no more than 100 came from Guangxi. At present, the repatriation of the refugees is underway. According to Lei Yu, last year the scope of foreign investment expanded greatly. Hong Kong businessmen Li Shao-kee and Cheng Yu-tong invested in Guangxi and Robert Kwok made large investments in Beihai City's Fangcheng Port. This year, Guangxi will build the infrastructure on a large scale and strive to become the "most convenient thoroughfare" which "with the great southwest behind, serves the great southwest and faces Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan." Guangxi leaders made these remarks at today's "News Conference on Guangxi's Reform, Opening up, and Economic Development." When answering a Hong Kong reporter's question, Lei Yu said: Guangxi shares a 1,025-km land frontier and 1,595-km coastline with its neighboring countries. Making use of this long frontier and coastline, many lawless elements carry out gunrunning and drug trafficking. The Guangxi Government has always adopted severe measures to deal with lawless elements. Last year, the government boosted the police force by 700 personnel to specially cope with gunrunners and drug traffickers and seized more than 10 kg of heroin, some 800 kg of opium, and about 300 guns (mostly smuggled in from outside the borders), and arrested over 300 smugglers (mostly members of gangs comprising several persons). The Guangxi leader went on to say: We have always maintained close coordination with the Hong Kong police. This has been the case in the past and it will remain unchanged in the days to come. When briefing the news conference on Guangxi's economic construction and the bid to improve its investment environment, Cheng Kejie said: In the last two years, we have built or extended five airports. For example, Guilin and Beihai Airports are international and Liuzhou and Wuzhou Airports are expected to be available for operation this year. Moreover, five railway lines, two expressways, and hydropower and thermal power stations with a total generating capacity of 8.2 million kwh are under construction. All these projects will better serve Guangxi's and the great southwest's opening up and economic construction. According to statistics, last year, Guangxi put $1 billion into practical use, had 4,360 foreign-invested enterprises, and earned $1.325 billion in foreign currency by exporting goods, a big increase on the 1992 figure. The scope of foreign investment also expanded remarkably. There was a marked increase in the number of investing countries, regions, and big financial groups and firms. In June this year, Singapore's political celebrity Lee Kuan Yew will hold consultations with Guangxi on developing an industrial park in Beihai. Thailand's foreign exchange dealers are negotiating with Guangxi on 18 projects and applying to set up an office in Nanning. Malaysia and Guangxi will open Beihai to Southeast Asia sea routes. On the issue of Guangxi shaking off poverty, Cheng Kejie said: Ten percent of China's poor households are in Guangxi. This being the case, Guangxi's task in shaking off poverty is very arduous. Apart from implementing the "87 Program [solving the problem of food and clothing for 80 million people in poverty-stricken areas within 7 years]" cited in Li Peng's Government Work Report, in carrying out the work of shaking off poverty, we have worked out a plan to remove 200,000 people from the most poverty-stricken areas within 8 years. We began to implement the program last year and moved 23,000 people to areas where cultivable land and fresh water were available and where there are schools and land available for road building. This year we plan to move 25,000 people. The main difficulty facing the plan is the funds problem. It will take about 6,000 to 7,000 yuan to relocate an especially poor household. The other difficulty is the problem of how to achieve national unity between those who are moved out and those who are moved in. The State Council has clearly stated that it will give great support to Guangxi in terms of finance and credit.
