So says a don of a defense-related organization suggesting a future direction the industry should take. The total sales of the Japanese aircraft manufacturing industry was only about ¥ 200 billion in FY93, negligibly small in contrast to those of the U.S. and European countries. World-class Technology Level This is the aftereffect of the ban on any aircraft production in Japan ordered by the GHQ for a period of seven years following the end of WW-II. During the same period, the world aircraft industry entered the jet age, and a remarkable wave of evolutions occurred in the aircraft technology. In Japan, all the aircraft engineers scattered away in every direction and the transfusion of the tradition was held up temporarily during that period. Nonetheless, since the restitution of aircraft production in 1952, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (``MHI'') has been trying to build up its development and manufacturing capabilities first through the repairs and overhauls of U.S. military airplanes, then gradually through fuselage production subcontracts from U.S. manufacturers, and finally the development of airplanes on orders from the Defense Agency. Not only MHI, but also Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (``IHI'') learned new techniques and technologies through license productions from the U.S. manufacturers and tried to catch up with the rest of the world. Boeing's top management commented recently that, ``They have reached the world-class level more or less. In certain areas, they are even ahead of us,'' referring to the manufacturing engineering technology, which is, after all, Japan's forte. The development of an airplane takes many years and a huge sum of money, particularly if it is a commercial airplane, and it is getting out of hands for private enterprises as the risk and cost of the development of a commercial airplane have become so enormous due to the increase in the size and the sophistication of the performance requirement. As a result, international joint development has become a standard approach world-wide in order to minimize the development risks, and secure and expand the market. In fact, Japanese manufacturers are included in the negotiations for the development projects of large next generation jet liners and supersonic planes. Yutaka Hineno, a managing director and the general manager, the Aircraft and Special Vehicle division, boasts that his company is ``the world's number one when it comes to the fuselage production which includes aerodynamics and compound material technology.'' However, for the company which wants to be No. 1 in everything, the achilles heel of their aircraft production business is the engine. A high ranking person of the Defense Agency said, ``Pratt & Whitney, General Electric and Rolls Royce are the `Yokozuna (grand champions of Sumo wrestling),' and Snecma [phonetic] of France is an 'Ozeki (second ranking in the senior grade).' IHI, the Yokozuna of Japan, is probably considered a 'Maegashira (fifth ranking in the senior grade)' in the world ring. That means that MHI should probably be considered a Jyo-nidan (the second from the bottom of the junior grade).'' The basic principle of the jet engine hasn't changed for the last 50 to 60 years. In other words, there hasn't been any technological breakthrough, but rather, it has been a slow process of evolution accumulating improvements bit by bit; therefore, the experience is what really counts in this area. ``It is an area where it is extremely difficult to catch up and surpass the forerunner overnight,'' according to the same person in the Defense Agency. Hineno, upon hearing this allusive analysis, grinned and said, ``it is a bit too harsh for anyone to call us a Jyo-nidan, but we hope to join the senior grade and be able to compete with IHI, though san-yaku (yokozuna, ozeki and sekiwake) are out of reach for the time being.'' MHI chose the fuselage when reentering the aircraft business after WW-II, as they figured it was too much to pursue both the engine and the fuselage. Under the government's administrative guidance, it was IHI's destiny to find a way to become a manufacturer dedicated to the engine since then. Expectation on YSX As to the future direction, Hinone stressed that, ``It has been agreed that our share will be increased from 5% to 10% in a large engine joint development project with P&W; in addition, we are hoping to be involved in the subassembly developments through an enhancement of our alliance with them. Also, since we believe that we are a part of the world-class san-yaku when it comes to small engine technologies, we will seek a leading role in the specific field based on our unique and superior technologies,'' suggesting that they will be after a two-tier policy of developing small engines as well as large engines. However, the scale of their commercial aircraft business is only a little over ¥40 billion, or slightly less than 10% of the Aircraft and Special Vehicle division. In addition, the sharp yen appreciation in the recent months has caused them a substantial foreign exchange loss, so that a spokesman admits that the business is ``not necessary in red, but it is quite tough to make any money.'' Nonetheless, a substantial market growth is expected for them so that its importance is undeniable while the defense business is shrinking. It is quite interesting to see what happens in the small jetliner ``YSX'' (seating 75 passengers) development project in which Japan is assuming the leadership asking overseas manufacturers to participate in the project, as MHI is expected to assume the leader company's role in the project.
