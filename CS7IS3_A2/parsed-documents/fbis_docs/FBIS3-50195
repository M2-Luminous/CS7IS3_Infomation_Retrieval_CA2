Speaking in a Czech Television's discussion program, Arena, Zieleniec said that the Czech Republic's entrance into NATO would depend on the development of the security situation in Europe. "If the developments are calm, peaceful, and heading for democracy in all Eastern and Central European states, ... the Czech Republic's admission into NATO may be protracted, but this will pose no risk to our security," Zieleniec said. He added that he did not think the country would now be facing any urgent threat. Zieleniec said it was in the Czech Republic's interest that the neighbor countries belong to the same political-military bloc. "No one wants its own border to be the border of confrontation," he said. He dismissed as false all press considerations about the Czech Republic's wish to join NATO before its neighbors. But Zieleniec said that the North Atlantic Alliance, which jointly guarantees a bigger entity, had to be effective. The immediate opening of NATO deep eastwards and embracing states where democracy "is not yet fully convincing" would be risky.
