He only met with foreign VIP's who visited China. However, he has now expanded his activities. He has hosted important domestic meetings and has even energetically made a keynote speech. Owing to this, some leaders, who were calling for Li's resignation at the National People's Congress [NPC] slated for next March, were placed in suspended animation. It has become certain that the Jiang Zemin-Li Peng structure, which was formed with an eye toward the post-Deng Xiaoping era, will continue to remain in power. Premier Li took a low profile because of heart trouble in late April. He did not appear at official events until Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir visited China in mid-June. After that, he started to attend meetings with foreign VIPs visiting China. Nevertheless, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, "acting on behalf of Premier Li Peng," hosted important meetings of the State Council (government). During this time, many things happened; Li Guixian, president of the People's Bank of China who was close to Premier Li, was forced to step down form his post. This was in contrast to Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji's rise. Premier Li Peng's retreat seemed apparent. However, Premier Li Peng started to recover lost ground as he regained his health around October. In particular, he made a long speech on "next year's main tasks" at a national economic policy meeting, which was held in early December following the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee. He impressed local representatives at the meeting that he was a top government leader by presiding over the most important final day of the meeting. Premier Li Peng, who was reelected at the NPC in March this year, will remain in his post another five years. Some people thought, when Premier Li Peng was not attending official events this summer, that he would step down form his post and be replaced by Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji during the next NPC scheduled for March next year. Lately, however, people no longer have such a view and members of the leadership have agreed that replacing the premier will not be on the agenda of the next NPC. Although it is certain the premier's powers will be restored, there is no doubt that Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji will continue to have overall control of economic policy matters. It seems that relations with the United States, which is the pillar of Chinese diplomacy, are under the control of President Jiang Zemin. Therefore, there is no prospect of Premier Li Peng displaying his leadership authority.
