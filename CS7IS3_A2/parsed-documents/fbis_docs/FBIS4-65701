Ahead of a meeting with Alitalia senior executives scheduled for Thursday [19 May], Fiori cautioned, "The government does not intend to throw more money into the well of public companies." "If the plan is credible and is aimed at revival and the recovery of quality and rests not only on job cuts, recapitalization -- with interventions which can be diverse and provide also for a bond issue -- will be no problem and it will be possible to bring in private investors as well," added the minister. Speaking at the end of a meeting with union representatives, Fiori said the policy of the new government will be to "reduce state financial interventions to a minimum. If there is a public company in crisis, it is more correct to go to the market, with a bond issue guaranteed by the state, for example, if the European Commission allows it." The minister said he was confident of an EU [European Union] go-ahead "if the plan is credible and the unions allow it. In parallel, this will make Alitalia shares more tasty and there can be thinking on the entry of private capital in the company," he added with reference to the airline controlled by the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] public holding company. Fiori's comments came one day after unidentified ministry sources talked of a bond issue and opening Alitalia's doors to private investors to generate the 1.5 trillion lire (932 million dollars) needed to carry out the recovery plan. On ways and means to cut up to 4,000 jobs, for the purpose of reducing operating costs by 12 percent, Fiori today said the early retirement scheme could be extended beyond the 800 flight personnel but that the government will attempt to assure that "no pockets of unemployment" are created. "A system of social shock absorbers will have to be found and problems of management and fares will have to be looked at," he added. After saying that for any privatization plan, he "favors a golden share maintained by the state," the minister voiced his confidence in the airline's management. "I have no doubts about their capabilities; I just have the duty to verify." Fiori said he will meet the union side again after he has given the restructurization plan further study. Last week, Alitalia reported first-quarter losses of 190 billion lire, compared to loss for all of 1993 of 345.6 billion lire (215 million dollars) and 16.8 billion in the red for 1992. Total losses as of the end of the first quarter this year accounted for more than one-third of Alitalia capital. Aside from job cuts, according to the Alitalia board, the main points of the new restructurization plan are aimed at improving service, overhauling the entire network of regional connections and schedules, looking north and turning the Milan airport into a major hub for European flights, management reshuffles at the group's subsidiaries, cost cuts and new rules for flight crews. The board attributed the poor results of 1993 to a four-year-long global slump in the airline industry and to fare wars for intercontinental routes. Operating losses amounted to 80 billion lire (50.3 million dollars) last year compared to profits of 155 billion lire in 1992. Union representatives, speaking for the CGIL's [Italian General Confederation of Labor] FILT [Italian Federation of Transportation Workers], FIT [Italian Transportation Federation] of the CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and the UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] transport union, were generally non-committal at the end of their talk with the minister but said Fiori promised to roll back United Airlines' management of their own ground services at Rome's International Leonardo Da Vinci Airport. "Fiori took on the commitment to examine a legislative way which takes account of job guarantees," said Sandro Degni of the UIL with reference to union worries about job losses which could result if the recent agreement between United Airlines and the Aeroporti di Roma, which runs the Rome airports, is expanded to bring in other carriers. Paolo Brutti of the FILT said the government's opinion of the Alitalia restructurization plan is "fundamental. Ownership has to bet on the future of the company, otherwise, it will be difficult for the workers to do so. Then if fresh capital arrives from sell- offs and bond issues, this does not interest us." The FIT's Salvatore Frisella said recapitalization is a "duty within the civil code, if for no other reason." On trimming jobs, this union official said his side would be willing to discuss non- productive areas but "is not in agreement with cuts deriving from the curtailment of services." Silvano Barberini of the FIT, said that according to rumors ahead of the resignation tomorrow of the Aeroporti di Roma board, the new managing director could come from Texas Instruments, the company whose European operations were led by Schisano, and that Schisano may take over the chair. Named as a likely deputy chairman is Renato Cassaro, the present managing director of Fintecna, the IRI company which holds 40 percent of Aeroporti. The union official said these changes at the top, in line with the recent shake-up in the senior management of Alitalia, show that Aeroporti di Roma will not be put up for sale "but revived. And on this, the unions can only be in agreement."
