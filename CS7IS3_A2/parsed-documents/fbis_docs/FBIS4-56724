Mr. Sammy, we already have the partial results of these presidential elections; what do you think about them? What is your first impression? [Lewis] I believe there is a seemingly clear trend favoring Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic Revolutionary Party; however, as far as I know, the Electoral Tribunal [TE] has not yet released any official figures. Let us wait for some tangible information to ensure that we can conduct a final evaluation of the election results. It seems that the trend is indeed favoring Ernesto Perez Balladares. [Reporter] The TE magistrates have reported that the process seems to have evolved smoothly. Has any candidate of your party or of the MUN complained? Have you heard anyone complaining? [Lewis] We do not have any significant complaints, because the electoral process evolved normally. This situation must make all Panamanians proud, because we are displaying a great sense of civic responsibility. We have wisely exercised the right that democracy bestows upon us. This is indeed strengthening the incipient democracy we Panamanians have. [Reporter] Are you going to promote consensus with all political parties regardless of who is elected president? [Lewis] I will extend my warmest congratulations to the candidate elected through popular vote, because all Panamanians must join the winner and support him to ensure that we reach a consensus that could not have materialized before the elections. I trust that whoever the winner is, he will honor his commitments, because all the candidates talked about national consensus. I repeat, we hope the winner will honor his commitments to the Panamanian people. [Reporter] Thank you very much. This was Solidarity Party presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo from his party headquarters. He has been following the elections through Telemetro Television Network.
