FR940707-2-00186 FR940707-2-00099 During the first year of the eighteen-month pilot period, a qualified market maker is defined as a market maker that has maintained quotations in the subject security continuously for the preceding 20 business days. 15 During the last six months of the eighteen-month pilot period, a qualified market maker is defined as a market maker satisfying the criteria for a primary Nasdaq market maker. To qualify as a primary Nasdaq market maker, market makers must satisfy at least two of the following three standards: (1) The market maker must be at the best bid or best offer as shown in the Nasdaq system no less than 35 percent of the time; (2) the market maker must maintain a spread no greater than 102 percent of the average dealer spread; or (3) no more than 50 percent of the market maker's quotation updates may occur without being accompanied by a trade execution of at least one unit of trading. 16 Alternatively, recognizing that overall volume is also indicative of quality market making, the NASD has proposed a supplemental criterion for becoming a primary market maker. Under the supplemental criterion, a market maker must satisfy one of the three criteria set forth above and account for 11/2 times its proportionate share 17 of volume in the stock. 18 15 During the first year of the effectiveness of the rule, the separate criteria for becoming a qualified market maker for securities subject to a secondary offering, an initial public offering, or a merger or acquisition are: (i) For secondary offerings, the offering has become effective and the market maker has been registered in and maintained quotations without interruption in the subject security for 40 calendar days (between January 1, 1994 and May 31, 1994, the average time between filing and effective dates for secondary offerings reviewed by the NASD's Corporate Financing department was 34 business (48 calendar) days); (ii) For initial public offerings, the market maker may register in the offering and immediately become a qualified market maker; and (iii) After a merger or acquisition has been publicly announced, a qualified market maker in one of the two affected securities may immediately register as a qualified market maker in the other merger or acquisition security. 16 During the last six months of the eighteen-month exemption period, the separate criteria for becoming a qualified market maker for securities subject to a secondary offering, an initial public offering, or a merger or acquisition are: (a) For secondary offerings: (i) the secondary offering has become effective and the market maker has satisfied the qualification criteria in the time period between registering in the security and the offering becoming effective; or (ii) the market maker has satisfied the qualification criteria for 40 calendar days. (b) For initial public offerings: (i) the market maker may register in the offering and immediately become a primary Nasdaq market maker if it is a primary Nasdaq market maker in 80% of the securities in which it has registered; provided however, that if, at the end of the first review period, the primary Nasdaq market maker has withdrawn on an unexcused basis from the security or has not satisfied the qualification criteria, it shall not be afforded a primary Nasdaq market maker designation on any subsequent initial public offerings for the next 10 business days; or (ii) the market maker registers in the stock as a regular Nasdaq market maker and satisfies the qualification criteria for the next review period. (c) After a merger or acquisition has been publicly announced, a primary Nasdaq market maker in one of the two affected securities may immediately register as a primary Nasdaq market maker in the other merger or acquisition security. 17 The rule provides that the NASD may change from time to time the proportionate volume necessary for a market maker to satisfy this test. If the NASD elects to change this criterion, the Act requires it to file a proposed rule change with the Commission. 18 For example, if there are 10 market makers in a stock, each has a proportionate share of 10 percent. Thus, a market maker seeking to qualify as a primary market maker under the alternative criteria must, in addition to satisfying one of the three criteria under the standard approach, account for at least 15 percent of the overall volume. For example, if a market maker maintains its bid or offer at the inside quote at least 35 percent of the time, but maintains a 1 point spread in the stock when the other dealers averaged a 3/4 point spread and changed its quote three times on average for every trade, then the market maker would have to meet the proportionate volume test to qualify as a primary market maker.
