I have heard few senior politicians complain that they have been excluded from this inner council. This electoral contest is a thankless challenge, fraught with risk. The European election for British members of the Strasbourg Parliament will be fought on three broad issues. First, there will be a powerful media element determined to convert the occasion into a personal trial of strength for John Major. His qualities will not become a doorstep issue, but bad results will be used by his media opponents to persuade those at Westminster whose loyalty is brittle that a change of leader is essential. The pundits will argue that heavy Tory losses provide the last available pretext for change ahead of the autumn double of a party conference and a new parliamentary session. In my view, a change is highly improbable, but Mr Hurd dare not discount it. Secondly, the Opposition will try to turn the European contest into a nationwide by-election. That is what European elections have been in the past. In current circumstances, this could be devastating for the Government. At the last European elections, Labour led the Conservatives by 40 percent to 35 percent. The current poll rating gives comparable figures of around 50 per cent and 25-30 percent, indicating a swing to Labour of nearly 10 percent. Furthermore, the Liberal Democrats are now poised to do significantly better than in their freakishly bad showing four years ago, when they were eclipsed by the momentary splendour of the Greens. The Opposition is determined to convert the forthcoming Strasbourg elections into a national by-election for three reasons. Such a strategy would concentrate the debate on domestic economic and welfare issues, which give the Tories such a miserable poll rating. Second it would demonstrate the ability of the Liberal Democrats to gather tactical Labour votes and to storm hitherto safe Conservative seats. Furthermore, it would excuse the Opposition from having to argue their own ill-formulated European policy. Douglas Hurd needs no guidance on the implications of this. Finally there is the option of emphasising the European character of the election, and, as far as possible, wrenching it from the national mould. This seems to be the obvious Tory tactic. Even so, I suspect that some of Mr Hurd's associates would argue for a low-key European campaign, since this would minimise the risk of exposing Tory divisions. This "hold your nose and think of Europe" approach should be disregarded. It will take a monumental effort to introduce European Union issues into the June election, but domestic Tory interests, and wider considerations, require a high-profile campaign. This means, in the first instance, that the European election should be only incidentally about the Strasbourg Parliament. Its activities, powers and procedures are unfamiliar. The Tory link with the declining European People's Party, agreed by Margaret Thatcher, is best left to history. There are wider European issues to put to the British public, and they cover not only British government policies agreed through the Council of Ministers, but also our prospective attitudes to the Maastricht renegotiation scheduled for 1996. The June election will be an excellent opportunity for the Government to look ahead and share its vision. A broader European campaign could proceed under the terms set out by John Major in The Economist last September. He then emphasised the need to look afresh at how the European Union is developing: "...it is time to look afresh at the Community and consider the way ahead. Time to put away the old slogans, dreams and prejudice." At the centre of the changing Union is its enlargement -- almost certain -- from 12 to 16 members and probably upwards of 20 thereafter. Enlargement may imply tighter monetary controls and Commission power, as Jacques Delors would argue, or it may result in a looser form of Union foreseen by the terms negotiated for Britain at Maastricht, with "opt-outs" in respect of the social chapter and monetary union. There is also public interest in how subsidiarity can be used to reduce the burden of the common agricultural policy. People want to know how the burgeoning bureaucracy of the Union can be reduced, and how Britain's freedom from the social chapter can be maintained. There is the opportunity for the Government to gamble on a high-profile European election, which involves setting out its post-Maastricht negotiating stall. Of course it involves the risk of an open argument about opinions honestly held, but then what are elections about? With a dismal poll rating, the Tories can afford the risk of offering the politics of choice and not those of passing domestic discontent.
