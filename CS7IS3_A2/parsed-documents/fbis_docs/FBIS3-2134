What bill the British Hong Kong Government adopts now is their own business. He stressed that the three-tier councils set up by the British Hong Kong authorities unilaterally would totally cease to exist on 30 June 1997. By that time, the Chinese Government will reorganize the three-tier councils in Hong Kong together with Hong Kong citizens in accordance with the Basic Law and its relevant provisions. While attending a Spring Festival reception hosted by XINHUA's Kowloon office, Zhang Junsheng expressed the above views when asked by a reporter about the Legislative Council debate on Patten's partial political reform bill. Talking about the British side claiming to publicize the contents of the Sino-British talks, Zhang Junsheng reiterated that the Chinese side would certainly make an appropriate response if the British side unilaterally did so. When a reporter asked him about the issue of continued service by civil servants at the directorate level after 1997, Zhang Junsheng said: The Basic Law has made definite stipulations on this issue. Except for secretaries and other senior officials who should be nominated by the chief executive of the special administrative region [SAR] and report to the central government for appointment, all other public servants may remain in employment. Zhang Junsheng said: The 180,000 Hong Kong civil servants have served the Hong Kong people for a long time and have performed substantial work. They have also rendered considerable deeds toward the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong today. Zhang Junsheng hoped that they would remain in service and continue to serve the SAR government and the Hong Kong people sincerely after the establishment of the SAR government. As the government at that time will be the Chinese people's own government, they should serve it even more enthusiastically.
