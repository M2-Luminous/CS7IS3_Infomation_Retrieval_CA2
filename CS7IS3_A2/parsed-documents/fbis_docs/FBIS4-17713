According to the statistical data, at present 261.5 thousand Poles live in Lithuania. "Despite a great number of obstacles you have not lost your nationality", Walesa said. "You still belong to a large Polish family. You never reached outside the border, the border stretched over you. You are not here guests or newcomers or emigrants". Walesa emphasized that Poles in Lithuania are citizens of Lithuania. "Lithuania is your country. The prosperity of Lithuania is your prosperity. You must be good citizens. You must care about your homeland and participate in the changes. You must show that you can usefully and creatively work for Lithuania in building the common home for both Lithuanians and Poles". Poles who live in Lithuania should be loyal for the state and respect its institutions. The state in its turn should guarantee the ability to foster national identity, culture, education and language.
