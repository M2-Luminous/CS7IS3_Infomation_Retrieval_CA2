G."-initialled report: "Ability of European Union to Achieve Compromise Praised"] [Text] Bonn, 30 Mar -- The Federal Government has expressed satisfaction about the fact that, following the compromise with Great Britain, the expansion of the European Union [EU] by Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway will become possible at the beginning of 1995, if the ratification procedures are concluded in time in the individual countries. Chancellor Kohl, who is on vacation in Austria, expressed relief. Foreign Minister Kinkel stressed that the only thing that is required now is the approval by the European Parliament. He hopes that the referendums in the would-be member countries will be positive. The accession of the four countries will enrich the European Union politically, economically, and culturally. Great Britain and Spain have committed themselves to the European Union at a "moment that is important for the European Union's survival." The European Union has proved its ability to achieve compromises and to make decisions. The larger the European Union becomes, the more difficult the procedure gets at voting. Nevertheless, Germany feels that it is the advocate of the states in Central and East Europe. Regarding the applications for membership by Poland and Hungary, Kinkel said: "These countries need to see light at the end of the tunnel." However, their inclusion will "proceed slowly." One has to "bring" the states of Central and East Europe "close" to the European Union "carefully." In contrast to the government, Mr. Lamers, foreign policy spokesman of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union Bundestag group, expressed disappointment at the result of the negotiations on the blocking minority for decisions in the extended Council of Ministers. The British behavior demonstrates "a basic attitude toward European unification, which is incompatible with the goals of at least the European Union's founding members and lets bad things be expected also for practical decisionmaking in Brussels." It is not okay that London "on the one hand, rightly demanded the strengthening of the European Union's ability to act and, on the other, did precisely the opposite -- namely made the procedure more difficult." This cannot go on. Predictability and credibility of the British European policy must be doubted. The events show the difficulties that will have to be faced at the negotiations of the EU government conference in 1996 about a comprehensive institutional reform. The states, which want to proceed further in political cooperation, must not be hindered from doing so. In order to prepare for the German EU Presidency, which begins on 1 July, Mrs. Wieczorek-Zeul, deputy chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, advocated giving priority to combating unemployment and to the "implementation of a social Europe." The Federal Government must give up its "blocking attitude" toward the proposals of the EC Commission presented in its white book "Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment." As quickly as possible "Europol" is to be developed into an effectively functioning European police force, which can be used to combat border-crossing organized crime. Mrs. Wieczorek-Zeul said: "We want to put particular emphasis on combating right-wing extremist violent criminals and their border-crossing terrorist activities in European cooperation." The European Union must implement a foreign policy based on partnership: "Above all, the point is help for reconstruction in the destroyed former Yugoslavia." The Federal Government should work for common EU advances in implementing a "stability pact" with the countries in Central and East Europe. Bilateral neighborhood treaties are to be concluded between the countries involved, which guarantee protection for the respective minorities and affirm the recognition of the borders. The results should be included in the CSCE. The states in East and Central Europe should be able to participate in discussion about the common foreign and security policy: "They must be given an all-European prospect." During the German presidency, the public discussion of the EU reform planned for 1996 should begin.
