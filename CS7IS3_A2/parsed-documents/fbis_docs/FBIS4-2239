Under the accord, the maturities of the short-term funds range from two weeks to nine months. The interest rate will be fixed at the time of issue and the Bank of Tokyo will act as the issuing agent for China in the deal. Hong Yun-cheng, president of CITIC Industrial Bank, said that this short-term measure may help cut money-raising costs and diversify China's access to the world's capital markets. Hiroyuki Nakao, senior managing officer of the Bank of Tokyo, said: "China's creditability runs high in Japan. Banks and other financial institutions are ready to go with the cp [commerican papere] program." This is the first time that China has moved to issuing commercial paper in an overseas capital market.
