By now the region has a total afforested area of some 23,450 ha [hectares], including more than 201 ha of nurseries of young trees and over 2.4 million economic trees. Currently, the annual afforestation area in the region has jumped to more than 50,000 ha from 20,000 ha in the past years, according to official statistics. Since Tibet began its drive for economic development in the areas along the Yarlung Zangbo River, the biggest river in this region, local governments have concentrated some manpower as well as funds on the afforestation drive. After years of hard work, a 20-km-long forest belt of some 670 ha has been formed along the southern bank of the river. Official sources said that Tibet is one of the few regions of the country which have protected the environment well and Tibet's good ecology is still in good condition.
