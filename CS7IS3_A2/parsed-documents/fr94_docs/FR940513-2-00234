Signed by: Mr. Mark Vogelzang, President and CEO. Funds Requested: $194,970. Total Project Cost: $389,940. To replace obsolete studio equipment and improve the program production capabilities of Vermont Public Radio, which operates three stations in that state_in Windsor, Colchester, and Rutland. Vermont Public Radio is moving its headquarters_which will include its main production facility_from Windsor to Colchester. This project is part of that relocation. The project would purchase full master control room, production control room, news production room, and talk studio equipment. It would also purchase subcarrier units to permit Vermont Public Radio to use Vermont ETV's existing microwave system; this would provide a technically superior transmission of Vermont Public Radio's signal from its main studio to its two repeater stations. File No. 94044 CTBN Vermont ETV, Inc., 88 Ethan Allen Avenue, Colchester, VT 05446&hyph;3129. Signed by: Mr. John E. King, VP/Finance & Administration. Funds Requested: $1,042,500. Total Project Cost: $1,390,000. To improve the switching and interconnection facilities of Vermont ETV, Inc. (``VETV''), which operates four stations and offers the sole public TV signal to most of the State's residents. For VETV's control center in Colchester, the project would purchase machine control and signal switching systems as well as a control room automation package. This would increase the center's signal routing capacity and greatly improve the integration of its signal and control systems. The proposed microwave would provide a full duplex, digital system connecting the Colchester studio to VETV's four transmission sites. It would be able to transmit three TV, 12 audio, and many data circuits. This would enable VETV to distribute diverse distant learning services via cable television, wireless cable, and ITFS and to offer data interconnection to varied noncommerical entities.
