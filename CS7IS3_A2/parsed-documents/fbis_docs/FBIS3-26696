The responsible person said: Since the seventies, when China began to develop its nuclear power industry, it has followed a principle of "safety first and quality first." In 1984, the NNSA was formed. As a result, the construction and development of the nuclear power industry began to have a legal basis. The state has promulgated three administrative regulations -- the "Regulations Governing the Safety Supervision and Control of Civilian Nuclear Facilities," the "Regulations Governing the Control of Nuclear Materials," and the "Regulations Governing the Emergency Control of Nuclear Accidents in Nuclear Power Plants" -- 12 departmental rules and regulations, including nuclear safety provisions and implementation rules, as well as 59 nuclear safety guiding principles. Some nuclear safety laws and regulations and technical documents are now being formulated. In accordance with the nuclear safety standards established by the International Atomic Energy Agency, these regulations, rules, and guiding principles stipulate in detail the safety standards and quality-guarantee requirements for the construction and operation of civilian nuclear facilities. The responsible person continued: China has adopted a safety licensing system for civilian nuclear facilities. As far as nuclear safety controls are concerned, we have followed the principle that "the law should be enacted first so that there is something to be observed, and that once implemented, the law should be enforced to the letter." To promote scientific standards in its work, the NNSA has established a nuclear safety committee consisting of 32 noted experts from various technical fields. The committee provides consultation services concerning the safety examination and evaluation, supervision, and control of civilian nuclear facilities. In addition, a nuclear safety center was established in Beijing to undertake the task of providing technical information for nuclear safety controls. The center is engaged in the technical evaluation, testing, monitoring, and data analysis of nuclear safety. A total of three supervisory stations have been set up in Shanghai, Guangdong, and Chengdu, with each being responsible for the supervision of nuclear safety in east China, south China, and the western region, respectively. In terms of providing technical means to guarantee nuclear safety, China has already established a training center equipped with a simulated nuclear power plant and has developed a batch of advanced software for analyzing and evaluating nuclear safety, with some of these having been used in the safety appraisals of nuclear power plants. Meanwhile, a system for responding to and evaluating nuclear accidents has also been established.
