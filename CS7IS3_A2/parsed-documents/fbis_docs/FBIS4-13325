From the Myrha Street Mosque in Paris, he describes the battle plans of "those on the inside" and the FIS' government program. In the heart of the 18th district, a very Arab and African-looking Parisian area, the Myrha Street Mosque, a warehouse undergoing renovations, is the latest retreat of Shaykh (master) Abd el-Baki Saharawi. A founder of the FIS, this 84-year old preaches every Friday in front of thousands of faithful. Since the imprisonment of the FIS' principal leaders Abbasi Madani and Ali Belhadj in Algeria in 1990, no one has been really qualified to speak on behalf of the FIS. As fundamentalist guerrillas control at least four Algerian regions (Blida, Bouira, Chlef, Medea), they have their own legitimacy. Outside Algeria, however, Saharawi is one of the few who have been maintaining ties with "those on the inside." "I have been in contact with the mujahidins (freedom fighters)," he simply admits. Whenever he speaks about Chebouti, a member of the Armed Islamic Movement (MIA) and main guerrilla leader, Shaykh Saharawi call him "general Chebouti." "We have had thousands of generals whose titles were illegitimate. Why should we not have our own military ranking system?" In Paris, people no longer understand the true nature of Algeria's ruling group, which is split between the "eradicationist" wing, which favors all-out repression, and the moderate wing, which advocates dialogue. Shaykh Saharawi is unimpressed by such fine distinctions: "Algeria's rulers went one step toward democracy by holding elections. We won, but they clung to power. It was this caricature of democracy that triggered the crisis: The ruling class had become illegitimate." Dialogue? What dialogue? Shaykh Saharawi smiles self-righteously: "The Army must return to its barracks; it has nothing to do with civilian life. The ruling group tells us: `Leave oil, foreign affairs, and the armed forces to us.' But such bartering is over, now, it is a thing of the past..." He dismisses as irrelevant the three-year transitional period the army has been attempting to negotiate with fundamentalist leaders: "We give them three months, and that is it." Why should they wait any longer? Fundamentalists are convinced that they will be in power much sooner, possibly within a month: "Mujahidins have already begun to converge in the Algiers area. The rulers will fall like ripened fruit." His face suddenly hardening, Shaykh Saharawi pulls out pictures of fundamentalists who have been viciously tortured: faces butchered with chain saws, limbs cut off. Algeria's civil war is now a palpable presence in the quiet mosque. "We will not let them have their way," he says curtly, adding: "You did not understand me; all we ask the Army is to desist. Soldiers have one single purpose: to defend the country..." We insist. Is shared power an option? Could there be a coalition grouping the Arab-Muslim bloc of the FLN [National Liberation Front] and some members of the FFS (Socialist Forces Front) led by Kabylia-born Hocine Ait Ahmed? "Why not?" says Shaykh Saharawi. "But should the people give us an absolute majority, then we shall not share power. When the Right wins in France, it governs alone, and Socialism is swept away." The French system is often mentioned by Shaykh Saharawi, who was a sergeant in the 7th Regiment of Algerian infantrymen during World War II, before becoming union representative in the factory for FO [Workers' Force]. However, Western logic has had no bearing on his political views: "For us, democracy is only a means to an end, it is most definitely not a value." France has disappointed him, its options are no longer credible. "It took you four centuries to come up with democracy, and not a single voice was heard condemning the interruption in the electoral process." Not that fundamentalists want to extend their jihad to French suburbs. "We do not intend to open a second front in France. Before 1962, things were different, we were fighting our colonizer. Today's events only affect Algerians." Shaykh Saharawi's political platform is fairly specific: "For us, most issues are already discussed and settled in the Koran. That which God has decreed remains immutable." Sixty km south of Algiers, in the fundamentalist-controlled Blida region, no woman goes about unveiled. God's will? "Of course, wearing the veil is a Koranic recommendation. Woman is unique for man, she must be honored and respected. The prophet wrote this in his Hadith (teachings)." Shaykh Saharawi was especially appalled by recent television programs which allegedly advised women to have sexual intercourse before marrying. "This is pure depravation," says the cleric, adding that "all this cannot be done overnight; there are no plans to impose Islamic law with militiamen and pasdarans, as was the case in Iran. We must re-islamize society little by little." All parties will be accepted in this Islamic society, provided they are not anti-Islamic. This is the sudden admission that spreads doubt in the mind of the Western listener. For instance, there is not much of a future for Said Saadi's Kabyle party, the RCD (Rally for Culture and Democracy), which has been given the most exposure by the French press because it provides them with a secular (and deceiving) picture of Algeria's society: "Obviously, the RCD will be banned, as it does not represent anyone but itself." Shaykh Saharawi has no mercy for Algerian intellectuals, who are a daily target of terrorists, either: "These are bureaucrats tooting their own horn; they condemn recent killings, but they did not say a word against the military dictatorship which oppressed the people for 30 years." Why does this tactful old man, who does not lack a sense of humor, advocate a society that runs totally counter to our beliefs? How can we understand one another? After all, he unequivocally condemned the murders of foreigners, including French nationals. But faced with such questions, Shaykh Saharawi quickly puts an end to the discussion. "I am a Muslim; you in Europe are atheists, laymen, it is only normal that we should not understand one another; we must learn to respect one another." The whole fundamentalist platform is to be found in a 16-page document written by FIS founders at their organization's inception in 1989. Agriculture will be strongly promoted. "Algeria used to be the granary of the Mediterranean; feeding the people is a priority." Taxes will be replaced by zekat (charity), which is more productive. The economy will be liberal, except from a number of sectors which will remain state-owned (oil, mining). Corruption will be hunted down ruthlessly. Shaykh Saharawi insists: "Ruthlessly." Will they go as far as cutting off a thief's hand, as provided for by the Koran? "When everyone has enough to eat, and no earlier than that, we may consider such a punishment." What about the burden of Algeria's foreign debt? "When we are in power, we shall see what we can afford to pay..." No question of paying for the servicing of the debt, at any rate: "We paid already at least four times what was owed; the notion of interest is contrary to Islam's precepts." Economics is visibly not Shaykh Saharawi's primary concern. The true program of this simple and pious man is contained in the following Koranic line, which he willingly translates: "God is everlasting, ever-living, and he rules the world."
