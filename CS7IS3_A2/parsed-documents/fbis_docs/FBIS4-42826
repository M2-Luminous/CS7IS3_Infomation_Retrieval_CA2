Subordinating NATO to the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), as Russia has in mind, "would run counter to our security interests and is not acceptable," Kinkel said today at the NATO foreign ministers' spring conference in Istanbul. NATO remained the anchor for security and stability in Europe, the advance release of Kinkel's speech said. It is important for Russia to take an active part in the Partnership for Peace. Over and above that, relations should be deepened, Kinkel stressed, calling for the meeting to give a signal to that effect to Moscow. However, this "by no means meant a directorate of NATO and Russia for European security questions." Nor can Russia "receive any kind of right of veto over alliance decisions."
