The talks came amid growing pressure on Tudjman as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright warned Croatia that it might face possible international sanctions if it did not stop meddling in the Bosnian conflict. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic denied assertions by EC mediator Lord Owen due to be broadcast on British television later Wednesday that regular Croatian troops were stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but he acknowledged the presence of "volunteers" there. The talks here were expected to focus on a cease-fire between Croat and the mainly Moslem government forces in central Bosnia, internal borders, and access to the sea for the Bosnian Government side. Granic said after Wednesday's meeting with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and international mediators Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg that a "small but real step forward" had been made. A definitive ceasefire between Bosnian Army forces and Croatian HVO [Croatian Defense Council] militia would be discussed in Bonn, Granic said, adding: "It is important for us that the Moslem side stop its offensive in central Bosnia." Silajdzic said he was "encouraged" by a Croatian pledge supporting Bosnian proposals to allow residents of Mostar, the capital of Herzegovina where Croats are besieging the Moslem eastern half of the city, to return home. In a joint statement the delegations said that prior to the Bonn summit the two sides would make "a major effort to prepare a plan for a cease-fire on all front lines, to halt all military operations, and to create conditions for a lasting halt to hostilities, the protection of populations and strengthening of confidence measures." They said that areas of dispute over territorial boundaries "must be resolved solely by peaceful political means." Owen and Stoltenberg are to attend the Bonn meeting after a visit to Belgrade for talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Owen warned against putting too much stress on the cease-fire, saying that "real problems" should be discussed including Mostar and the Adriatic port of Neun, which the Moslems want to give them access to the sea. Albright, arriving in Zagreb at the start of a European tour, said the issue of Croatian troops in Bosnia "comes up frequently and...is a great concern and might in fact lead to sanctions if there is not some change in that behaviour." She said Washington had specifically warned Zagreb on the subject. "The conflict in this region has no justification. Aggression cannot be justified. War crimes cannot be justified. Blockage of humanitarian aid shipments cannot be justified. It is time to stop the excuses and start making work on many of the unfulfilled promises," she said. Owen, in an interview with Channel Four television, commented: "We all know there is...a very substantial element of the Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina," and said the international community should address the issue "more strongly." Granic however denied Owen's assertions in an interview with BBC radio. He said that though there were Croatian volunteers engaged in the conflict, Zagreb had no intention of intervening militarily. In Zagreb, the Croatian Catholic Church announced that primate Cardinal Franjo Kuharic left Wednesday for Sarajevo at the head of a group of several bishops who are to attend the ordination of the new auxiliary bishop for Sarajevo, Petar Sudar. The UN Protection Force had guaranteed transportation for the bishops from Sarajevo airport to the archbishop's office in the Bosnian capital. A significant number of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina are aligned with the mainly Moslem Government side.
