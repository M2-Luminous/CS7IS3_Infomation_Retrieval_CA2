The Jordanian Interior Ministry asked the Iraqi opposition in Jordan to stop its political and media activities against Iraq and to adhere to observed regulations and laws. The Jordanian Interior Ministry also decided not to renew the residency of any Iraqi opposition after it expires. This is in order to limit the activities of the Iraqi opposition and to prevent any future tension between Jordanian authorities and the opposition if it violates the red lines set by the Jordanian Government. It was learned that although the Jordanian Government allowed a number of Iraqi opposition members to live in Amman, this does not mean they are allowed to practice political and media activities. This is especially true because Jordan is a democratic country and cannot prevent any Arab citizen from living in it as a long as he adheres to the regulations and laws. Despite the fact that the opposition is carrying out some simple social activities and is sending some faxes here and there, this is not the same as allowing the Iraqi opposition to work.
