FBIS3-59196 "drweu019__a94014" FBIS-WEU-94-019-A Document Type:Daily Report 28 January 1994 ANNEX Germany Court Rejects Compensation Claim for Iraqi Trade Embargo LD2701163294 Hamburg DPA in German 1223 GMT 27 Jan 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD2701163294 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Excerpt] Karlsruhe (DPA)--German firms have no right to claim compensation from the state for losses arising from the embargo imposed on Iraq in August 1990. The foreign trade ban, decreed in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, was imposed by the Council of the European Union (EU); thus, losses can only be attributed to the "Community legislator," the Federal Court of Justice said in a ruling announced today. A compensation claim by a vehicle manufacturer, who has since gone bankrupt, has thus been finally rejected. In mid-1989, the company had concluded with an Iraqi Government company a contract to supply 100 low-loader trucks that were intended for use as transport vehicles in the Iraqi oil fields. A total of 25 vehicles were delivered and paid for. The delivery of the remaining 75 vehicles, which was due in the summer of 1990, did not take place because of the embargo on Iraq that banned, among other things, the export of all goods from EU countries to Iraq and Kuwait. The vehicle manufacturer demanded compensation for his fruitless expenditure and lost profits. [passage omitted]
