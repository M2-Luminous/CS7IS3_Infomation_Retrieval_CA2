They assigned the job to an assassination group, led by a hit man from an Arab country. The London-based Committee for the Defense of (Saudi) Legitimate Rights said that Saudi Arabia, which has paid a huge sum to this gang, is apparently trying to stay away from the assassination attempt for domestic reasons connected with tribal vendettas and external reasons connected with the image of Saudi Arabia abroad. In a related development, Usamah's mother was surprised when a police officer prevented her from boarding a plane that was about to take off, even though she had completed airport formalities on her way to be treated abroad from an incurable disease.
