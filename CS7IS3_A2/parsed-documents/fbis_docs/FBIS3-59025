As a matter of principle, Germany should be in a position to fulfill its obligations as a UN member, or as a member of the Western European Union or NATO, he said. "It is a matter of saying yes in principle, so that it is possible to say no in each individual case without raising issues of reliability," Naumann said today before the Hamburg Overseas Club. However, a military operation of this type must not always be the last resort: "It is by no means the case that we soldiers need such a mission for purposes of self-confirmation."
