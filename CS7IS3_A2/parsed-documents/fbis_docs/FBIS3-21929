According to the decree, the measure will control the entrance of fiduciary money, "since right now, a great many people enter the nation with large amounts of cash and other assets and no one knows their origin or destination." Several weeks ago, DEA agents in the United States said Panama cooperated more in the fight against drug trafficking during Manuel Antonio Noriega's military dictatorship than the current democratic government. According to a Presidency press bulletin, the government order seeks to safeguard the principles ruling the International Financial Center operating in Panama and to prevent the fraudulent entrance of ill gotten cash and other valuables. In this regard, the document indicates that "although our legislation does not prohibit the entrance and exit of cash and other liquid assets, it is advisable to safeguard the Panamanian banking center's principles. This assures that passengers entering the nation with cash and other assets, that the cash and assets have legal origins and are not the product of illegal drug trafficking." The government said the Customs Directorate will be responsible for enforcing the decree as well as punishing the violators. Forms, therefore will be drawn up to read: "Traveler's Sworn Statement," in which the person, national or foreigner, will declare his assets. Yesterday, members of the National Banking Association pointed out that the initiative can be healthy, but only as a precautionary measure as it is very difficult to prevent money laundering. Meanwhile, others said the measures could cause the number of attacks on tourists to increase as the amount of cash being brought in will be known.
