In this way, he indicated his strong resolve to come to grips with the political reform at the risk of his political future. [Begin Hosokawa recording] If the political reform is not carried out, I have no intention of hanging on to the post of prime minister at all. If the political reform, which has repeatedly been debated in the past five years, is left buried because of minor differences, we will probably not have an opportunity again to carry it out. Now, both the ruling and opposition parties are holding a joint committee meeting of both houses of the Diet and I intend to call on President Kono of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to hold a top-level meeting with me to discuss ways to handle a package of political reform bills.
