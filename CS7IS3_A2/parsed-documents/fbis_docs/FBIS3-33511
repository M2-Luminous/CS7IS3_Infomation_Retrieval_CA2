On the other hand, that of the Legislative Branch has remained stable, and that of the Judicial Branch has suffered a considerable downgrading. The positive image of the Executive Branch showed the following changes: in 1990, it was 34.4 percent; a year later, it was 48.5 percent; and, in December 1992, it was 35.9 percent. Last December, however, it evinced a more than considerable rise, reaching 48.3 percent. According to New Majority, this is explained by the government party's victory in the 3 October elections and the approval of the law on constitutional amendment. As for the Legislative Branch, its positive image was reflected in the following numbers from December 1990 to December 1993: 15.3 percent, 14.2 percent, 15.3 percent, and 12.3 percent. Although its figures varied little from one year to the next, this branch shows the lowest index of the three branches of government. Insofar as the Judicial Branch is concerned, it showed very slight changes of opinion among the persons queried between 1990 and 1992. The really sudden shift occurred last year, when it had recorded an unexpected support just a few months earlier. This branch had a positive image of 20.9 percent in 1990, 24 percent in 1991, 18.8 percent in 1992, and only 13.1 percent in December of last year. This marked setback can be explained by the deepseated crisis experienced by the Supreme Court. The conclusions are as follows: - In December 1990, the Executive Branch had a better image than the Legislative and Judicial Branches; however, the latter surpassed the Congress. Now, the Judicial and Legislative Branches have similar indexes. - Whereas the Executive Branch improved appreciably during the past four years, both the Legislative and Judicial Branches declined during the same period. - Although in most countries it is common for the Congress to have a lower level of support than the Executive Branch, it is unusual for the Judicial Branch to have an image that is so much more negative. Using the same data collection device, the image of various power factors was analyzed. At the end of 1993, the Catholic Church and the FFAA [Armed Forces] have an image better than that of business owners and trade unions: a trend that has been repeated during the past seven years. During this period, however, the image of the different factors evolved differently. The Catholic Church, which six years ago had no more than 36 percent positive opinions, has now attained 47.8 percent; while the FFAA, which had 24.6 percent at the end of 1987, have now reached 36.3 percent. On the other hand, business owners, who gleaned 18.4 percent positive opinions in 1987, now have 20.1 percent; whereas trade unions, which had 18.6 percent six years ago, have now garnered no more than 6.9 percent, with a negative trend.
