Shenin at Kalininskiy Rayon Conference in Moscow: "United for Victory!"] [Text] I think that our goals are clear and understandable. They are reestablishment of the unified state--the Soviet Union, restoration of government by the people--the soviets of people's deputies, and, without any question, a return to the socialist pattern of development. What should we do at this exceptionally complex time? Should we adapt to present circumstances or strive to take charge of them and direct them? I feel that the second option is more important for communists and the communist movement. For this reason, I do not always accept hasty decisions that have not been preceded by thorough consideration. We should recall the events in October, when some comrades believed that power was within our grasp. This was an absolutely groundless opinion, and it led to groundless actions. Even today many people are saying that we should simply take charge of the government and then decide what kind of society we want to build. This is also a colossal mistake. Some people even plan to avoid all "isms" for the time being. We must begin, they say, by restoring order in the country and stabilizing the situation, and then we can decide whether we want to build capitalism or socialism. I think a communist has no right to take this stance. We must take the same approach to the issue of national accord and civic peace. There are many questions in this area. When we talk about national accord and civic peace, we have to invest this term with a specific meaning. We have to stipulate the exact terms on which we would agree to this, because some of the people who are now appealing to us for accord and peace are those who recently destroyed them with their own hands. They include the president and the head of the Cabinet of Ministers. Are they hoping to perpetuate the pervasive chaos and degradation? There is no question that our tactics might change. There could be a variety of opinions and actions, but the main thing is that our tactics must not get in the way of our strategy or obstruct its essential purpose. In spite of all of the present turmoil, the communist movement in our country is gaining in strength and numbers. We can see this in Russia and Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], in Belorussia [Belarus] and Tajikistan, in Southern Ossetia and Tataria. Furthermore, we can already attest to the united action of many of our communist detachments. The chief aim of the absolute majority of communists is the formation of a single party within the territory of the Soviet Union. Our meetings with representatives of various communist organizations in Russia have provided us with further evidence of this. Today virtually everyone realizes that disaster can only be avoided and this tragedy can only be endured on one condition--the creation of a unified state. Without this, no economic, political, social, or interethnic problems will be solved. That is why all people who cherish these goals must strive for organizational unification. Can the communist movement and the communist parties accomplish this? I believe that they can. This is the primary goal of the work of the UCP-CPSU. Our union was formed in accordance with a decision of the 29th CPSU Congress. The declaration adopted at that congress said that the CPSU would be turned into an international voluntary union of communist parties in response to the current situation in the Soviet Union. The program and charter of the UCP-CPSU are in force. Specific goals corresponding to the level of our work have been defined. Various Union structures are still functioning. It is our job to interact with them and organize them, beginning with the Union structures of the communist movement. The communist parties of 10 republics are now full-fledged members of the UCP-CPSU. We are pleased to report that we recently acquired several new associate members and, what is particularly important, that they include the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and the Russian Communist Workers Party. All the parties, including the associate members of the UCP-CPSU, have their own programs (with the exception of the CPRF). It gives me pleasure to report that a serious step toward the resolution of this problem was taken at the March (1994) Plenum of the CPRF Central Executive Committee: There was a discussion of a draft CPRF program, which will be published after the text has been finalized. It is still being discussed in party organizations. I think the All-Russian (April) CPRF Conference could adopt a document defining the political image of the largest organization in Russia and the entire territory of the Soviet Union. As you know, a joint statement by the leadership of the UCP-CPSU Council and the CPRF Central Executive Committee, containing several important provisions with regard to the consolidation of Russia's communists, was signed on 3 February 1994. It specifically stresses that the question of the CPRF's full-fledged membership in the UCP-CPSU will be discussed at the All-Russian (April) CPRF Conference. I feel that too much time is being spent on discussion of membership in the UCP-CPSU. There are frequent unproductive debates, and the issue itself is spurious. Could anyone deny that all the newly emerging communist organizations were established on the basis of the CPSU? I hope that the issue of membership in the UCP-CPSU will finally be settled at the upcoming CPRF conference. This will pave the way for the unification of other parties in the fraternal republics. There is another equally difficult problem: the unity of the communist movement in Russia. Should we consider convening an all-Russian congress of communists after the April CPRF conference? This objective is just as important as the establishment of the Union organization. Both could be attained at the same time. One would not interfere with the other. In fact, it would only have a stimulating effect. There are so many people who want to split the communist movement. Some are working specifically toward this goal in accordance with the appropriate programs. Others are doing it unconsciously, not even realizing that they are actually adding grist to the mill of our political opponents. That is why the overwhelming majority of members of the Political Executive Committee of the UCP-CPSU Council, and I personally, oppose all types of parallel party structures, conferences, and organizing committees. The problems of unification have to be addressed within our own party. However much we may respect our administrative bodies, it is time for everyone to realize that the party is an organization in which the communist individual and the primary party unit are the foundation, and that they will make the final decisions on the party's role in society, its political image, and its future. I feel that we have every opportunity for organizational unification. It must be organizational, because we could have ideological differences of opinion in the present situation. This is completely understandable. Organizational unification, however, would allow us to hold the 30th UCP-CPSU Congress and approve all the basic policy-planning documents. They would then lay an ideological foundation for the unification of all of the communists of the Soviet Union. I am certain that this approach, with consideration for the organizational and political autonomy of each republic party, will bring us much closer to our present goal. Our main concern, however unattainable the objective might seem, is the issue of power. Yes, we must acknowledge that we are in a stage of transition. I support the views of the comrades here who said that we are living through a "second NEP [New Economic Policy (1921-1936)]," but who will gain advantages from this? Will the anti-people regime benefit from it or will we? Under present conditions, it will be the regime. If the question of power is settled in the interest of the majority, then we can reap the benefits of this NEP, as V.I. Lenin once did. That is why I feel that it is time to do some serious work on the party program and formulate a state ideology that would pave the way for an effective struggle against the anti-people regime. It must be removed from the political stage. Then the communist movement could begin working on its own rise to power and on the full-scale move from the transition period to socialism. That would be followed by the work of building a socialist society and restoring the USSR.
