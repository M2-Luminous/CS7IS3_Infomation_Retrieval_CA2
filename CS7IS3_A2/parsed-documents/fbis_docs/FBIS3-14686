Dr. al-Majali, how do explain the Jordanian stand? [Al-Majali] The Jordanian economy has been considerably affected. In such an atmosphere and with that massive impact on conditions in Jordan, how can we go to peace negotiations? A negotiator must be relaxed; he must feel at ease about negotiating for peace because it involves benefits for all. [Tannuri] The United States has said that there are proposals and ongoing negotiations about searching ships. What are these proposals; and is it possible for the government to respond positively to them? [Al-Majali] First of all, I would like to affirm that we are hiding nothing. We are a committed state that has good credibility. When we say that we import nothing that violates the UN resolutions, we really mean that. But they have to conduct searches. Hence, we proposed several methods to handle this. One of these is to entrust the task to an international nonprofit firm, like Lloyd's Register. This firm's representatives in al-'Aqabah can monitor things and report directly to the United Nations. More than three months have passed. We understood that the parties concerned had approved this proposal. Nothing has happened yet. On the contrary, the number of ships searched or intercepted this year is almost equal to all the ships searched in the past years. [Tannuri] Are there guarantees in monitoring violations and ensuring Jordan's commitment not to violate the UN resolutions imposing the embargo on Iraq? [Al-Majali] We are committed. We are a member of the United Nations. If we do not comply we will be violating the resolutions of an organization to which we belong. [Tannuri] Thank you Mr. prime minister.
