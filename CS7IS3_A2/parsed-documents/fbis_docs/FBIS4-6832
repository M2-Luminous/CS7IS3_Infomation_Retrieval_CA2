A few European banks, including ING (Internationale Netherlanden Bank M.V.) of the Netherlands, are consulting with North Korea on establishing offices in Pyongyang and U.S. multinational corporations such as McKinsey Inc. and IBM Corp. are trying to advance into the communist state, the sources said. North Korean imports of machinery and social infrastructure goods, including telecommunications equipment from Europe, have risen sharply from last year, according to the sources. In contrast, South-North economic cooperation has made no headway since last year as the nuclear dispute has chilled inter-Korean relations. North Korea's efforts to get closer to European banks and U.S. multinational corporations are designed to revitalize its economy by inducing investment and obtaining loans from foreign banks and businesses. For example, a North Korean economic mission toured European nations including Britain, Germany and Austria late last year to hold seminars aimed at attracting investment to the Najin-Sonbong special economic zone. Thanks to such efforts, foreign banks have begun paying more attention to North Korea. ING bank is seeking to establish a liaison office in Pyongyang -- a first for Western banks -- while Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) bank is pushing for a Pyongyang office to secure a bridgehead there. Banks from Britain, Germany and Switzerland are also consulting with North Korea, according to the sources. McKinsey Inc. of the United States has contacted North Korea through its firms in South Korea, Japan and Europe, and IBM's British subsidiary sent staff to the isolated state last summer to provide technical training. Thailand dispatched a large-scale economic mission to North Korea recently to discuss a 50-year lease at Najin port and to secure real estate within the Najin-Sonbong special economic zone.
