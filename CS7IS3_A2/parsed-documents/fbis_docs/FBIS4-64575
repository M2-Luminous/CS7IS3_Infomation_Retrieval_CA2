At its latest security transactions under repurchase agreement, the Bundesbank allocated to the banks 14-day money at a marginal interest rate of 5.41 percent. This is 0.06 percentage points less than last week. A total of 77 billion German marks [DM] were allocated, which were set off by expiring transactions of DM79.2 billion. The overwhelming majority of the allocation was at interest rates between 5.41 and 5.43 percent. The rate for security transactions under repurchase agreement is considered to be the third prime rate of the Bundesbank. Because of the large volume of these deals it is more important for the money market than the classical prime rates, the discount and the Lombard rate, which have been at 5 and 6.5 percent respectively since 15 April.
