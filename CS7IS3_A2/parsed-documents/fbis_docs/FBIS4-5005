On the other hand, although of a small scale, NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company] intends to proceed earlier with experiments of its next-generation communication system in the Kanto region. In the spring of last year, it built an optical-fiber communication line between its Yokosuka Research and Development Center in Yokosuka city and its Musashino Research and Development Center in Mitaka city. Both centers are equipped with numerous terminals including work stations linked to local area networks (LAN) which are each tied into the new communication lines via asynchronous transmission mode (ATM). The system has the capacity to transmit and receive data at speeds of 2.4 gigabytes (with one gigabyte equalling 1 billion bytes) per second between Yokosuka and Musashino, equaling the basic transmission capabilities of a B-ISDN. Further, a model house was built at a point about four kilometers away from the Yokosuka center and the two were linked with optical fiber cables. Although the same type of optical fiber cable was used, differences in the equipment installed at both ends will limit the transmission speed to 156 megabytes (with one megabyte equalling 1 million bytes) per second. This speed will equal the capacity built into B-ISDN subscriber lines. In the future, the type of basic transmission line installed between Yokosuka and Musashino will crisscross the Japanese archipelago and telephone exchanges and offices and homes will be interconnected just like the Yokosuka center and the model house. The purpose of the experiments is to determine the practical uses of the system as well as the residual technical hurdles. NTT has labeled the new services to be made available in the B-ISDN age with the acronym "VI&P" from the title "Visual Intelligent and Personal Communications Services." As indicated by the title, the services visualize multimedia use in the home as well as commercial use such as high-speed computer communications. Subscriber functions being tested relative to the model house include transmission of high-resolution images and simultaneous multiplex transmission of data. High-resolution images are called super high definition (SHD) images which can be used without alteration for purposes such as computer graphics and fabrication of printing plates. They have the capacity to hold four times as much data as that prescribed for high-definition television broadcasting studios. It has been confirmed that static images can be transmitted at the rate of one per second without obvious compromise of quality as the result of compressed transmission. Evaluations are being performed of applications for the system to include operation of electronic newspaper services entailing the transmission of newspaper page images to homes and the conduct of remote diagnostics based on transmissions of microscopic photographs of pathologic tissue. Consideration is being given to the conduct of experiments on the transmission of data between medical institutions. It has already been confirmed in intra-research center tests that animated images compressed under criteria similar to international standards known as MPEG2 can be transmitted without deterioration at speeds of 625 megabytes per second. Sooner or later, transmission of such images will be tested on the optical fiber circuits. It is said that technical problems do not exist relative to the concept of receiving high-vision images when using television telephones. The VI&P Integrated Experimentation Section states that in the area of high-speed computer communications, "capabilities and stability factors relative to transmission functions are adequate." However, actual transmission tests at the speed of 2.4 gigagbytes per second have not been conducted yet between Yokosuka and Musashino. Work has not been completed on installing equipment for interfacing between terminals and LAN or LAN and the high-speed transmission circuits, thus limiting transmission tests between terminals at speeds of 25 to 30 megabytes per second. Needless to say, this bottleneck can be eliminated when the interface issues are resolved, while considerably high transmission speeds have already been achieved even under current tests. Data on floppy disks used with wordprocessors and personal computers can be transmitted at the rate of 1.25 megabyte (1 byte equals 8 bits) per second. A standard sheet of documentation handled routinely by businessmen can be transmitted in a short 0.4 seconds which is more than adequate of such purposes. High-speed transmission of data is very useful in such work as computer-aided design work (CAD) done at work stations and for engineers to crunch massive numbers on super computers. Such requirements can probably be handled on the B-ISDN. Now that a year has passed since commencement of experiments, officials in charge of the VI&P Integrated Experiment Section express the frank sentiment that, "They would like to expand the application for the proposed system." It may be appealing to transmit super high-resolution images and a floppy at instantaneous speeds, but the question arises as to whether there would be any demand of such capabilities alone. VI&P experiments conducted by NTT represent forerunners of the technical phase of tests to be performed at the Kansai Cultural Academic City. Trials and errors to produce concepts for new types of commercial services represent a major project for the future.
