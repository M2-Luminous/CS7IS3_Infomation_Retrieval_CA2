"It can't be an everlasting presence. It has justified itself up to now. We believe it will continue to justify itself, but we certainly have no desire to keep British troops indefinitely in Bosnia," he said. He was responding to questions on whether Britain would withdraw its forces, serving under the United Nations, if peace talks failed to make progress. Hurd had earlier held 45 minutes of talks with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur on the sidelines of a two-day, 53-delegation conference on European stability here. Hurd, who also met Thursday with French counterpart Alain Juppe and Defence Minister Francois Leotard, said however that no date had been agreed by France and Britain for the withdrawal of their peacekeeping forces in Bosnia. France has warned it would pull out half its forces by the end of the year if no progress in peace talks is made. "We have not been so precise about dates, but we are on the same line, in our main objective which is to bring about a negotiated peace," Hurd said. Other questions broached with the French involved Russia and the European Union, he said. Speaking of the search for a successor to Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, Hurd said former British conservative minister and current EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan was the best candidate. The question was touched on during talks with Balladur, he said.
