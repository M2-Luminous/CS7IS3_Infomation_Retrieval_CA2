In particular the revival of the economic development in the United States has a positive effect, Woergoetter says. Thus, domestic exports to the United States strongly increased last year. At the moment a strong and "healthy" impulse is coming from the United States, because growth is still taking place without an acceleration of inflation. The other large industrial nations are currently not able to generate their own stimuli since they must cope with far-reaching structural adjustment problems, Woergoetter says. "There is no doubt that the low point of the recession has been overcome, but the upward movement is very slow," Ewald Walterskirchen, economic development expert of the Economic Research Institute (WIFO), says, assessing the current economic situation. The signals from the United States and the Austrian tax reform do have a positive effect, but the trust of the investors is not yet there. Last year industry's plans for investments were reduced by about 20 percent, this year Walterskirchen expects a 4-percent decline. Walterskirchen, too, does not see any reason at the moment to revise the forecasts for Austria (WIFO: 1.5 percent growth of the real GDP; IHS: 1.4 percent). Both researchers see problems for the FRG, Austria's most important economic partner. The tax increases that have been announced for 1995 could have a dampening effect on growth.
