Approximately one year has passed since the test launching on 29 May 1993 of the prototype No. 1 of Nodong-1 with a reputed range of 1,000 km. Since then, a second test launching has not been conducted. To develop missiles, scores of test launchings are usually required to discover defects and improve reliability before they are mass produced and deployed. If not, they will not work with precision and it is doubtful whether they will hit the intended targets after the launch buttons are pressed. Is the "Rimpac" Exercise of Japan, the United States, and the ROK in Mind? [subhead] A U.S. reconnaissance satellite detected that several containers had been taken to the missile launching site on the east coast of North Korea and a launcher installed. A giant shelter pad against propellant jets had been erected and the brisk activities of North Korean warships were also noted. But, what was launched on the morning of 31 May was different: It was a conventional Chinese-made antiship Silkworm missile. It is so named because of its green caterpillar shape which resembles a silkworm. It was a missile of 80 to 90 km range intended mainly to defend coastal areas from enemy landing operations. Although it was reported that a new type of missile mounted with improved guidance apparatus was tested, Japanese intelligence experts seemed to lose interest, saying: "Why, it is a Silkworm." At about the same time, the United Nations Security Council adopted a presidential statement demanding North Korea stop pulling spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and have it inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In reaction, North Korea insisted that there is no need to allow full inspections as the DPRK has a unique status since it proclaimed its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and then withheld its intentions to do so. It publicly stated that if economic sanctions were applied it would be deemed a declaration of war. If war breaks out, the U.S. and ROK Navies will have complete command of the sea, and the U.S. Third Marine Division on Okinawa and two ROK Marine divisions will be able to threaten the flanks and rear of the DPRK forces by landing on the North Korean coast. "Rimpac 94," a joint naval exercise of Japan, the United States, the ROK, Canada, and Australia, is under way in the Pacific and the DPRK surely feels the menace of awesome naval power demonstrated by that exercise. To show the posture that it will not yield to such threats and it is ready to intercept any landings, the DPRK may have to test launch what little antiship missiles it has or conduct training in the laying of mines. But, this sort of bullying attitude will by and large have an adverse affect on the Americans. If a soft and pliant attitude is taken to satisfy American pride, the DPRK may attain its objective of holding high-level U.S.-DPRK talks; of obtaining power generating facilities through light water reactors which are difficult to use for military purposes; and of obtaining economic assistance from both Japan and the United States. On the contrary, the demonstration of military power, however small, will make the U.S. response difficult. "Nodong" Missile Development May Be At a Standstill [subhead] As for Japan, antiship missiles are no threat at all. Whether the development of Nodong-1 or its improved type Nodong-2 is continuing is what matters. Attention is focused on whether test launchings are due shortly or not. The reason why a Nodong-1 test has not been conducted for more than a year is attributed to the North Korean practice that "the DPRK has conducted quite a few tests on domestically developed and produced Scud B and C missiles." This way, missiles for practical use cannot be produced. Scud C's and Nodong-l's are said to have been developed for export during the Iran-Iraq war with orders being placed and development funds provided by Iran. And, at the test launch last May, an Iranian delegation was invited to attend. But at present, Iran is in financial difficulty because of low petroleum prices and it has little reason to purchase North Korean-produced missiles. There are strong signs that the Japanese Government has applied pressure: "How can Iran provide money for development of missiles by none other than North Korea" in view of the fact that Iran is receiving economic assistance from Japan. If the DPRK abandons the development of ballistic missiles with a possible range reaching Japan on top of the fact that it has a very weak air force, Japan will feel almost no threat at all.
