He pointed out: This year, while development and reform are in a crucial stage, the provincial government will pay close attention to the consolidation and implementation of the series of reform measures which the central and Hainan provincial authorities have promulgated. Great efforts will be made to organize the implementation of those moves by proceeding in an orderly manner, and step by step, and motive power will be injected continuously to ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of Hainan's economy. Governor Ruan said: Various major reforms centering on the establishment of a socialist market economic structure have been introduced. Moreover, Hainan has its own concrete reform measures, such as the establishment of a company system in state-owned enterprises, opening of the property rights trading market, the introduction of a modern tax collection and management system, and improvement of the open foreign economic structure. These measures involve an extremely wide range of endeavor and their implementation is a task of primary importance. When answering the question of how to absorb foreign capital more vigorously as macroregulation and control are applied, the Governor said: "Hainan has its unique strong point, which no other cities in the country have. We are pursuing the practice of issuing visas at the airport to provide the greatest convenience to foreign businessmen and ensure that they can leave the country from other ports. Our preferential policies on investment and taxation will remain unchanged, as will our relaxed investment environment. If there is any change it will be to make it even more appealing. We will also transform our government functions, reduce the number of `keepers [ba men di 2116 7024 4104],' and we will not set up any customs barriers, namely, we will reduce examination and approval procedures and increase the number of people `engaging in hygiene [gao wei sheng di 2269 5898 3932 4104].' To put it another way, while acting in accordance with the laws governing the market economy, we will practice standardized management and supervision." This outstanding student, who graduated from the Automotive Machinery College in Moscow, displayed his ability to skillfully summarize things. This simple and vivid analogy was an embodiment of the Hainan Government's general line of thinking on reform and has attracted the attention of economic theorists and journalists and has received the approval of governments at all levels and the relevant departments in the province. Full of confidence, Governor Ruan said: "Hainan encourages a free flow of personnel, funds, and commodities. In Hainan, there are many opportunities to make money and reap quick profits, with the average rate of returns amounting to 20 to 30 percent. I believe that so long as `there are people making money here, others will follow suit.' More and more foreign businessmen have set foot on the soil of Hainan and increased amounts of funds have flowed into Hainan. This is the best proof of my argument. Last year, Hainan signed 316 new contracts on foreign capital utilization, an increase of nearly 83 percent over the previous year." When talking about this year's tasks, this No. 1 man in Hainan said: "This year we will continue to uphold the principle of infrastructures going first and strengthen the construction of infrastructures. We will transform ports, construct railways and expressways, build Haikou's Meilan Airport, and develop the electric power, post and telecommunications, oil refining, construction materials, steelmaking, and food processing industries as well as tourism.... There are too many things for us to do." With a feeling of joy and a proper sense of pride, Governor Ruan informed these reporters: "In the last two or three years, Hainan's gross domestic output value has increased at an average annual rate of close to 23 percent, more than 10 percentage points over the nation's average growth rate. This is a world record. This year we will maintain a growth rate of 18 percent so that Hainan's economy forges ahead in a sustained, rapid, and healthy way." When asked about his feelings regarding his management of Hainan affairs, this current magistrate of Hainan Island, who has previously been China's labor and public security ministers, said: "I have a deep love for Hainan, which is an island clinging to the Chinese land and to which the central authorities have attached ever greater importance. It is a treasure island which finds favor in the eyes of more and more farsighted people. With its abundant natural resources, tropical beauty, and relaxed investment environment, Hainan has become an ideal place, attractive to both investors and tourists. I am fully hopeful about Hainan."
