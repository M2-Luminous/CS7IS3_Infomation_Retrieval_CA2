"Regional Operation 1994" was put into effect in the areas with the greatest prevalence, including Sonora, Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Durango, Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoacan, Guerrero, and Oaxaca States. A total of 9,700 members of the armed institution are participating. This contingent is equipped with 250 field vehicles, 17 helicopters, and seven small Mexican Air Force planes, as well as Army regulation weapons. It also has special facilities for destroying plantations, including defoliants, trained dogs, flame throwers and, in some cases, tractors. Furthermore, as the National Defense Secretariat reported, the campaign is not limited to those states, but extends throughout the country, because military personnel will be conducting it in their zonal and regional jurisdictions. One of the important features is the surveillance at airports and on the network of roads and highways. For this purpose, the forces are backed by the Federal Judicial Police, whose mission is to detect the drug traffickers' safe houses and activities in all parts of the republic, so as to keep the military forces informed of them.
