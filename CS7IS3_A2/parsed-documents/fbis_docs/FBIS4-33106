FBIS4-33106 "drlat106_k_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Strikes Continue in Tierra del Fuego Strikes Continue in Tierra del Fuego PY0206014094 Buenos Aires LA PRENSA in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 2 PY0206014094 Buenos Aires LA PRENSA Spanish BFN [Text] The Tierra del Fuego Province metalworkers' conflict has deteriorated to an even greater degree following the unexpected break in the negotiations and the entrepreneurs' decision to send telegrams warning workers of their dismissal if they fail to show up for work. Yesterday picket lines prevented the entry of workers to factories, and cut access roads to the industrial area. Metalworkers Union [UOM] leaders, meanwhile insisted: "We will continue the strike to its last consequences. If the government or the police repress our activities we will answer back just as harshly." The attempt to find a solution to the conflict between workers and entrepreneurs failed yesterday morning following eight hours of negotiations at the Labor Ministry. Last night entrepreneurs agreed to pay according to coefficient three [reference unknown], but gradually and over a three-year period. The UOM rejected the offer. The Labor Ministry then proposed reducing the period of implementation of the coefficient three proposal, and established a period, to be determined by compulsory arbitration, during which coefficient three would remain in effect. The UOM also rejected this offer. Marcelo Sosa, UOM Ushuaia branch secretary general, explained the reasons for rejecting the entrepreneurs' proposal: "The offer presented by entrepreneurs is way below what workers want. The proposal is unacceptable." Sosa announced that "the strike will continue until progress is made and until entrepreneurs rehire dismissed fellow workers." Sosa also criticized factory managers. He said managers' arguments "are arbitrary" and "the only thing they want is to wear out the determination of our fellow workers who remain on strike." Sosa also blamed entrepreneurs for "breaking the compulsory arbitration by dismissing 127 fellow workers." The failure to find a negotiated solution generated strong tensions in the province almost immediately. Entrepreneurs sent 2,500 telegrams warning workers to show up for work or face dismissal. In the morning, however, picket lines prevented the entry of workers who showed up for work. Philco and Sanyo personnel who showed up for work were transported in company buses to the plant for the first shift, which was to start at 0600. But the group of workers who had been camping in front of the factory since the beginning of the strike surrounded the bus, shouting: "Go back, strike breakers." A second group of strikers cut the road leading to the industrial area and forced all other buses to return to the city. Company directors filed a complaint at the police department immediately afterward. Sanyo Industrial Director Fernando Nott said "activists organized their move hours before the buses went to pick up workers." Nott asked "the police and other provincial authorities to take the necessary measures" to guarantee "the safety of people who want to work." At that hour the possibility of returning to the negotiating table to try to find a solution to the conflict looked impossible. Pedro Waisman, president of Tierra del Fuego's Industrial Union, commented: "The problem started as a labor and economic conflict, but it has now turned into a political and ideological problem." Waisman warned: "These activists have all been identified. The police and government must act immediately to reestablish social peace and permit workers to return to work on the island. You cannot work with strikers' picket lines threatening women and children and breaking everything." Workers denied this statement. They denied "the existence of active picket lines," explaining: "Buses carrying workers gave up the idea of entering the factory zone because they considered conditions to be inappropriate for production." The UOM held a general meeting and decided to challenge the threats of massive dismissal and the possibility that the strike be declared illegal. They decided to continue their indefinite strike, which has already been in effect for 17 days. Angel Valle, assistant UOM Ushuaia branch secretary general, said: "We are going through a grave crisis. We need concrete government answers. The only thing the government has given us is repression." In Buenos Aires, meanwhile, Labor Secretary Carlos Etala said entrepreneurs will be able to dismiss workers "with just cause" if they continue their strike. Etala said the dismissals "will be legal because the union disobeyed the order for compulsory conciliation, and did not return to work." The Labor Ministry has been delaying the decision to declare the strike illegal, despite the fact that it is technically able to do so, because it is trying to find a negotiated solution to the conflict. Yesterday Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, Labor Minister Armando Caro Figueroa, Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, and Presidential Secretary General Eduardo Bauza met to analyze the situation.
