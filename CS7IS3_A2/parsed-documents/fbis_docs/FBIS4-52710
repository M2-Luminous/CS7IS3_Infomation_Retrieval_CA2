While the party is excited at being in such a position, bewilderment is spreading in the party. Originally, there was strong concern in the party and "Soka Gakkai," a large religious group supporting Komeito, over other parties' opposition to a leading role for the "Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-Komeito bloc" in the coalition administration. Because their "leading role" has become apparent since formation of the new cabinet, this concern has also led to apprehension about the party's future because the administration "may remain in the minority force." It is likely that for the time being Komeito will not participate in the new parliamentary group "Kaishin," which has prompted the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to secede from the coalition. And, the party will likely try to consolidate its internal structure while urging the SDPJ to return to the coalition. The SDPJ's secession from the administration was an unexpected incident for Komeito as well. On 28 April when the new cabinet was inaugurated, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ishikawa said to a party general meeting of both lower and upper house members: "The situation does not allow us to be pleased with the increase of Komeito cabinet members from four to the current six." Ichikawa thus admonished against the optimistic view within the party, and stressed a sense of crisis about Komeito having become one of the minority ruling parties. The party plans to put off its participation in "Kaishin" for the time being, because it intends to serve as a "mediator" in the future in persuading the SDPJ to return to the administration. A senior Komeito member says: "If Komeito makes a move now, this will stimulate the SDPJ to confirm its determination to leave the coalition. We want to continue to persuade it to return to the coalition." Takenori Kanzaki, former posts and telecommunications minister, who has now returned to party affairs, stated in an NHK discussion program on 8 May: "We had better watch the situation for a while regarding this issue." Before the SDPJ left the coalition, Ichikawa and Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa urged the SDPJ to understand the need to raise indirect taxes, including the consumption tax, and to deal with the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected nuclear weapons development, through such occasions as meetings of the coalition policy council. However, the actual situation concerning Komeito is that women within Soka Gakkai have still expressed a strong opposition to the consumption tax hike, and that the party "has not yet discussed the final details of measures to deal with North Korea, including the extent of Japan's possible logistical support for the U.S. forces" (as stated by a member in charge of policies). In an effort to soften internal dissatisfaction with Komeito acting in concert with Ozawa, Ichikawa has begun to study the idea of changing the Komeito image that Ichikawa's personal leadership has so far sustained the party, by gradually entrusting management of party affairs to the young combination of Kanzaki and Akihiro Ota in the future. Ichikawa has not ostensibly changed his intention to support the new administration in carrying out policies, stating that "as long as the administration makes adequate decisions on policies, the general public will support it." However, with the remarks by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano [on the 1937 Nanjing massacre], the SDPJ has enhanced its opposition to the Hata cabinet, and the possibility of the party returning to the coalition is now decreasing. It appears that it is not easy for Komeito to pave the way for breaking the deadlock in the current situation in which the ruling coalition has unexpectedly become a minority as a result of the "power game."
