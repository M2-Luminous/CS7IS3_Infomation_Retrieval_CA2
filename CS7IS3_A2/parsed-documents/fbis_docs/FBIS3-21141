Along with increasing the area of the electrolytic cell to 6,000 square meters after this, economics research on processing for a daily production scale of several hundred tons, which would make it practical, will be carried out. The hydrogen supply for oil refineries generally makes use of hydrogen production units or secondary hydrogen from contact catalyst reformers (CCR). Besides the fact that demand for hydrogen is growing yearly due to desulfurization in the process of refining crude oil and conversion to purer fuels by means of product upgrades, there has been a leap in uses such as deep desulfurization of diesel fuel. In addition, with the prospects for future introduction of equipment for hydrogenation decomposition of heavy petroleum, the quantities of hydrogen necessary can only be seen as increasing. However, since there is also the problem of hydrogen production facilities being costly to construct, hydrogenation desulfurizers are used to produce hydrogen sulfide, and the sulfur is recovered through thermal decomposition. Therefore, there are expectations for recovery of hydrogen from sour gas that includes hydrogen sulfide. PEC combined wet absorption and an electrolytic reaction, separated hydrogen sulfide from sour gas and furthermore separated hydrogen and sulfur from the hydrogen sulfide, making progress in technical developments that will help in efficient use of hydrogen at oil refineries. As a result, highly efficient recovery of hydrogen from the hydrogen sulfide separated from sour gas with a with a 430 square meter single cell ion-exchange membrane test tank was confirmed. The hydrogen recovered has a purity of 99% and the sulfur a purity of 99% or greater. Based on these results, PEC is now planning to increase the area of the electrolytic cell to 6,000 square meters to help in establishing recovery technology. On the other hand, processing for a daily production of several hundred tons is necessary for practical application, and there are plans for conducting examinations of economic practicality at the same time.
