A new process, developed by the Zeo-Tech Company in Bavaria, utilizes the waste heat to generate hot water simultaneously with the cold in the refrigerator. All of this is accomplished without the use of environment-threatening CFC's (chlorofluorocarbons), FHC's (fluorinated hydrocarbons, or hydrocarbons. The Joern Schwarz stand at the Hannover Fair simply displayed cold beer and hot water. At first glance, that in itself constituted nothing particularly unusual at this year's Fair. What is extremely unusual, however, is the way the main developer at the Zeo-Tech Company in Unterscheissheim, Bavaria, cools the beer and heats the water. Both are effected with water vapor and 12 kg of sand. Schwarz relies on a simple technical principle, namely, that highly porous materials--in this case, a sand-like zeolite that occurs naturally and which for a long time has also been used as a substitute for phosphates in detergents--at a negative pressure voraciously sucks up the water evaporating from a water surface. In the process, the minerals develop heat, while the water, owing to the evaporation, is cooled and eventually frozen. Some zeolites can--without replacement--sop up water as often as needed and then release it again. In this process, a cold circulation is generated. "Private households use 25% of the primary energy expended in Germany annually to produce heat and cold," Schwarz points out. Usually, this is done in separate processes as a result of which a considerable amount of power is lost. What could be more desirable than to have the cold and the heat generation linked together? The successful result of this endeavor is the "cool-boiler," a combined apparatus consisting of an electrical hot water generator and a refrigerator. The bottom line here is that only the boiler consumes power. "The operation of the refrigerator comes gratis," Schwarz is pleased to say. It was not a simple matter to convert the theoretical physical principles into a practical system however. It cost the researchers at the Zeo-Tech Company about three years in R&D time before they could build the first successful prototype. This method of discontinuous energy conversion procedes in two phases. The first phase lasts only as long as it takes for the zeolite to become saturated with water. Then, in the second phase, a reverse procedure is effected through the introduction of heat. The water is forced out of the zeolite in the form of water vapor, is then liquified in a condensor, and then, in the next step, can via a collecting main be sucked up again in the evaporator. For the operation of the cool-boiler, the two evacuated zeolite containers (weight filled of each is six kg) are alternately heated, thereby forcing the adsorbed water out (desorber). For the prototype, the required electrical power was about 1 KW. The water vapor releases its heat in the condensor, after which it is transferred to the boiler water through the casing wall. The water flows through a line into the refrigerator's evaporator. There, the other zeolite container can suck up the water vapor that is generated. In this way, the heat required for the evaporation process is drawn out of the inside of the refrigerator. During the process, the zeolite is heated to 150�C, sending this heat to the boiler water via a heat-exchanger. The process continues until one adsorber is saturated with water and the other has its water removed. "Using twelve kilos of zeolite, the process lasts two to three days," Schwarz notes. Then the adsorber and desorber exchange roles. This technique can generate up to -20�C in the refrigerator, and 90�C in the boiler. The system is regulated by an ESP control system. When the temperature gets too high, a temperature sensor in the refrigerator sends a pulse signal to the vacuum pump which again activates the adsorption process. One of the hard nuts to crack in the development of this technique was the evaporator. Decisive in its functioning is a fiber in which the water can rise and which offers a large surface area. No less important is the requirement that the fiber not be destroyed or damaged by the formation of ice crystals. The Zeo-Tech developers had a stroke of luck and chance in this matter. A fiber glass material is used in the prototype that easily withstands the countless evaporation and cooling processes. Schwarz and his team of researchers is now working on the further development of the control and regulating technology and on optimizing the zeolite system. The refrigeration technicians expect better energy utilization through the use of aluminum heat exchangers that are dip-coated in zeolite powder with ceramic glue. Schwarz still cannot provide precise data on the system's power balance. It is to be ascertained in the coming months. In any case, this year's Fair brought the refrigeration technicians an unexpected success. A "white goods" [linen] manufacturer in Saxony expressed interest in a cooperative venture. The first cool-boiler system could appear on the market as early as 1996.
