The report was disclosed this weekend in Vienna, Austria. The government official said that this very day he is sending a note requesting "to be told what is the basis of that report, when it was made, and who was interviewed." Fishman explained that the government had no knowledge that this study had been made. "No UN official consulted the police authorities in the country. The report is irresponsible and unimportant," the minister signaled. The report, disclosed by the UN Inter-American Board on Drug Control which is headquartered in Vienna, on a study conducted in the middle of last year, highlights the "evident" lack of coordination among the police institutions as being among the problems Costa Rica suffers in this field. Rafael Angel Guillen, director of the Judicial Investigation Agency, also denied the lack of coordination among police institutions. Meanwhile Guillen highlighted the permanent struggle being waged to prevent his country from becoming a bridge for drug trafficking activities from South America to the United States. The UN report indicates that marijuana cultivation in isolated areas of Costa Rica has increased despite police efforts while it assures that Costa Rica is becoming increasingly a bridge for drug trafficking to the United States and Europe. "In the past two years (marijuana abuse) has doubled, while cocaine abuse has tripled," adds the report disclosed in Vienna. It also criticizes the "excessive" and incorrect use of lesser hypnotics and tranquilizers that constitute a real problem.
