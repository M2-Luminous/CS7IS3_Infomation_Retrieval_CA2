FR941026-1-00028 FR941026-1-00013 Sections 1653.3 (g) and (h) require the Board to determine whether court orders accepted for review under this subpart constitute qualifying orders and to provide an explanation of the decision. If the order is found to be qualifying, the decision will state the effect of the order on the TSP account of the participant. In many cases, the effect of a final divorce decree will be a payment from the participant's account to the spouse of former spouse. In the case of a preliminary order, the effect is often maintenance of a freeze on the account until a further court order is received by the Board. Under current Board procedures, the Board's decisions provide a 30-day appeal period for the parties to request an administrative review of the decision by the Executive Director. Section 1653.3(i) of the proposed regulations eliminates that appeal period and makes the Board's initial decision the final administrative action. In the Board's experience, the appeal period has been used primarily as a time for seeking from the divorce court a new order to supersede the earlier order, rather than to raise substantive issues relating to the Board's decision. The Board believes that it is appropriate for the divorce court, rather than the Board, to clarify any question concerning the meaning of the order. Elimination of the appeal period will not, however, eliminate any opportunity for the parties to return to the divorce court for an amended order, since §1653.5(a) provides that even after a determination that an order awards a portion of a TSP account, payment cannot be made until at least 30 days after appropriate tax notification has been provided. Similarly, if the Board determines that an order is not qualifying, §1653.3(j)(4) provides that the account will remain frozen for 45 days from the date of the Board's determination. Thus, the spouse or former spouse is protected against disbursement of a loan or withdrawal to the participant during the 45-day period, and may seek a new order from the divorce court during that time. Section 1653.3(j) describes when a freeze imposed under §1653.3(c) will be removed. Section 1653.3(j)(1) reiterates the provision in paragraph (f) that if the Board receives an incomplete order the parties will be notified that a complete document must be received within 30 days. If it is not received within that time, the freeze will be removed. Section 1653.3(j)(2) provides that, where a qualifying order precludes disbursements from the participant's account, the freeze will remain on the account until the order is either superseded or vacated by a subsequent order of the court. Of course, if the subsequent order itself requires freezing the account, then the account will not be unfrozen. A common situation involves a preliminary order entered to preserve the status quo by precluding the participant from obtaining a loan or withdrawal from his or her account while the divorce proceedings are pending. The court then enters a final divorce decree, which dissolves the preliminary order but also includes an award of a portion of the TSP account to the former spouse. Because the final divorce decree will itself require that the account be frozen, the freeze will remain on the account until payment of the former spouse's share. Section 1653.(j)(3) provides that, where it is determined that an order makes an award of a portion of a TSP account, the freeze will be removed upon payment. As discussed in connection with the elimination of the appeal period §1653.3(j)(4) provides that, where the Board determines that an order is not qualifying, the account will remain frozen for 45 days after that determination. This enables the parties to seek and submit to the Board a new, qualifying order from the divorce court, without concern that the participant may withdraw or borrow from his or her account during the 45-day period. Alternatively, a party may seek to challenge the Board's determination in Federal court. The freeze may be removed sooner than the expiration of the 45-day period only upon written agreement from both parties to the divorce proceedings. Section 1653.3(k) provides the rules for processing multiple court orders. Section 1653.3(k)(1) provides that, where there are conflicting orders arising from the same divorce proceeding and involving the same spouse of former spouse, the order bearing the latest date will supersede any earlier orders, regardless of the dates on which they are received by the Board. The date will be determined by using the date the order was entered by the clerk of the court or the date the order was filed by the clerk of the court, if the order does not show a date entered. If the order does not indicate a date entered or filed, the date the order was signed by the judge will be used. Since 5 U.S.C. 8467(a) provides that ``[a]ny payment under this subsection to a person bars recovery by any other person,'' the general rule set forth in §1643.3(k)(1) obviously cannot be applied if payment on the first order received has already been made before the Board receives a later order that would have superseded the first order. Moreover, consistent with the last sentence of §1653.2(b)(1), no court order will be honored to the extent that doing so would require the Board to accept the return of money already properly paid pursuant to another order. Section 1653.3(k)(2) provides that where there are conflicting orders involving different spouses of former spouses, the order with the earliest date (determined in the same manner as under §1653.3(k)(1)) will be given priority (again, unless payment on the first order received has already been made). Any payments from the account will be made first based on the order bearing the earliest date, and proceeding through and additional orders until the account is exhausted. It is presumed that the earliest order established rights for the spouse or former spouse named in that order which cannot be affected by subsequent orders in different cases in which the first spouse is not a party. Section 1653.4 sets forth rules for calculation of the amount of an entitlement. TSP accounts are valued once a month as of the last day of the month. Under §1653.4(a), if the date or event specified in the order for calculating the award falls on any day except the last day of the month, the account balance on which the amount of the entitlement is based is determined as of the last day of the previous month. Unless otherwise provided by the court order, any outstanding loan balance as of the end of the month used for calculating the entitlement will be included in the account balance for this calculation. If the date or event specified in the order falls on the last day of a month, the account balance is determined as of that day.
