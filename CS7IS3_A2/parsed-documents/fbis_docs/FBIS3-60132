Emilio Vence, DAS chief in Barranquilla (capital city of Atlantico Department,) added that Montanes, who had been serving a 24-year sentence in a Puerto Rican jail when he escaped, was arrested in a house located in the northern area of this Colombian Caribbean city. Montanes was sent to prison in 1981, but 10 years later in January 1991, he and two other prisoners escaped in a helicopter. According to Vence, "he apparently has been working in Colombia doing the same thing he did in Puerto Rico." The official added that Montanes will be transferred to Santa Fe de Bogota and will remain under strict security measures, at the orders of the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Republic, while his possible extradition to Puerto Rico or the United States is being processed. On Wednesday [12 January], DAS also arrested Peruvian Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, alias "El Vaticano," in Cali (southeastern Colombia). Peru had requested Chavez' extradition. He is charged with trafficking 60 tons of coca paste to Colombia.
