We are talking about Valdanos Bay, the only inlet in that part of the coast which has natural features for building a naval base. This is the only way in which the leading Serbian "navigators" intend to remedy the numerous complexes acquired with disintegration of the once respectable Yugonavy, now that it has been driven from most of the Adriatic. For quite a long time now, the vessels of the Serbian Navy have been floating in close quarters in the ports of Kumbor and Tivat in Kotor Bay. The narrow entrance to the "bride of the Adriatic" is no problem to spot from outside, so that the "floating scrap pile," as Italian Admiral Acquille Zanonni recently called the Yugoslav Navy, is in a fearful claustrophobic panic. It thus needs a way out, deliberation from its phobia, but also from the loser's syndrome which has greatly affected the souls of the officers there. But there are other reasons for building a naval base at Valdanos as well. One is certainly to change the composition of the population in the Ulcinj part of the coast, which is unfavorable for the Serbs. When that area is militarized and the families of Serbian officers move there, the high share of Montenegrins and Albanians in the ethnic composition of the population there will be offset to some extent. Another reason for building a naval base in that bay lies in the constant fear of an external enemy. Serbian strategists, that is, have estimated that it is only in that region that the international forces conducting the naval blockade off the coast of Montenegro could land marines. That is why they set up a radar station even earlier in the hills above what previously was the military vacation resort at Valdanos, but also numerous fortifications and gun emplacements. Defect--The Proximity of Albania All of this in fact confirms certain earlier tendencies shown by the Serbian top government leadership. That is, there were signs even in the past that that top leadership was moving more and more toward industrial nourishment of the warmaking spirit, little by little transforming their economy and industrial potential toward military production, the only industry in "FR Yugoslavia" which is still somehow getting by. Within that context, there is a possibility of military industrial plants being moved or established in the Montenegrin hills, especially when we bear in mind that sizable ground forces are already concentrated above Valdanos Bay, but nothing close to what is just now being planned. The naval base at Valdanos, that is, has one important defect--it is close to the Albanian border. Should there be a real military conflict with its southern neighbor, "FR Yugoslavia" must secure the hinterland of the Navy stationed at the future base, although that will not help it much because Valdanos is within range of Albanian artillery, which is not a comfortable realization for Serbian officers. What is more, Valdanos does not have the necessary depth (the bay is only some 15 meters deep), and it is barely broad enough to allow two large vessels to maneuver at the same time. Outmoded Missiles Nevertheless, in spite of all these deficiencies, the project of a naval base at Valdanos is nevertheless moving toward realization. Aside from the reasons already given, among which we should emphasize once again that this is the only bay on the Montenegrin coast which has the natural features for something of this kind, achievement of this plan for a naval base would certainly have a large psychological impact on the unnecessary and outmoded vessels which at the moment are only discharging oil into Kotor Bay and serving as potential targets. In terms of the number of vessels, of course, this is still an impressive fleet, but the level of its maintenance is indicated by the "incident" that occurred a year ago during the visit to the Navy by Milan Panic and Zivota Panic, who at that time were the Yugoslav prime minister and chief of the General Staff, respectively. Just as those two left a warship, it began to sink for no apparent reason. Even if the Yugonavy were not so neglected and rotten, it would not be able to accept engagement on the open sea. In addition to the chronic shortage of trained personnel, it is also troubled by the fact that it is no longer suitable for the altered circumstances of a potential naval war. That is, the number of warships, which still seems frightening at first, was adapted in its structure to defending the coast of Croatia, exploiting the natural advantages of the numerous Croatian islands and bays. Lora, near Split, was to be the main point of support, and Vis and Lastovo were strong detached fortresses. That is why the ships were mainly fast and light, able to jump out at an enemy from behind a peninsula or island and to hide still more quickly in the next cove. However, the Montenegrin coast is not very indented, and coastal artillery located on the hills there can be used effectively for its defense. But domination beyond territorial waters (12 nautical miles from the coast) can be achieved only with the help of large ships, cruisers, for example. But the Serbian Navy lacks them. Perhaps it would welcome the "surface-to-surface" missiles which the Yugonavy was purchasing in sizable quantities from Sweden, but they have mainly been taken as war booty by the Croatian Navy. Those missiles they still possess are outmoded and of poor quality. Nor can they boast of strong coastal artillery, because they were compelled to install ordinary "field" guns for that purpose. Here again they were "crippled" by the Croats, who captured numerous coastal batteries. River Submarine In spite of all that, Dojcilo Isakovic, commander of the Serbian Navy, a Chetnik from Lora well-known to the people of Split who at one time made a "reputation" with the published secret plans to build a new Serbian weapon--a river submarine--which was supposed to strike horror into enemies and be the envy of the world, but actually was an unprecedented stupidity, has been persistently repeating the story to the effect that the fleet was successfully evacuated from Croatia, mostly thanks to none other than himself. Dojcilo says that the Croats have only what the Serbs intentionally left them, and that amounts to three vessels that were under repair. In this way, Rear Adm. Isakovic is laying the groundwork for his glory in the war, now that he has already managed to prove himself to be a "Serb from head to toe." But his stories can at the very least be regarded as lies and arrogant boasting, because he "gave" to the Croatian Navy more than 30 vessels, among them the most modern--the missile-carrying fast attack craft which now bears the name of King Petar Kresimir IV. When we look at the "gifts," Dojcilo and Milan Zec, his chief of staff, did not deserve to be decorated and promoted, but to be tried for treason. All that we have said obviously serves to promote still further the dream of "martial glory" which is supposed to take up full-fledged positions in the "Serbian sea" as well. Something like that is the purpose of the plan to which we have referred to build an expensive naval base at Valdanos intended for the "scrap pile," pointing out at the same time that the top Serbian leadership has not the slightest intention of developing the tourist potential and collecting foreign exchange from foreign visitors, but intends to improve military industrial plants, pursue general militarization, and make money from the sale of arms. No question of good-neighborly relations; they are a permanent threat to the peace.
