The new series of official discussions, of which this was the first, is aimed at considering modifications to the existing marketing agreement between Russia and De Beers in response to the political and socio-economic changes that have taken place in Russia since it was signed. Further meetings on the subject will take place in the near future. The parties remain committed to the existing agreement, pending their agreeing on any modification. They are also committed to the stability of the international diamond market and to taking the necessary steps to curtail Russian rough gem diamonds reaching the market outside the current marketing arrangements. During the discussions the parties re-iterated their joint responsibility, as the world's two largest gem diamond producers, to the international diamond market and to the well-being of the world diamond community. The parties hope that the new series of discussions will re-establish a solid base for on-going co-operation into the future and thereby ensure the further development of the international diamond business, to their mutual benefit and to the benefit of the entire diamond industry.
