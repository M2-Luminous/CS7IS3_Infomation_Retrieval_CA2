[Kryzhanivskyy] I will frankly say that Moscow is absolutely not ready to annex our territories, since this would be a violation of the tripartite statement [on nuclear disarmament]. You must understand that this would lead to an unpredictable confrontation between us and Russia. [Tkachuk] Have Ukrainian-Russian relations warmed up since the tripartite statement was signed? [Kryzhanivskyy] I would not term this warming. The situation is simply forcing us to meet each other half-way. Moscow is aware of the creeping tensions in our relations. Verbally, everyone supports improvement in our relations. Although our side has taken a great deal of open steps aimed at warming the climate in relations between our states, everything is hampered by certain things. You understand, all those statements about protecting the Russian-speaking population... I am simply appealing to Russian diplomats and politicians: Exclude 12 million Russian-speaking people living in Ukraine from the total number of 25 million who live outside Russia! Nobody will harass them in Ukraine. I have already told them that they can negotiate this issue with other CIS countries, but not with us, because there is nothing anti-Russian in Ukraine. Mr. Filatov, one of the closest advisers to Yeltsin, for example, has recently admitted in a private conversation with me that the Russian-speaking population is not oppressed in Ukraine. As you see, there are reasonable politicians in Russia who understand us. [Tkachuk] Mr. Ambassador, do you believe that our foreign policy toward CIS countries, and primarily toward Russia, is active enough? [Kryzhanivskyy] However the president and the prime ministers are always willing to improve relations between our countries, the parliament must also be taken into account. I believe that the new Supreme Council, even if it is headed by [current Supreme Council Chairman] Plyushch, will change its policy toward Russia. I think that the new legislators will understand the importance of establishing good relations between our countries. [Tkachuk] Currently, Ukrainian and foreign analysts are pointing to the increasing influence of pro imperial factors in Russia's foreign policy. Can Ukraine become a factor of deterrence for its neighbor? [Kryzhanivskyy] Gaydar [former Russian deputy prime minister] recently told me that if the Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Russian economies are united, there will be only one result -- a complete collapse of the Russian economy. I would like to emphasize that no reasonable politician who is today in power in Russia, counts on a union between Ukraine and Russia. [Tkachuk] What is Russia's attitude toward President Clinton's "Partnership for Peace" initiative? [Kryzhanivskyy] The attitude is rather interesting. Russia wants to join this program, however, not in the same manner as other countries such as Ukraine or Moldova. Russia wants to obtain a special status. It is impossible to wink at the fact that Russia is a huge state. Moreover, it is not only huge but also nuclear. [Tkachuk] To what extent is Yeltsin's situation stable today, taking into account the new Duma and the recent amnesty? [Kryzhanivskyy] I do not expect any political changes in Russia in the next five months. The current alignment of forces seems to satisfy everybody, even communists and nationalists.
